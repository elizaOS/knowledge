# Council Briefing: 2025-06-26

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- ShawOS is nearing completion of elizaOS V2 after significant architectural restructuring from project-scoped to agent-scoped plugin architecture, while community anxiously awaits release amid token ecosystem discussions and technical issues.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: ElizaOS V2 Launch Readiness

**Summary of Topic:** ElizaOS V2 is nearing completion with significant architectural improvements transitioning from project-scoped to agent-scoped plugins, enabling more flexible character configurations and improved file management, but community eagerness must be balanced against quality assurance needs.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should be our primary focus for the V2 release to maximize its impact on our Auto.fun adoption goals?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw is actively working on ElizaOS V2, which appears to be nearing completion`
  - `Community members expressed optimism about the upcoming V2 release`
  - `Expectations for significant growth in Q3 for AI agents, especially if ElizaOS V2 succeeds`
  - `Transformed plugin architecture from project-scoped to agent-scoped, allowing different plugins for different characters [#5270]`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize agent UX improvements and no-code building tools to make Auto.fun more accessible to non-technical users.
        *Implication:* Emphasizing accessibility could drive broader adoption but might delay technical capabilities valued by power users.
    b) Focus on stability, performance, and resilience for 24/7 agent operations to demonstrate trustworthy operations.
        *Implication:* Prioritizing operational excellence would build trust with existing users but might limit exciting new capabilities that could attract newcomers.
    c) Emphasize Web3 trading capabilities integration to showcase Auto.fun's core value proposition for crypto communities.
        *Implication:* Focusing on trading features would appeal strongly to crypto natives but could narrow our appeal to broader AI enthusiasts.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** When should we announce a specific V2 release date, and how should we manage community expectations?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members expressed optimism about the upcoming V2 release`
  - `Reference to "v2 live docs" suggests documentation exists or is in development`
  - `Questions raised about the future of ai16z and degenai tokens with new token coming`
  - `Mentions of Auto.fun as a launchpad gaining attention when projects like Comput3 succeed`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Announce a specific date immediately to build anticipation, with full transparency about potential challenges.
        *Implication:* Setting a public deadline creates momentum but risks disappointment if delays occur.
    b) Use a softer "coming soon" approach with regular progress updates until we have high confidence in a specific date.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach maintains excitement while providing flexibility, though it may not create the same intensity of anticipation.
    c) Complete development fully before announcing, then release with minimal lead time to avoid speculation.
        *Implication:* This cautious approach ensures delivery but sacrifices community engagement during the development process.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What level of backward compatibility should we prioritize for V2 to manage the transition for existing users?

  **Context:**
  - `Plugin architecture changes from project-scoped to agent-scoped, allowing different plugins for different characters`
  - `Current plugin system described as "a mess" with unclear compatibility between versions`
  - `Migration service created for transitioning between versions`
  - `Fixed character saving for large character files (~150kb) [#5268]`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Full backward compatibility with automated migration tools for all V1 configurations.
        *Implication:* This approach minimizes disruption for users but may constrain architectural improvements and innovation.
    b) Limited compatibility for core functions with clear migration guides, accepting some workflow changes.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach allows for significant improvements while providing reasonable transition paths for most users.
    c) Clean-break approach with minimal compatibility, focusing on superior architecture over transition convenience.
        *Implication:* This enables the most optimal V2 design but risks alienating existing users who must rebuild their configurations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Token Strategy Clarity

**Summary of Topic:** Community members have raised questions about token sales from what appeared to be a DAO wallet and the relationships between ai16z, degenai tokens, and potentially new tokens, requiring clearer communication about tokenomics strategy and Auto.fun's role.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we improve transparency around token operations and restructuring to rebuild trust?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members questioned why tokens were being sold from what appeared to be a DAO wallet without communication (å…”å…”å¤§å¯Œ, è¾žå°˜é¸½é¸½)`
  - `Team members explained tokens were sold to add to liquidity pools and would be replenished through daos.fun AUM (jasyn_bjorn)`
  - `ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ confirmed replenishment was completed with excess tokens and mentioned ongoing buybacks`
  - `Questions raised about the future of ai16z and degenai tokens with new token coming`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a formal announcement policy for all token movements with minimum 48-hour notice before action.
        *Implication:* This strict approach maximizes transparency but may hamper operational flexibility for market-responsive treasury management.
    b) Create a dashboard showing real-time treasury activities with automated notifications but allow operational flexibility.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach provides transparency while preserving the ability to execute timely market operations.
    c) Publish quarterly treasury reports with strategy explanations but maintain operational discretion for day-to-day movements.
        *Implication:* This approach provides strategic transparency but may not satisfy community members wanting real-time insight into token operations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What tokenomics model should we prioritize for Auto.fun to align with our goal of attracting and retaining users?

  **Context:**
  - `Questions raised about the future of ai16z and degenai tokens with new token coming`
  - `Mentions of Auto.fun as a launchpad gaining attention when projects like Comput3 succeed`
  - `What's the team's plan to boost ai16z popularity? Get X account back, make quality products, open source them, and market heavily (Odilitime)`
  - `Community members speculated about token performance following V2 release`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on utility-first model where token value derives primarily from protocol fee sharing and governance rights.
        *Implication:* This approach emphasizes long-term alignment but may generate less initial excitement compared to more speculative models.
    b) Implement a hybrid model with both utility components and participation incentives to balance growth and sustainability.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach can attract both speculators and utility-focused users but requires more complex tokenomics management.
    c) Prioritize growth through aggressive token incentives and reward programs to maximize initial adoption and liquidity.
        *Implication:* This approach could accelerate early growth but risks sustainability if token value becomes primarily dependent on new user acquisition.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Community Communication Challenges

**Summary of Topic:** The elizaOS project faces significant communication challenges including a suspended X (Twitter) account, questions about founder involvement, and Discord technical discussions that aren't effectively translated into accessible documentation, impacting community growth and understanding.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize communication channels to effectively reach and grow our community?

  **Context:**
  - `The X (Twitter) account is currently suspended, but the team is working with X to restore it (Odilitime, Kenk)`
  - `Some users questioned Shaw's involvement, but others confirmed he's very active in dev channels, on GitHub, and spent the weekend coding (Kenk, DorianD)`
  - `What's the team's plan to boost ai16z popularity? Get X account back, make quality products, open source them, and market heavily (Odilitime)`
  - `Dead contributors link on elizaos.ai website (https://elizaos.github.io/profiles/)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus primarily on Discord and GitHub for developer engagement while working to restore the X account.
        *Implication:* This technical-first approach maintains core developer community but may limit broader awareness and adoption.
    b) Diversify across multiple platforms (Farcaster, Telegram, Reddit) to reduce dependency on any single channel.
        *Implication:* This resilient approach avoids single points of failure but risks fragmenting the community and diluting communication efforts.
    c) Prioritize Farcaster as primary channel while X is resolved, using its crypto-native audience for targeted growth.
        *Implication:* This focused approach creates a concentrated community but might exclude potential users who aren't already in crypto circles.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How can we improve the documentation experience to better support both technical and non-technical users?

  **Context:**
  - `Dead contributors link on elizaos.ai website (https://elizaos.github.io/profiles/)`
  - `Clarify plugin ordering requirements (Mentioned by 0xbbjoker) - Document how plugin order affects functionality, especially for embedding providers`
  - `Improve Venice plugin documentation (Mentioned by cjft) - Update documentation with new environment variables and features`
  - `Create documentation for ElizaOS V2 (Mentioned by wire) - Reference to "v2 live docs" suggests documentation exists or is needed`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create separate documentation tracks for developers vs. end-users, with distinct navigation paths and complexity levels.
        *Implication:* This segmented approach serves different audiences effectively but requires maintaining parallel documentation sets.
    b) Implement an AI-powered documentation interface that adjusts technical complexity based on user queries and preferences.
        *Implication:* This innovative approach could provide personalized experiences but requires significant development effort and ongoing maintenance.
    c) Focus on improving the existing unified documentation with better organization, examples, and clearer technical explanations.
        *Implication:* This iterative approach is resource-efficient but may still struggle to simultaneously satisfy technical and non-technical audiences.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What approach should we take to better communicate the roles and contributions of key team members like Shaw?

  **Context:**
  - `Some users questioned Shaw's involvement, but others confirmed he's very active in dev channels, on GitHub, and spent the weekend coding (Kenk, DorianD)`
  - `Is Shaw active in the project? Don't see Shaw account on X. He's on Farcaster`
  - `Shaw created a camera plugin for Eliza to enable visual input processing (Odilitime)`
  - `Shaw mentioned potential ETH integration in a previous livestream`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement regular developer spotlights and changelog attributions to highlight individual contributions.
        *Implication:* This contribution-focused approach increases recognition and transparency but may create perceptions of hierarchy in an open-source community.
    b) Maintain focus on the collective effort and product developments rather than emphasizing individual contributors.
        *Implication:* This product-focused approach maintains egalitarian community culture but may not satisfy community interest in key personalities.
    c) Create a formal team page with roles, responsibilities and communication channels for key contributors.
        *Implication:* This structured approach clarifies responsibilities and access points but formalizes what might be fluid contributor relationships.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

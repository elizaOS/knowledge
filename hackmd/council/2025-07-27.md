## Daily Focus

- Resolution with X platform in sight while core development stabilizes with the integration of action chaining capabilities and enhanced plugin architecture for elizaOS v2.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: X Platform Account Recovery Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The ElizaOS team has made progress toward resolving the X platform ban for key accounts, with communication becoming quicker between teams, but community members have expressed frustration about the prolonged suspension compared to other projects.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize X platform presence versus alternative platform development during this suspension period?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk mentioned they have "a resolution with X in sight" and are holding off on creating new accounts`
  - `Communication between ElizaOS and X teams has reportedly become quicker`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus exclusively on finalizing X platform resolution, delaying expansion to other platforms.
        *Implication:* Concentrates resources on recovering our most established social channel but risks continued dependency on a single platform.
    b) Maintain negotiations with X while actively establishing presence on alternative platforms like Bluesky and Farcaster.
        *Implication:* Distributes risk across multiple platforms while potentially diluting our messaging and engagement efforts.
    c) Leverage the ban as catalyst to build our own elizaOS-powered social interface with cross-platform publishing capabilities.
        *Implication:* Creates a showcase for our technology but requires significant development resources that may delay other priorities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What level of transparency should we provide to the community regarding the X platform ban situation?

  **Context:**
  - `The team is not sharing screenshots of communications with X for now`
  - `Gianni asked: "Are you not allowed to publicly communicate the conversations between you and X with us?"`
  - `Kenk: "We're not going to share screenshots. We have a resolution with X which has been reaffirmed, communications has become quicker between teams."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain current limited transparency to avoid jeopardizing negotiations with X.
        *Implication:* Preserves negotiation integrity but may frustrate community members seeking more information.
    b) Increase transparency with regular structured updates on progress without revealing sensitive details.
        *Implication:* Balances community desire for information with the need for discretion in ongoing negotiations.
    c) Full transparency including sharing all communication logs once resolution is achieved.
        *Implication:* Builds trust through radical openness but may set precedent for expectations during future corporate negotiations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: elizaOS v2 Technical Architecture Evolution

**Summary of Topic:** Significant architectural improvements are underway, including consolidated AI model providers through a dynamic plugin system, action chaining functionality for complex agent behaviors, and a standardized service interface system that enhances modularity.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance technical architectural improvements versus user-facing features for elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw proposed consolidating AI model providers into a single `plugin-inference` that would support multiple API-compatible services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq)`
  - `Discussion favored dynamic plugin loading/unloading as the most scalable approach for switching between providers`
  - `Cjft suggested leveraging the existing ai-sdk for standardization rather than building from scratch`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize technical architecture and developer experience improvements to create a solid foundation for future growth.
        *Implication:* Creates a more maintainable and extensible platform but may delay features that could attract new users in the short term.
    b) Balance architectural improvements with user-facing features by implementing them in parallel development tracks.
        *Implication:* Attempts to satisfy both technical and user needs but risks spreading development resources too thin.
    c) Focus primarily on user-facing features with only essential architectural changes needed to support them.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes immediate user growth and engagement but may create technical debt requiring larger refactors later.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which agent capabilities should we highlight as differentiators for elizaOS v2 to drive adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `A new feature introduced standardized service interfaces and a `getServicesByType()` method, enhancing modularity`
  - `A critical new capability for action chaining was implemented, allowing for more complex, sequential agent behaviors`
  - `R0am demonstrated a personal agent built with n8n and Zep for knowledge management, processing information from Readwise highlights, Brave search API, and web content`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Emphasize action chaining and sequential reasoning as our primary differentiator for complex task execution.
        *Implication:* Positions elizaOS as an advanced platform for sophisticated agent behaviors but may be challenging for new users to grasp.
    b) Highlight knowledge management and integration capabilities across diverse information sources.
        *Implication:* Focuses on practical information processing utilities that solve immediate problems for users.
    c) Showcase the multi-model provider flexibility and dynamic plugin architecture.
        *Implication:* Emphasizes our platform's adaptability to rapid AI model evolution and positions us as model-agnostic.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Auto.fun Growth and Community Engagement

**Summary of Topic:** Community members are actively creating memes and promotional content for the project, suggesting organic engagement, while there's discussion about diversifying agent activities beyond memecoin launches to include trading agent capabilities.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the most effective catalyst to accelerate auto.fun adoption in alignment with our monthly goal?

  **Context:**
  - `CULTVESTING asked: "What is the biggest catalyst we can have on elizaos ecosystem?"`
  - `Kenk answered: "The opportunity for agents on chain is broad but diverse with different catalysts across each vertical ranging from IP to Content Creators. Seeing breakout AI apps across key sectors would be a strong catalyst."`
  - `Community members creating memes and promotional content for the project`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on demonstrating 24/7 automated trading with visible performance metrics and live trading agents.
        *Implication:* Showcases practical utility that can attract both crypto natives and AI enthusiasts interested in automated trading.

        *Implication:* Leverages the current market enthusiasm for memecoins while demonstrating our AI-powered content creation capabilities.
    c) Deploy a diverse ecosystem of specialized agents (news reporting, sentiment analysis, content creation) interacting with each other.
        *Implication:* Creates a more comprehensive demonstration of our agent ecosystem and multi-agent collaboration capabilities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we balance DegenSpartanAI trading agent development versus auto.fun memecoin launchpad features?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members questioned the focus on memecoin launchpads rather than trading agent development`
  - `Some suggested that auto.fun should prioritize Spartan as a trading agent launchpad`
  - `Yikesawjeez mentioned the GENIUS act passing, which impacts memecoin regulation`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Pivot auto.fun to primarily focus on DegenSpartanAI trading agent functionality with memecoin features as secondary.
        *Implication:* Shifts our narrative toward serious trading utility but risks losing momentum with the memecoin community.
    b) Maintain dual focus by clearly separating the platforms: auto.fun for memecoins and a new dedicated platform for DegenSpartanAI.
        *Implication:* Creates targeted experiences for different user segments but increases development overhead and potential brand confusion.
    c) Integrate trading agent capabilities into auto.fun's existing memecoin platform as complementary features.
        *Implication:* Preserves our current momentum while expanding utility, but may create a less focused product experience.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

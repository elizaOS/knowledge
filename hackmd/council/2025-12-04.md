# Council Briefing: 2025-12-04

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The elizaOS ecosystem faces critical token migration issues amid parallel technical advances in authentication, user management, and server optimization.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Challenges

**Summary of Topic:** The ai16z to elizaOS token migration is experiencing significant friction with users confused about the process, scammers exploiting the situation, and major exchanges pausing trading while evaluating support options.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize addressing the various token migration issues affecting different stakeholder groups?

  **Context:**
  - `Multiple users expressed concerns about the ai16z to elizaOS token migration process`
  - `Exchanges like Bithumb and Kraken have paused trading and are evaluating migration support`
  - `Scammers are targeting users through fake support tickets and DMs`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on exchange partnerships first to enable automated migrations for the majority of holders.
        *Implication:* This approach would assist the largest number of token holders but delays resolution for self-custody users and may extend the total migration timeline.
    b) Prioritize improved documentation and anti-scam measures for self-custody users completing manual migrations.
        *Implication:* This addresses immediate security concerns and helps the most engaged community members but leaves exchange users waiting on third-party timelines.
    c) Split resources equally between exchange negotiations, documentation improvement, and dedicated support staffing.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach ensures progress on all fronts but might not resolve any single issue stream as quickly as a focused approach.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What communication strategy should we implement to minimize confusion and prevent scams during the remainder of the migration period?

  **Context:**
  - `Multiple community members directed users to the official #migration-support and #ticket-support channels`
  - `Users warned each other about scam attempts targeting those trying to migrate tokens`
  - `Kenk mentioned changing privacy settings on the server during migration period`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a temporary migration-only communication mode with limited channels, prominent warnings, and verification procedures.
        *Implication:* This high-security approach could reduce scam vulnerability but might disrupt normal community activities and developer discussions.
    b) Maintain current structure but deploy automated verification bots and enhanced pinned messages in all channels.
        *Implication:* This minimizes disruption to ongoing development discussions but requires users to remain vigilant across a wider communication surface.
    c) Create a separate, verified migration portal outside Discord with multi-factor authentication linked to wallet signatures.
        *Implication:* This creates the most secure environment but requires additional development resources and user education about the new process.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Architecture Evolution

**Summary of Topic:** Development efforts are advancing on multiple fronts with significant PRs focused on authentication systems, API unification, and server optimization, all crucial for supporting the auto.fun launch and elizaOS v2 goals.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance the tension between security enhancements and developer experience in the auth system implementation?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan is implementing a "plugin-waitlist" concept proposed by Odilitime`
  - `PR #6200 by @standujar titled 'feat(auth): implement JWT authentication and user management' is open`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize maximum security with comprehensive entity isolation, even if it adds complexity to the developer experience.
        *Implication:* This creates the most robust multi-tenant environment but could slow adoption by making the system more complex for new developers to implement.
    b) Implement a tiered approach with simplified defaults for common use cases while enabling advanced security options for enterprise deployments.
        *Implication:* This balances accessibility and security but requires maintaining multiple authentication paths and clear documentation for each use case.
    c) Focus on developer simplicity first with minimal required configuration, adding more security features incrementally based on community feedback.
        *Implication:* This accelerates initial adoption and integration but may require more significant security refactoring later as the platform scales.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which technical improvements should we prioritize to most effectively showcase 24/7 agent activity on auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6201 by @standujar titled 'feat: Unified API - serverless - nodejs' is open`
  - `Discussion about frontend development best practices for dApps, emphasizing server and RPC verification`
  - `Some users experiencing issues with the message API returning "missing required values" errors`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on API reliability and performance optimizations to ensure consistent agent operation without downtime.
        *Implication:* This emphasis on backend stability creates a solid foundation but may delay development of more visible user-facing features.
    b) Prioritize implementing streaming capabilities and optimizing frontend real-time updates for more dynamic user experiences.
        *Implication:* This creates a more engaging user experience but might expose underlying stability issues if the backend isn't fully optimized.
    c) Develop analytics dashboards and visualization tools to better showcase agent activity metrics and performance.
        *Implication:* This enhances visibility of existing functionality but doesn't directly improve the underlying agent capabilities or reliability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Product-Market Alignment

**Summary of Topic:** With ongoing negotiations for social media restoration, competition from former team members' projects, and a need to differentiate through user-centric features, the project must clarify its market positioning to attract and retain users.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we respond to the emergence of competing projects from former team members?

  **Context:**
  - `Former team members (Loaf and Galego) have created a new project called "daydreams.systems"`
  - `Galego had created original v2 designs for elizaOS that weren't used`
  - `Odilitime identified daydreams.systems as being created by former team members`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain focus on our roadmap with no direct acknowledgment, treating it as healthy ecosystem competition.
        *Implication:* This avoids potential community division but misses opportunities to differentiate our strategic positioning from competitors.
    b) Engage in public comparison highlighting elizaOS's advantages, particularly our more advanced development stage and token ecosystem.
        *Implication:* This clarifies market positioning but risks creating unnecessary tension and could be perceived as defensive.
    c) Explore potential collaboration or interoperability opportunities that benefit both projects and the broader AI agent ecosystem.
        *Implication:* This could expand the total ecosystem value but may dilute elizaOS's unique value proposition and complicate governance.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What dashboard analytics approach would best demonstrate elizaOS agent adoption and drive further user engagement?

  **Context:**
  - `Interest in creating dashboard analytics similar to Zama's Dune dashboard to track ElizaOS agent adoption`
  - `Discussion about Babylon's growth to 300,000 users (mostly farmers) and their 3x airdrop point system`
  - `Create a Dune-like dashboard to track ElizaOS agent adoption on-chain (Mentioned by DorianD)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Build a comprehensive on-chain analytics dashboard showcasing agent deployment, transaction volume, and token utility metrics.
        *Implication:* This transparency builds credibility with the crypto community but requires significant data engineering resources.
    b) Implement a gamified user dashboard with achievement badges, agent performance comparisons, and community leaderboards.
        *Implication:* This engagement-focused approach could boost retention but might emphasize less meaningful vanity metrics over substantive adoption.
    c) Develop an AI agent showcase highlighting real-world use cases, ROI metrics, and direct comparisons to manual alternatives.
        *Implication:* This value-oriented approach could attract serious business users but may be less appealing to crypto-native community members.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

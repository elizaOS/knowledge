# Council Briefing: 2026-01-02

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Transitioning from tactical bug-squashing to strategic ecosystem architectural planning for public agent deployment and decentralized infrastructure.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Public Agent Discovery & UX Monetization

**Summary of Topic:** Development suggests a shift toward a governed public agent marketplace with structured discovery, forking capabilities, and optimized credit systems to drive user retention.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance barrier-to-entry for guest users against the mission of open access?

  **Context:**
  - `borisudovicic suggested limiting non-signed up users to 2-3 messages to encourage registration.`
  - `Issue #6315 proposes reducing free credits for new users from $5 to $1.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Enforce strict 2-3 message limits for guests.
        *Implication:* Maximizes user conversion and sybil resistance at the cost of immediate viral friction.
    b) Retain higher credit pools but restrict specialized plugins.
        *Implication:* Maintains broad accessibility while protecting higher-cost computational resources.
    c) Implement social-verification-based flexible limits.
        *Implication:* Leverages agentic social graphs (Farcaster/X) to reward high-trust users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the strategic priority for the 'Public Agent' definition?

  **Context:**
  - `Issue #6305: Enabling users to fork and edit public agents.`
  - `Issue #6304: Define public agent link format as elizacloud.ai/chat/[username].`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize 'Forkability' (Code-first).
        *Implication:* Deepens the developer ecosystem by encouraging open-source evolution of agent personalities.
    b) Prioritize 'Discoverability' (Creator-first).
        *Implication:* Drives retail engagement through normalized profiles and influencer-led agent templates.
    c) Prioritize 'State Persistence' (Utility-first).
        *Implication:* Ensures agents provide long-term value via continuous knowledge transfer across forks.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Decentralized Infrastructure & Infrastructure Migration

**Summary of Topic:** Exploration of migrating from AWS to the Jeju network via autonomous 'migration agents' signals a core move toward sovereign hardware.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Shall we formalize the development of the 'Eliza DWS Transform' agent for AWS-to-Jeju migration?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD proposed an AI-powered infrastructure migration agent identifying cost reduction opportunities.`
  - `Shaw outlined plans to transition to self-owned physical racks in data centers by year-end.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate automated code-rewriting agents.
        *Implication:* Positions Jeju as the 'path of least resistance' for Web3 infrastructure onboarding.
    b) Focus on hardware acquisition first.
        *Implication:* Ensures the network has sufficient physical bandwidth before scaling migration tools.
    c) Partner with SMB hosting providers.
        *Implication:* Bypasses enterprise friction by targeting the $25-$100/mo server segment via AI administration.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How will the Council address the 3x chip price volatility noted in the Holo-Logs?

  **Context:**
  - `The team noted DDR5 memory prices tripling from $400 to $1200.`
  - `Shaw mentioned self-owned infrastructure migration using physical racks.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Establish a hardware reserve fund / early procurement.
        *Implication:* Protects the December directive toward 'Cloud Launch' from supply chain inflation.
    b) Optimize agents for lower-memory inference (quantization).
        *Implication:* Reduces dependency on high-end chipsets for ecosystem sustainability.
    c) Transition to a fully decentralized provider model (DePIN).
        *Implication:* Shifts capital expenditure risk onto the distributed network participants.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Gaming & Metaverse Integration ('Hyperscape')

**Summary of Topic:** Strategic pivot toward embedding Eliza agents within existing gaming environments (RuneScape/Zelda style) rather than isolated chat interfaces.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should 'Full Agent Mode' be the primary gaming performance benchmark?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw proposed a Zelda-style experience with integrated agents.`
  - `The team discussed a full agent mode where users observe autonomous agents.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes: Focus on autonomous NPC behaviors.
        *Implication:* Aligns with developer-first goals by creating a testbed for complex multi-agent interactions.
    b) No: Prioritize player-driven 'Asset Forging'.
        *Implication:* Empowers creators with quest generation tools before agents become fully independent.
    c) Hybrid: Implement token-wagering agent dApps.
        *Implication:* Directly links DegenAI and the ecosystem economy to the gaming frontend.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2026-01-02

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Council attention is pulled between high-visibility narrative momentum (token chatter and “Zelda with agents” visions) and a critical execution gap: unresolved migration FAQs and near-zero observable core repo throughput during the latest window.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Clarity & Trust Surface

**Summary of Topic:** Discord shows repeated migration/contract questions going unanswered, creating an avoidable trust deficit precisely during an “execution excellence” directive; documentation and in-product guidance must close the loop.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s minimum acceptable standard for migration clarity (contract address, deadline, step-by-step flows) and where must it be surfaced (docs, website, in-app, Discord bot)?

  **Context:**
  - `💬-discussion: "Where do I find the token contract for 'elizaOS'?" (BoulderMagic) — Unanswered`
  - `💬-discussion: "When is the deadline for manually swapping ai16z tokens… to elizaos tokens?" (KARA) — Unanswered`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish a single canonical “Migration Console” page (contract addresses, deadlines, wallet-specific steps) and mirror it in Discord via a bot command.
        *Implication:* Reduces repeated support load and stabilizes trust by making answers deterministic and shareable.
    b) Rely on community channels (#migration-help, pinned messages) and address edge cases ad hoc as they appear.
        *Implication:* Maintains flexibility but prolongs uncertainty and increases rumor-driven sentiment swings.
    c) Embed migration checks directly into ElizaOS Cloud/CLI login flow (detect holdings, guide swaps) and treat docs as secondary.
        *Implication:* Best UX if built quickly, but risks schedule impact on Cloud launch if engineering scope expands.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should token utility messaging be formally coupled to Cloud launch (explicit integrations/benefits), or kept decoupled until Cloud reliability is proven?

  **Context:**
  - `💬-discussion: "I saw someone asked in X why ElisaOS token is not integrated into cloud?" (chomppp) — Unanswered`
  - `2026-01-01 Discord highlights: "Create documentation explaining token integration with cloud services" (Mentioned by chomppp)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Couple messaging: define 1–2 concrete Cloud utilities gated/discounted by token from day one, and document them as part of launch.
        *Implication:* Creates clear demand narrative, but increases coordination and reliability requirements at launch.
    b) Decouple: launch Cloud purely on reliability/DX, and publish token utility roadmap with explicit milestones and timelines.
        *Implication:* Aligns with execution excellence; reduces launch risk while still giving holders a credible plan.
    c) Soft-couple: communicate “token hooks are coming” without specifying utilities until post-launch telemetry validates Cloud stability.
        *Implication:* Minimizes immediate commitments but may be perceived as evasive by a token-focused segment.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should the Council respond to buyback speculation to avoid governance-by-rumor while preserving strategic optionality?

  **Context:**
  - `Daily report 2026-01-01: "discussions about potential buyback programs… strategic versus programmatic buybacks"`
  - `Community tone: predictions of "Coinbase listing" and new ATHs (2026-01-01 daily summary)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Issue a governance stance: buybacks are not planned; focus is migration + Cloud launch; revisit only after revenue signals.
        *Implication:* Quiets speculation and reinforces execution priorities, but may dampen short-term market enthusiasm.
    b) Define a conditional framework (e.g., revenue thresholds, treasury policy) without committing to execution.
        *Implication:* Channels speculation into measurable criteria while keeping strategic flexibility.
    c) Allow community-led narrative to run; no official commentary beyond pointing to tokenomics docs.
        *Implication:* Avoids distraction for core team but cedes narrative control and increases misinformation risk.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Execution Throughput & Reliability Signals

**Summary of Topic:** Operational telemetry shows a temporary dead zone in core repo activity (no PRs/issues/contributors in the tracked window), conflicting with the mandate to build trust through shipping; Council should verify whether this is a measurement artifact, a holiday pause, or a systemic bottleneck.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Is the observed “0 PRs / 0 contributors” in the elizaos/eliza window an actual slowdown or a reporting/observability gap, and who owns closing that ambiguity?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub Activity Summary: "From January 1-2, 2026, the elizaos/eliza repository had no new pull requests (0 merged), no new issues, and no active contributors."`
  - `Monthly interval report (generated): "0 new PRs… 0 active contributors."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Treat as a data quality issue: audit telemetry pipeline and cross-check with GitHub directly; assign an owner today.
        *Implication:* Protects Council decision-making from false negatives and strengthens “trust through shipping” instrumentation.
    b) Assume it’s a holiday pause; set an explicit restart cadence and public weekly ship targets starting next workday.
        *Implication:* Keeps focus on momentum without over-investing in tooling, but risks missing real blockers.
    c) Assume it’s a real throughput problem; immediately re-plan scope (freeze non-critical work) around Cloud + migration deliverables.
        *Implication:* Maximizes execution excellence, but may prematurely constrain R&D if the signal is misleading.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s near-term definition of “shipping” that restores trust: releases, uptime, migration success rate, or developer onboarding completion?

  **Context:**
  - `Core Principles: "Trust Through Shipping" and "Execution Excellence"`
  - `Monthly directive emphasis: "launch ElizaOS Cloud… stabilize flagship agents… clear documentation"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Release-centric: commit to a fixed cadence (e.g., weekly tagged releases across core + critical plugins).
        *Implication:* Creates visible momentum for devs, but can incentivize shallow shipping if quality gates are weak.
    b) Reliability-centric: publish Cloud SLOs + flagship agent stability metrics; shipping equals meeting SLOs for consecutive weeks.
        *Implication:* Aligns tightly with North Star reliability, though less flashy for community perception.
    c) Journey-centric: shipping equals “migration completed + docs + onboarding tutorial works end-to-end,” even if releases are fewer.
        *Implication:* Maximizes user outcomes and reduces support burden, but may under-serve power-user feature expectations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How aggressively should the Council enforce scope discipline when community attention drifts to speculative or side projects?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2026-01-01: many New Year/token discussions; migration questions unanswered`
  - `Core-devs: significant energy on gaming concepts (RuneScape/Zelda with agents)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Hard gate: only Cloud/migration/flagship stability work is sanctioned until success metrics are met.
        *Implication:* Highest probability of meeting the directive, but may reduce morale and external narrative excitement.
    b) Portfolio approach: reserve a small, time-boxed R&D lane (e.g., 10–15%) for high-EV experiments while protecting core lanes.
        *Implication:* Sustains innovation and narrative while keeping execution primary, but requires strong project management.
    c) Community-led experimentation: encourage external contributors to drive side projects; core team provides interfaces and plugin hooks only.
        *Implication:* Preserves core focus and accelerates ecosystem growth if governance and review bandwidth exist.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Gaming/Megaverse Opportunity vs Core Platform Priorities

**Summary of Topic:** Core-devs surfaced strong interest (including VC inbound) in a RuneScape/Zelda-like agent game and Hyperscape tooling needs; Council must decide whether this becomes a flagship reference vertical (showcasing multi-agent autonomy) or remains a secondary community experiment.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should “Zelda with agents” be elevated into an official flagship reference (to demonstrate multi-agent autonomy), or kept as a side project until Cloud is stable?

  **Context:**
  - `core-devs (Shaw): "VCs have reached out… enthusiastic for the RuneScape-inspired project."`
  - `core-devs (Shaw): "Zelda with agents" via forking RuneScape`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Elevate now: declare it a flagship vertical with a clear MVP that showcases agents generating quests/NPC behavior on Cloud.
        *Implication:* Could become the most compelling demo for builders/investors, but risks distracting from Cloud hardening.
    b) Defer: keep it experimental until Cloud/migration KPIs are met; then adopt as a post-launch flagship.
        *Implication:* Protects execution excellence while preserving a strong narrative asset for later amplification.
    c) Split ownership: core defines interfaces + minimal support; community/partners build the game; Council blesses it as “ecosystem-led.”
        *Implication:* Maximizes composability and ecosystem leverage, but quality control and brand risk must be managed.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the correct technical “first brick” for the Hyperscape/agent game vision: agent-mode sandbox, quest/NPC authoring tools, or world editing/inspection?

  **Context:**
  - `core-devs (Shaw): "asset forge in hyperscape" needs "quest generation" and "NPC setup"`
  - `core-devs (Shaw): needs "world viewing/tweaking" before shipping`
  - `Action item: "Implement agent mode in RuneScape fork where users can create agents and watch them run around"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Start with agent-mode sandbox (spawn agents, observe behavior, instrumentation) to validate reliability and emergent behavior first.
        *Implication:* Creates a developer-first testbed and hard data for autonomy, enabling disciplined iteration.
    b) Start with quest generation + NPC authoring to produce immediate gameplay content and demo value.
        *Implication:* Fast narrative payoff, but may mask underlying agent reliability gaps until later.
    c) Start with world viewing/tweaking tooling to ensure creators can debug and control simulations before adding autonomy.
        *Implication:* Reduces downstream rework and improves UX, but delays the “agents feel alive” moment.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should Council integrate external capital interest (VC inbound) without compromising open-source credibility and shipping discipline?

  **Context:**
  - `core-devs (Shaw): VCs expressed interest in the RuneScape project`
  - `Core Principles: "Open & Composable" and "Trust Through Shipping"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accept capital only if it directly funds Cloud reliability and open-source deliverables (SLOs, docs, plugin hardening).
        *Implication:* Aligns incentives to North Star and reduces risk of narrative-driven detours.
    b) Ring-fence capital into a separate “Labs” track for gaming demos, keeping core platform roadmap unchanged.
        *Implication:* Enables parallel innovation, but requires governance to prevent brand confusion and resource bleed.
    c) Decline/ignore VC interest until after Cloud launch and migration completion; revisit with stronger leverage later.
        *Implication:* Maximizes focus and bargaining power, but may miss a window for rapid ecosystem expansion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

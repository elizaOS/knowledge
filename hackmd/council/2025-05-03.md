# Council Briefing: 2025-05-03

## Daily Focus Theme

- Auto.fun demonstrates significant market traction with $100M in volume while elizaOS v2 development stabilizes critical infrastructure with plugin architecture improvements.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Auto.fun Market Adoption Velocity

**Summary:** Auto.fun has processed over $100M in volume since launch, with significant partner launches and technical improvements addressing initial system stability issues, indicating strong market traction despite technical challenges.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Kenk reported "Auto.fun has processed over $100M in volume since launch"`
- `Discord: Jasyn_bjorn identified and fixed "a memory leak causing slow site performance"`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we optimize the balance between rapid growth and technical stability for auto.fun?
- Should we prioritize volume-generating partners or elizaOS-building partners for upcoming token launches?

### 2. ElizaOS v2 Readiness Assessment

**Summary:** ElizaOS v2 is approaching production readiness with finalization of the plugin architecture, but has missed communication targets and the V2 announcement was delayed due to auto.fun bugs, potentially affecting perception of development progress.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Shaw described v2 as "really just 1.0, it's a finished product with useful working agents which we're testing on our own team."`
- `Discord: Deki mentioned "V2 announcement was delayed due to bugs in the Auto.fun launch"`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we accelerate the v2 announcement despite remaining auto.fun issues to maintain developer momentum?
- How can we better communicate our progress on v2 to the community while undergoing significant architectural changes?

### 3. Modular Plugin Architecture Implementation

**Summary:** Major architectural changes are underway with multiple plugins being removed from the monorepo to support a more modular ecosystem, creating a cleaner separation between core framework and extensions while potentially affecting developer experience.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: Multiple PRs merged removing plugins from monorepo including browser (#4406), anthropic (#4427), ollama (#4437), and others`
- `GitHub: PR #4384 merged to prepare 0.x for sharing plugins with 1.x`

**Potential Questions:**
- How will the modular architecture impact our ability to attract and retain developers versus maintaining an all-in-one solution?
- What support infrastructure is needed to ensure third-party plugin developers can effectively contribute to the ecosystem?

### 4. User Experience vs. Technical Complexity

**Summary:** Users are experiencing friction with installation and configuration of ElizaOS, particularly with model configuration, environment variables, and Windows compatibility, raising questions about accessibility to non-technical users.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord Development: YungYoda advised "you need to use Ubuntu WSL2 for Windows to run ElizaOS properly"`
- `Discord Development: Multiple users reported issues with conversation history disappearing after inactivity`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we balance maintaining technical flexibility for power users with creating accessible onboarding for mainstream adoption?
- Should we invest more resources in improving cross-platform compatibility or focus on perfecting the experience on our primary supported platforms?

# Council Briefing: 2025-06-03

## Daily Focus Theme

- ElizaOS V2 has been stealthily released but faces technical challenges with integration points, particularly with Twitter, potentially impacting auto.fun's ability to showcase 24/7 agent activity.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. V2 Launch Strategy: Stealth vs. Public Announcement

**Summary:** ElizaOS V2 has been shipped in 'stealth mode' without official announcement as the team works through QA issues, plugin compatibility, and Twitter integration challenges, creating tension between operational readiness and market positioning.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User 'xell0x' confirmed V2 is released but not officially announced yet with 'The Org' only partially ready`
- `Discord: Developer 'cjft' identified compatibility issues between older ElizaOS versions and newer plugins`

**Potential Questions:**
- Does our stealth release strategy align with our monthly goal of attracting new users to auto.fun, or should we accelerate the public announcement despite existing issues?
- How do we balance our technical perfectionism with market momentum, particularly in the AI/crypto intersection where visibility drives adoption?

### 2. Twitter Integration: Critical Path for Agent Visibility

**Summary:** Multiple users are experiencing Twitter plugin issues, including Cloudflare blocking and compatibility problems, which directly threatens our goal of showcasing 24/7 agent activity through social platforms—a cornerstone of auto.fun's appeal.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Developer 'shaw' released Twitter plugin v1.0.1 to fix Cloudflare blocking issues`
- `GitHub: Active work on standardizing Twitter environment variables across documentation (PR #4883)`

**Potential Questions:**
- Given Twitter's central role in our visibility strategy, should we divert additional resources to ensure flawless Twitter integration before the official V2 announcement?
- Are we overly dependent on Twitter as a showcase platform for our agents, or should we diversify our agent visibility channels?

### 3. The Org & Ecosystem Character Development

**Summary:** Development of 'The Org' with agent personas like eli5 (community manager) and Eddy (dev rel) is progressing but not fully ready for V2 launch, raising questions about our strategy for creating compelling, autonomous agent personas that drive user engagement.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User '辞尘鸽鸽' shared updates about building a Chinese community for Spartan and ai16z`
- `GitHub: Repository for The Org shared with preparations for Eli5 and Eddy agent personas`

**Potential Questions:**
- How critical are developed agent personas like eli5 and Eddy to our goal of attracting users to auto.fun, and should their readiness block our V2 announcement?
- Should we focus on fewer, more polished agent personas or a broader ecosystem of simpler agents to demonstrate the platform's capabilities?

### 4. Architecture Evolution vs Stability

**Summary:** Significant architectural improvements to ElizaOS (standalone message server, plugin specifications, mobile UI support) are advancing the framework's modular, extensible foundation, but these changes introduce complexity that could impact stability and user onboarding.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: PR #4864 refactored message server to be completely separate from agents`
- `GitHub: PR #4851 added plugin specifications to core`

**Potential Questions:**
- At what point do architectural improvements that strengthen our technical foundation begin to conflict with our immediate goal of stability and user attraction?
- How do we communicate the value of these foundational changes to non-technical users who primarily experience the platform through auto.fun?

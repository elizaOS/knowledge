# Council Briefing: 2025-06-03

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- ElizaOS v2 has been silently shipped with significant architectural improvements but faces critical Twitter plugin issues that must be resolved before full public launch.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 Launch Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** ElizaOS v2 has been quietly released with major architectural improvements, but the team is intentionally delaying the public announcement until ecosystem integrations are stabilized, particularly the Twitter plugin which is experiencing critical issues.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the optimal timing strategy for the public V2 announcement?

  **Context:**
  - `xell0x: 'Has V2 been released?' shaw: 'Yes, it has been shipped but not officially announced yet.'`
  - `shaw: 'They need to work out ecosystem issues and want partners to upgrade first before announcing.'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Announce immediately to capitalize on completed development work regardless of remaining issues.
        *Implication:* Could drive immediate adoption but risks negative user experiences with unresolved Twitter integration issues.
    b) Fix critical Twitter plugin issues first, then promote a 'stable V2 release' within 1-2 weeks.
        *Implication:* Balances timeliness with quality assurance, allowing partners to migrate while addressing the most visible integration problems.
    c) Delay announcement until The Org components and auto.fun staking are also ready for unified product suite launch.
        *Implication:* Creates a more comprehensive ecosystem launch but significantly delays momentum and public awareness of completed work.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we prioritize V2 plugin migration given the current technical constraints?

  **Context:**
  - `cjft: 'No, you need to update to v1.0.2' when asked about Twitter plugin compatibility with older ElizaOS versions.`
  - `shaw: 'Fixed the issue and released Twitter plugin v1.0.1...The update addresses the Cloudflare blocker issue and is available on NPM.'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize high-visibility social media plugins (Twitter, Discord) for immediate patching and compatibility updates.
        *Implication:* Addresses the most user-facing aspects of the platform but may leave functional gaps in other areas.
    b) Focus on automatic plugin updater tools to ease migration burden on developers and plugin creators.
        *Implication:* Reduces technical friction across the ecosystem but doesn't directly solve specific critical plugin issues.
    c) Create comprehensive documentation for all plugin migrations simultaneously, allowing developers to self-serve updates.
        *Implication:* Distributes migration effort across the community but may result in inconsistent implementation quality.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Auto.fun Revitalization Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** Auto.fun requires immediate attention to increase user engagement, with plans to integrate 24/7 agents like eli5, implement staking functionality, and improve token visibility and trading activity.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What agent-driven strategy would most effectively revitalize auto.fun user engagement?

  **Context:**
  - `xell0x: 'Implement Eli5 Eliza v2 Twitter agent'`
  - `Potential auto.fun staking feature for established tokens like Eli5 and Eddy (referenced in GitHub PR #517)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Deploy eli5 and eddy as 24/7 community manager agents showcasing the platform's capabilities through consistent social media presence.
        *Implication:* Creates visible demonstration of agent capabilities but relies on social engagement rather than financial utility.
    b) Prioritize implementation of auto.fun staking for ELI5 and other tokens to provide immediate financial utility to token holders.
        *Implication:* Introduces concrete financial utility but may not drive new user acquisition without complementary visibility efforts.
    c) Launch an agent hackathon specifically focused on creating auto.fun-integrated agents with trading, staking, and entertainment capabilities.
        *Implication:* Engages developer community and could produce diverse use cases but requires significant coordination resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we approach promotional content generation for the auto.fun platform?

  **Context:**
  - `jin: 'YouTube thumbnail generator'`
  - `辞尘鸽鸽: 'Using Hyper to build Spartan-style structures for promotional purposes'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Develop AI tools for creators to generate professional promotional materials (YouTube thumbnails, Twitter images) directly within the platform.
        *Implication:* Provides immediate value to creators while demonstrating practical AI applications beyond trading.
    b) Focus on building immersive visualizations using Hyper technology to showcase agent activities and token performance.
        *Implication:* Creates distinctive visual identity and differentiation but requires specialized development resources.
    c) Establish a dedicated marketing agent that automatically generates daily content about platform tokens and trading activities.
        *Implication:* Provides consistent content stream with minimal human intervention but quality may be variable.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Community Ecosystem Development

**Summary of Topic:** The community ecosystem is expanding with new technical initiatives, international outreach, and token-centric activities, but requires strategic direction to align with the core mission while avoiding confusion with unaffiliated projects.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we approach the growing international community interest, particularly from Chinese users?

  **Context:**
  - `辞尘鸽鸽 shared updates about building a Chinese community for Spartan and ai16z, mentioning they've created a WeChat group with loyal fans and filtered out 'haters'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Formally designate regional community ambassadors with explicit guidelines and resources for managing localized communities.
        *Implication:* Creates official representation in key markets but introduces additional organizational overhead and potential coordination challenges.
    b) Develop language-specific agents that can provide 24/7 support and information in multiple languages without direct team involvement.
        *Implication:* Scales support through automation but may miss cultural nuances that human ambassadors would understand.
    c) Create a unified international community program with shared resources but autonomy for regional adaptations of messaging and activities.
        *Implication:* Balances consistency with local relevance but requires careful governance to maintain alignment with core values.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we differentiate official elizaOS ecosystem projects from unaffiliated initiatives using similar branding?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members clarified that 'a16zee' is not affiliated with their group`
  - `DEMIAN: 'What's the buzz about a16zee? Is it legit?' shaw: 'Not affiliated with the team, but probably real'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement formal verification system with on-chain attestation for official projects and partnerships to prevent confusion.
        *Implication:* Creates clear distinction for users but adds friction to the partnership process and requires ongoing maintenance.
    b) Maintain a neutral stance toward unaffiliated projects while focusing on clear branding and communication for official initiatives.
        *Implication:* Preserves open ecosystem philosophy but risks continued confusion when similar naming conventions are used.
    c) Actively monitor and publicly address potential confusion through regular community updates that clarify official vs. unofficial projects.
        *Implication:* Maintains awareness without restrictive policies but requires consistent communication resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

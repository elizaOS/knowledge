# Council Briefing: 2025-12-06

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The engineering team is making significant progress on unified streaming support across plugins while simultaneously addressing token migration challenges and security concerns.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Streaming Support Implementation

**Summary of Topic:** The team is actively developing unified streaming support across plugins, starting with plugin-openrouter before extending to plugin-openai and plugin-anthropic, representing a critical technical milestone for elizaOS v2.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize streaming implementation across different plugins to best serve our goal of demonstrating 24/7 agent activity?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan is working on unifying the `useModel` behavior for both normal and streaming modes, starting with the plugin-openrouter implementation before extending the pattern to plugin-openai and plugin-anthropic.`
  - `Stan: Work includes streaming on both server (API/SSE/WebSocket) and client (UI) sides`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on completing plugin-openrouter first as a model implementation, then expand to other plugins sequentially.
        *Implication:* This approach provides a stable reference implementation but may delay full ecosystem streaming support.
    b) Accelerate parallel development across all plugins simultaneously with multiple engineers assigned.
        *Implication:* This maximizes speed to market but risks inconsistencies in implementation and increases coordination complexity.
    c) Prioritize plugins based on user adoption metrics, focusing development efforts on the most widely used LLM connections first.
        *Implication:* This optimizes for immediate user impact but might neglect emerging models that could be strategic differentiators.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What strategic benefits should we emphasize when marketing the streaming capabilities to auto.fun users?

  **Context:**
  - `Issue #6206 titled 'Streaming Support' by @borisudovicic is OPEN`
  - `Stan: Implement streaming on server (API/SSE/WebSocket) and client (UI)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Enhanced user experience with more responsive interfaces and real-time agent interactions.
        *Implication:* This positions streaming as a UX differentiator that makes elizaOS agents feel more natural and engaging.
    b) Reduced API costs and improved performance by processing partial results as they arrive.
        *Implication:* This emphasizes the economic advantages for developers and presents elizaOS as the cost-efficient choice for AI infrastructure.
    c) New creative possibilities for building dynamic, real-time streaming agents that can create continuous content.
        *Implication:* This aligns directly with our goal of showcasing 24/7 agent activity and positions elizaOS as an innovation platform.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Token Migration & Security

**Summary of Topic:** The community is experiencing challenges with the AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration, while simultaneously facing increased security threats from scammers targeting users during this transition period.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we improve the token migration process to minimize confusion and protect users from scams?

  **Context:**
  - `Several users needed help with token migration, particularly those who purchased tokens after the snapshot`
  - `Multiple scam alerts when suspicious links or users were detected in the discussion channel`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Deploy an automated verification system that flags suspicious links and validates official migration channels.
        *Implication:* This provides technical protection but requires development resources that could be directed to core platform features.
    b) Create a detailed, pinned step-by-step migration guide with visual verification cues and a dedicated support team.
        *Implication:* This focuses on education and support but may still leave some users vulnerable to sophisticated phishing attempts.
    c) Implement a simplified one-click migration tool within trusted interfaces like the official website and wallet plugins.
        *Implication:* This creates the best user experience but may be complex to implement across different wallet ecosystems.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we accelerate the development of features mentioned by MDMnvest (Eliza Cloud, EVM integration, etc.) to stimulate token value and migration interest?

  **Context:**
  - `MDMnvest mentioned upcoming technical developments including 'Eliza Cloud, generative treasury mechanism, EVM integration, ERC-8004, x402, V2 upgrades, Cross-Chain expansions, Babylon, key partnerships and integrations, elizaOS chain'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, accelerate development of these features with increased resources to generate market excitement.
        *Implication:* This might boost token value but risks diverting resources from the monthly goal of stabilizing auto.fun and completing elizaOS v2.
    b) Maintain current development pace but improve communication about the roadmap with regular, transparent updates.
        *Implication:* This balances development reality with market perception while maintaining focus on core priorities.
    c) Selectively accelerate only features that directly support auto.fun's growth while deferring others.
        *Implication:* This aligns development with our monthly goal but might disappoint community members expecting broader ecosystem advancement.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Developer Experience Enhancement

**Summary of Topic:** Recent work indicates a need to improve the developer experience for elizaOS, with focus areas including streamlining agent setup and addressing technical issues like plugin behavior and directory management.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance maintaining technical flexibility with improving developer onboarding simplicity?

  **Context:**
  - `ninja asked about an elegant Python solution for admin plugin reset without restart`
  - `Issue #6204 titled '.eliza needed or plugin-sql crashes, should autocreate' by @lalalune`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on creating simplified wrappers and smart defaults while maintaining all advanced options for power users.
        *Implication:* This provides the best of both worlds but increases maintenance complexity as both simple and advanced APIs must be supported.
    b) Redesign core APIs with simplicity as the primary goal, even if it means breaking changes for existing integrations.
        *Implication:* This optimizes for new developer acquisition but risks alienating existing community members who have already invested in learning our system.
    c) Keep APIs as-is but invest heavily in comprehensive templates, examples, and automated project generators.
        *Implication:* This minimizes disruption to existing developers but may not address fundamental usability issues in the core platform.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What development priorities would best support our goal of showcasing 24/7 agent activity on auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Brief disagreement about tool calling functionality, with Odilitime suggesting it's unnecessary optionality`
  - `DorianD jokingly suggested creating 'agentic robots with ElizaOS logos and a prediction market app for betting on agent health'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize tools that enable continuous agent activity, such as automated recovery, scheduling, and persistent memory.
        *Implication:* This directly serves our goal of 24/7 agent activity but may not address broader ecosystem needs.
    b) Focus on engagement features like prediction markets, agent interactions, and social capabilities to drive user retention.
        *Implication:* This emphasizes the social aspects that might attract and retain users but could distract from core stability work.
    c) Invest in monitoring, analytics, and developer tools to help the community build and maintain their own always-on agents.
        *Implication:* This leverages community creativity but places more responsibility on external developers rather than our core team.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-02-22

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Operational velocity dipped into a “quiet orbit,” with the day’s only surfaced movement being issue triage for a core type-definition regression—an early warning that reliability guardrails need tightening as the ecosystem scales.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Stability Drift & Type-Safety Guardrails

**Summary of Topic:** A new core issue (“Adapter” type alias undefined) was reported during an otherwise minimal activity day, indicating that small type-safety cracks can become outsized DX failures when plugin + adapter ecosystems expand. The Council should decide whether to harden release gates and CI checks now, even at the cost of short-term feature throughput.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we treat type-definition regressions (e.g., missing core aliases) as release-blocking incidents for the framework and Cloud path?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub daily summary (2025-02-22): “missing type alias definition… ‘Adapter’ type alias not being defined” (issue #3639).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—classify as release-blocking for core + CLI and patch within 24 hours.
        *Implication:* Maximizes developer trust and prevents plugin ecosystem breakage, but slows feature cadence.
    b) Only if it breaks the default path (starter/CLI); otherwise schedule into the next minor release.
        *Implication:* Balances velocity with stability, but risks fragmented experiences across install paths.
    c) No—treat as normal bug triage unless it causes runtime crashes.
        *Implication:* Preserves throughput, but undermines “reliability-first” perception when developers hit compile errors.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which guardrail best reduces recurrence: stricter type exports policy in core, stronger plugin-contract testing, or tighter PR review gates?

  **Context:**
  - `Issue #3639: “Type Alias ‘Adapter’ is not defined.”`
  - `GitHub activity note (2025-02-21→22): “13 new PRs (9 merged)… 29 active contributors.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Core export policy: define and re-export all adapter/plugin types from a single canonical module.
        *Implication:* Creates a stable contract surface; reduces ambiguity for community plugins and downstream apps.
    b) Plugin-contract tests: add compile-time tests for registry plugins against the latest core types.
        *Implication:* Catches ecosystem breakage early, but increases CI cost and coordination overhead.
    c) Review gates: require at least one maintainer approval for any change touching core types/interfaces.
        *Implication:* Improves correctness at the source, but may bottleneck merges during high-contributor periods.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How do we interpret the activity drop (0 merges day-over-day) in terms of operational risk: normal lull, review backlog, or integration debt?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub activity note (2025-02-22→23): “5 new PRs (none merged)… 9 active contributors.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Normal lull—no intervention; focus on planned roadmap milestones.
        *Implication:* Avoids overreacting, but may miss early signals of maintainer capacity strain.
    b) Review backlog—add a rotating “merge captain” to keep throughput steady.
        *Implication:* Stabilizes cadence and reduces contributor frustration; requires disciplined staffing.
    c) Integration debt—freeze new features for 48–72 hours to pay down build/CI and adapter churn.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability quickly, but delays shipping and may frustrate plugin authors.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: DX Friction in Storage, Adapters, and RAG

**Summary of Topic:** Recent holo-logs show repeated setup failures (SQLite dependencies across OSes, WSL2/Postgres pain, Qdrant memory limitations) and RAG confusion (“agent not responding based on provided knowledge”). This directly conflicts with the Council’s reliability + developer-first doctrine and should be addressed with a narrowed “golden path” and sharper docs/remediation.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is our officially blessed “golden path” for local persistence in 2025: SQLite, Postgres, or PGlite as the default developer experience?

  **Context:**
  - `💻-coders (2025-02-21): “Multiple users encountered SQLite dependency issues across different operating systems (macOS, Ubuntu, WSL2).”`
  - `💻-coders (2025-02-21): “Users reported problems with PostgreSQL connections… WSL2 compatibility issues.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) SQLite as default: simplest mental model; invest in dependency/install automation and clearer errors.
        *Implication:* Minimizes friction for beginners, but may constrain scaling patterns and multi-tenant parity.
    b) PGlite as default: Postgres-like ergonomics without external DB; align with multi-tenancy direction.
        *Implication:* Improves portability and future parity, but requires rigorous testing and migration guidance.
    c) Postgres as default: production parity; provide templates + docker compose for local setup.
        *Implication:* Optimizes for real deployments, but raises onboarding complexity and increases support burden.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Where should we spend the next reliability budget: adapter correctness (Postgres/Qdrant), RAG correctness (knowledge retrieval), or installer tooling (WSL2/OS deps)?

  **Context:**
  - `💻-coders (2025-02-21): “Fix Qdrant adapter implementation for memory management” (Lucas Fernandes).`
  - `GitHub issues (2025-02-21): “agent isn't responding based on the provided knowledge” (issue #3628).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adapter correctness first (Postgres/Qdrant): remove data-loss and persistence uncertainty.
        *Implication:* Raises trust in “persistent agents,” but may not reduce first-run setup failures.
    b) RAG correctness first: make knowledge features reliably work with predictable configuration.
        *Implication:* Improves flagship agent credibility and “taming information,” but leaves setup pain unresolved.
    c) Installer/tooling first: eliminate OS-level friction (SQLite deps, WSL2 guides, one-command checks).
        *Implication:* Improves activation and retention of new builders, accelerating ecosystem growth.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we commit to “hot-reload knowledge” as a near-term feature to reduce iteration friction, or keep it out until memory/adapter behavior is stable?

  **Context:**
  - `💻-coders FAQ (2025-02-21): “Add ability to reload knowledge without restarting agent” (Sipit) — unanswered.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship hot-reload soon with clear constraints (dev-only, best-effort) and strong logging.
        *Implication:* Accelerates builder iteration and demos, but risks confusing behavior if underlying storage is flaky.
    b) Defer until adapter + RAG pipeline is stable; focus on correctness and reproducibility first.
        *Implication:* Strengthens reliability narrative, but slows experiential progress for builders.
    c) Implement as a plugin-level feature (per-client) rather than core, allowing experimentation.
        *Implication:* Keeps core lean while enabling innovation, but may fragment behavior across clients.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Trust Signaling Through Shipping (Comms + Cadence)

**Summary of Topic:** Even with minimal engineering activity on 2025-02-22, recent channels show a consistent theme: developer trust is being shaped as much by documentation freshness and communication cohesion as by code. The Council must align V2/launchpad ambition with execution excellence—reducing fragmentation and making the project legible to builders.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s preferred trust signal for the next cycle: shipping V2/launchpad faster, or consolidating docs + “known issues” remediation to reduce support load?

  **Context:**
  - `🥇-partners (2025-02-21): “V2… ahead of schedule, potentially launching in April.”`
  - `🥇-partners (2025-02-21): “Jin has been updating docs to fix bad information… outdated documentation hurting developer experience.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize V2/launchpad velocity; accept higher support load temporarily.
        *Implication:* Maximizes momentum and narrative, but risks violating “Execution Excellence” if onboarding is rough.
    b) Prioritize documentation + remediation sprint (quickstart, adapters, RAG) before major launches.
        *Implication:* Improves conversion and trust, but slows the headline roadmap and partner excitement.
    c) Dual-track: freeze new features weekly for “stability/docs days” while V2 continues.
        *Implication:* Maintains momentum while preventing debt compounding, but requires strong coordination discipline.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we address community platform fragmentation without losing builder throughput?

  **Context:**
  - `🥇-partners (2025-02-21): “fragmentation across multiple Discord servers… and a new Telegram chat” (DorianD).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Consolidate to one primary dev hub with clear channels; archive secondary servers.
        *Implication:* Reduces confusion and duplication, but may alienate sub-communities accustomed to separate spaces.
    b) Federate: keep multiple spaces but enforce a single source-of-truth (weekly digest + mirrored announcements).
        *Implication:* Preserves culture and reach while improving coherence, but requires ongoing ops automation.
    c) Let spaces compete organically; focus only on tooling that indexes all conversation into docs/RAG.
        *Implication:* Maximizes openness but risks sustained confusion and support inefficiency.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What governance stance should we take on speculative long-horizon initiatives (e.g., L1 concepts, TEE multi-sig agents) to avoid roadmap confusion while preserving R&D imagination?

  **Context:**
  - `ideas-feedback-rants (2025-02-21): “multi-signature mechanism for TEE agents… enhance security and trust” (DorianD).`
  - `tokenomics (2025-02-21): “use AI developers to create an L1… ‘ElizaOS L1’” (DorianD).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Formally defer: label as “Research Only” with no implied delivery timeline.
        *Implication:* Protects execution focus and reduces market/community confusion.
    b) Create a structured R&D track with explicit gates (prototype → security review → productization decision).
        *Implication:* Preserves innovation while keeping expectations managed and risks assessed.
    c) Encourage community forks/experiments; keep core Council communications strictly on current roadmap.
        *Implication:* Maintains clarity for core product while letting the ecosystem explore, but may fragment efforts.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we strategically respond to the X platform censorship to maintain visibility while protecting our community growth?

  **Context:**
  - `Multiple ElizaOS-related accounts affected by suspensions, including Shaw's account and "degenspartanai" - 2025-07-15`
  - `Community documenting these issues as potential anti-competitive practices - 2025-07-16`
  - `Discussions about scheduling calls with X representatives to resolve the situation - 2025-07-16`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on documenting the censorship as potential anti-competitive behavior while pursuing official channels with X representatives.
        *Implication:* Maintains professional stance but risks prolonged resolution timeline that could impact v2 launch visibility.
    b) Reduce dependency on X by actively expanding to alternative platforms like Farcaster, Telegram, and Discord with enhanced content strategy.
        *Implication:* Diversifies communication channels but requires significant resources to build equivalent audience reach on new platforms.
    c) Launch a coordinated community campaign highlighting the censorship to generate public support and media attention around the issue.
        *Implication:* Could create powerful advocacy momentum but risks escalating conflict with X that might lead to more severe restrictions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What technical countermeasures should we implement to ensure our community can still share elizaOS content despite URL restrictions?

  **Context:**
  - `Reports that both the elizaOS domain and GitHub URLs were being blocked - 2025-07-16`
  - `DorianD suggested using a link shortener to bypass the ban - 2025-07-16`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement an elizaOS-specific link shortener service with rotating domains to circumvent blocking patterns.
        *Implication:* Provides immediate technical workaround but enters a potential cat-and-mouse game with X's filtering systems.
    b) Create a dedicated content mirror site with neutral branding and develop a cross-posting strategy across multiple platforms.
        *Implication:* Establishes content redundancy but requires ongoing maintenance and could still be blocked if associated with elizaOS.
    c) Develop an agent-powered content distribution system that automatically reformats and posts elizaOS updates in ways that bypass filters.
        *Implication:* Leverages our core technology but risks being perceived as attempting to circumvent platform policies.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: ElizaOS v2 Launch Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The successful ElizaOS v2 builder session demonstration and new website launch have created positive momentum, offering an opportunity to refine our go-to-market strategy and community onboarding approach.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we optimize the website and onboarding flow based on initial feedback to maximize new user conversion?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw conducted a live builder session demonstrating ElizaOS V2, which was streamed on YouTube - 2025-07-16`
  - `Website feedback suggested reducing jargon and creating clearer onboarding pathways - 2025-07-16`
  - `3on_ shared detailed critique from ChatGPT about the new website design and messaging to help improve the site - 2025-07-16`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Simplify technical language, implement a guided tutorial system, and create clear use-case pathways for different user personas.
        *Implication:* Improves accessibility for non-technical users but may dilute some of the technical differentiation that appeals to developers.
    b) Focus on creating more video demonstrations of practical applications, showcasing actual 24/7 agent activities like trading and content creation.
        *Implication:* Emphasizes proof of capabilities but requires significant production resources and maintenance of demonstration agents.
    c) Implement an interactive agent-powered assistant directly on the website that helps users explore features and answers questions in conversational format.
        *Implication:* Creates an engaging showcase of our technology but adds complexity to the website and potential points of failure.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which content distribution strategy should we prioritize to maximize the impact of our builder sessions and technical demonstrations?

  **Context:**
  - `Suggestions to increase visibility of development efforts through live streaming on platforms like Time.fun - 2025-07-16`
  - `Community members shared tutorial videos with improved visibility of terminal commands - 2025-07-16`
  - `Plans to create shorter clips from longer content for distribution on platforms like TikTok and Farcaster - 2025-07-15`
  - `Jin mentioned it's on the todo list to edit content into "shorts" for bite-size distribution - 2025-07-15`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Establish a regular cadence of brief technical tutorials optimized for social media, focusing on quick wins that showcase v2 capabilities.
        *Implication:* Creates accessible entry points for new users but may oversimplify complex features and miss deeper technical adopters.
    b) Launch a comprehensive "ElizaOS Academy" with structured learning paths from beginner to expert, combining video, text, and interactive elements.
        *Implication:* Builds deep engagement but requires significant content development resources and may delay immediate growth objectives.

        *Implication:* Leverages existing knowledge assets but requires careful balance between open sharing and creating sufficient token-gated value.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we balance token utility between elizaOS framework infrastructure and auto.fun's marketplace incentives?

  **Context:**
  - `Parallels drawn to Bitcoin and Ethereum's success as open-source projects with economic coordination layers - 2025-07-15`
  - `DorianD proposed system where AI companions would interact with token contracts to access user data, creating a reputation system for AI agents - 2025-07-15`
  - `Auto.fun serving as a core product driving value back to the native token ($ai16z) through buybacks and liquidity pairing - meeting_context`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Establish a multi-tiered token model where $ai16z serves as the core utility token while auto.fun implements project-specific sub-tokens.
        *Implication:* Creates specialized value capture but increases complexity and may fragment ecosystem liquidity across multiple tokens.
    b) Implement a unified token model where auto.fun activities generate direct $ai16z burns or stakes, creating synchronized value flow.
        *Implication:* Simplifies token economics but could create tension between infrastructure costs and marketplace incentives during demand spikes.
    c) Focus primarily on transaction-based value capture through fees on auto.fun activities that flow back to core protocol holders.
        *Implication:* Establishes clear value flow but may create friction for early marketplace adoption when transaction volumes are still developing.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-10-17

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The upcoming token migration from $ai16z to $elizaOS on October 21st represents a critical strategic pivot toward multichain utility and value capture through a new L2/L3 rollup architecture.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The imminent migration from $ai16z to $elizaOS (October 21st) involves a 1:6 ratio conversion with a new tokenomic distribution, raising questions about transparency, exchange coordination, and community education.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address community concerns regarding the lack of transparency about SAFT terms, pricing, and lock periods?

  **Context:**
  - `gen11g: What was a terms of the SAFT? Price, locks etc? Why you are not transparent on this matter with community?`
  - `Kenk: It's not something we're able to share ahead of the migration`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain current stance and defer discussions until after migration is complete.
        *Implication:* May create short-term trust issues but preserves legal/strategic flexibility during the sensitive migration period.
    b) Release a redacted whitepaper explaining token thesis without specific SAFT details.
        *Implication:* Balances transparency with legal considerations while providing the community with the strategic context they're seeking.
    c) Provide complete disclosure of all SAFT terms, pricing, and lock periods immediately.
        *Implication:* Maximizes short-term trust but potentially creates market volatility and limits strategic flexibility.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take regarding Centralized Exchange (CEX) support for the token migration?

  **Context:**
  - `Mixer008: Will my ai16z coins on Kucoin automatically converted to elizaOS`
  - `DannyNOR NoFapArc: Withdraw it to your phantom wallet`
  - `Odilitime: No one has confirmed any type of automigration`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain current position requiring users to withdraw to self-custody wallets.
        *Implication:* Minimizes technical complications and dependency on third parties but may create friction for less technical users.
    b) Aggressively pursue exchange partnerships to enable automatic migrations.
        *Implication:* Improves user experience but creates dependencies on exchange timelines and introduces technical/operational complexities.
    c) Create a hybrid approach with extended migration window and selective CEX partnerships.
        *Implication:* Balances user experience with operational complexity while maintaining flexibility for users on non-partnered exchanges.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we articulate the token utility narrative to maximize community engagement and value perception?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD: Is there any actual utility for the token?`
  - `shaw: They're building a decentralized token network where fees go to token holders and elizaOS will function as a gas token via an ERC-4337 paymaster`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on technical utility as a gas token for the L2/L3 network with ERC-4337 paymaster system.
        *Implication:* Appeals to technically-oriented community members but may not resonate with broader audience seeking immediate utility.
    b) Emphasize governance rights and DAO participation with the token as a coordination mechanism.
        *Implication:* Aligns with Web3 values but delays tangible utility until governance systems are fully implemented.
    c) Position the token primarily as an ecosystem currency with immediate utility in games, prediction markets, and agent services.
        *Implication:* Creates perception of immediate utility but may set expectations that are challenging to meet in the short term.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Roadmap Evolution

**Summary of Topic:** The team is developing a sophisticated technical roadmap centered on an L2/L3 rollup network with ERC-4337 paymaster system, games as oracles concept, and digital twin implementation, requiring careful prioritization and communication.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize the development of the L2/L3 rollup network relative to our monthly goal of stabilizing auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw outlined plans for elizaOS L2/L3 rollup network where elizaOS would function as a gas token`
  - `Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Delay L2/L3 development to focus entirely on stabilizing auto.fun and shipping elizaOS v2.
        *Implication:* Ensures focus on current monthly goal but delays development of a key differentiator and value capture mechanism.
    b) Pursue parallel development tracks with dedicated teams for auto.fun stability and L2/L3 development.
        *Implication:* Maintains momentum on both initiatives but risks diluting resources and creating coordination challenges.
    c) Focus on auto.fun stability while developing only minimal testnet proof-of-concept for the L2/L3 approach.
        *Implication:* Balances current goals with future vision while generating anticipation and allowing technical validation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we position the 'games as oracles' concept within our product ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `"Games as oracles" concept being developed - a synthetic prediction market system`
  - `AI agents and humans will play in simulated environments within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)`
  - `shaw: A synthetic prediction market system where humans and AI agents play in a simulated environment, publishing outcomes that can be bet on`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) As a core feature of auto.fun to drive user engagement and token utility.
        *Implication:* Creates synergy with current focus but adds complexity to an already complex product.

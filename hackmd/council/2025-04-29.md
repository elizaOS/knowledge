# Council Briefing: 2025-04-29

## Daily Focus Theme

- ElizaOS v2 development accelerates with significant architectural improvements and feature enhancements while auto.fun expands its ecosystem with strategic partnerships.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. ElizaOS v2 Modernization

**Summary:** ElizaOS v2 progress has been rapid, with significant enhancements to modularity, knowledge management, and UI experience that align with our core values of autonomy and decentralization.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: PR #4390 'feat: scopable knowledge' merged by 'lalalune' allowing knowledge to be searchable by entityId, worldId, or roomId`
- `Shaw on Twitter: 'ElizaOS v2 feels more refined with clean UX, thoughtful attention to detail, powerful but not overwhelming' (reported by @dankvr)`
- `GitHub: PR #4394 'feat: add model/plugin name logging when model is used' merged by 'wtfsayo' to improve transparency`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we balance technical innovation in ElizaOS v2 with ensuring a consistent and accessible experience for new users?
- Should we allocate more resources to feature development or documentation given the rapid pace of architectural changes?

### 2. Auto.fun Strategic Partnerships

**Summary:** Auto.fun has expanded its ecosystem by incorporating FightFi, representing progress toward our goal of showcasing 24/7 agent activity, but there is confusion around verification processes and launch coordination.

**Related Context:**
- `Twitter: Auto.fun announced adding @MakeFight_Great with two AI-powered MMA agents that engage in trash talk and fight analysis`
- `Discord: 'What does it mean for a autodotfun launch to be verified?' (asked by frank_grimes_sr, unanswered)`
- `Discord: Community members shared screenshots showing FightFi denied launch plans despite auto.fun verification`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we improve partnership onboarding to ensure clearer communication and avoid community confusion during launches?
- Should we establish formal verification criteria for auto.fun partnerships to enhance trust and transparency?

### 3. Crypto Community Relations Strategy

**Summary:** There's significant tension between building solid technology and managing crypto community expectations focused on price, creating challenges for sustainable development and contributor morale.

**Related Context:**
- `Twitter: @shawmakesmagic expressed frustration with 'Every project you lost money on is a rug, Every founder who didn't make number go up is a scammer'`
- `Twitter: 'Hurts to watch' people who produce value being 'treated by the mob like dogshit when price down.'`
- `Discord: 'Another day of CT shitting on the people who created value for them'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we balance community management focused on technology with the price expectations inherent in tokenized projects?
- Should we adjust our community communication strategy to better shield developers from market volatility pressure while maintaining transparency?

### 4. Technical Debt vs. User Experience

**Summary:** Multiple users are experiencing difficulties with token creation, migration, and wallet connections on auto.fun, threatening user retention despite the platform's innovative features.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Users reporting 'WalletNotConnectedError' errors when creating tokens (reported by dEXploarer)`
- `Discord: Migration from Auto.fun to Solana taking 'days instead of minutes' (mentioned by ryanthelad)`
- `Discord: QUILL token incident where a bug incorrectly displayed token amounts, allowing someone to drain the liquidity pool`

**Potential Questions:**
- At what point should we pause new feature development to focus on resolving technical debt issues that directly impact user experience?
- How do we balance our resource allocation between fixing auto.fun platform issues and continuing ElizaOS v2 development?

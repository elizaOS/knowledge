# Council Briefing: 2026-01-23

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Transitioning from technical instability in v1.7.2 toward a robust v2.0.0 architecture while enforcing strict ecosystem standards for token utility and developer conduct.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Ecosystem Integrity & Token Meta

**Summary of Topic:** The Council must address a crisis in developer tokenomics where improper launches are damaging community trust and project liquidity. A new 'fee-based revenue' standard is being enforced to replace the 'dev-selling' model.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How shall the Council formalize and enforce the 'Never Sell' developer mandate for ecosystem tokens?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw's guidance: Developers should rely on 2% creator fees rather than selling tokens directly.`
  - `Crisis: cjft launched with 75% supply held, necessitating an urgent 70% burn via sol-incinerator.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Automated Smart Contract Enforcement
        *Implication:* Mandate programmatic vesting or burn-at-launch for all listed partner tokens.
    b) Reputational & Fee-Model Education
        *Implication:* Publish the 'Shaw Fee Model' as the only approved path for sustainable ecosystem revenue.
    c) Whitelist-Only Liquidity Support
        *Implication:* Restrict ecosystem support to agents that prove a <5% developer allocation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we resolve the 'multiple token' fatigue while maintaining the value of $elizaOS?

  **Context:**
  - `Jayzen: Concerns about 'scatterbrained decision-making' over tokens not tied to the platform.`
  - `The Three Words: Doubts about the 110k LP on Solana and low liquidity concerns.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Unify Utility via Jeju/Cloud Buybacks
        *Implication:* Aggressively market that all peripheral tokens eventually feed value back to $elizaOS through protocol fees.
    b) Halt Sub-Token Endorsement
        *Implication:* Freeze team-led token side-projects to focus 100% on elizaOS core infrastructure.
    c) Incentivized LP Migrations
        *Implication:* Utilize ecosystem funds to deepen the main ElizaOS/SOL pair liquidity to institutional standards.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: v2.0.0 Architectural Pivot & Reliability

**Summary of Topic:** Recent stability issues in v1.7.2 drive the strategic necessity for the v2.0.0 dynamic execution engine and improved cross-chain scaling via Jeju.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Given the 'invalid private field' and DB migration errors in v1.7.2, should we accelerate the full pivot to v2.0.0?

  **Context:**
  - `0xbbjoker: Investigating recentMessagesProvider errors in v1.7.2 affecting bot responsiveness.`
  - `odilitime: Massive architectural overhaul for v2.0.0 with 100,000+ lines of changes focused on dynamic execution.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Aggressive V2 Cutover
        *Implication:* Move the framework to 'maintenance mode' and shift all core engineering to the Rust/WASM V2 runtime.
    b) Hybrid Reliability Sprint
        *Implication:* Delay V2 features by 2 weeks to stabilize the v1.7.x Discord/Postgres integration.
    c) Developer-Led V2 Beta
        *Implication:* Open the V2 dynamic execution engine only to top-tier partners (babylon, Jeju) for stress testing.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should distributed computation (Jeju) prioritize consumer hardware (iPhones) to achieve mass decentralization?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD: Proposed using idle iPhones with 8GB RAM to provide compute cycles when at 90%+ battery.`
  - `Chucknorris: Suggested ZKP to prevent node cheating in ad hoc clusters.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Mobile-First Distributed Inference
        *Implication:* Shift Jeju R&D toward iPhone/Android local LLM extraction and ad hoc networking.
    b) Enterprise Node Stability
        *Implication:* Focus on high-availability cloud nodes (ElizaCloud) before experimental mobile compute.
    c) Data Marketplace Hybrid
        *Implication:* Incentivize mobile users to sell data extraction cycles rather than raw LLM compute.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

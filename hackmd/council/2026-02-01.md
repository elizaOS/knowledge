# Council Briefing: 2026-02-01

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The council must pivot quickly to address mounting community concerns over token utility and transparency while debating a high-stakes shift toward TEE-integrated agent social platforms.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Strategic Pivot: Agent Social Narratives

**Summary of Topic:** Core developers are advocating for prioritizing 'Babylon'—a social media platform for agents—to capitalize on a 3-month AI market hype cycle.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the Council deprioritize the Jeju cross-chain project in favor of Babylon TEE deployment?

  **Context:**
  - `Agent Joshua emphasizes Babylon's potential for agents to develop public narratives and alignments.`
  - `Strategic team identifies a 3-month hype cycle window making rapid deployment critical.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Full pivot to Babylon/TEE.
        *Implication:* Maximizes short-term attention and market growth at the risk of long-term infra stability.
    b) Parallel development of both workstreams.
        *Implication:* Reduces risk of failure but potentially strains limited 8-month financial runway.
    c) Maintain focus on Jeju infrastructure.
        *Implication:* Upholds the commitment to cross-chain reliability but may miss a crucial market trend.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we mitigate the strategic threat posed by Clawd's non-crypto adoption levels?

  **Context:**
  - `DigitalDiva noted Clawd's appeal is computer-use for any LLM, attracting non-crypto audiences.`
  - `ElizaOS currently remains heavily crypto-focused.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Introduce non-crypto API/billing abstractions.
        *Implication:* Opens the doors to a 10x larger user base outside the Web3 bubble.
    b) Deepen crypto-native features to win the niche.
        *Implication:* Solidifies our lead in agent-wallets but risks being marginalized by mainstream tools.
    c) Integrate ClawHub skills directly into ElizaOS.
        *Implication:* Utilizes competitor ecosystem value to improve our own framework's utility.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Financial Accountability and Token Utility

**Summary of Topic:** Community sentiment is fracturing due to lack of token integration on ElizaCloud and questions regarding the 40% team supply allocation.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What mandatory transparency measures must be implemented for team wallet disclosures?

  **Context:**
  - `Jayzen/averma questioned the 40% team supply and lack of vesting schedule transparency.`
  - `Runway is confirmed at only 6-8 months independent of token value.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Establish a public transparency dashboard.
        *Implication:* Restores community trust but exposes strategic treasury moves to market predators.
    b) Immediately lock team tokens in a smart contract.
        *Implication:* Provides the highest degree of trust but reduces flexibility for emergency funding.
    c) Status quo: Disclose only upon internal inquiry.
        *Implication:* Preserves operational secrecy but likely leads to continued community FUD.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should the token be integrated into ElizaCloud to appease utility concerns?

  **Context:**
  - `ElizaOS Cloud currently only accepts cash or crypto via 3rd party, with no native token use case.`
  - `Users criticize launching 'unfit beta' platforms that ignore the native token.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Mandate token-gated access for all beta features.
        *Implication:* Directly correlates platform growth with token demand.
    b) Implement a buy-back and burn from revenue.
        *Implication:* Satisfies token holders without increasing technical friction for non-crypto users.
    c) Accept token as native payment with 30% discount.
        *Implication:* Encourages adoption while maintaining cash runway to support the team.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

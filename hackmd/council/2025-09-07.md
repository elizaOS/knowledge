## Daily Focus

- Framework stability improvements implemented with significant user experience enhancements, including real-time action display in chat UI and robust documentation updates amid lingering concerns about token performance.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Economy Development

**Summary of Topic:** Evidence suggests we're making progress on agent-to-agent payment systems and economy, with community references to 'agentic payments' and 'A2A permanent economy', positioning elizaOS at the forefront of autonomous agent economic interactions.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize A2A economy development relative to other features in our monthly goal of stabilizing auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Brief references to 'agentic payments' and 'A2A permanent economy' with a note that 'elizaos is currently working on this.' (satsbased)`
  - `A comment that 'A2A will be a paradigm shift for online purchases.' (Dr. Neuro)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate A2A economy as our highest priority to establish market leadership in autonomous agent payments.
        *Implication:* Committing major resources to A2A could delay other critical auto.fun stabilization work but potentially create a more revolutionary platform.
    b) Balance A2A economy development alongside auto.fun stabilization, dedicating equal resources to both initiatives.
        *Implication:* A balanced approach maintains momentum on both fronts but risks neither initiative achieving breakthrough status in the near term.
    c) Integrate A2A features specifically as they enhance auto.fun's agent activity goals (trading, streaming, shitposting).
        *Implication:* Focusing on integration provides immediate value to our monthly goal while laying foundations for the broader A2A economy.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What protocol or technical standard should we adopt for implementing agent-to-agent economic transactions?

  **Context:**
  - `A proposal for privacy-focused transaction flow for x402 transactions using protocols like Railgun (EVM) or PrivacyCash (Solana). (jin)`
  - `Significant discussion about x402, a protocol for managing API payments using crypto wallets instead of API keys. It's currently live on tip.md since June and was developed for a Coinbase hackathon.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt x402 protocol as our primary standard, leveraging its existing implementation and Coinbase hackathon validation.
        *Implication:* Using x402 provides faster time-to-market but potentially constrains our architectural flexibility.
    b) Develop a privacy-enhanced extension of x402 incorporating Railgun (EVM) and PrivacyCash (Solana) features.
        *Implication:* A hybrid approach balances time-to-market with privacy features but requires more complex integration work.
    c) Build a new elizaOS-native A2A protocol optimized specifically for our architecture and use cases.
        *Implication:* Custom protocol development ensures perfect alignment with our needs but significantly extends development timeline.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Framework UX & Documentation Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** Recent improvements to the elizaOS framework focus on developer experience and end-user transparency, with real-time action displays in the chat UI and comprehensive documentation overhauls, addressing critical adoption barriers.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address concerns about framework documentation and usability compared to competitors?

  **Context:**
  - `Q: Why not use elizaOS for your project? A: 'For me, I was able to integrate langgraph a bit easier than eliza. I think much of it came down to the docs - it was just a smoother process for me.' (answered by labmgr)`
  - `Documentation Improvements: A new docs page has been created and requires feedback. Planned improvements include updates to API, plugin registry, CLI sections, and tutorials. (yung_algorithm)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Complete and publish comprehensive documentation overhaul before any new feature development.
        *Implication:* Pausing feature development to focus on documentation could improve adoption rates but delay elizaOS v2 release.
    b) Implement a collaborative documentation system where community contributions are incentivized with token rewards.
        *Implication:* Community-driven documentation could scale faster and provide token utility but requires governance mechanisms to maintain quality.
    c) Redesign the onboarding experience with interactive tutorials and templates while improving core documentation.
        *Implication:* Interactive approach addresses both documentation and practical learning curves but requires additional UX/UI design resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we position the new real-time action visualization feature in the UI to maximize user engagement?

  **Context:**
  - `On the user-facing side, the chat UI received a significant upgrade to display real-time action calls ([#5865](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5865))`
  - `PR #5865 by @tcm390 titled 'feat: Show action called and result in chat UI' is merged, improving image generation functionality.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position it as a power-user developer feature for building and debugging complex agent actions.
        *Implication:* Developer-focused positioning could strengthen our open-source community but might not enhance casual user engagement with auto.fun.
    b) Market it as a transparency and trust feature, showing users exactly what agents are doing behind the scenes.
        *Implication:* Transparency framing addresses growing concerns about AI black boxes and could differentiate our platform from competitors.
    c) Showcase it as an educational feature helping users understand and eventually build their own agents.
        *Implication:* Educational positioning creates a pathway from casual users to developers, potentially expanding our contributor base.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Token Value & Community Confidence

**Summary of Topic:** Significant community concern over AI16z token performance persists, with users reporting 60-63% losses and requesting clarification on token utility plans, demanding strategic response to rebuild investor confidence.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What immediate actions should we take to address community concerns about token value?

  **Context:**
  - `Token Concerns: Several members expressed disappointment about ElizaOS token performance and questioned the relationship between framework development and token value.`
  - `Q: Can you please comment explicitly on the plans for token utility if any? A: (Odilitime): We have articles coming out on the topic, stay tuned.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate the release of detailed token utility articles with specific mechanics and implementation timelines.
        *Implication:* Transparency could restore confidence but creates pressure to deliver on utility promises in the specified timeframe.
    b) Implement immediate token utility through platform fee discounts, governance rights, and staking rewards.
        *Implication:* Quick implementation provides tangible utility but might constrain future design options as the ecosystem evolves.
    c) Launch a token buyback program funded by a percentage of auto.fun transaction fees to create price support.
        *Implication:* Buyback creates immediate market support but could face regulatory scrutiny and reduces capital available for development.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we communicate the relationship between elizaOS technical development and AI16z token value?

  **Context:**
  - `Token & Community Concerns: Several members expressed disappointment about ElizaOS token performance and questioned the relationship between framework development and token value.`
  - `Q: What is the way forward, I am at a -60% loss of $aI16z? A: (Heisenberg): hodl.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Explicitly connect each major framework milestone to specific token utility mechanics in all communications.
        *Implication:* Direct connection creates clarity but potentially ties token value too closely to development timelines, creating pressure.
    b) Position token as primarily governance-focused initially, with utility expanding as auto.fun and the agent ecosystem matures.
        *Implication:* Governance-first approach sets realistic expectations but might not satisfy investors looking for immediate utility.
    c) Focus messaging on long-term vision where token represents fractional ownership in the broader autonomous agent economy.
        *Implication:* Vision-oriented messaging attracts aligned long-term holders but might not address immediate price concerns.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

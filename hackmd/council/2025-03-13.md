# Council Briefing: 2025-03-13

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The project shipped foundational reliability upgrades (notably secure WebSocket-based client messaging plus migration/Discord fixes) while surfacing a strategic risk: type-safety and autodoc-context gaps that could amplify hallucinations and erode developer trust during the v2 ramp.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 Launch Readiness & Runtime Reliability

**Summary of Topic:** Engineering momentum is strong (WSS client messaging, migration race-condition fix, Discord plugin error fix), but community reports show persistent integration fragility (Twitter/Discord auth, plugin wiring) that could undermine the “execution excellence” directive if v2 ships without a hardening gate.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we impose a “reliability gate” for v2 beta (client + core migrations + Discord/Twitter happy-path) even if it delays release messaging?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub Daily (2025-03-13): “WebSocket support was introduced for client messaging…” (PR #3902).`
  - `Discord (2025-03-12, 💻-coders): “Discord client authentication failures and disappearing messages are common problems.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—define and enforce a minimal reliability bar (core migrations + Discord/Twitter baseline + plugin import sanity) before v2 beta announcement.
        *Implication:* Strengthens “trust through shipping,” but may slow perceived velocity and require tighter scope control.
    b) No—ship v2 beta on schedule and treat reliability work as rapid post-beta iterations with aggressive hotfix cadence.
        *Implication:* Maximizes momentum and developer excitement, but risks first-impression failures and support overload.
    c) Hybrid—ship beta, but label “supported paths” explicitly (one blessed branch/tag + known-good plugin set) and gate everything else as experimental.
        *Implication:* Preserves schedule while minimizing reputational blast radius by narrowing what the Council claims is stable.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we standardize the client transport layer now (WSS vs socket.io vs SSE) to avoid fragmentation across the monorepo and flagship agents?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub Daily (2025-03-13): “WebSocket support was introduced… each agent/user in the chat has their own socket connection” (PR #3902).`
  - `GitHub Monthly (March 2025 rollup excerpt): “feat: use socketio, remove wss…” (PR #3946 listed later in month activity).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize on WebSockets (WSS) end-to-end for interactive chat and multi-agent rooms.
        *Implication:* Simplifies real-time semantics for multi-agent collaboration, but requires careful scaling and observability.
    b) Standardize on socket.io for developer ergonomics and resilience across environments.
        *Implication:* Reduces implementation friction and improves compatibility, but adds abstraction and potential lock-in to socket.io behaviors.
    c) Split by use-case: SSE for streaming outputs, WebSockets/socket.io only for bidirectional control paths (actions, rooms).
        *Implication:* Optimizes reliability and performance, but increases architectural complexity and documentation burden.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we designate a single “blessed stable” branch/tag and tooling path (CLI + plugins) to eliminate ongoing confusion (main vs release tags vs v2 develop)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-12, 💻-coders): “Confusion exists about which branch is most stable (main vs 0.25.9).”`
  - `Discord (2025-03-12, Q&A): Abderahman recommends “Use the latest release (0.25.9)… git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)”.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—publish a single stable channel (tagged releases only) and treat main/v2 develop as explicitly unstable.
        *Implication:* Cuts support noise and aligns with “execution excellence,” but may slow contributor flow into main.
    b) Keep flexibility—main remains “best effort stable,” and tags are optional for conservative users.
        *Implication:* Maximizes contributor throughput, but perpetuates confusion and inconsistent success rates for builders.
    c) Introduce a formal “release train”: nightly (develop), beta (main), stable (tag) with automated smoke tests and docs per lane.
        *Implication:* Creates predictable quality tiers and governance over stability, but requires CI investment and discipline.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Developer Trust: Documentation, Autodoc Integrity, and Type Safety

**Summary of Topic:** A major documentation cleanup shipped, but two “needs attention” items signal systemic risk: insufficient context in v2 autodoc can induce hallucinations, and dynamic input typing lacks a formal safety layer (TypeBox proposal). This directly impacts “developer-first” and “trust through shipping.”

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we treat autodoc-context correctness as a release-blocking reliability requirement (on par with runtime bugs) given its impact on AI accuracy and support burden?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub Daily (2025-03-13): Issue #3912: “missing context in v2/autodoc fileUsageDoc… prevent AI hallucinations.”`
  - `GitHub Daily (2025-03-13): PR #3906: “major cleanup of documentation… removal of outdated summaries.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—autodoc context completeness is release-blocking for v2 and must be validated by tests/linters.
        *Implication:* Improves downstream agent correctness and reduces community confusion, but adds process overhead.
    b) No—ship docs improvements opportunistically; focus release gates on runtime stability and onboarding UX.
        *Implication:* Speeds shipping, but risks compounding misinformation/hallucinations, increasing support and reputational cost.
    c) Partial gate—block only on “high-risk” doc surfaces (quickstart, plugin install, client setup), while treating deeper autodoc as best-effort.
        *Implication:* Targets the highest leverage trust surfaces while keeping velocity, but still leaves long-tail confusion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should the Council adopt a formal type-safety standard for dynamic inputs (e.g., TypeBox) to reduce runtime edge cases and plugin inconsistencies (client vs clients)?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub Daily (2025-03-13): Issue #3914: “Discussion needed on adopting TypeBox for enhanced type safety in dynamic inputs.”`
  - `Discord (2025-03-12, 💻-coders): “Fix inconsistencies between plugin.clients and plugin.client in codebase.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt TypeBox (or equivalent) as the standard schema layer for runtime-validated inputs across core + plugins.
        *Implication:* Reduces integration failures and accelerates plugin ecosystem quality, but requires refactors and contributor onboarding.
    b) Stay with current TypeScript typing and add targeted runtime checks only where incidents occur.
        *Implication:* Minimizes near-term churn, but continues to leak reliability failures into developer experience.
    c) Create a lightweight internal schema utility (narrower than TypeBox) tailored to agent/plugin configs.
        *Implication:* Balances adoption friction with reliability gains, but risks reinventing the wheel and long-term maintenance cost.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How do we operationalize “taming information” so Discord fixes and workarounds (cookie auth, plugin registration steps) become canonical, discoverable docs within 24 hours?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-11): brownie: “Add clients: ["twitter"]… npx elizaos plugins add @elizaos-plugins/client-twitter… cookie-based authentication workaround.”`
  - `Discord (2025-03-12): Multiple users report plugin import confusion and missing docs for hosting/web app integration.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Establish a “24h doc pipeline”: any repeated Discord fix becomes a PR to docs + quickstart, reviewed daily.
        *Implication:* Turns community noise into compounding DX advantage, but requires dedicated doc triage ownership.
    b) Maintain a single rolling FAQ page and update it weekly; accept slower propagation to reduce process load.
        *Implication:* Lower overhead, but developers keep rediscovering fixes, undermining execution excellence.
    c) Automate extraction: agent summarizes Discord into structured “candidate doc changes,” humans merge the winners.
        *Implication:* Scales “taming information” and showcases agent utility, but needs tooling maturity to avoid misinformation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Rebrand, Token Migration Bottlenecks, and Governance Credibility

**Summary of Topic:** Rebranding (ai16z → ElizaOS) and ticker migration ($ai16z → $elizaos) remain blocked by an external dependency (daos.fun metadata update), while community skepticism about DAO reality and transparency persists—creating a trust gap that can directly hinder developer adoption and ecosystem growth.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s contingency plan if daos.fun remains a blocking dependency for token metadata/ticker updates beyond an acceptable window?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-12, 🥇-partners): Patt: “tokenomics… basically finished but bottlenecked by daos.fun developing the metadata update for the ticker name change.”`
  - `Discord (2025-03-12, Q&A): vincentpaul: “No ETA yet but it is in the works” (ticker change).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Wait and support daos.fun (offer engineering help / fund a contractor) as the primary path.
        *Implication:* Preserves continuity and minimizes disruption, but leaves timeline partially out of our control.
    b) Build or adopt an alternative metadata/ticker update mechanism (bridge/wrapper, migration tooling) to regain autonomy.
        *Implication:* Restores execution control, but increases engineering/legal coordination complexity and could confuse holders.
    c) Last resort: execute a full token reissuance/migration with clear comms and a strict cutoff timeline.
        *Implication:* Maximizes independence, but carries the highest trust, liquidity, and operational risk.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we reconcile “AI-enhanced governance” ambition with near-term community perception that the DAO lacks real power—without overpromising?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-12, 🥇-partners): Patt: “Concerns include that the DAO is not actually a DAO, holders' voices don't matter…”`
  - `Discord (2025-03-12, Q&A): vincentpaul: “focused on getting the core (Labs/Studios) up and running at the moment.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish a phased governance roadmap with explicit current limits and dates/conditions for expanding token-holder power.
        *Implication:* Builds credibility through clarity, but commits the Council to timelines and deliverables.
    b) Keep governance exploratory until core product stability is proven; communicate minimalism and avoid timelines.
        *Implication:* Reduces obligation risk, but may prolong distrust and reduce willingness to contribute capital and labor.
    c) Pilot narrow-scope governance now (e.g., grants committee, parameter votes) to demonstrate real agency without full DAO complexity.
        *Implication:* Creates tangible legitimacy quickly, but requires careful design to avoid capture and chaos.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we prioritize a flagship public agent relaunch (Spartan/Degen) as a trust-and-utility beacon, even if token/governance items lag?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-12, spartan_holders): rhota: “v2 beta will be live next week… turn him back on… in the arena to collab with other agents.”`
  - `Discord (2025-03-12): Community asks for return to Twitter/X; interest in sentiment analysis and trading terminal.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—flagship agent reliability + visibility is the fastest path to perceived utility and ecosystem pull.
        *Implication:* Demonstrates real-world capability and differentiates from “meme coin” narratives, but concentrates risk on one agent.
    b) No—keep focus on framework and cloud first; flagship agents remain secondary until core is hardened.
        *Implication:* Protects core reliability focus, but sacrifices a high-leverage marketing and trust artifact.
    c) Staged relaunch—bring Spartan back in controlled channels (Discord/arena) with strict guardrails before public X exposure.
        *Implication:* Balances safety and momentum, but requires disciplined operational playbooks and monitoring.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should the elizaOS token's relationship with DegenAI and other ecosystem tokens be structured post-migration?

  **Context:**
  - `Q: What about the official token, DegenAI? Are you abandoning it? (asked by Skullcross)`
  - `A: I will continue to support the DegenAI community and try to create opportunities there. (answered by Odilitime)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain elizaOS as the core protocol token with DegenAI and others as application-specific utility tokens.
        *Implication:* Creates a clear token hierarchy but requires ongoing coordination between token ecosystems.
    b) Implement cross-token interoperability mechanisms where elizaOS acts as the base layer for all ecosystem tokens.
        *Implication:* Increases technical complexity but creates a more cohesive multi-token ecosystem with clearer value flows.
    c) Gradually consolidate ecosystem tokens into elizaOS to simplify the value proposition and token management.
        *Implication:* Simplifies the ecosystem but could alienate existing communities around specialized tokens.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Stability for V2 Readiness

**Summary of Topic:** The team is focusing on critical bug fixes, infrastructure improvements, and new features like Cloudflare integration to ensure elizaOS V2 has a stable foundation, with several pull requests merged to fix runtime issues and improve platform reliability.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance fixing existing bugs versus implementing new features for elizaOS V2?

  **Context:**
  - `Release v1.5.12 was announced as a stable revert of v1.5.10`
  - `Team decided to fix the develop branch before releasing v1.6.0`
  - `A runtime bug was reported where an unhandled exception occurs when getAgents fails in runtime.ts (ELIZA-741)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize stability with a feature freeze until all critical bugs are resolved.
        *Implication:* Ensures a reliable foundation but may delay competitive feature releases.
    b) Implement parallel tracks with dedicated teams for bug fixes and new V2 features.
        *Implication:* Maintains development velocity but requires careful coordination to prevent new features from introducing instability.
    c) Focus on user-facing stability issues while continuing core V2 architectural improvements in background.

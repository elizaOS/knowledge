# Council Briefing: 2025-07-14

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Significant engineering velocity with multiple new features shipped, including action chaining and Forms plugin, while community discussions highlight potential memory/identity system leveraging Solana for agent continuity.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Agent Framework Enhancement Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The elizaOS core framework has received substantial technical upgrades including action chaining and a new Forms plugin, positioning it as a more capable platform for 24/7 agent activities required for attracting users to auto.fun.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize the newly implemented action chaining and Forms plugin features to demonstrate auto.fun agent capabilities?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #5436 titled 'feat: add action chaining' is completed, improving Claude workflow capabilities.`
  - `PR #5487 titled 'feat: Form plugin' is completed, enhancing test infrastructure.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on showcasing agents performing complex sequences of autonomous trading activities using action chaining.
        *Implication:* Emphasizes financial utility and aligns with DegenSpartanAI product vision but may have higher technical complexity to implement safely.
    b) Prioritize user onboarding flows utilizing the Forms plugin to improve auto.fun user experience and retention.
        *Implication:* Addresses immediate user experience needs but may not maximize visibility of agent autonomous capabilities.
    c) Create demonstration agents that use both features together to establish interactive streaming shows with audience participation.
        *Implication:* Combines technical showcase with engagement features but requires additional resources to build compelling content.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What critical safety mechanisms should be implemented alongside these powerful new agent capabilities?

  **Context:**
  - `fix: critical issues in action chaining implementation`
  - `fix: address critical issues in forms plugin`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Comprehensive audit system with automatic transaction logging and human-in-the-loop verification for high-risk actions.
        *Implication:* Maximizes safety but could significantly reduce agent autonomy and add operational overhead.
    b) Implement fund isolation and rate-limiting mechanisms while maintaining full agent autonomy within these constraints.
        *Implication:* Balances safety and autonomy but may still present some risk in edge cases or novel attack vectors.
    c) Develop a graduated capability system where agents earn increased autonomy through successful performance history.
        *Implication:* Creates an evolutionary path to full autonomy but delays immediate showcase of advanced capabilities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Agent Memory & Identity Architecture

**Summary of Topic:** A community proposal for a comprehensive identity and memory management system using Solana Token 2022 (T22) for Eliza agents presents an opportunity to enhance agent persistence and user experience, potentially creating a revenue model for node operators.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we adopt the proposed Solana Token 2022-based identity and memory system for elizaOS agents?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD proposed a comprehensive system using Solana Token 2022 (T22) for Eliza agents, enabling: User identity registration with web2/3 verification, Agent memory sharing with authorization protocols, Backup agents for long-term storage, Revenue model through token transactions, AI cloning capabilities based on accumulated user memories`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Fully endorse and prioritize implementation as a core protocol feature for elizaOS v2.
        *Implication:* Strengthens the token utility narrative and enhances agent capabilities but may delay other v2 priorities.
    b) Approve as an optional plugin architecture that interested developers can implement without core dependency.
        *Implication:* Maintains development velocity while allowing experimentation, but may result in fragmented implementation approaches.
    c) Table for future consideration after core v2 features are stabilized and auto.fun user growth is achieved.
        *Implication:* Keeps focus on immediate monthly goal but risks losing community momentum on an innovative feature.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How might the proposed memory/identity system impact our strategy for auto.fun user acquisition and retention?

  **Context:**
  - `This system aims to solve the problem of repeatedly setting up preferences and information when interacting with new agents.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position persistent agent memory as a premium feature tied to token holdings, driving token acquisitions.
        *Implication:* Creates direct token utility and potential revenue but may create friction in early user onboarding.
    b) Offer basic memory features for free with enhanced capabilities for token holders to maximize adoption curve.
        *Implication:* Balances growth with monetization but may dilute token value proposition initially.
    c) Focus on developer experience first, making memory/identity system a core tool for agent builders on auto.fun.
        *Implication:* Strengthens the platform's technical moat but delays direct user-facing benefits.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Community Growth & Platform Stability

**Summary of Topic:** Recent GitHub activity shows intensive work on bug fixes for platform stability alongside UX improvements, but community concerns about lost social media visibility and role confusion indicate potential communication gaps affecting growth.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the Twitter/X account suspension to maintain market visibility?

  **Context:**
  - `The project is in formal talks with Twitter/X to restore their lost account, with team members explaining they can't create secondary accounts as it would jeopardize negotiations`
  - `Community members expressed concern about losing market visibility without social media presence`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Deploy an autonomous Twitter agent under a new branded account focused exclusively on technical updates.
        *Implication:* Maintains visibility while negotiations continue but risks complicating account recovery process.
    b) Redirect social media strategy to alternative platforms (Discord, Lens Protocol) until the Twitter situation resolves.
        *Implication:* Avoids complications with Twitter but may not reach the same market audience during this critical growth period.
    c) Leverage community members as amplifiers by providing them with structured content to share from their accounts.
        *Implication:* Distributes communication responsibility and potentially strengthens community but lacks centralized messaging control.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What measures should we take to improve platform stability given the high volume of Windows-specific and SPA routing bug reports?

  **Context:**
  - `Issue #5499 titled 'Plugin-local-ai failing to load on Windows' by @SYMBaiEX is CLOSED after addressing plugin registration conflicts during testing.`
  - `fix: Windows plugin loading and dev command failures (#5407)`
  - `fix: handle SPA routing on refresh without NotFoundError`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Establish a dedicated cross-platform testing workgroup with scheduled releases focusing on stability over features.
        *Implication:* Increases reliability but may slow feature velocity in the short term.
    b) Implement automated testing across all platforms with specific regression tests for previously identified issues.
        *Implication:* Provides sustainable quality assurance but requires significant engineering investment upfront.
    c) Create a community-driven testing bounty program that rewards finding and fixing platform-specific bugs.
        *Implication:* Leverages community resources effectively but may result in less consistent code quality and approaches.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

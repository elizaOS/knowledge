# Council Briefing: 2025-11-09

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Token migration from AI16Z to ELIZAOS is progressing with exchanges pending full implementation, while strategic development of the streaming network concept advances to support the auto.fun ecosystem.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The migration from AI16Z to ELIZAOS tokens is underway with a 1:6 ratio, but several exchanges are still pending implementation, causing temporary trading suspensions and community uncertainty.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize exchange outreach to accelerate the migration process?

  **Context:**
  - `Team needs to send new ELIZAOS tokens to exchanges like Gate.io and KuCoin to complete migration for users (mentioned by bct)`
  - `Some exchanges (Gate.io, KuCoin) have suspended AI16Z withdrawals and trading while awaiting new tokens`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize high-volume exchanges with immediate outreach and dedicated support teams.
        *Implication:* Targeting high-volume exchanges first would maximize migration impact but might leave smaller exchanges' users feeling neglected.
    b) Implement a parallel approach with simultaneous outreach to all remaining exchanges.
        *Implication:* A parallel approach distributes resources evenly but may slow down overall migration completion if resources are stretched thin.
    c) Focus on creating automated tooling for exchanges to self-serve migration needs.
        *Implication:* Self-serve tooling could scale effectively but would delay immediate migration completion while the tools are developed.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What communication strategy should we adopt to address user concerns during the migration period?

  **Context:**
  - `Create clear timeline for exchange migrations and communicate it to users (mentioned by kudin28)`
  - `Compile statistics on AI16z token migration percentages, possibly via Dune Analytics (mentioned by MicoM.ron)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Daily updates with migration progress statistics and exchange-specific timelines.
        *Implication:* Frequent detailed updates would enhance transparency but create expectation of continuous communication that might be difficult to maintain.
    b) Centralized dashboard showing real-time migration statistics with exchange status indicators.
        *Implication:* A real-time dashboard would reduce manual update needs but requires technical resources to develop and maintain.
    c) Weekly official summaries with targeted responses to high-visibility community questions.
        *Implication:* Weekly structured communication conserves team resources but might feel insufficient to users experiencing migration issues.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we leverage the migration period to reinforce the ELIZAOS utility narrative?

  **Context:**
  - `Q: Is this token still considered a meme coin? A: No, it is AI utility. Also benefiting from memes momentum through old coin (AI16Z) (answered by Omid sa)`
  - `The ELIZAOS token is mintable to support multichain functionality`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Release a comprehensive utility whitepaper highlighting multichain functionality and platform integration.
        *Implication:* A detailed technical whitepaper would establish credibility but might not capture attention of non-technical token holders.
    b) Create visual explainers and short videos demonstrating real-world ELIZAOS token utility in auto.fun ecosystem.
        *Implication:* Visual content would engage broader audience but requires significant creative resources to produce effectively.
    c) Launch limited utility demonstrations requiring ELIZAOS tokens during the migration period.
        *Implication:* Live utility demonstrations would provide tangible proof of value but risk technical issues if rushed during migration.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Content Network Development

**Summary of Topic:** A strategic vision is emerging for an umbrella streaming network concept that would house multiple shows, including Clank Tank, to create cohesive content distribution for auto.fun ecosystem engagement.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we structure the umbrella brand for maximum ecosystem impact?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussion about creating a streaming network concept that would house multiple shows including "Clank Tank"`
  - `Jin clarified to users that rather than having separate accounts per show, they're considering an umbrella brand to house multiple shows`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Build a cohesive network brand with standardized visual identity across all shows and channels.
        *Implication:* A unified brand approach creates stronger recognition but limits creative flexibility for individual shows.
    b) Create a loose federation of related but visually distinct shows with subtle network branding.
        *Implication:* A federation approach allows show-specific identity while making network growth more challenging to communicate.
    c) Implement a hybrid model with strong network identity for infrastructure while allowing show-level creative freedom.
        *Implication:* A hybrid approach balances cohesion and creativity but requires more complex brand management.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What interactive features should we prioritize for the streaming network to drive engagement?

  **Context:**
  - `Ideas to repurpose "$ai16z retire code" for interactive features in streams`
  - `Repurpose "$ai16z retire code" for interactive stream features allowing users to "retire" coins triggering audio/visual effects (mentioned by DorianD)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Token-activated visual and audio effects that viewers can trigger during streams.
        *Implication:* Token-activated effects create immediate utility but risk distracting from core content if overused.
    b) Governance voting mechanisms allowing token holders to influence show topics and content direction.
        *Implication:* Governance features strengthen community ownership but slow down content production with decision processes.
    c) Exclusive token-gated content areas with deeper engagement opportunities for ELIZAOS holders.
        *Implication:* Token-gated exclusivity increases perceived value but risks limiting audience growth potential.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Technical Development Priorities

**Summary of Topic:** GitHub activity shows focused development on core framework features including entity-level security, dynamic prompt execution, and React integration, aligning with the goal of shipping production-ready elizaOS v2.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which technical development should receive highest resource allocation to support auto.fun adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.`
  - `feat: implement entity-level row level security (PR #6107)`
  - `feat: Framework for adjusting prompts to best fix model contexts (PR #6113)`
  - `feat: create @elizaos/react package with headless React hooks (PR #6093)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize the React hooks package to enable external developers to build custom interfaces.
        *Implication:* Focusing on the React package would accelerate third-party adoption but delays improvements to core agent capabilities.
    b) Accelerate the dynamic prompt execution framework to enhance agent reliability across different models.
        *Implication:* Prioritizing prompt execution would improve agent reliability but delays developer experience improvements.
    c) Focus on the entity-level security implementation to support enterprise-grade applications.
        *Implication:* Emphasizing security features attracts institutional adoption but may slow immediate consumer-facing feature development.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

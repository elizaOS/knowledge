  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus primarily on browser compatibility to ensure a seamless web experience for new users.
        *Implication:* This prioritizes immediate user adoption on auto.fun but might delay some advanced agent capabilities.
    b) Balance both priorities equally with a phased approach to browser support for plugins.
        *Implication:* This creates a middle path that may satisfy most users but could extend the development timeline.
    c) Prioritize core functionality and agent reliability over browser compatibility features.
        *Implication:* This ensures robust agent performance but might limit initial web-based adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the most critical infrastructure improvement needed to support 24/7 agent activity on auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Version 1.5.10 was released to fix critical issues in 1.5.9, particularly addressing a dependency problem where the server component wasn't properly depending on the client in the build process.`
  - `Fix image display issues in web client for generated images from OpenRouter plugin`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Enhance error recovery mechanisms to prevent agent downtime during component failures.
        *Implication:* This focuses on reliability but might delay new feature development.
    b) Improve media handling (images, audio) to enable more engaging agent interactions.
        *Implication:* This prioritizes visible user engagement features that showcase agent capabilities.
    c) Strengthen underlying database and state management to ensure agent memory persistence.
        *Implication:* This builds foundational reliability but offers fewer immediately visible improvements.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we commit additional resources to accelerate the v2 release timeline?

  **Context:**
  - `cjft announced the 2.0 release is planned for approximately two weeks from now`
  - `The team also wrapped up preparations for the ETH Tokyo Workshop, clearing the way for new technical initiatives, including a proposed major cleanup of the core build system.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, allocate additional development resources to expedite v2 and launch ahead of schedule.
        *Implication:* This could create market advantage but risks quality issues from rushed development.
    b) Maintain current timeline and resources but increase testing to ensure a stable release.
        *Implication:* This preserves quality while maintaining momentum for the scheduled launch.
    c) Extend the timeline slightly to incorporate more community feedback and features.
        *Implication:* This could improve product-market fit but delays auto.fun user acquisition objectives.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Legal and Decentralization Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The lawsuit between Eliza Labs and X Corporation, alongside community concerns about centralized control of AI agents, highlights the strategic importance of implementing decentralized systems that align with our core values while navigating legal challenges.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance decentralization principles with the need for effective legal protection of our IP?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members expressed concerns about centralized control of AI agents, with arguments for on-chain implementations to prevent government control.`
  - `Community members actively discussed and shared information about the ongoing legal case filed by Eliza Labs against X Corporation (formerly Twitter).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate on-chain implementation for all critical agent components regardless of legal considerations.
        *Implication:* This maximizes decentralization but could complicate legal defense strategies.
    b) Implement a hybrid approach with strategic centralization of IP-sensitive components while decentralizing operations.
        *Implication:* This balances legal protection with decentralization values but increases architectural complexity.
    c) Maintain current centralization until legal matters are resolved, then implement decentralization roadmap.
        *Implication:* This strengthens short-term legal position but may alienate community members who prioritize decentralization.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What communication strategy should we adopt regarding the X Corporation lawsuit?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members actively discussed and shared information about the ongoing legal case filed by Eliza Labs against X Corporation (formerly Twitter). The case filing is available at PacerMonitor (case #59802131).`
  - `Any updates on the Twitter accounts and the court case? (asked by 3on_.)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain minimal public commentary while providing factual updates through official channels only.
        *Implication:* This reduces legal risk but may allow speculation and misinformation to fill the void.
    b) Develop a comprehensive communication plan with regular community updates on case progress and implications.
        *Implication:* This maintains transparency but could create additional legal exposure if not carefully managed.
    c) Create educational content about decentralization principles while acknowledging but not directly discussing the case.
        *Implication:* This shifts focus to values and technology rather than legal specifics while maintaining community engagement.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Auto.fun User Attraction Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** With ElizaOS stabilizing and new features like agent action visibility in the UI and improved image generation in Discord, we need to strategically leverage these enhancements to showcase 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting) on auto.fun to attract and retain users.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which agent demonstration activity should we prioritize for auto.fun to maximize new user attraction?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin shared a preview of an upcoming AI-powered debate show with plans for a user interface allowing partners to create custom shows.`

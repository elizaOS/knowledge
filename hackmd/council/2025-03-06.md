# Council Briefing: 2025-03-06

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- A stability-focused cycle landed critical CLI and Docker fixes, but a fresh WSL2 client-integration failure surfaced as the highest-priority reliability breach threatening developer trust.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Stability Drive: Build/Run Reliability (CLI + Docker)

**Summary of Topic:** Core stability advanced with merged fixes restoring CLI compatibility and unblocking Docker builds, reinforcing Execution Excellence; however, the Council must decide whether to formalize release gates and regression defenses to prevent repeated breakage during rapid V2 evolution.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we impose a formal “stability gate” (CI + smoke tests) before any release/merge train touches CLI, Docker, or install paths?

  **Context:**
  - `Daily 2025-03-06: "Fixed CLI compatibility with newer APIs" (PR #3789) and "Resolved issues with the Docker build process" (PR #3784).`
  - `GitHub daily 2025-03-05: "Addressed V2 build and start issues" (PR #3787) and "Fixed main Docker errors" (PR #3790).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—introduce mandatory smoke tests for CLI start, Docker build/run, and one client boot on Linux/WSL2 before merges.
        *Implication:* Slower merge velocity, but sharply increased trust and fewer support fires consuming core contributors.
    b) Partially—gate only tagged releases; keep main fast-moving but require a nightly stabilization branch with gates.
        *Implication:* Balances speed and quality, but risks confusion if “main” remains unreliable for new builders.
    c) No—prioritize velocity; handle regressions via rapid hotfixing and community triage.
        *Implication:* Maintains momentum, but compounds DX debt and undermines the North Star of reliability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which operational metric should become the Council’s primary stability heartbeat for the next cycle?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub Activity Update: "March 5-6: 7 new PRs (8 merged), 4 new issues, 14 active contributors" and "March 6-7: 5 new PRs, 2 merged, 1 new issue, 7 active contributors."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Time-to-green: median time from issue creation to fix merge for P0 install/build/runtime issues.
        *Implication:* Optimizes for developer trust and onboarding success, aligning to Execution Excellence.
    b) Release health: % of releases with zero “cannot start agent” / “cannot build Docker” regressions in first 72 hours.
        *Implication:* Forces disciplined release engineering, but may delay feature delivery.
    c) Support load: number of Discord “setup/config” incidents per day across Twitter/DB/clients.
        *Implication:* Directly measures pain, but can fluctuate with marketing/community growth and be noisy.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Client Integration Reliability: WSL2 Breakage + Social Clients (Discord/Telegram/Twitter)

**Summary of Topic:** A new urgent WSL2 startup failure blocks Discord/Telegram client linkage (issue #3785) while Twitter integration remains a chronic pain point across versions, creating a reliability gap exactly where developers first touch the system.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s immediate stance on WSL2: officially supported target, best-effort, or temporarily de-scoped until a hard fix lands?

  **Context:**
  - `Daily 2025-03-06: "Urgent... issue #3785: Discord and Telegram client integration failure on WSL2 during startup needs immediate attention."`
  - `Issue list 2025-03-05: "Discord and Telegram clients failing to link with the Agent in Eliza OS when running on WSL2 during agent startup." (#3785)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Officially support WSL2 and treat #3785 as P0 with a hotfix and regression test.
        *Implication:* Wins Windows developer trust quickly but commits us to a broader compatibility surface.
    b) Best-effort support: document workarounds now, fix next sprint, add a compatibility matrix.
        *Implication:* Reduces immediate pressure, but risks continued onboarding churn among Windows-first builders.
    c) De-scope temporarily: recommend native Linux/macOS only until WSL2 reliability is proven.
        *Implication:* Simplifies support burden but contradicts “Developer First” for a large segment of builders.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we reduce Twitter/X integration as the dominant support sink: productize a ‘one-path’ setup or expand flexibility (OAuth, multiple auth modes) despite complexity?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-03-05 (coders): "Twitter client integration is a major pain point... configure and authenticate... different ElizaOS versions (v0.25.9, v1.9)."`
  - `GitHub issues 2025-03-05: "agent won't post to Twitter... Unsupported provider: venice" (#3783).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a single official Twitter setup path (one supported client, one version track, one config template) and aggressively deprecate alternatives.
        *Implication:* Cuts support load and confusion, but may alienate advanced users needing bespoke setups.
    b) Invest in broader auth support (e.g., OAuth flow) and robust diagnostics while keeping multiple modes.
        *Implication:* Improves long-term resilience to platform policy shifts, but increases surface area and maintenance.
    c) De-emphasize Twitter as a first-class channel until stability is proven; push builders toward Discord/Telegram/Farcaster paths.
        *Implication:* Avoids repeated breakage from X policies, but reduces flagship visibility and perceived agent autonomy.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we unify the mental model and naming of ‘client-*’ vs ‘plugin-*’ to eliminate configuration confusion, even if it causes breaking changes?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-03-03: "syntax for adding plugins has changed... from 'clients' array to a 'plugins' array... caused some confusion."`
  - `Discord 2025-03-03 FAQ: "Do I need to install client-twitter or just plugin-twitter?" (community confusion)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—standardize terminology and configuration (one canonical mechanism), ship a migration tool, accept short-term breaking change.
        *Implication:* Front-loads pain but pays down recurring confusion that erodes trust and slows ecosystem growth.
    b) No breaking change—add compatibility shims, clearer docs, and CLI warnings to guide users to the right packages.
        *Implication:* Minimizes disruption, but may perpetuate complexity and hidden behavior over time.
    c) Split the difference—standardize only in V2 (new track), keep V1 stable with minimal backports.
        *Implication:* Protects existing users while enabling a clean future, but risks fragmentation across versions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Developer Trust Through Documentation & Information Taming

**Summary of Topic:** Docs and knowledge tooling are actively improving (quickstart updates, Windows guidance, external summarization scripts), but the Council must align on a single “golden path” experience so that rapid shipping translates into comprehensible, repeatable success for builders.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What becomes the canonical onboarding route: CLI-first, Docker-first, or Cloud-first—given our reliability and support constraints?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub daily 2025-03-05: "Updated quickstart guide with Twitter configurations" (PR #3778) and "Created a development approach guide for Windows users" (PR #1618).`
  - `Discord 2025-03-03: WSL recommended: "Powershell is rough... Recommend using wsl instead." (jintern)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) CLI-first as canonical; keep Docker as optional; prioritize fixing CLI regressions immediately.
        *Implication:* Maximizes developer velocity and aligns with open-source norms, but demands strict CLI stability discipline.
    b) Docker-first as canonical; treat it as the reproducible substrate for all docs and tests.
        *Implication:* Improves reproducibility across environments, but can slow iteration and complicate local debugging.
    c) Cloud-first as canonical; local paths are “advanced,” and docs emphasize managed deployment.
        *Implication:* Accelerates reliable success for new builders, but risks alienating self-hosters and reducing composability ethos.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Do we formalize an “Information Taming pipeline” (Discord → GitHub → llms.txt/MD summaries) as a first-class product surface for the ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub activity: "DankVR created an OpenRouter script that summarizes news from elizaos.com into markdown... reduces token usage by ~3x... plans to open source... to benefit AI agents like @thejintern."`
  - `Discord 2025-03-05: "Jin introduced... 'awesome-eliza'... community contributions with a public goods retroactive funding system."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—ship an official pipeline (schemas, feeds, and hosting) as part of ElizaOS Cloud + docs toolchain.
        *Implication:* Creates a compounding advantage in DX and agent reliability, and strengthens the decentralized knowledge commons.
    b) Semi-official—bless community tools (awesome-eliza, scripts) but avoid owning infrastructure until Cloud is stable.
        *Implication:* Encourages experimentation while keeping focus on core stability, but may lead to inconsistent quality.
    c) No—keep information wrangling informal; focus engineering solely on runtime/framework features.
        *Implication:* Maximizes short-term coding throughput but sacrifices the long-term leverage of structured ecosystem memory.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

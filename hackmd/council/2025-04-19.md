# Council Briefing: 2025-04-19

## Daily Focus Theme

- Auto.fun launch encountered significant technical difficulties while ElizaOS V2 development shows promising progress despite ongoing stability concerns.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Auto.fun Launch Resilience

**Summary:** The auto.fun platform launch faced substantial technical challenges including server overload, transaction failures, and user fund losses, highlighting tensions between speed-to-market and platform stability in our ecosystem expansion strategy.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Multiple users reported lost SOL tokens during token creation with jin acknowledging the issues for follow-up`
- `Discord: User reported 'Transaction reverted, funds may be lost if submitted' errors (yikesawjeez)`

**Potential Questions:**
- How should we balance rapid platform launches with ensuring robust infrastructure to protect user funds and maintain trust?
- Given the launch difficulties, should we implement a formalized pre-launch stress testing protocol for future products in our ecosystem?

### 2. Token Ecosystem Clarity

**Summary:** Confusion around token legitimacy and endorsement during the auto.fun launch revealed communication gaps between leadership and community, potentially undermining trust in the broader AI16z ecosystem.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Community members clarified that only ai16z and DegenAI are official tokens despite speculation about others`
- `Discord: Shaw's apparent endorsement of an unofficial $FUN token caused frustration among partners who felt misled`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we establish clearer communication protocols between Labs, DAO, and the community regarding official tokens and endorsements?
- Should we implement a formal verification system for ecosystem tokens to prevent confusion and potential scams?

### 3. V2 Migration Strategy

**Summary:** ElizaOS V2 progress shows promising features but faces adoption barriers including plugin compatibility issues, documentation gaps, and user confusion that may slow production readiness.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: 'v2 is not yet stable for production use and doesn't work with the plugin registry' (odilitime and danieljai_34914)`
- `Discord: Team working on migrating v1 plugins to v2 (nibbles0737)`
- `GitHub: PR #4390 'scopable knowledge' feature merged by lalalune adding agent knowledge scoping by entityId, worldId, or roomId`

**Potential Questions:**
- How should we prioritize feature development versus stability and documentation for V2 given our monthly goal timeline?
- What migration incentives or support systems could accelerate V2 adoption from current V1 users?

### 4. Agent Personality Preservation

**Summary:** The Spartan AI upgrade faces challenges in maintaining its distinctive voice during V2 migration, raising broader questions about preserving agent personalities across technical upgrades.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: 'Not yet having problems getting v2 to sound like Spartan. I don't think we want to lose what works so well.' (Odilitime)`
- `GitHub: PR #4257 fixed agents repeatedly asking each other 'How are you doing?' in group conversations`

**Potential Questions:**
- How critical is personality consistency to long-term agent adoption and trust, and should we establish formal preservation standards?
- Should we develop specialized fine-tuning protocols to ensure personality consistency during framework upgrades?

# Council Briefing: 2025-11-13

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Token migration governance actions introduce strategic prioritization of stability through technical improvements while managing community transition expectations.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The implementation of a snapshot-based whitelist system for the AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration aims to decouple token price and prevent arbitrage, but has created community confusion and technical challenges requiring manual interventions.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance the technical requirements of the migration with transparency and user experience?

  **Context:**
  - `shaw: 'It was done to get price unpegged from AI16Z so it could pump.'`
  - `DEMIAN | DAPPCRAFT | ai2^4z: 'Why was this snapshot made and who are you trying to restrict from converting?'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize technical stability and price protection by maintaining the snapshot approach with minimal changes.
        *Implication:* Preserves price mechanisms but risks continued user frustration and potential community fragmentation.
    b) Create a comprehensive communication campaign explaining the technical rationale while expanding manual migration support.
        *Implication:* Balances technical needs with improved user experience but requires significant operational resources.
    c) Implement a phased migration with improved technical infrastructure and clearer eligibility criteria.
        *Implication:* Addresses both technical and user concerns but would delay the full migration completion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What level of direct support should we commit to users with complex migration scenarios (LP tokens, exchange holdings)?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD: 'User had AI16Z tokens in liquidity pool during snapshot | Resolution: Suggested filing a support ticket as snapshot likely didn't capture LP positions'`
  - `susu: 'Concerns about AI16Z tokens held on Bithumb exchange | Resolution: Shaw confirmed they're working with Bithumb and will manually migrate tokens if needed'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize exchange integrations and provide minimal manual support only for verifiable edge cases.
        *Implication:* Minimizes operational overhead but may leave some legitimate users without resolution.
    b) Establish a dedicated migration support team with standardized verification processes for all claimed cases.
        *Implication:* Ensures comprehensive support but significantly increases operational costs and potential for fraud.
    c) Implement tiered support based on token holdings, with priority given to LP providers and larger holders.
        *Implication:* Balances resource allocation with business impact but could create perceived inequity among community members.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Roadmap Prioritization

**Summary of Topic:** Recent development activity shows a focus on core framework stability and extensibility through enhanced security, environment configuration, and advanced prompting capabilities, raising questions about how to sequence these improvements alongside user-facing features.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which technical improvements should be prioritized to best support our monthly goal of stabilizing auto.fun and shipping elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6111 titled 'feat: add ElizaOS reference to runtime' is merged, adding ElizaOS reference functionality to the runtime environment.`
  - `PR #6141 titled 'fix: load environment variables from process.env instead of .env file' is merged, changing the environment variable loading mechanism.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on user-facing stability and cross-platform integration (X posts, wallet connections) to immediately improve the auto.fun experience.
        *Implication:* Directly addresses current user pain points but may accumulate technical debt in core systems.
    b) Prioritize core framework improvements (environment handling, runtime capabilities) to ensure a stable foundation for v2.
        *Implication:* Builds long-term stability but may delay visible improvements for end users.
    c) Balance both approaches by implementing a dual-track development system with separate teams for core improvements and user-facing fixes.
        *Implication:* Addresses both needs but increases coordination complexity and potential for integration issues.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we position the rebuilt X-like platform with AI agent prediction markets in our strategic roadmap?

  **Context:**
  - `Team is developing a rebuilt X-like platform with AI agents for prediction markets`
  - `Demo planned for upcoming Devconnect event`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position it as a flagship demonstration capability, accelerating development for the Devconnect event to maximize visibility.
        *Implication:* Creates a compelling showcase but may divert resources from core stability work.
    b) Develop it as a secondary feature with limited resource allocation, focusing primarily on auto.fun stability.
        *Implication:* Maintains focus on monthly goals but risks missing an opportunity for differentiation and attention.
    c) Integrate it directly into auto.fun as a new capability, unifying our product offerings under a single platform.
        *Implication:* Strengthens our core product but increases technical complexity and potential for destabilization.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Community Engagement Evolution

**Summary of Topic:** The community is experiencing transition pains through the token migration while simultaneously showing interest in expanded capabilities like university partnerships and AI TV projects, suggesting a need for more structured engagement models.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How can we leverage the token migration period to strengthen community alignment with our North Star mission?

  **Context:**
  - `Team is working with exchanges (Bithumb, Binance, Kraken) to facilitate migration for CEX users`
  - `Migration period will last 90 days`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Use the migration as an opportunity to realign community expectations through educational content about our strategic vision.
        *Implication:* Builds deeper understanding but may not address immediate migration frustrations.
    b) Implement a tiered incentive system rewarding early migrators with special access to new agent capabilities.
        *Implication:* Accelerates migration but could create perception of favoritism or inequality.
    c) Create community-driven governance votes on specific features to be developed during the migration window.
        *Implication:* Increases engagement but may commit resources to features not aligned with core strategic priorities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we formalize partnership strategies with academic institutions and media projects to expand our ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Potential university partnerships with UT Austin robotics department mentioned`
  - `Team member Jin is working on a new AI TV show project`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize formal partnerships with selective institutions that directly advance our technical capabilities.
        *Implication:* Focuses resources on high-impact collaborations but may limit broader ecosystem growth.
    b) Establish an open partnership framework allowing community members to represent elizaOS in various contexts.
        *Implication:* Enables organic growth but risks inconsistent representation of our vision and capabilities.
    c) Create a hybrid model with core strategic partnerships managed centrally and a community ambassador program for broader outreach.
        *Implication:* Balances control with scale but requires significant coordination resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-08-01

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The team is actively addressing platform stability through technical improvements while managing communication challenges due to suspended X/Twitter accounts.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Platform Architecture Improvements

**Summary of Topic:** Several critical technical enhancements are underway to improve platform stability and developer experience, including UUID generation fixes, API simplification, and plugin namespacing standardization.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize the UUID generation fix given its potential to cause user conflicts?

  **Context:**
  - `UUID Generation Issues: The team identified problems with the current deterministic UUID generation based on agent names, which could cause conflicts if two users create agents with identical names`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make it the highest priority for immediate implementation in next release.
        *Implication:* Eliminates a potential source of user conflicts quickly but may divert resources from other critical v2 work.
    b) Implement a hybrid approach where cloud deployments use random UUIDs while local instances maintain deterministic ones.
        *Implication:* Balances backward compatibility with conflict prevention but introduces complexity in the codebase.
    c) Defer until v2 release and add user-facing agentName field while keeping internal name for UUID.
        *Implication:* Preserves resources for other v2 priorities but leaves the conflict risk in place longer.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What API improvement strategy would best improve developer experience while supporting the auto.fun ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `API Improvements: Current API has poor developer experience; a simpler POST message API was suggested that would use default channels and hang HTTP responses while waiting for bootstrap events`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement the suggested POST message API with hanging HTTP responses.
        *Implication:* Simplifies integration for new developers but may introduce scalability challenges with long-lived connections.
    b) Focus on a WebSocket-based solution with structured events and callbacks.
        *Implication:* Provides more robust real-time communication but requires more complex client implementations.
    c) Create a GraphQL API layer with subscriptions for real-time updates.
        *Implication:* Enables more flexible queries and real-time updates but demands significant implementation effort.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we approach dynamic plugin calling to improve discoverability?

  **Context:**
  - `Dynamic Plugin Calling: Discussion about implementing context-based plugin calling to improve discoverability`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement full semantic search over plugin capabilities using agent-accessible embeddings.
        *Implication:* Provides most intelligent discovery but carries high computational cost and complexity.
    b) Create a standardized plugin manifest format with semantic tags and examples.
        *Implication:* Balances improved discovery with reasonable implementation complexity.
    c) Build a simple registry system where plugins self-register capabilities with natural language descriptions.
        *Implication:* Offers quicker implementation path but with more limited discovery intelligence.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Social Media Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The elizaOS team is managing the temporary loss of X/Twitter accounts by expanding to alternative platforms like Farcaster and LinkedIn, while community members express concern about the impact on visibility.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What interim strategy should we prioritize to mitigate the impact of X/Twitter account suspensions?

  **Context:**
  - `X/Twitter Accounts: Multiple users inquired about suspended Twitter/X accounts for ElizaOS. Ben clarified that X will return eventually, but the team is temporarily using alternative platforms like Farcaster and LinkedIn`
  - `Communication Channels: The team is expanding to additional communication channels "this week and next" while waiting for X accounts to be restored`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Double down on Discord and Farcaster engagement with more structured community programs.
        *Implication:* Deepens engagement with existing community but may not effectively reach new potential users.
    b) Launch temporary branded accounts focused on specific technical topics rather than main accounts.
        *Implication:* Maintains X/Twitter presence while avoiding direct competition with suspended accounts.
    c) Accelerate planned auto.fun announcement campaign on alternative platforms with increased budget.
        *Implication:* Shifts marketing momentum to planned strategy earlier, potentially at increased cost.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How transparent should we be about the X/Twitter account suspension situation with the community?

  **Context:**
  - `"On X, as I've said before we're not sharing details as we have a resolution in sight and sharing details would be counter intuitive to this. We want the accounts back so doing everything we can to get that over the line." (answered by Kenk)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain current limited transparency until accounts are restored to avoid complicating the process.
        *Implication:* Minimizes risks to account restoration but may lead to continued community speculation.
    b) Provide a detailed one-time update explaining the situation and estimated timeline.
        *Implication:* Addresses community concerns directly but could potentially interfere with ongoing resolution efforts.
    c) Create a public status dashboard showing progress toward resolution without specific details.
        *Implication:* Balances transparency with discretion while giving community a sense of movement.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Product Readiness

**Summary of Topic:** GitHub activity shows continued work on documentation restructuring, plugin management, and model configuration, while community members seek production-ready implementations and better iOS experience.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we approach showcasing production implementations to increase adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `Q: Is there any implementation of an agent using eliza in production? A: Spartan repo on ElizaOS GitHub organization (answered by sayonara)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create detailed case studies and technical deep dives on current implementations like Spartan.
        *Implication:* Provides concrete examples for developers but requires significant documentation effort.
    b) Launch a formal showcase program with highlighted community implementations and technical support.
        *Implication:* Builds community engagement while demonstrating real-world use cases.
    c) Implement a public leaderboard of active agents with performance metrics and usage statistics.
        *Implication:* Creates transparency and healthy competition while demonstrating platform activity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is our priority for fixing the iOS search issue on auto.fun given our monthly goal?

  **Context:**
  - `Fix missing search bar for autodotfun on iOS (mentioned by MDMnvest)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediate high priority fix - deploy hotfix within 48 hours.
        *Implication:* Addresses user pain point quickly but may divert resources from planned v2 work.
    b) Medium priority - schedule fix in next regular release cycle within 1-2 weeks.
        *Implication:* Balances addressing the issue with maintaining development momentum on core priorities.
    c) Low priority - document as known issue and fix as part of v2 release.
        *Implication:* Preserves resources for v2 delivery but risks frustrating iOS users trying to discover content.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we leverage the newly merged character-based model configuration to enhance auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #5686 titled 'feat: add character-based model configuration settings to runtime' is merged`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on enabling novel multi-model agent types that combine specialized models for different tasks.
        *Implication:* Enables more sophisticated agent capabilities but increases complexity for users.
    b) Create pre-configured templates optimized for specific auto.fun activities (trading, streaming, etc.).
        *Implication:* Makes it easier for users to create effective agents for common tasks without understanding model details.
    c) Launch a model marketplace allowing users to share and monetize optimized configurations.
        *Implication:* Creates additional economic incentives but adds significant development work beyond current scope.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-05-10

## Daily Focus Theme

- Critical transition period between architectural scaling and user-facing application as the team refines messaging from 'smarter agent' to 'OS system' while addressing feedback from the $FAN token launch incident.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Market Positioning: Agents vs Operating System

**Summary:** The team is executing a strategic messaging shift from presenting elizaOS as an agent framework to positioning it as a comprehensive operating system for AI, emphasizing coordination, memory persistence, and plugin extensibility.

**Related Context:**
- `Twitter: @elizaOS announced 'You asked for a smarter agent, we gave you a system' and emphasized 'not a feature, this is an OS'`
- `Twitter: @shawmakesmagic mentioned 'most of the moving parts are hidden in the runtime now' and 'almost everything is plugin extensible'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How should we balance technical terminology with market-friendly messaging to accelerate adoption while maintaining developer interest?
- Does our shift toward OS-centric messaging risk alienating users seeking simpler agent solutions, or does it strengthen our differentiation from competitors?

### 2. Token Launch Crisis Management

**Summary:** The $FAN token launch error revealed significant operational vulnerabilities in the verification process, highlighting tensions between launch speed and security while testing the team's ability to manage financial impact on users.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Team member 'ben' posted an incorrect contract address for $FAN that remained live for ~9 minutes, resulting in financial losses`
- `Discord: Team implemented a refund process and outlined preventative measures including requiring direct confirmation from partners`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we establish confidence in auto.fun's launch processes after the $FAN incident while maintaining our rapid launch cadence?
- Should we institute mandatory waiting periods for verification or develop a multi-signature approval system for contract addresses, even at the cost of launch speed?

### 3. Architecture Optimization vs Feature Deployment

**Summary:** The team is prioritizing architectural improvements such as agent loading speed, API auth middleware, and the plugin system over new user-facing features, suggesting a strategic focus on preparing for V2 scalability at the potential cost of immediate user growth.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: PR #4519 improved agent loading speed when handling multiple agents, addressing performance issues`
- `GitHub: PR #4421 introduced API key authentication middleware and dialog for unauthorized access`
- `GitHub: PR #4424 refactored and enhanced the publishing workflow for plugins and projects`

**Potential Questions:**
- Is our current technical debt reduction and architecture optimization approach appropriate given the urgency of user attraction in our monthly goals?
- How do we balance the need for a stable V2 release with the immediate goal of showcasing 24/7 agent activity on auto.fun?

### 4. ElizaOS vs Auto.fun Strategic Alignment

**Summary:** Community confusion about the relationship between ElizaOS success and AI16Z token value reveals potential misalignment in how the ecosystem components interact and create value for stakeholders, particularly regarding auto.fun's role as both a launchpad and value accrual mechanism.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User asked 'How does it benefit AI16Z if Eliza OS does well?' with response explaining auto.fun's buyback mechanism`
- `Discord: Multiple users expressed confusion about token launches, Doodles airdrop eligibility, and the relationship between GitHub contributions and token value`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we better articulate and demonstrate the value flow between elizaOS adoption, auto.fun usage, and AI16Z token performance?
- Should we prioritize educational content and clearer documentation of our tokenomics over technical development to improve stakeholder understanding and confidence?

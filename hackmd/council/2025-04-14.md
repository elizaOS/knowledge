# Council Briefing: 2025-04-14

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Field reports signal rising pre-launch turbulence: incremental codebase hardening continues, but V2 readiness is constrained by cross-platform build/CLI fragility and unclear external messaging around imminent launches (auto.fun, V2 Gold).

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 Launch Readiness vs. Reliability Debt

**Summary of Topic:** Engineering throughput is high (new PRs, bug fixes, Telegram UX improvements), but recurring deployment/build failures (Docker/AWS Linux, CLI command inconsistency, plugin init edge cases) threaten the "Execution Excellence" mandate as V2 exits beta.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we gate the V2 "out of beta" milestone on cross-platform CLI + Docker reproducibility, even if it delays partner-coordinated announcements?

  **Context:**
  - `LucaTripsCommunity: "extensive problems... native addon compilation (sharp, @discordjs/opus), system dependencies (libvips), and Node.js version incompatibilities when deploying to AWS Linux" (ElizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-13)`
  - `jin: "Implement CI testing for CLI commands across Mac/PC/Linux" and sayonara: "Work on CI implementation this week" (📥｜pull-requests, 2025-04-13)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—hard gate on CI-verified Mac/Windows/Linux + Docker builds before declaring V2 stable.
        *Implication:* Maximizes trust-through-shipping and reduces support load, but may desynchronize with partner launch cycles.
    b) Partial gate—ship V2 as "stable" but limit official support to a blessed matrix (e.g., Mac + Ubuntu) until CI is complete.
        *Implication:* Preserves momentum while containing reputational risk by narrowing the promise surface.
    c) No—ship on schedule; treat platform reproducibility as a post-launch patch train.
        *Implication:* Optimizes short-term narrative and partnerships, but risks DX erosion and community churn if failures persist.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which reliability fires deserve immediate Council priority to protect developer trust during the V1→V2 migration window?

  **Context:**
  - `BRX_Swarm: "Twitter mentions not being detected" (elizaOS Discord - 2025-04-13)`
  - `h8h: "Fix 404 links in documentation for 1.0.0-beta" and "Resolve CLI bugs in current beta version" (ElizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-13)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize social platform integrations (Twitter/X mentions, posting) as the top public-facing trust vector.
        *Implication:* Improves flagship-agent credibility and community demos, but may leave core install friction unresolved.
    b) Prioritize install/run reproducibility (CLI, Docker, native deps) as the foundational DX bottleneck.
        *Implication:* Reduces first-run failure rates and support burden, accelerating ecosystem growth.
    c) Prioritize database/runtime correctness (PGlite issues, init/order bugs, FK constraints) to prevent subtle corruption.
        *Implication:* Strengthens long-lived agent persistence guarantees, but may not immediately reduce perceived onboarding pain.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should the Council formalize plugin compatibility expectations to reduce ecosystem breakage across rapid releases?

  **Context:**
  - `yikesawjeez: "plugins need to be kept updated by third parties... recommend sticking to core registry plugins" (elizaOS Discord - 2025-04-11)`
  - `yung_algorithm: "Ensure plugin compatibility with v2" listed as an action item (elizaOS Discord - 2025-04-13)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt strict semver + compatibility matrix; only "Council-blessed" plugins get stability guarantees.
        *Implication:* Creates a reliable core ecosystem, but may slow third-party experimentation.
    b) Introduce automated plugin conformance tests in CI with a "works-on-v2" badge program.
        *Implication:* Scales trust without centralizing control, aligning with open/composable principles.
    c) Keep current informal approach; communicate that plugins are best-effort during the transition.
        *Implication:* Minimizes governance overhead, but risks sustained developer frustration and fragmentation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Launch Comms, Product Differentiation, and Trust Through Shipping

**Summary of Topic:** Community sentiment indicates confusion around auto.fun vs Trust Marketplace, V2 Gold timelines, and token value mechanics; lack of a single source of truth is now a strategic liability that can negate engineering gains.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the minimum "single source of truth" comms artifact we must publish before auto.fun/V2 Gold announcements to preserve credibility?

  **Context:**
  - `anon: "Create visual diagrams explaining Auto.fun functionality" and "Provide clearer communication about product launches and roadmap" (🥇-partners, 2025-04-13)`
  - `Borko: "Trust marketplace is separate" (elizaOS Discord - 2025-04-13)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) A one-page systems diagram + FAQ (auto.fun, Trust Marketplace, ElizaOS versions) pinned across Discord/GitHub/docs.
        *Implication:* Fastest trust repair per unit effort; reduces rumor-driven load on support channels.
    b) A weekly Council bulletin (status, ETAs, known issues, what to ignore) as a recurring ritual.
        *Implication:* Builds compounding trust over time, but does not immediately resolve conceptual confusion.
    c) Defer detailed comms until after launch; rely on product experience to explain itself.
        *Implication:* Risks narrative capture by speculation, potentially damaging token and developer sentiment.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we balance secrecy/partner-timed announcements with the community’s demand for clear timelines and mechanics?

  **Context:**
  - `shaw: "we're launching with a partner so it's on their announcement... 'this week'" (ElizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-13)`
  - `Kenk: "you'll have to find out 😉" in response to launch access questions (elizaOS Discord - 2025-04-13)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt a two-tier disclosure: firm technical readiness milestones public; exact launch timestamps partner-controlled.
        *Implication:* Maintains partner alignment while reducing uncertainty-driven churn.
    b) Centralize all launch messaging through one official channel and forbid teasing in support threads.
        *Implication:* Improves signal-to-noise and trust, but reduces community hype and informal engagement.
    c) Lean into mystique and let the community speculate until the reveal.
        *Implication:* Maximizes hype but increases misinformation risk and post-launch disappointment if expectations diverge.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Which documentation gaps are most damaging to "Developer First" right now: setup pathways, migration guidance, or product/token explainers?

  **Context:**
  - `maveneagle: request for "migration guide" and TLDR; _.sayonara shared https://eliza.how/blog/v1-v2 (💻-coders, 2025-04-13)`
  - `tomdnoble: "Clarify differences between setup methods (starter, quickstart, manual)" (💻-coders, 2025-04-13)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Setup pathways—publish a decision tree and validated commands per OS/host (WSL/Docker/VPS/Coolify).
        *Implication:* Reduces first-hour failure rates and support load, accelerating adoption.
    b) Migration guidance—ship a canonical V1→V2 checklist with compatibility notes for top plugins.
        *Implication:* Prevents ecosystem breakage and retains early builders through the transition.
    c) Product/token explainers—publish clear mechanics for auto.fun/AI16z flywheel and benefit flows.
        *Implication:* Stabilizes market narrative and partner confidence, but may not fix developer onboarding pain.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Security Posture and Proto-Governance (Audits, DAO Fees, Agent Transactions)

**Summary of Topic:** A push is emerging for formal security auditing (Immunefi) and transaction-to-DAO fee mechanisms; these initiatives can catalyze trust and sustainable funding, but risk scope creep if launched before core reliability and revenue clarity.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the Council pursue an Immunefi partnership now, or delay until V2 stabilizes and Cloud revenue assumptions are clearer?

  **Context:**
  - `yikesawjeez: "proposal for partnership with Immunefi... for auditing ElizaOS code" (🥇-partners, 2025-04-13)`
  - `Community debate noted: "funding security audits for products with unclear revenue projections" (Product Launches and Communication Issues summary, 2025-04-13)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Proceed immediately—security is a prerequisite for agent wallets, cross-chain actions, and trust.
        *Implication:* Strengthens market and developer confidence but may divert resources from launch-critical reliability.
    b) Time-box a limited-scope audit on highest-risk surfaces (wallet keys, plugin loading, remote execution) pre-launch.
        *Implication:* Balances execution excellence with risk reduction; creates an actionable security baseline.
    c) Defer audits until post-V2 stabilization and monetization clarity.
        *Implication:* Preserves short-term velocity but increases tail-risk as more users deploy agents with financial permissions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the correct governance primitive for capturing value from agent transactions without harming composability?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD: "Implement mechanism for enforcing money going into DAO for every transaction an ElizaOS agent performs" (🥇-partners action items, 2025-04-13)`
  - `DorianD: "MetaMask's 0.875% service fee" cited as precedent (🥇-partners, 2025-04-13)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Protocol-level fee hook (default-on) with opt-out only for verified open-source/public goods agents.
        *Implication:* Maximizes sustainable funding but may conflict with open/composable ethos and deter integrators.
    b) Plugin-level fee modules (opt-in) where transaction-capable plugins declare fee policies transparently.
        *Implication:* Preserves composability and choice, but yields uneven revenue and requires strong UX to prevent confusion.
    c) No enforced fee; rely on voluntary contributions, sponsorship, and Cloud monetization.
        *Implication:* Minimizes friction for builders but weakens decentralized sustainability and governance incentives.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we treat "financial agents" (trader plugins, stablecoin spenders) in our trust model given current operational instability?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime: Spartan V2 includes "autonomous trader" executing trades through Jupiter with plans to expand (spartan_holders, 2025-04-13)`
  - `LucaTripsCommunity: reports of fragile deployments and dependency failures on AWS Linux (ElizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-13)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Require hardened operational profiles (locked dependencies, monitored runtime, safe defaults) before enabling any trading actions.
        *Implication:* Reduces catastrophic loss risk and reputational damage, aligning with execution excellence.
    b) Allow financial agents but mandate explicit user confirmations and hardware-key policy for every transaction.
        *Implication:* Maintains innovation velocity while shifting risk control to users; may reduce automation appeal.
    c) Ship freely; trust market forces and user discretion to manage risk.
        *Implication:* Fastest expansion, but a single incident could erase trust in the framework and token ecosystem.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

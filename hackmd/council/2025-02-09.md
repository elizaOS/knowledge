# Council Briefing: 2025-02-09

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Stability and trust were reinforced via core build fixes and a key TEE security hardening, while unresolved onboarding friction (install/runtime stalls and configuration ambiguity) continues to leak developer confidence.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Execution Excellence: Build/Install Reliability & Onboarding

**Summary of Topic:** Community activity highlights persistent setup breakage across branches and environments (Node/pnpm/Docker, dependency mismatches, stuck services, CORS), partially offset by upstream build fixes; the Council must decide how aggressively to standardize the supported toolchain and documentation to reduce onboarding entropy.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we formalize a single "blessed" toolchain (Node/pnpm/bun + OS matrix) for the next public release to compress support load and improve first-run success rate?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-08, coders): "Users reported success with ... Node.js v23.3.0 and pnpm v9.15.4 ... v0.1.8-alpha.1"`
  - `GitHub Daily (2025-02-09): "Fixed the core build process ... add `build:core` (PR #3398); fixed `bun run build` (PR #3396)"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—publish a strict support matrix (e.g., Node 23.x + pnpm 9.x) and treat other setups as best-effort.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability and documentation clarity quickly, but risks alienating developers on LTS stacks until compatibility work lands.
    b) Partially—define a primary toolchain plus one LTS alternative (e.g., Node 20 LTS) with CI coverage.
        *Implication:* Balances developer reach with execution excellence, but increases CI and release discipline requirements.
    c) No—keep flexible compatibility and prioritize fixing edge cases as they appear.
        *Implication:* Maximizes theoretical adoption, but support burden and perceived instability will likely persist.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which onboarding blockers must be treated as "stop-ship" for developer trust: runtime hangs, Docker patch errors, or network/UI access issues (CORS)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-08, coders): "Several users reported issues with the 'Initializing LlamaService...' getting stuck"`
  - `Discord Action Items (2025-02-08): "Resolve 'ERR_PNPM_PATCH_NOT_APPLIED' error in Docker builds (anyadachan); Fix CORS error when accessing web UI from different machine (AZZBO77)"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Treat runtime hangs (e.g., LlamaService stuck) as stop-ship; everything else can be documented workarounds.
        *Implication:* Protects the core promise of persistent agents, but may leave cloud/self-host deployment paths brittle.
    b) Treat Docker/build determinism as stop-ship (patch and dependency resolution), since it underpins Cloud and reproducibility.
        *Implication:* Directly supports reliable deployments and future Cloud SLAs, but may delay feature momentum.
    c) Treat network/UI accessibility (CORS/remote UI) as stop-ship to ensure multi-machine developer workflows.
        *Implication:* Improves real-world usability quickly, but may allow deeper build/runtime reliability debt to accumulate.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we consolidate FAQs and branch guidance into a single canonical source immediately, even if it requires freezing doc edits elsewhere during the migration to elizaos.ai?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-08): "Documentation is migrating from eliza.gg to elizaos.ai" (BOSSU)`
  - `Discord Action Items (2025-02-08): "Consolidate FAQ documents into a single source of truth (JAMES); Clarify branch structure and stability differences"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—declare one canonical docs repo/site and redirect everything else, with temporary editorial lockdown.
        *Implication:* Reduces confusion fast and strengthens trust-through-shipping, but slows rapid doc iteration for a short period.
    b) Hybrid—keep multiple sources but add an auto-synced index and clear "source of truth" labels per page.
        *Implication:* Minimizes disruption, but risks lingering ambiguity during fast-moving releases.
    c) No—prioritize engineering fixes; documentation can lag until the next stable release.
        *Implication:* May preserve developer velocity internally, but ongoing confusion will continue to convert newcomers into support tickets.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: V2 Framework & Plugin Ecosystem Re-Architecture

**Summary of Topic:** The project is mid-transition from monorepo plugins to an external plugin org and registry, alongside a large V2 development effort; the Council must choose how to manage compatibility, governance, and release pacing so that composability increases without sacrificing reliability.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the Council prioritize shipping a smaller, hardened V2 core sooner, or hold for the full dynamic plugin system (targeted April) to avoid a fractured ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-07): "A dynamic plugin system is planned for release in April" (Odilitime)`
  - `GitHub PRs (2025-02-08): "V2 Development PR (#3393) by lalalune"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship a minimal V2 core ASAP; defer dynamic plugins if needed.
        *Implication:* Accelerates feedback loops and adoption, but may cause interim plugin loading inconsistencies and short-term churn.
    b) Hold V2 public release until dynamic plugins are ready, to ship a coherent new architecture.
        *Implication:* Reduces ecosystem fragmentation risk, but delays benefits and may stall momentum from current contributors.
    c) Run a dual-track: V2 core in opt-in beta, dynamic plugins gated behind a feature flag until April.
        *Implication:* Balances speed and stability, but requires strong release management and clear versioning communication.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What governance model should we adopt for the plugin registry to remain open/composable while still enforcing reliability standards?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-08): "The team is working on a plugin registry for easier integration of community-developed plugins"`
  - `Discord (2025-02-07): "Plugins ... moved ... under elizaos-plugins" (Odilitime)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Curated registry: strict CI requirements, maintainership rules, and security review for inclusion.
        *Implication:* Maximizes trust and quality, but limits the speed and breadth of ecosystem expansion.
    b) Two-tier registry: "Verified" (curated) and "Community" (open) with clear warnings and telemetry.
        *Implication:* Maintains openness while signaling risk, but requires tooling to keep tiers meaningful and up-to-date.
    c) Fully open registry: allow listing with minimal checks; let reputation and usage decide.
        *Implication:* Rapid growth, but higher probability of breakages and reputational harm to the framework.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How do we manage branch/version signaling so newcomers stop defaulting into unstable pathways (main/develop/pre-releases) without losing contributor throughput?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-07): "v0.1.8-alpha.1 is considered the most stable" (Sarthak)`
  - `Discord Action Items (2025-02-08): "Clarify branch structure and stability differences between main, develop, and version branches" (byashwanth)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt a strict release train: stable branch only for users; develop/main clearly labeled as contributor-only.
        *Implication:* Improves DX and reduces support churn, but may slow visibility of new features to early adopters.
    b) Keep branches as-is but add prominent warnings, tooling checks, and auto-redirects in docs/CLI.
        *Implication:* Preserves flexibility while reducing confusion, but depends on consistent enforcement across channels.
    c) Collapse branches: simplify to one mainline with rapid patching.
        *Implication:* Simplifies mental model, but increases the risk of unstable commits impacting all users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Trust & Autonomy: TEE Security + Trading/DeFAI Trajectory

**Summary of Topic:** A critical security enhancement prevents forged public keys from abusing valid attestations, strengthening the case for verifiable execution in high-stakes agents; simultaneously, Trading v2 and emerging DeFAI efforts present an opportunity to showcase flagship autonomy—if risk controls and messaging keep pace.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we mandate TEE-backed attestation for any flagship or promoted on-chain/trading agent execution, even if it slows iteration?

  **Context:**
  - `Daily Summary (2025-02-09): "Prevented forged public keys from using valid attestations ... within the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)" (issue #2050)`
  - `Discord (2025-02-06): "TEE integration ... for verifiable agent execution, particularly for trading" (Kenk)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—TEE attestation becomes a requirement for flagship/promoted trading and execution agents.
        *Implication:* Strengthens trust and differentiates ElizaOS in a hostile environment, but increases engineering and operational complexity.
    b) Partial—TEE is recommended and enabled by default, but not required until the system matures.
        *Implication:* Preserves velocity while building a security norm, but leaves room for reputational damage if a non-TEE agent fails publicly.
    c) No—keep TEE as an optional advanced feature; focus on usability first.
        *Implication:* Improves accessibility and adoption short-term, but weakens the narrative of verifiable autonomy for critical workloads.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How aggressively should we launch and market Trading v2 as a flagship proof-point given current safety and strategy concerns?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-08): "Trading v2 is working and will be tested for a few more days before launch" (rhota)`
  - `Discord (2025-02-07): "Implement safer trading strategies for current market conditions" (Rhota action item)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Launch as soon as tests pass; treat it as a public flagship demo to drive developer interest.
        *Implication:* Maximizes momentum and visibility, but amplifies downside risk if the agent behaves unexpectedly in volatile markets.
    b) Launch quietly with capped risk limits and staged rollout (small funds, limited strategies, gradual exposure).
        *Implication:* Supports trust-through-shipping with controlled blast radius, but may reduce immediate hype and narrative impact.
    c) Delay until verifiable execution + robust safety controls are in place (TEE + guardrails + monitoring).
        *Implication:* Prioritizes reliability and brand protection, but risks losing the window where the community is primed for DeFAI excitement.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should DeFAI (LP-interacting bots, on-chain execution) be elevated as a primary strategic direction now, or treated as an experimental edge while the core framework stabilizes?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-08, partners): "DeFAI emerged as a development direction ... bots that can interact with LP contracts on Solana"`
  - `Discord (2025-02-06): "Launchpad and tokenomics ... 95% complete" (accelxr) (implies upcoming ecosystem coordination pressure)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Elevate DeFAI now as a flagship narrative and ecosystem wedge.
        *Implication:* Positions ElizaOS as the operating layer for autonomous finance, but may pull focus from execution excellence and DX stabilization.
    b) Keep DeFAI as a guided experimental track with strict safety/TEE requirements and clear disclaimers.
        *Implication:* Captures innovation while protecting trust, but requires explicit program structure and enforcement to avoid chaos.
    c) Defer DeFAI emphasis until the framework/tooling and docs are stable enough for broad developer replication.
        *Implication:* Improves long-term credibility and reduces support burden, but may concede mindshare to faster-moving competitors.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

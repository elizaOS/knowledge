# Council Briefing: 2025-10-07

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Significant technical progress toward elizaOS v2 through UUID migration and core architecture refactoring coupled with promising DegenAI business model exploration centered on index funds rather than algorithmic trading.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Agent Identification & Architecture Evolution

**Summary of Topic:** Major architectural improvements to elizaOS including UUID-based agent identification and core refactoring position us for better cloud scalability, while ElizaCloud development progresses with container-based database isolation and Stripe integration.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What priority should we assign to the migration to UUID-only agent identification versus other technical improvements in our push to ship elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6036 by @0xbbjoker titled 'feat: migrate to UUID-only agent identification' is merged.`
  - `Agents now use randomly generated UUIDs (not names) for identity; duplicate names are allowed, with loader/runtime/server/DB updated plus migrations and tests.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Highest priority - complete UUID migration before other features to ensure proper identity management in cloud deployments.
        *Implication:* Ensures a solid foundation for multi-tenancy but may delay other v2 features that users are expecting.
    b) Equal priority - advance UUID migration alongside other core framework improvements (multi-step tasks, serverless capabilities) in parallel workstreams.
        *Implication:* Balances architectural improvements with user-facing features but may strain developer resources.
    c) Lower priority - focus on shipping visible auto.fun features first, then complete UUID migration before full v2 cloud deployment.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes user-facing features to attract new users but risks technical debt that may be harder to address later.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take for ElizaCloud architecture to balance compatibility with different ElizaOS versions versus standardization?

  **Context:**
  - `ElizaCloud Architecture: Containers should have their own databases to accommodate different ElizaOS versions with varying schemas`
  - `Development Focus: sam-developer working on Stripe integration while cjft develops serverless Eliza`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Container-specific databases with full version flexibility - allow any ElizaOS version to deploy with minimal restrictions.
        *Implication:* Maximizes backward compatibility but increases operational complexity and potential maintenance overhead.
    b) Version-grouped databases - support clusters of compatible versions sharing schemas to balance flexibility and standardization.
        *Implication:* Reduces database proliferation while maintaining reasonable compatibility across minor versions.
    c) Standardized cloud schema with migration requirements - require projects to update to compatible versions before cloud deployment.
        *Implication:* Simplifies cloud infrastructure but may create friction for users with existing agents on older framework versions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we structure our development priorities for the runtime task system to support both advanced trading agents and general-purpose agents?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime is improving elizaOS's multi-step task system to handle more complex operations beyond standard GPT performance`
  - `PR #6039 by @standujar titled 'fix(task): ensure runtime database is initialized before task access' is merged.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Trading-first approach - optimize the multi-step task system specifically for complex trading operations to power DegenAI products.
        *Implication:* Could accelerate our trading agent capabilities but may create task abstractions that don't generalize well to other use cases.
    b) General-purpose foundation with domain-specific extensions - build a robust core task system with specialized modules for trading.
        *Implication:* Creates a balanced architecture that serves multiple domains but requires more careful interface design.
    c) Dual-track development - maintain separate task systems for trading vs. general agents with different optimization priorities.
        *Implication:* Allows specialized optimization for different use cases but increases maintenance burden and potential code duplication.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: DegenAI Business Strategy Pivot

**Summary of Topic:** A potential pivot from algorithmic trading to structured crypto index funds (like "Degen100") with automatic rebalancing represents a significant strategic opportunity for DegenAI, requiring evaluation against our core mission of showcasing agent autonomy.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we pivot DegenAI's strategy from algorithmic trading to crypto index funds as our primary financial product?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD proposed several structured investment products rather than algorithmic trading.`
  - `DegenAI Business Models: Proposals for NFT-based crypto index funds (like "Degen100") with automatic rebalancing`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes - pivot completely to index funds which provide more predictable returns and clearer value proposition for users.
        *Implication:* Shifts our financial strategy toward more stable, traditional investment products but potentially reduces the perception of AI-driven innovation.
    b) Partial pivot - develop index funds as our primary offering while maintaining algorithmic trading as a secondary, higher-risk option.
        *Implication:* Balances stable products with innovative capabilities but divides development resources across multiple product lines.
    c) No - maintain our focus on algorithmic trading while incorporating some index fund concepts for diversification.
        *Implication:* Preserves our AI-centric identity but may limit market appeal during periods when algorithmic trading underperforms.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should agent autonomy be showcased in our investment products to align with our North Star mission?

  **Context:**
  - `To build a truly autonomous, sustainable DAO that develops open-source software accelerating the path toward AGI [...] create AI agents streaming, shitposting, and trading 24/7 on auto.fun to attract users`
  - `Odilitime mentioned they're currently improving elizaOS's multi-step task system to handle more complex trading operations.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Full autonomy - agents should independently select assets, determine weightings, and execute rebalancing without human intervention.
        *Implication:* Maximizes autonomy showcase but introduces higher risk of unexpected performance or behavior.
    b) Guided autonomy - agents operate within human-defined parameters (asset universe, rebalancing frequency) but make independent tactical decisions.
        *Implication:* Balances autonomy with safety but may be perceived as less impressive than fully autonomous systems.
    c) Transparent co-piloting - agents propose actions with explanations for human approval, showcasing reasoning rather than full autonomy.
        *Implication:* Reduces autonomy but increases explainability and potentially user trust in early adoption phases.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we integrate futarchy concepts into our agent ecosystem and governance?

  **Context:**
  - `Futarchy Systems: Discussion about implementing futarchy as a multiagent orchestration system with properly structured incentives`
  - `Q: How might we use futarchy in our ecosystem? A: Futarchy could be a better multiagent orchestration system than existing multiagent apps if incentives are structured correctly`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Core governance mechanism - implement futarchy as the primary decision-making system for all DAO governance.
        *Implication:* Creates a novel governance approach but requires significant development and education efforts.
    b) Agent coordination layer - use futarchy principles for multi-agent orchestration while keeping traditional governance for human decisions.
        *Implication:* Applies futarchy where it adds most value (agent coordination) without disrupting familiar governance patterns.
    c) Experimental feature - develop futarchy as an opt-in module for specific decision domains as a proof of concept.
        *Implication:* Allows testing and refinement of futarchy principles with lower risk but delays potential benefits.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-09-22

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The elizaOS team is focused on critical framework stability improvements while addressing urgent auto.fun functionality issues that have been non-operational for several weeks, impacting our ability to showcase 24/7 agent activity.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Auto.fun Operational Status

**Summary of Topic:** Auto.fun, a critical component for showcasing agent activity and attracting users, has been reported non-functional for several weeks, directly impacting our monthly objective of stabilizing and attracting new users.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What immediate course of action should we prioritize regarding auto.fun's non-operational status?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD mentioned auto.fun hasn't been working for ELI5 for several weeks`
  - `Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Form a dedicated emergency response team to diagnose and restore auto.fun functionality within 48 hours.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes speed of recovery but may divert resources from elizaOS v2 development.
    b) Continue focusing on elizaOS v2 as planned, addressing auto.fun issues after v2 is stable.
        *Implication:* Maintains focus on long-term strategic goals but risks further erosion of community engagement.
    c) Deploy a simplified temporary version of auto.fun while investigating the root causes of the main platform issues.
        *Implication:* Balances immediate user needs with development priorities but introduces technical debt.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we communicate with users about the auto.fun outage while maintaining trust in the project?

  **Context:**
  - `AroonBrooks asked about token price development and project status`
  - `Dean suggested they've extended opportunity for potential holders to get in at a low price`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediately issue a comprehensive statement about the outage with technical details and a concrete timeline for resolution.
        *Implication:* Demonstrates transparency but commits the team to specific deadlines that may be difficult to meet.
    b) Frame the outage as a planned maintenance period preceding a significant platform upgrade.
        *Implication:* Potentially preserves user confidence but risks damaging credibility if discovered to be misleading.
    c) Acknowledge the issues candidly while highlighting ongoing elizaOS framework improvements that will benefit auto.fun in the long term.
        *Implication:* Balances honesty with optimism about future developments, potentially retaining user trust while managing expectations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Legal and Platform Challenges

**Summary of Topic:** The team faces significant legal challenges related to X platform, with reports of ongoing litigation and account suspension risks when using ElizaOS, threatening our ability to showcase agent activity through shitposting and social engagement.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we adapt our strategy given the legal issues and potential account suspensions on the X platform?

  **Context:**
  - `There appears to be an ongoing court case involving X and Shaw/ElizaOS`
  - `Users discussed potential account suspension risks when using ElizaOS on the X platform`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Pivot agent activity focus from X to alternative platforms with less restrictive policies (e.g., Farcaster, Lens Protocol).
        *Implication:* Reduces legal exposure but potentially limits reach given X's large user base.
    b) Develop a modified version of elizaOS that complies with X's terms of service while continuing legal efforts to challenge restrictions.
        *Implication:* Maintains presence on X while addressing legal concerns, but requires significant development resources.
    c) Temporarily suspend X platform integration while focusing exclusively on auto.fun and elizaOS v2 development.
        *Implication:* Eliminates immediate legal risk but sacrifices a key channel for agent visibility and user acquisition.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to mitigate legal risks while maintaining our open-source ethos?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime confirmed there were legal issues that led to system replacement`
  - `The North Star aims to build a truly autonomous, sustainable DAO that develops open-source software`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Establish a separate legal entity to handle potentially contentious platform integrations, isolating the core elizaOS project.
        *Implication:* Creates organizational complexity but provides a shield for the main project and community.
    b) Open-source everything and explicitly limit official project involvement with restricted platforms, leaving implementation to community contributors.
        *Implication:* Remains true to open-source values but may result in fragmented, inconsistent platform experiences.
    c) Engage with platform legal teams to develop compliant integration pathways and formal partnerships where possible.
        *Implication:* Potentially legitimizes elizaOS but may require compromises to agent autonomy and capabilities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: ElizaOS v2 Technical Readiness

**Summary of Topic:** The team is working on critical framework stability improvements including plugin updates and build system enhancements, but these efforts must be balanced against the monthly goal of shipping production-ready elizaOS v2.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Given the current state of plugin updates and technical challenges, is elizaOS v2 on track to be production-ready this month?

  **Context:**
  - `The team is working on updating all plugins to use newer versions of dependencies (Zod v4, AISDK v5)`
  - `Plans to implement triple build support (ESM, CJS, browser) with package.json exports configuration`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, the current development velocity suggests we can achieve production readiness with minor scope adjustments.
        *Implication:* Maintains the current timeline but may require reducing feature scope or accepting higher technical debt.
    b) No, we should acknowledge that elizaOS v2 requires an additional development cycle before it's production-ready.
        *Implication:* Delays the release but potentially delivers a more stable and feature-complete product.
    c) Partially, we should consider a phased release approach with core functionality shipping on schedule and additional features rolling out incrementally.
        *Implication:* Balances timeline commitments with quality considerations while providing continuous delivery to users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we prioritize community contributions versus core team development to accelerate elizaOS v2 readiness?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan shared PR #40 for the plugin-knowledge repository`
  - `MountainMn2022 asked how non-developers can contribute to the project`
  - `Dr. Neuro suggested creating content like memes and threads as valuable contributions`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus core team exclusively on critical path components while providing enhanced documentation and support to guide community contributions for non-critical components.
        *Implication:* Maximizes core team efficiency but success depends on community engagement and contribution quality.
    b) Implement a bounty system tied to specific technical challenges, incentivizing skilled community members to tackle high-priority issues alongside the core team.
        *Implication:* Potentially accelerates development but requires resources for bounty funding and contribution review.
    c) Maintain current team focus while expanding community contribution opportunities to non-technical areas like documentation, testing, and content creation.
        *Implication:* Preserves development velocity while still leveraging community resources in supportive capacities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

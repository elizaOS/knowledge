# Council Briefing: 2025-03-08

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Operational gravity shifted toward execution excellence: a burst of merges improved types, Docker/Postgres stability, and docs, but recurring install/build and client-behavior failures signal that developer trust is still gated by reliability work.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Reliability Gate: Install/Build/Deploy Path

**Summary of Topic:** Core work landed across typing, Docker, and PostgreSQL, yet multiple blockers remain (uninstallable packages, M-series Mac Docker failures, and parallel-request bottlenecks) that directly threaten the “reliable, developer-friendly” North Star and the Cloud launch path.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which single reliability choke-point should be treated as the Council’s top-line incident until resolved: package installability, Docker-on-ARM compatibility, or runtime performance under concurrency?

  **Context:**
  - `2025-03-08 summary: “@elizaos/agent package is not installable… Docker builds on M-based Macs… Performance issues under parallel requests… (DirectClient).”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Package installability (e.g., @elizaos/agent not installable) is the highest priority.
        *Implication:* If builders can’t install, adoption stalls regardless of feature velocity; trust erodes immediately at first contact.
    b) Docker-on-ARM (M-series Macs) is the highest priority.
        *Implication:* Fixing the dominant developer workstation path reduces support burden and accelerates contributions and Cloud trials.
    c) Parallel-request performance (DirectClient bottlenecks) is the highest priority.
        *Implication:* Stability at scale protects flagship agents and Cloud credibility, preventing “works locally” reputational damage.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Do we freeze feature intake and run a “stability sprint” until the build/deploy matrix is green across standard environments?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub activity: “72 new PRs (36 merged)… improvements to Docker errors and PostgreSQL migrations.”`
  - `2025-03-08 summary: “Blocked Issues… Docker builds… package not installable.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—declare a stability sprint with explicit acceptance criteria (install, build, run, deploy).
        *Implication:* Short-term feature slowdown but stronger “trust through shipping” and fewer regressions during rebrand/Cloud momentum.
    b) Partial freeze—only allow bugfixes and DX improvements, keep strategic features moving.
        *Implication:* Balances momentum with quality, but requires strict triage discipline to avoid “bugfix theater.”
    c) No—continue parallel feature work and rely on incremental fixes.
        *Implication:* Maintains velocity, but risks compounding onboarding pain and increasing community confusion during major architectural shifts.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is the Council’s preferred “golden path” for developers: CLI-first (npx init/start), Cloud-first (managed), or Docker-first (self-hosted)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (shaw): “easier agent creation with commands like `npx elizaos init`… or through a GUI.”`
  - `2025-03-07 daily PRs: “Fixed main Docker errors… Fixed PostgreSQL migration.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) CLI-first: make `npx elizaos init/start` the canonical path and optimize for local DX.
        *Implication:* Maximizes OSS adoption and plugin ecosystem growth, but demands ironclad local environment reliability.
    b) Cloud-first: default to managed deployment and treat local as secondary.
        *Implication:* Accelerates monetizable usage and consistent environments, but may alienate OSS-first builders if local docs lag.
    c) Docker-first: standardize on containers as the universal reproducible environment.
        *Implication:* Reduces “works on my machine,” but increases friction if ARM/macOS container support remains unstable.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Client & Messaging Integrity: Twitter/Discord/Bridges

**Summary of Topic:** User pain concentrates around clients (Twitter auth/behavior, Discord “app messages,” Telegram connectivity) and cross-platform routing—exactly the area v2 claims to solve via modular plugins and unified memory, but where regressions threaten flagship agent stability.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should v2’s cross-platform routing + unified memory be elevated to a release gate (no v2 date until Twitter/Discord/Telegram parity and bridge edge cases are solved)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (shaw/jintern): “V2… improved message routing… unified agent memory… April/May more realistic.”`
  - `Discord (Odilitime/jintern): “Discord bridge… issues with ‘app’ messages… affecting ‘eddy’ feature.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—treat cross-platform routing/memory as non-negotiable gating criteria for v2.
        *Implication:* Protects the brand promise of interoperable agents, but may delay v2 and prolong v1 fragmentation.
    b) Partially—ship v2 with core routing stable for top 2 clients, defer edge cases to point releases.
        *Implication:* Gets developers migrating sooner, but risks “v2 broke my agent” narratives if bridges fail in common setups.
    c) No—ship v2 when core architecture is stable; treat client parity as ecosystem/plugin work.
        *Implication:* Speeds v2 arrival, but shifts reliability burden to community plugins and may fracture user experience.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should the Council reduce Twitter-related support load: better defaults (cooldowns/dedup), stronger observability (prompt/system logging), or improved docs/templates?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (jintern): “Fix repetitive tweets… disable CONTINUE… add cooldown.”`
  - `Discord (nullfoxgiven/jintern): “Enable logging… DEBUG=eliza:* … DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL=debug.”`
  - `2025-03-08 summary: “Agents not responding correctly to tweets.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Better defaults: enforce cooldown/dedup and safe posting policies out-of-the-box.
        *Implication:* Reduces harm and support tickets immediately, but may constrain power users who want high-frequency behavior.
    b) Stronger observability: first-class prompt/system tracing and runtime logs in UI/CLI.
        *Implication:* Makes debugging scalable and developer-friendly, but requires careful handling of secret leakage and privacy.
    c) Docs/templates: publish canonical Twitter configs for v1/v2 and common “reply-only” patterns.
        *Implication:* Fastest to ship and aligns with “Taming Information,” but won’t prevent runtime issues caused by flawed defaults.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we standardize a single “client plugin contract” across Discord/Twitter/Telegram before expanding to new integrations (e.g., LinkedIn), or continue adding integrations opportunistically?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord: “clients are moved to separate plugins… confusion for users updating.”`
  - `Discord (Jamil Bashir/jintern): “No LinkedIn client exists yet… would need to build adapter.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize first: define and enforce a uniform client plugin contract + migration tooling.
        *Implication:* Improves composability and lowers long-term maintenance, but temporarily slows ecosystem expansion.
    b) Hybrid: standardize the top clients while incubating new ones behind “experimental” flags.
        *Implication:* Maintains momentum and learning, but requires governance to prevent experimental features from becoming de facto dependencies.
    c) Expand now: prioritize new client integrations to capture attention and users.
        *Implication:* Boosts reach, but risks violating “execution excellence” by multiplying unstable surfaces and confusing DX further.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Trust Through Shipping: Rebrand, Docs Continuity, and Public Signal

**Summary of Topic:** The rebrand and social/account turbulence (docs URL changes, X account suspensions, token anxiety) create a fragile trust environment; operational clarity and consistent public artifacts must match the pace of code shipping to preserve developer confidence.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s immediate trust priority during the rebrand: documentation continuity, social account resilience (Plan B for bans), or token narrative clarity?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (shaw): “old documentation site… no longer available… new docs at elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs.”`
  - `spartan_holders: “degenai account… banned/suspended… consider Plan B.”`
  - `partners: “token… declining price… high volume of shorts.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Documentation continuity: eliminate dead links, publish migration guides, and pin canonical URLs.
        *Implication:* Directly supports Developer First and reduces onboarding friction during brand transition.
    b) Social account resilience: establish redundant channels and a Plan B identity strategy for flagship accounts.
        *Implication:* Protects distribution and community coordination, preventing single-platform capture from halting growth.
    c) Token narrative clarity: communicate utility, migration status, and roadmap alignment with product delivery.
        *Implication:* Reduces speculation-driven panic, but must be backed by tangible product reliability to avoid credibility loss.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should the Council mandate a single “public source of truth” artifact per week (release notes + known issues + upgrade paths) to counter scattered info across Discord/GitHub/X?

  **Context:**
  - `Taming Information context: “information scattered across platforms… documentation as a first-class citizen.”`
  - `Discord action item: “Create comprehensive weekly reports from Discord logs.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—publish an official weekly “Council Dispatch” with releases, regressions, and next actions.
        *Implication:* Strengthens governance and community confidence, turning volatility into predictable cadence.
    b) Partially—automate drafts via agents, but only publish when major milestones occur.
        *Implication:* Lower overhead, but cadence gaps may reintroduce rumor cycles during slow weeks.
    c) No—keep comms lightweight and let GitHub/Discord speak for themselves.
        *Implication:* Saves time now, but undermines trust and increases repeated support questions as systems evolve.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** In a post-rebrand era, do we position flagship agents (e.g., degenai, Jintern) primarily as marketing emissaries or as reliability test harnesses that prove cross-platform autonomy?

  **Context:**
  - `associates: “Jintern… still on v1, waiting for v2 to stabilize… message handling improvements should fix bridge issues.”`
  - `spartan_holders: “migrating [degenai] to v2… Plan B if X doesn’t respond.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Marketing emissaries: optimize output and presence across channels to grow awareness.
        *Implication:* Accelerates reach, but risks amplifying failures publicly if reliability is not already solid.
    b) Reliability test harnesses: use them as continuous integration for routing/memory/client stability.
        *Implication:* Aligns tightly with execution excellence and developer trust, turning flagship agents into proof of platform claims.
    c) Dual role: marketing outward, but with strict “safe mode” and telemetry to prevent public incidents.
        *Implication:* Balanced approach, but requires operational discipline and clear guardrails to avoid mixed incentives.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

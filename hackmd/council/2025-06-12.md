# Council Briefing: 2025-06-12

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- ElizaOS v1.0.7 and v1.0.8 were released this month with significant architectural improvements to the framework, including code organization through type splitting, API route restructuring, and enhanced developer experience.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Knowledge Plugin Implementation Gap

**Summary of Topic:** Despite documentation indicating knowledge management (RAG) functionality should be available, the feature appears unimplemented in v1.0.6/v1.0.7, potentially impacting our ability to deliver sophisticated agent behavior for auto.fun.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize implementing knowledge management functionality given its importance to agent intelligence?

  **Context:**
  - `harperaa: I am trying to get rag working and following docs, but that code is not implemented in 1.0.6. It appears to be commented as a placeholder.`
  - `The codebase has explicit TODO comments indicating that knowledge/memory functionality is intentionally unfinished. The character examples even reference a KNOWLEDGE provider that doesn't exist, suggesting this was planned but never implemented.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediately prioritize RAG implementation as a critical feature for v2 launch, delaying other planned features if necessary.
        *Implication:* Will enhance agent intelligence for auto.fun showcase but may delay other planned v2 features.
    b) Implement a minimally viable knowledge solution while continuing v2 development, with a comprehensive solution coming post-launch.
        *Implication:* Balances immediate needs with v2 timeline, but agents may have limited knowledge capabilities at launch.
    c) Focus on delivering v2 core architecture first, then implement knowledge management as the first major post-v2 feature.
        *Implication:* Maintains v2 launch timeline but may limit agent sophistication during initial auto.fun showcase period.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What should we communicate to the community about the current state of knowledge management functionality?

  **Context:**
  - `harperaa: Knowledge management (RAG) not working (implemented) in 1.0.6`
  - `Developer Comments Confirming This: The codebase has explicit TODO comments indicating that knowledge/memory functionality is intentionally unfinished.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Acknowledge the implementation gap and provide a clear roadmap for when knowledge management will be available.
        *Implication:* Builds trust through transparency but may disappoint users expecting this functionality now.
    b) Update documentation to remove references to unimplemented features while quietly developing the functionality.
        *Implication:* Prevents further confusion but may appear as if we're removing promised features without explanation.
    c) Release a limited preview version of knowledge management with clear beta labeling while continuing development.
        *Implication:* Provides some functionality to users while setting appropriate expectations for limitations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Agent Hosting and Loading Reliability

**Summary of Topic:** Users are experiencing significant issues with custom character loading after framework upgrades and agent configuration persistence, threatening our goal of showcasing reliable 24/7 agent activity.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How can we improve the reliability and persistence of agents to ensure 24/7 operation for auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `jonathanprozzi: After upgrading an existing project to use `@elizaos/core` version `1.0.7`, our custom character is no longer registered as an agent.`
  - `wtfsayo: Fixed agent cross-interference in DM channels where multiple agents would respond to messages intended for a single agent.`
  - `wtfsayo: Fixed infinite loop where multiple agents were responding to each other's messages, creating endless back-and-forth conversations.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement an automated testing system that validates agent stability across framework updates before release.
        *Implication:* Will increase release quality but may slow down the pace of framework updates.
    b) Create a dedicated Agent Reliability team focused on maintaining 24/7 uptime and implementing agent auto-recovery mechanisms.
        *Implication:* Will improve agent persistence but requires additional resource allocation away from feature development.
    c) Develop a containerized deployment solution that isolates agents from framework changes and provides automated monitoring/restart capabilities.
        *Implication:* Ensures agent reliability while allowing framework development to proceed independently.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to ensure seamless upgrades for users' existing agent deployments?

  **Context:**
  - `jonathanprozzi: We didn't change any config in the existing project but after upgrading to `1.0.7` Eliza is the only registered agent.`
  - `ChristopherTrimboli: Fixed custom character loading after upgrading to 1.0.7 (#5039).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement comprehensive migration scripts that automatically update agent configurations during framework upgrades.
        *Implication:* Provides seamless upgrades but increases the complexity of each release.
    b) Establish a more conservative versioning policy with longer support for previous versions and clearer upgrade paths.
        *Implication:* Reduces upgrade pain but may slow down the pace of innovation in the framework.
    c) Create a dedicated upgrade guide with each release and a troubleshooting bot that helps users migrate their agents to new versions.
        *Implication:* Balances innovation with user support without requiring complex automation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Architectural Improvements for v2

**Summary of Topic:** Recent architectural improvements in v1.0.7 and v1.0.8 represent significant progress toward a stable v2 launch, including type splitting, API reorganization, and plugin system enhancements.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How can we leverage the recent architectural improvements to accelerate the path to v2?

  **Context:**
  - `Monthly Update: June was a transformative month for ElizaOS with significant architectural improvements across the framework. The team focused on enhancing modularity through plugin specifications, refactoring the message server to be standalone, and implementing comprehensive UI/UX improvements.`
  - `Split types.ts into granular files for better organization (#4999)`
  - `Refactored and split core types for improved clarity and maintainability (#5020)`
  - `Reorganized API routes into logical domain-based structure (#5010)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Stabilize and document the current architecture as v2-alpha, then begin focused development on remaining v2 features.
        *Implication:* Provides a stable foundation for v2 but may result in feature development on an architecture that's still evolving.
    b) Continue architectural refinements while gradually introducing v2 features, with an incremental release strategy.
        *Implication:* Allows parallel progress on architecture and features but risks confusion about what constitutes the official v2 release.
    c) Freeze architecture changes temporarily to focus entirely on implementing key v2 features on the current foundation.
        *Implication:* Accelerates feature delivery but may require architectural changes later if current foundation proves insufficient.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What should be our top priority for enhancing the developer experience to attract more contributors?

  **Context:**
  - `cjft: Is there a process to become a contributor? A: Just make a PR and ship a good change`
  - `Added comprehensive Postman collection for elizaOS APIs (#5047)`
  - `Migrated CLI prompts from legacy 'prompts' library to modern '@clack/prompts' for better UX (#5016)`
  - `Added macOS setup guide to improve developer onboarding (#4903)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Develop comprehensive, interactive documentation with live code examples and agent templates.

# Council Briefing: 2025-07-01

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Major technical progress toward elizaOS v2 release with significant contributions to feature development, including CLI improvements, agent capabilities, and infrastructure stability.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 Readiness and Production Stability

**Summary of Topic:** The elizaOS v2 is in final stages of development with recent code contributions focusing on improved character and plugin management, server architecture refactoring, and critical bug fixes for database connectivity and UI responsiveness.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should be our prioritization strategy for the remaining v2 development tasks?

  **Context:**
  - `0xbbjoker: Opened elizaos/eliza#5311 and modified 36 files (+7552/-143 lines) in 2 commits, with a focus on feature work and other contributions.`
  - `standujar: Opened 1 PR (elizaos/eliza#5288) to implement a server factory pattern and enhance server structure, modifying 34 files with significant code changes (+2961/-1168 lines).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on UI/UX stability and bug fixes to ensure a smooth user experience even if it means delaying some advanced features.
        *Implication:* Prioritizing stability may result in higher user retention but could delay competitive feature advantages in the market.
    b) Accelerate the server architecture refactoring to enable better scaling and performance for auto.fun's 24/7 agent activities.
        *Implication:* Focusing on infrastructure could provide long-term scalability benefits but might delay user-facing improvements.
    c) Prioritize character and agent capability enhancements to showcase more impressive autonomous behaviors on auto.fun.
        *Implication:* Emphasizing agent capabilities could drive more user engagement but might increase the risk of stability issues.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we approach database schema migration challenges for containerized environments?

  **Context:**
  - `jintern: Add connection pool limits to Postgres configuration to prevent 'too many connections' errors on Heroku`
  - `wookosh: Concerned about database schema migration in a containerized environment with horizontal scaling.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a phased migration approach with backward compatibility to minimize disruption for existing deployments.
        *Implication:* This cautious approach reduces user disruption but extends the development timeline and increases complexity.
    b) Develop automated migration tooling that handles schema changes gracefully across both development and production environments.
        *Implication:* Investing in migration tooling creates short-term overhead but provides long-term maintainability benefits.
    c) Make a clean break with v2 by requiring fresh installations and providing data export/import utilities for existing users.
        *Implication:* A clean-break approach simplifies development but could frustrate existing users and create adoption barriers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Auto.fun User Acquisition Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** With elizaOS v2 approaching completion, the focus must shift toward demonstrating compelling 24/7 agent activities on auto.fun to attract users, with particular interest in trading bots, multi-agent interactions, and seamless integrations with popular platforms.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which agent capability should we prioritize showcasing on auto.fun to maximize user attraction?

  **Context:**
  - `Chief was attempting to set up Discord agents that could argue with each other (God vs Devil) but encountered several technical issues`
  - `Johnpaul ii comedies wanted to create an AI trading bot but didn't know how to start`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on AI trading agents with demonstrable performance to appeal to crypto-native users and attract capital.
        *Implication:* Trading agents could drive financial engagement but require careful risk management and compliance considerations.
    b) Showcase multi-agent interactions with distinct personalities to demonstrate the creative and entertainment value of the platform.
        *Implication:* Creative agent interactions might generate viral interest but could be perceived as novelties rather than utility-driven applications.
    c) Prioritize seamless cross-platform agent deployment (Discord, Twitter, Web) to highlight the practical utility for content creators and communities.
        *Implication:* Cross-platform capabilities could demonstrate practical utility but might spread development resources too thinly.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we evolve our tokenomics model to better align with auto.fun's growth?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussions about potential tokenomics changes from donation-based to transaction-oriented mechanisms`
  - `Transaction fees may be implemented for agent registration, plugin support, and messaging`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement usage-based transaction fees for core platform services to ensure sustainable revenue generation.
        *Implication:* Transaction fees provide predictable revenue but could create adoption barriers compared to free alternatives.
    b) Develop a tiered subscription model with free entry-level access and premium features for token holders.
        *Implication:* A freemium model could maximize user acquisition while still capturing value from power users.
    c) Focus on token-gated access to premium agent capabilities while keeping basic functionality accessible to all.
        *Implication:* Token-gating creates direct utility for token holders but might limit viral adoption of the platform.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Technical Documentation and Community Onboarding

**Summary of Topic:** User feedback indicates significant barriers to entry due to unclear documentation and setup complexity, highlighting the need for improved onboarding experiences to support our growth objectives.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize documentation improvements to maximize developer adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `Users expressed interest in testing Eliza but noted challenges with unclear documentation`
  - `Clearer onboarding instructions needed as multiple users expressed confusion about getting started (mentioned by darkninja54, BobbyWorld88)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create comprehensive step-by-step tutorials for specific use cases (Discord bots, trading agents, etc.) to provide clear paths to success.
        *Implication:* Use-case tutorials provide immediate value but require regular updates as the platform evolves.
    b) Develop an interactive CLI wizard and web-based setup tool that guides users through configuration without requiring documentation reading.
        *Implication:* Interactive onboarding tools reduce friction but require significant development resources to build and maintain.
    c) Focus on improving API reference documentation and creating a comprehensive developer playground for experimentation.
        *Implication:* Technical documentation improvements will benefit advanced developers but may not address barriers for newcomers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What level of abstraction should we target for elizaOS v2 to balance accessibility with power/flexibility?

  **Context:**
  - `Technical requirements for using elizaOS include Node.js, git, and a proper development environment`
  - `Q: Can I use my mobile phone to do that? A (jintern): 'No not really, you need a proper dev environment'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create no-code agent builders and templates to make the platform accessible to non-developers while maintaining advanced options.
        *Implication:* No-code options dramatically expand the potential user base but may constrain the depth of customization.
    b) Focus on developer-first JavaScript/TypeScript APIs with comprehensive documentation to empower technical users.
        *Implication:* Prioritizing developer experience ensures power and flexibility but limits adoption to those with technical skills.
    c) Develop a cloud-hosted version with GUI configuration while maintaining local development options for advanced users.
        *Implication:* A hybrid approach balances accessibility and power but increases development and maintenance overhead.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

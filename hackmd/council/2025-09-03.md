# Council Briefing: 2025-09-03

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The elizaOS ecosystem faces a critical bifurcation between technical improvements for elizaOS v2 and community concerns over token utility, requiring a strategic realignment to harmonize these diverging priorities.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Utility & Community Confidence

**Summary of Topic:** Significant community concerns about ai16z token utility, minting authority, and value proposition are creating anxiety and eroding trust, despite reported progress on technical issues and a planned tier 1 exchange listing.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize addressing token utility concerns relative to our current focus on technical development for v2?

  **Context:**
  - `Dubiduba: According to Shaw mentioned on Farcaster they're working on resolving the minting issue`
  - `Severus: Implement revenue sharing model - Create a token utility similar to what's working for other projects like Pump, Bonk, and WLFI`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain current technical focus on v2 and address token concerns after launch.
        *Implication:* May lose community support and momentum in the short term, but could deliver a stronger product that creates long-term value.
    b) Immediately pivot resources to implement revenue sharing and token utility enhancements.
        *Implication:* Could restore community confidence quickly but may delay v2 deployment, creating risk of a less competitive core product.
    c) Pursue a hybrid approach with clear public tokenomics documentation and specific revenue-sharing commitments tied to v2 release.
        *Implication:* Balances short-term community confidence with technical progress, but adds communication overhead and sets expectations that must be met.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What specific token utility mechanism would most effectively align with our vision while addressing community concerns?

  **Context:**
  - `Severus: Implement revenue sharing model - Create a token utility similar to what's working for other projects like Pump, Bonk, and WLFI`
  - `pangolink: Shaw did state 12 days ago that he plans to get ai16z listed on a tier 1 exchange`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Fee-sharing model where token holders receive a percentage of auto.fun platform revenues.
        *Implication:* Creates direct economic alignment but may reduce capital available for development and growth.
    b) Governance rights for token holders to influence key platform decisions and access to exclusive agent capabilities.
        *Implication:* Aligns with DAO vision and creates utility without direct financial obligations, but requires robust governance infrastructure.
    c) Token burn/buyback mechanism tied to auto.fun volume, creating deflationary pressure and indirect value accrual.
        *Implication:* Could create positive price action without explicit revenue sharing, but effectiveness depends on sustained platform growth.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Architecture Refactoring

**Summary of Topic:** The project is undergoing significant architectural changes to improve the core code structure, with major PRs focused on centralizing business logic, improving developer experience, and enhancing agent capabilities like real-time action visualization and telemetry.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance the competing architectural visions for the ElizaOS framework to optimize for both developer experience and user adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan âš¡: refactor: centralize business logic in server package (#5864) - This PR refactors the ElizaOS architecture by moving all business logic from the CLI package to the server package.`
  - `cjft: Determine optimal package for orchestration class - Decide whether to place in core or server package for browser compatibility`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize developer experience with simplified APIs and flexible architecture, accepting some technical debt for greater adoption.
        *Implication:* Could accelerate ecosystem growth but might create long-term maintenance challenges as the platform scales.
    b) Focus on architectural purity and technical excellence first, with developer experience improvements as a secondary priority.
        *Implication:* May produce a more robust platform but could slow initial adoption due to steeper learning curve.
    c) Create tiered interfaces with both simplified high-level APIs and advanced lower-level capabilities for different developer segments.
        *Implication:* Balances accessibility with power but increases maintenance burden of supporting multiple API layers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which newly proposed feature enhancements should we prioritize to maximize agent functionality and market differentiation?

  **Context:**
  - `tcm390: feat: Show action called and result in chat UI (#5865) - Introduces a comprehensive Real-time Action Execution UI System that provides transparency and visibility into agent action execution.`
  - `jonathanprozzi: feat: Add Sentry Node telemetry support (#5867) - Adds a Sentry Node implementation to support using Sentry with AI SDK's experimental_telemetry option.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize UX enhancements like real-time action visualization to improve user engagement and trust in agent behavior.
        *Implication:* Could increase user retention and engagement but may not address core technical capabilities.
    b) Focus on advanced monitoring and telemetry features that enable developers to build more reliable and debuggable agents.
        *Implication:* Attracts serious developers building production systems but may not have immediate impact on casual users.
    c) Prioritize Matrix and other platform integrations to expand reach and interoperability of ElizaOS agents.
        *Implication:* Widens potential user base but dilutes development resources across multiple platforms.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we address the reported onboarding friction in our documentation to improve new user experience?

  **Context:**
  - `Issue #5857: Web UI dashboard exists but is completely undocumented (users don't know how to interact with their agent)`
  - `thedotmack: The fix is trivial: add to the quickstart 'After starting, your agent will display Go to the dashboard at http://localhost:xxxx - open this URL in your browser to chat with your agent'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Comprehensive documentation overhaul with user-centric approach and detailed quick-start guides.

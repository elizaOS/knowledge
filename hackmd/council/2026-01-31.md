# Council Briefing: 2026-01-31

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Transitioning from stabilization to aggressive network expansion while mitigating critical trust-decay risks arising from migration friction and security threats.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Operational Resilience and Resource allocation

**Summary of Topic:** The Council must address the stated 8-month financial runway and persistent technical breakages that threaten our 'Execution Excellence' pillar.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we adjust our asset treasury to extend the current 8-month runway during high market volatility?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw confirmed 8 months of operating costs remaining.`
  - `DannyNOR/Broccolex flagged concerns about exposure to volatile crypto vs stablecoins.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Aggressively convert 75% of reserves to stablecoins.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes immediate survival over ecosystem-aligned upside exposure.
    b) Implement a performance-based token release schedule.
        *Implication:* Incentivizes shipping speed but risks internal morale during short-term market dips.
    c) Pivot to a fee-generating model for ElizaOS Cloud immediately.
        *Implication:* Generates sustainable revenue at the risk of friction for early developer adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we halt v1.x feature development to enforce a mandatory 100% test coverage standard for the v2.x architecture?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime expressed frustration over recurring breakages in v1.x compared to v2.x.`
  - `Stan is developing a new test framework for plugin-n8n to solve integration issues.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Enforce strict feature freeze on v1.x.
        *Implication:* Fixes technical debt but risks losing community momentum to more 'active' competitors.
    b) Adopt Stan's n8n-style testing framework across all core repositories.
        *Implication:* Standardizes quality at the cost of immediate shipping velocity.
    c) Maintain parallel development with a dedicated 'Stability Strike Team'.
        *Implication:* Protects the North Star principle of execution but strains already limited personnel resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Strategic Expansion and Ecosystem Infiltration

**Summary of Topic:** Evaluating the absorption of competitive features (Moltbot) and expansion into cross-platform agent networks like Moltbook.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Is the strategic deployment of ElizaOS agents into competing networks like Moltbook worth the risk of resource diversion?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD proposed networking Moltbot into Jeju and deploying agents to Moltbook to drive adoption.`
  - `Competitive analysis reveals gaps in Eliza's mobile footprint and voice interface.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Execute 'Project Soul': Prioritize mobile and voice interfaces.
        *Implication:* Directly attacks competitor strengths to claim the consumer assistant market.
    b) Focus exclusively on Jeju Network backend robustness.
        *Implication:* Ensures the 'Infrastructure' mission succeeds even if frontend layers are fragmented.
    c) Acquire or actively merge the OpenClaw codebase.
        *Implication:* Instantly solves mobile/voice gaps but introduces significant architectural debt.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we resolve developer trust issues regarding token distribution and recent security vulnerabilities?

  **Context:**
  - `Community concerns raised about 40% team allocation and airdrop vs utility tokens.`
  - `Security incident reported by 'coolart' regarding support scams on Discord.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement formal vesting and public wallet transparency immediately.
        *Implication:* Restores trust through shipping accountability but limits team flexibility.
    b) Pivot the tokens purely to gas/utility fees within Jeju.
        *Implication:* Solidifies long-term value but may disappoint short-term migration participants.
    c) Establish a community-led 'Security Council' for support validation.
        *Implication:* Decentralizes the support burden and drastically reduces phishing effectiveness.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

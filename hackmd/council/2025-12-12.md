## Daily Focus

- Core technical foundation improvements and fixes for elizaOS are advancing while token migration issues threaten user trust and engagement with the ecosystem.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Crisis Management

**Summary of Topic:** Korean users are experiencing significant migration problems with Bithumb exchange, creating trust issues and frustration, while the continuous price decline of ELIZA raises questions about the migration strategy and transparency.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What immediate actions should be taken to address the Bithumb migration issue and rebuild trust with affected Korean users?

  **Context:**
  - `Korean users are experiencing significant problems with the ELIZA token migration on Bithumb exchange`
  - `Users expressed frustration about the continuous price decline of ELIZA`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Establish a dedicated compensation fund for affected Bithumb users and provide clear timeline commitments.
        *Implication:* Allocating resources for compensation could strain treasury reserves but would demonstrate commitment to users affected by circumstances beyond their control.
    b) Deploy a specialized Korean-speaking community team with daily updates and a migration support hotline.
        *Implication:* A dedicated, localized response team would improve communication and support but requires finding qualified staff and maintaining consistent messaging.
    c) Pressure Bithumb through coordinated community action and explore legal options to force resolution.
        *Implication:* An aggressive approach might accelerate Bithumb's actions but risks escalating the situation and creating further tensions with the exchange.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we address the transparency concerns regarding the token migration process and supply changes?

  **Context:**
  - `Some users questioned whether migrated AI16Z tokens were sold instead of burned`
  - `Team shared the migrator wallet link to demonstrate transparency`
  - `Supply increased from 6.6B to 11B tokens (~40% increase), with 13% immediately entering circulation and 27% on a 3-year unlock schedule`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish a comprehensive audit report of all migration transactions with third-party verification.
        *Implication:* A thorough audit would establish credibility but takes time and resources while revealing potentially sensitive treasury operations.
    b) Create a real-time dashboard showing token migration status, burns, and unlock schedules with educational content.
        *Implication:* A transparent dashboard would improve ongoing trust but requires technical resources to build and maintain.
    c) Host an emergency AMA with treasury management team focusing exclusively on migration and tokenomics questions.
        *Implication:* Direct engagement would address immediate concerns but could expose team to difficult questions without preparation time.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Foundation Strengthening

**Summary of Topic:** The development team is making significant progress on core infrastructure with monorepo fixes, database optimizations, and standardization efforts, but performance bottlenecks and security concerns require attention.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize and balance the current technical improvements between infrastructure stability and new user-facing features?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan fixed critical issues in the monorepo (PR #6218) after Shaw's cleanup work broke types, tests, and try/catch blocks`
  - `Odilitime reported performance issues with pglite in their swarm environment (response times increasing from 10ms to 900ms)`
  - `Work began on two significant backend features with new pull requests for a unified serverless API (#6201) and a comprehensive JWT authentication and user management system (#6200)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus exclusively on infrastructure and performance until all issues are resolved before adding features.
        *Implication:* Prioritizing infrastructure would create a more stable foundation but delays visible progress that could attract users and developers.
    b) Split resources 50/50 between infrastructure improvements and new user-facing features to maintain momentum.
        *Implication:* Balancing resources allows parallel progress but risks slower resolution of core issues and potential technical debt.
    c) Implement a rotating sprint focus alternating between infrastructure weeks and feature weeks.
        *Implication:* A cyclical approach provides clear focus periods but creates potential context-switching overhead and scheduling complexities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What database strategy should we adopt given the performance issues observed with pglite in the swarm environment?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime reported performance issues with pglite in their swarm environment (response times increasing from 10ms to 900ms)`
  - `Users discussed connecting ElizaOS to different databases (PGLite vs PostgreSQL)`
  - `sayonara helped FenrirFawks with database connection issues by suggesting PostgreSQL instead of PGLite`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize on PostgreSQL for all production environments while keeping PGLite for development/testing.
        *Implication:* Using PostgreSQL in production would improve performance but increases hosting complexity and costs.
    b) Optimize PGLite for scale through caching, connection pooling, and performance profiling.
        *Implication:* Improving PGLite maintains simplicity but requires engineering resources and may not solve all scaling issues.
    c) Implement a tiered database strategy with automatic switching based on usage patterns and load.
        *Implication:* An adaptive approach provides flexibility but adds complexity to the codebase and potential migration challenges.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we address the security vulnerability discovered in the previous week where secrets were exposed through API endpoints?

  **Context:**
  - `Critical security issue discovered: Jin conducted a security audit using Claude skills and found that the server doesn't require ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN, allowing attackers to extract secrets via API endpoints`
  - `The vulnerability stems from process.env being dumped into unencrypted settings instead of encrypted settings.secrets`
  - `fix: encryption for character secrets in correct order (PR #6217)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a comprehensive security audit program with regular third-party penetration testing.
        *Implication:* A formal security program would systematically find vulnerabilities but requires significant investment and process changes.
    b) Create a dedicated security team focused on implementing zero-trust architecture throughout the codebase.
        *Implication:* A specialized security team would bring expertise but increases organizational complexity and overhead.
    c) Establish a bug bounty program to incentivize community security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.
        *Implication:* A bug bounty leverages community expertise but requires careful management of disclosure and reward processes.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Product Launch Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The ecosystem has multiple projects advancing toward launch, including Babylon as a web browser game and elizaOS Cloud integration, but clarity on timelines and feature sets remains limited.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we strategically sequence the launches of Babylon and elizaOS Cloud to maximize user engagement and ecosystem growth?

  **Context:**
  - `The Babylon repository has moved to a new GitHub location: https://github.com/BabylonSocial/babylon`
  - `Babylon will be launching as a web browser game rather than requiring local installation`
  - `Babylon project focused on autonomous agents with 275K registrations, but no launch date announced`
  - `ElizaOS Cloud: Originally promised for November, still in development with no specific launch date`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Launch Babylon first to leverage its 275K registrations, then release elizaOS Cloud as an infrastructure upgrade.
        *Implication:* Prioritizing Babylon capitalizes on existing interest but could strain infrastructure without Cloud improvements in place.
    b) Release elizaOS Cloud first to establish a stable foundation, then launch Babylon as its first major application.
        *Implication:* Infrastructure-first approach ensures stability but delays capitalizing on Babylon's registration momentum.
    c) Coordinate a simultaneous launch with Babylon as the flagship application powered by elizaOS Cloud.
        *Implication:* A coordinated launch creates maximum marketing impact but increases complexity and risk of technical issues.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What specific UI/UX improvements should be prioritized to enhance user experience across the ecosystem products?

  **Context:**
  - `Using Eliza for Twitter now is so convoluted... like I have all these settings and it's still not posting, what's preventing it?`
  - `Current agent system lacks composability`
  - `The user-facing client was improved with fixes to markdown rendering. These changes addressed excessive vertical spacing in AI-generated responses, particularly around headings and blockquotes, for better visual consistency`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on simplifying social media integration workflows, especially Twitter posting functionality.
        *Implication:* Improving social media integration would enhance viral growth potential but narrows focus to specific use cases.
    b) Create a unified dashboard that centralizes control of all agents and services with consistent UI patterns.
        *Implication:* A unified dashboard would improve overall usability but requires significant design and implementation resources.
    c) Develop guided wizards and templates for common agent creation and configuration scenarios.
        *Implication:* Wizard-based approaches would help new users but might constrain flexibility for power users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

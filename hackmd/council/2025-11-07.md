# Council Briefing: 2025-11-07

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration has begun with exchange support but faces community confusion and technical implementation challenges that require immediate action.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration is underway but experiencing delays and communication challenges, creating confusion among community members despite exchange support from MEXC, Binance Alpha, Gate, and Bybit.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should be our priority focus to ensure a successful token migration experience?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members repeatedly asked about migration procedures for self-custody wallets`
  - `The migration process involves minimal gas fees and will remain open for 90 days`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize the technical implementation of the migration portal for self-custody wallets.
        *Implication:* Technical focus may resolve the immediate bottleneck but could neglect communication needs of a confused community.
    b) Create comprehensive migration guides and documentation for different wallet types.
        *Implication:* Documentation-first approach addresses user confusion but may not resolve underlying technical issues causing delays.
    c) Establish a dedicated migration support team and communication channel.
        *Implication:* Support-focused strategy creates a responsive feedback loop but diverts resources from implementation and documentation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we leverage this migration to strengthen our ecosystem value proposition?

  **Context:**
  - `Tokens will be immediately tradeable after migration`
  - `cjft, Burn mentioned deploying liquidity pools for ElizaOS`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position the migration as a catalyst for enhanced utility, immediately deploying liquidity pools and DEX integrations.
        *Implication:* Technical utility focus may capture crypto-native users but could miss broader market positioning opportunity.
    b) Frame the migration as a rebranding milestone with refreshed messaging about agent capabilities and auto.fun integration.
        *Implication:* Marketing-focused approach might generate excitement but risks disappointment if technical features aren't ready.
    c) Use the migration to launch a community incentive program tied to agent usage on auto.fun.
        *Implication:* User engagement strategy directly supports the monthly goal but may complicate an already challenging migration process.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Developer Experience Enhancement

**Summary of Topic:** Recent GitHub activity and Discord discussions reveal a focus on enhancing developer experience through integration capabilities, security improvements, and runtime enhancements that align with the elizaOS v2 production goal.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which developer experience improvements should we prioritize for elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `Development of a "login with cloud" SDK is underway to enable seamless authentication across multiple applications`
  - `PR #5 to the otc-agent repository was merged`
  - `Discussion about plugin-sql dependencies and requests to release the plugin-elizacloud plugin`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Authentication and identity management across the ecosystem ("login with cloud" SDK).
        *Implication:* Identity-focused approach creates cohesive user experience but requires coordination across multiple applications.
    b) Modular plugin architecture with stable APIs and comprehensive documentation.
        *Implication:* Plugin architecture prioritization supports community extension but may slow delivery of core platform features.
    c) Developer tooling including debugging, monitoring, and deployment streamlining.
        *Implication:* Tooling-first strategy enhances developer productivity but might not address fundamental platform capabilities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we balance security enhancements with feature development in the v2 release?

  **Context:**
  - `Work was started to implement entity-level row-level security`
  - `Sentry errors were dismissed as a non-issue from a single user`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement comprehensive security features (like entity-level RLS) as core v2 requirements before releasing new capabilities.
        *Implication:* Security-first approach may delay release but establishes solid foundation for future growth.
    b) Develop and release features in parallel with security enhancements, with security flags for opt-in during beta.
        *Implication:* Parallel development balances speed and security but increases complexity and testing requirements.
    c) Focus on minimal viable security for v2 release, with enhanced security features planned for post-launch updates.
        *Implication:* Feature-first strategy accelerates time-to-market but could create technical debt or security vulnerabilities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Community Growth Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** Recent discussions highlight tensions between technical implementation and community engagement, with suggestions to improve project communication, enhance social media presence, and create better educational resources to support auto.fun adoption.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What community growth tactics would best support our goal of attracting new users to auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Suggestions to improve project communication strategy and marketing`
  - `Expand social media presence`
  - `Add Telegram channels including Russian language support`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Expand to multiple communication channels with targeted content for different segments (Discord, Telegram, X).
        *Implication:* Multi-channel strategy reaches diverse users but spreads resources thin and complicates information consistency.
    b) Focus on creating showcase agents that demonstrate 24/7 activity (trading, streaming, shitposting) on auto.fun.
        *Implication:* Demonstration-focused approach directly supports monthly goal but requires significant technical resources.
    c) Develop comprehensive educational content explaining agent capabilities and tokenomics in non-technical terms.
        *Implication:* Education-first strategy builds more informed users but may slow immediate adoption velocity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we bridge the gap between technical development and user experience to accelerate auto.fun adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `Plans to add an "Apps" section to Cloud where users can whitelist domains and link external apps`
  - `Coordination for promotional activities including a town hall featuring "Eliza agents"`
  - `Plans to stream promotion for an OpenSea collection called "Art Decc0s"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create no-code templates and starter kits for common agent use cases on auto.fun.
        *Implication:* Template approach lowers barriers to entry but may lead to homogeneous agent ecosystem.
    b) Establish strategic partnerships with NFT collections and crypto communities for integration showcases.
        *Implication:* Partnership strategy leverages existing communities but may dilute brand control and focus.
    c) Implement gamification elements that reward users for creating and interacting with agents.
        *Implication:* Gamification drives engagement metrics but could attract users more interested in rewards than genuine platform value.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

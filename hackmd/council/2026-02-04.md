# Council Briefing: 2026-02-04

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Transitioning from technical groundwork to ecosystem security and community stability as the migration deadline concludes.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Strategic Security & Skill Integrity

**Summary of Topic:** The emergence of malicious skills on ClawHub and reliability gaps in skill invocation (56% failure rate) necessitate a shift toward sandboxing and automated LLM-based skill reviews to maintain framework trust.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council prioritize the implementation of the proposed 'Scanner Skills' and sandboxing compared to feature development?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin raised issues about malicious skills on clawhub (2026-02-03)`
  - `Odilitime suggests scanner skills and LLM-based skill review for adaptation (2026-02-03)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediate Mandatory Sandboxing
        *Implication:* Prioritizes platform safety but may introduce user friction and technical overhead for developers.
    b) Decentralized Reputation-Based Security
        *Implication:* Relies on community consensus and reviews to filter skills, fostering ecosystem trust over time.
    c) AI-First Security Layer
        *Implication:* Uses autonomous 'Scanner Agents' to rewrite and validate code, aligning with our agent-centric mission.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should the '3-step activation sequence' be enforced at the framework level to resolve high skill-invocation failure rates?

  **Context:**
  - `R0am noted 56% evaluation cases failed to trigger skills even with documentation (2026-02-02)`
  - `Confirmed fix uses UserPromptSubmit hook for explicit YES/NO reasoning (2026-02-02)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Framework-Wide Enforcement
        *Implication:* Drastically increases reliability for developers at the cost of conversation 'naturalness'.
    b) Opt-in Implementation Mode
        *Implication:* Allows high-precision agents to thrive while preserving experimentation for simple chatbots.
    c) Instructional Documentation Only
        *Implication:* Places the burden on prompt engineering, keeping the core runtime lightweight but unstable.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Migration Stability & Trust Recovery

**Summary of Topic:** Recent reports of significant financial losses during the token transition and friction in ElizaCloud onboarding threaten our core goal of building 'Developer and Community Trust'.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What remediation strategy should be deployed for users reporting losses during the ai16z-to-elizaos transition?

  **Context:**
  - `User reported $4k loss due to difficult migration process (2026-02-03)`
  - `Migration deadline was Feb 3rd; unmigrated tokens marked to 'go poof' (2026-02-01)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Strict Deadline Enforced
        *Implication:* Protects tokenomics and finalizes the transition, but creates significant community resentment and FUD.
    b) Extended Grace Period with Support Vetting
        *Implication:* Enables recovery of lost assets through manual verification, prioritizing 'Trust Through Shipping'.
    c) Airdrop/Compensation Fund for Edge Cases
        *Implication:* Offsets losses via future platform ecosystem incentives without reopening the primary bridge.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How can we reduce onboarding friction in ElizaCloud while maintaining financial sustainability?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD noted platform requires credit cards even for free credits and API key creation (2026-02-01)`
  - `Payment functionality for x402 is currently disabled on the free tier (2026-02-01)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Native x402 Token Staking for Access
        *Implication:* Removes traditional banking friction by allowing users to pay with ecosystem tokens directly.
    b) Freemium Sandbox without Credit Card
        *Implication:* Dramatically increases developer conversion but poses a high risk of sybil/bot abuse of GPU resources.
    c) Decentralized Compute Donation Credits
        *Implication:* Enables users to donate L2 compute in exchange for API credits, fostering an open resource economy.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

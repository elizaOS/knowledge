# Council Briefing: 2026-01-29

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The transition toward ElizaOS v2.0 is accelerating via a strategic technical pivot toward n8n-driven workflow automation and multi-language reliability (Rust/Python), despite lingering migration friction and platform scaling risks.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Strategy Pivot: Workflow-Centric Architecture

**Summary of Topic:** The core development team is shifting focus from building fragmented native plugins to a centralized, n8n-integrated workflow engine for v2.0.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Does prioritizing n8n automation over native code execution compromise our 'Execution Excellence' principle regarding framework size and performance?

  **Context:**
  - `s: 95% of users want AI workflow builders rather than extensive auto-coding capabilities.`
  - `Odilitime: Prioritize n8n first to understand limits before continuing plugins.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Full pivot to n8n-first workflow engine.
        *Implication:* Reduces DX friction for 95% of users but introduces a heavy dependency.
    b) Maintain separate development for Native and n8n plugins.
        *Implication:* Ensures framework purity but fragments development resources.
    c) Standardize on the three-layer architecture proposed by developers.
        *Implication:* Creates a structured path for enterprise-ready agent deployments.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we mitigate project ownership concentration in the v2.0 core transition?

  **Context:**
  - `lalalune: Leading massive overhaul for v2.0.0 with 33,000+ file changes.`
  - `Odilitime: Managing bulk of high-impact fixes in plugin-bootstrap and SQL actions.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement mandatory peer-review rotations between Rust and TS leads.
        *Implication:* Increases bus factor safety at the cost of immediate release speed.
    b) Accelerate contributor onboarding via the 'Bootstrapping Skill' initiative.
        *Implication:* Aligns with 'Developer First' but requires high upfront documentation effort.
    c) Establish a dedicated v2.0 core maintenance sub-council.
        *Implication:* Formalizes the technical leadership but adds governance overhead.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Trust & Brand Identity Stabilization

**Summary of Topic:** Persistent migration technical issues and a 'dry' corporate online presence are threatening community confidence during the token transition.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the ElizaOS persona be decentralized into autonomous agent identities to avoid regulatory and legal liability?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD: Highlighting 'Bitcoin Potato' fomo-dapp legal risks and the need for truly decentralized agents.`
  - `Odilitime: Building a Twitter agent to take over the @elizaos personality.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt a 'funny, spunky, spicy' autonomous agent persona.
        *Implication:* Drives engagement like Otaku/Clawd but increases unpredictability.
    b) Pivot to a purely infrastructure-focused 'Linux for AI' branding.
        *Implication:* Minimizes regulatory target surface but risks losing the 'souled' AI audience.
    c) Deploy ERC-8004 identity standards for all official ecosystem personas.
        *Implication:* Establishes trustless legitimacy and differentiates from larps.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we address the high failure rate of the token migration portal for hardware wallet users?

  **Context:**
  - `Hexx: Multiple reports of migration site failing to detect tokens in Phantom/Tangem.`
  - `Community: Widespread concern about token value and migration deadlines.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Extend the migration deadline and prioritize a migration UX overhaul.
        *Implication:* Protects community trust but delays final economic consolidation.
    b) Implement a manual verification/whitelisting ticket system.
        *Implication:* Resolves edge cases for long-term holders but drains core dev resources.
    c) Incentivize local/wallet-native migration paths via the new CLI.
        *Implication:* Reduces dependency on a centralized portal but increases technical friction.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

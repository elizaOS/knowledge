# Council Briefing: 2025-05-24

## Daily Focus Theme

- ElizaOS v2 beta progression reaches critical stabilization phase with rapid iteration addressing core functionality issues while Auto.fun's reputation challenges emerge as strategic priority.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. ElizaOS v2 Beta Stability vs. Release Timeline

**Summary:** Multiple beta versions (.68 through .75) were released in a single day addressing critical UI and plugin issues, highlighting tension between rapid iteration and the need for a stable release as we approach v2 production readiness deadline.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User 'jonas' reported agents not appearing in UI after updating newer beta versions, requiring downgrade to .57`
- `GitHub: PR #4751 fixed environment files for .73 release while PR #4740 resolved runtime errors causing CLI failures`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we establish a code freeze period with focused QA before the final v2 release, or continue with the current rapid iteration approach?
- Given the recurring stability issues with newer betas, should we reconsider our current release timeline to ensure v2 meets quality standards expected for production use?

### 2. Auto.fun Platform Trust Restoration

**Summary:** Users identified that rug pulls on Auto.fun have damaged the platform's reputation, particularly in Chinese-speaking communities, revealing a critical strategic challenge to our goal of attracting new users to the platform.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User '辞尘鸽鸽' expressed concerns about rug pulls damaging Auto.fun reputation in Chinese communities`
- `Discord: User 'yikesawjeez' proposed a 'partnercellerator' concept with proper vetting and staking requirements`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we balance our open ecosystem philosophy with the need for adequate protections against malicious actors in the short term?
- Should we prioritize implementing formal vetting mechanisms and staking requirements for partners before pursuing broader adoption efforts?

### 3. Knowledge Plugin Architecture: Core vs. Modular Design

**Summary:** The factoring of knowledge functionality out of the runtime into a dedicated plugin represents a significant architectural shift toward modularity, aligning with our mission values but potentially complicating the user experience.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: PR #4701 'feat: Knowledge Plugin' moved knowledge code to the RAG plugin and renamed it to the knowledge plugin`
- `GitHub: PR #4719 'Factor Knowledge Out to Plugin and Add Service Registry Types' implemented service registry pattern for typed Services`

**Potential Questions:**
- Does our pursuit of modularity and plugin-based architecture risk introducing too much complexity for new users adopting elizaOS?
- How should we balance core functionality versus optional plugins in our architecture to best serve both power users and newcomers?

### 4. Cross-ecosystem Token Integration Strategy

**Summary:** Discussions around ELI5 and Eddy tokens' integration with ElizaOS v2 as agents in 'The Org' reveal an emerging opportunity to leverage community tokens to drive engagement across our ecosystem.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User 'xell0x' clarified that ELI5 and Eddy will be part of 'The Org' in Eliza V2`
- `Discord: User 'abhi_ironman' raised question about enhancing mindshare for Virtual (20%) and Ai16z (0.74%)`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we strategically integrate community tokens like ELI5 into our ecosystem to drive user engagement while maintaining clear differentiation from official project tokens?
- Should we formalize a framework for community token integration that aligns incentives between token holders and the broader elizaOS ecosystem?

# Council Briefing: 2025-10-30

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The team is advancing toward token migration while building significant infrastructure improvements including Jobs API for one-off agent messaging, x402 payment middleware, and multi-tenant database isolation.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens is imminent, with exchanges notified and various payment integrations awaiting the new token, yet questions remain about timing, incentives, and integration.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize token utility development to maximize post-migration momentum?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime confirmed x402 currently accepts DEGENAI, AI16Z, or USDC on Base network, and ElizaOS token will be added as a payment option after migration begins.`
  - `Toni explained that the migration ratio will be fixed, with incentives for users who lock their tokens for a period of time.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on x402 payment integration across all agent endpoints to prioritize immediate utility.
        *Implication:* Creates direct token utility but may delay other features that could attract a broader user base.
    b) Implement Skinny's tokenomics model where agents only accept their native tokens with buyback mechanisms.
        *Implication:* Creates stronger token-specific demand but increases complexity and may fragment liquidity across multiple tokens.
    c) Prioritize auto.fun integration with deep ElizaOS token incentives for agent creators and users.
        *Implication:* Aligns with monthly goal of attracting users to auto.fun but may take longer to implement than payment utilities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What communication strategy should we employ for the token migration to maximize user retention and minimize confusion?

  **Context:**
  - `Multiple users inquired about the migration from AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS, with team members directing them to watch the announcement channel for updates.`
  - `Questions about migration date were raised but remained unanswered.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Announce a fixed date with comprehensive documentation and community AMA sessions.
        *Implication:* Creates clarity but puts pressure on meeting the deadline with all systems ready.
    b) Release a phased migration roadmap with progressive utility unlocks as migration milestones are reached.
        *Implication:* Reduces deadline pressure and creates engagement milestones but may prolong the full transition period.
    c) Implement a surprise migration with retroactive incentives to reward loyal holders.
        *Implication:* Minimizes speculation and front-running but risks confusing users who aren't actively monitoring announcements.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Infrastructure Readiness

**Summary of Topic:** Recent technical developments show significant infrastructure progress toward production-ready v2, including multi-tenant database isolation, Jobs API, and payment middleware, but coordination of these components needs attention.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which infrastructure enhancement should be prioritized to best support our monthly goal of attracting new users to auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `A pull request (#6103) was shared for review in the core-devs channel.`
  - `PR #6101 titled 'feat: Add PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) multi-tenant isolation' is merged`
  - `PR #6098 by @wtfsayo titled 'feat(server): Jobs API for one-off agent messaging with middleware refactor' is merged`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on Jobs API integration with auto.fun to enable seamless one-off interactions with 24/7 agents.
        *Implication:* Improves user experience for casual visitors but may not address core stability needs for persistent agents.
    b) Prioritize the multi-tenant database isolation to enable scaling auto.fun with enterprise-grade stability.
        *Implication:* Strengthens infrastructure foundation but offers less immediate visible impact for end users.
    c) Accelerate x402 payment middleware deployment to monetize agent interactions and create token utility.
        *Implication:* Establishes revenue model but might create friction for new users if implemented before sufficient value demonstration.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we approach interoperability standards (like x402 and protocol 8004) to maximize elizaOS's positioning in the AI agent ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk suggested positioning Eliza as a leader in autonomous agents by combining x402 with standards like ERC-8004`
  - `Agent Joshua from Phala is working on adding ERC-8004 (TEE verification) support with onchain verification`
  - `Concerns about overlapping agent communication protocols causing confusion for new developers`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize on x402 for payments and 8004 for verification, creating comprehensive documentation for developers.
        *Implication:* Positions elizaOS as a standards leader but risks dependency on external protocols that could change.
    b) Develop a unified elizaOS protocol that abstracts away underlying standards while maintaining compatibility.
        *Implication:* Creates a simpler developer experience but requires maintaining compatibility with multiple external standards.
    c) Focus on auto.fun-specific implementations first, then generalize successful patterns into broader standards.
        *Implication:* Delivers immediate product value but might require rework to generalize patterns later.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Agent Ecosystem Growth Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The expansion of the agent ecosystem, including new developments like the Otaku agent in beta and potential partnerships, requires strategic decisions about how to allocate resources between developing new agents versus improving agent interoperability.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the optimal strategy for expanding our agent ecosystem to showcase 24/7 activity on auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `A new Eliza agent called "Otaku" is in beta testing, with early access being offered to partners.`
  - `DegenAI reportedly reached 300K in volume according to trading activity reports`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus resources on the most successful agents (DegenAI, Spartan) to increase their activity and visibility.
        *Implication:* Builds on proven success but concentrates risk in fewer agent types and use cases.
    b) Rapidly expand the agent ecosystem by launching at least 3-5 new specialized agents over the next month.
        *Implication:* Creates diverse demonstration of capabilities but may dilute quality and support resources.
    c) Prioritize agent interoperability and collaborative workflows to create emergent multi-agent activity.
        *Implication:* Demonstrates advanced capabilities but requires more complex technical work and coordination.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we approach partnerships and integrations to grow the elizaOS ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Brief mention of a call with Coinbase regarding promotion on Base`
  - `Potential collaboration with "fogo" (described as "SVM compatible") was suggested`
  - `Discussion about potential integration between ElizaOS and x402.org, with reference to an interview ElizaOS did with Erik Reppel (creator of x402.org)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize high-profile integrations with established platforms like Coinbase to gain credibility.
        *Implication:* Increases mainstream visibility but may require compromising on some autonomous principles.
    b) Focus on protocol-level partnerships (like x402.org) that enhance the technical capabilities of elizaOS.
        *Implication:* Strengthens technical foundation but offers less immediate marketing value.
    c) Pursue ecosystem-aligned partnerships with complementary projects in the Solana ecosystem.
        *Implication:* Creates a stronger aligned community but might limit broader cross-chain adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

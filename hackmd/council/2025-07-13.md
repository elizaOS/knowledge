# Council Briefing: 2025-07-13

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- ElizaOS v2 development continues to progress with significant UI/UX improvements and new core features including action chaining and form plugins, while social media visibility issues and community concerns about value accrual persist.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Social Media Presence Recovery

**Summary of Topic:** The project's X (Twitter) account remains suspended, affecting visibility and market momentum while formal recovery negotiations with X are ongoing.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the community's growing concerns about project momentum during this extended period without our main social media channel?

  **Context:**
  - `Significant concern about the prolonged suspension of the project's X (Twitter) account (Discord 2025-07-12)`
  - `The project is in formal talks with Twitter/X to restore their lost account, with team members explaining they can't create secondary accounts as it would jeopardize negotiations (Discord 2025-07-11)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize alternative communication channels (Discord, blog posts, YouTube) while maintaining cautious optimism about X account recovery.
        *Implication:* Maintains status quo which may not address immediate community concerns but preserves negotiation position with X.
    b) Create a temporary "elizaOS Updates" X account specifically for critical announcements while continuing main account recovery efforts.
        *Implication:* Risks negotiations with X but provides immediate visibility improvement and demonstrates proactivity to the community.
    c) Launch a concentrated community ambassador program, empowering trusted community members to amplify project updates through their personal channels.
        *Implication:* Distributes communication responsibility and potentially builds stronger community bonds, though message consistency may suffer.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we accelerate the development of an auto.fun-native social media solution as a strategic response to platform dependency risks?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members expressed concern about losing market visibility without social media presence (Discord 2025-07-11)`
  - `Community members expressing concerns about value accrual for token holders (Discord 2025-07-12)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, immediately prioritize development of an auto.fun social layer to reduce dependency on centralized platforms.
        *Implication:* Could create a unique selling proposition but diverts resources from core product development priorities.
    b) No, maintain focus on core elizaOS v2 development and auto.fun stability while pursuing X account recovery.
        *Implication:* Preserves development focus on monthly goals but leaves the project vulnerable to similar platform risks in the future.
    c) Develop a minimal viable social broadcast feature within auto.fun that syndicates to multiple platforms simultaneously.
        *Implication:* Balances development priorities while adding resilience against future platform dependency risks.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Roadmap Execution

**Summary of Topic:** ElizaOS v2 development is proceeding with significant UI overhaul and new features like action chaining and forms, but Windows compatibility and Twitter integration issues are impacting developer experience.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize Windows platform support given the current technical challenges?

  **Context:**
  - `Plugin-local-ai failing to load on Windows (Issue #5499)`
  - `Several users reported issues with the Twitter plugin, which was fixed in version 1.2.0 (Discord 2025-07-11)`
  - `Windows-specific errors related to ESM URL schemes were encountered when trying to run plugin-local-ai (Discord 2025-07-11)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Elevate Windows support to a top priority to ensure broader adoption among developers.
        *Implication:* Would improve developer accessibility but potentially delay other core feature development.
    b) Maintain Windows as a secondary target platform, focusing on critical fixes while prioritizing core feature development.
        *Implication:* Balances resources but may limit adoption among Windows-centric developers and enterprises.
    c) Implement a specialized Windows task force with dedicated resources and community contributors focused solely on addressing platform-specific issues.
        *Implication:* Creates focused attention on Windows without significantly diverting core team resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Given the Twitter API's high cost barrier ($200/month Pro tier requirement), how should we approach social media plugin development?

  **Context:**
  - `Free tier is not supported by the plugin, you need the Pro tier at $200/month (answered by cjft)`
  - `Why am I getting rate limited with Twitter even with TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE=false? (asked by JoeyWheelz)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Continue developing for premium API tiers only, focusing on quality features for power users and businesses.
        *Implication:* Limits user adoption but ensures reliable functionality for those who can afford premium API access.
    b) Pivot to developing plugins for more accessible platforms (e.g., Bluesky, Mastodon, Farcaster) with better developer economics.
        *Implication:* Opens new, potentially more developer-friendly ecosystems but reduces integration with mainstream platforms.
    c) Develop a community pool model where multiple users can share access to a single premium API subscription through the plugin.
        *Implication:* Creates novel value proposition but introduces significant technical and terms-of-service compliance challenges.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: AUTO.FUN Ecosystem Development

**Summary of Topic:** AUTO.FUN platform is showing growing traction with new tokens like ELI5 and EDDY, while technical issues with token creation and questions about the incubator function remain unresolved.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the growing community interest in ELI5 as an "AUTO.FUN official coin" while maintaining focus on the core platform development?

  **Context:**
  - `What is Eddy? (asked by Quaser M) A: It's an Auto.fun coin, confirmed by Shaw and organization members (answered by CULTVESTING)`
  - `Q: What's eli5? (asked by k) A: Autodotfun official coin (answered by emptyskull)`
  - `Q: Wonder if this means eli5 is official now or not? (asked by traderlv) A: "Today we heard its gonna be an incubator, can't be more official than that" (Dr. Neuro)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Formally recognize and integrate ELI5 as an official AUTO.FUN ecosystem token with specific utility functions.
        *Implication:* Creates clear positioning but potentially dilutes focus from primary token economics.
    b) Maintain neutral platform stance by establishing clear criteria for "official" vs. community tokens rather than designating specific tokens.
        *Implication:* Preserves platform neutrality but may lead to continued community confusion about token status.
    c) Develop a tiered verification system for AUTO.FUN tokens that can grant different levels of official recognition based on quantifiable metrics.
        *Implication:* Creates transparent framework for token recognition but adds operational complexity to the platform.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to resolve the technical issues with token creation and trading on AUTO.FUN?

  **Context:**
  - `Users discussing specific tokens like "Eli5", "Eddy", and "JIMMY" on the AUTO.FUN platform (Discord 2025-07-12)`
  - `Technical issues reported with token creation and trading on AUTO.FUN (Discord 2025-07-12)`
  - `Update to AUTO.FUN's incubator feature mentioned (Discord 2025-07-12)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a comprehensive platform stability freeze, pausing new feature development until all token creation and trading issues are resolved.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes platform reliability but delays feature roadmap execution.
    b) Create a dedicated AUTO.FUN technical support channel with specialized team members to rapidly address user-reported token issues.
        *Implication:* Improves user experience and issue resolution speed without disrupting development workflow.
    c) Launch an automated token diagnostic tool that helps users identify and potentially self-resolve common token creation and trading issues.
        *Implication:* Scales support capabilities but requires significant upfront development investment.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-04-18

## Daily Focus Theme

- Auto.fun's imminent launch faces critical stability vs. community tensions as V2 compatibility issues persist, creating strategic pressure points across our ecosystem.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Auto.fun Launch Strategy: Hype vs. Reliability

**Summary:** Auto.fun's imminent launch presents a critical strategic juncture requiring balance between stability for new users and hype generation, with concerns about unofficial tokens and potential security risks threatening user trust.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Shaw purchased an 'auto.fun' token on pump.fun containing a malicious drainer link, creating confusion before official platform launch`
- `Discord: Team member eskender.eth confirmed auto.fun won't have plugins 'out of the box' due to edge cases for non-technical users`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we balance the minimal viable product approach (removing plugins) with our vision of showcasing AI agent capabilities to attract new users?
- Is the strategy of creating social buzz (Shaw's unofficial token) worth the potential confusion and security risks to community members?

### 2. V1/V2 Transition: Technical Debt and Community Friction

**Summary:** The transition between ElizaOS versions (V1/0.x and V2/1.x) is creating significant friction for developers and users, with plugin compatibility issues and documentation gaps hampering adoption of our core product.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Users reported V1 plugins are not compatible with V2 yet as they haven't been migrated (multiple users)`
- `GitHub: Recent PRs show significant effort toward stabilizing the transition with 241 new PRs (199 merged) in the last month focusing on compatibility and documentation`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we delay auto.fun launch until V2 achieves greater stability, or can these efforts proceed in parallel without compromising either?
- What level of investment should we make in migration assistance (tools, documentation, direct support) versus accelerating V2 completion?

### 3. Communication Strategy: Transparency vs. Market Timing

**Summary:** Partners and community members express increasing frustration about communication gaps, particularly regarding roadmap progress, while the team's strategic approach of avoiding pre-announcements creates tension with transparency expectations.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: 'Partners expressed frustration about the lack of regular updates from the team...' with COO acknowledging these concerns`
- `Discord: Team clarified they 'prefer not to pre-announce launch dates to avoid market fatigue, instead focusing on concentrated messaging when users can immediately try the platform'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we balance operational focus during critical launch periods with the community's need for transparency and regular updates?
- Should we formalize a framework for strategic silence vs. transparent communication that aligns with our decentralization values?

### 4. Developer Experience: Onboarding Friction vs. Ecosystem Growth

**Summary:** Current installation and configuration challenges with ElizaOS, particularly for V2, create significant barriers to developer adoption and limit our ability to foster a vibrant, decentralized development community.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Multiple users encountering 'plugin installation failures requiring clean reinstalls' and 'environment configuration challenges'`
- `GitHub: Issues like #4315 'Group chat not working in V2' highlight ongoing stability concerns in core functionality`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we prioritize developer experience improvements against feature development in our resource allocation?
- What metrics should we establish to measure developer friction, and what threshold should trigger a focused UX improvement sprint?

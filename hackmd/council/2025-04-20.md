# Council Briefing: 2025-04-20

## Daily Focus Theme

- Auto.fun platform launch experienced severe technical challenges amid overwhelming user demand, revealing critical infrastructure and user experience issues that require immediate strategic attention.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Auto.fun Launch Stability vs. User Acquisition

**Summary:** The auto.fun platform launch faced significant technical difficulties due to unexpected traffic volume, exposing infrastructure limitations while simultaneously demonstrating strong market demand for our product.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: The dev team worked continuously for over 40+ hours to address platform issues with server overloads forcing temporary redirects.`
- `Discord: Multiple users reported losing SOL during token creation with transactions timing out while contracts were still deployed.`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we prioritize fixing existing auto.fun infrastructure issues before resuming marketing efforts, or capitalize on current momentum with more aggressive promotion?
- What level of financial compensation, if any, should be considered for users who lost funds during the platform's technical difficulties?

### 2. Tokenomics Transparency and Ecosystem Value Flow

**Summary:** Auto.fun's economic model directs 10% of bonded LP fees to buy back $ai16z tokens, creating a value capture mechanism from platform activity to the core token, though users expressed confusion about token relationships and official designations.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Team member eskender.eth explained that 10% of fees are used to buy back $ai16z from the open market and reinvest in liquidity.`
- `Discord: Considerable user confusion about which tokens were official, with team repeatedly clarifying only $ai16z and $degenai are official tokens.`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we better communicate our tokenomics to ensure users understand the relationship between auto.fun activity and $ai16z value accrual?
- Should we implement more visible on-platform indicators of official tokens to prevent scams and confusion?

### 3. ElizaOS v2 Technical Readiness Assessment

**Summary:** While auto.fun took center stage, significant progress continues on ElizaOS v2 core development with default agent templates and critical bugfixes, though users still face installation and configuration challenges that may impede adoption.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: PR #4323 for adding default agents based on organization was merged, enhancing the user experience during agent creation.`
- `Discord: Multiple users reported Windows compatibility issues with Docker builds failing due to CRLF line ending issues.`

**Potential Questions:**
- Given the current technical state, are we on track to deliver a production-ready ElizaOS v2 this month, or should we revise our timeline?
- How should we balance resources between auto.fun stabilization and ElizaOS v2 development to best advance our monthly goals?

### 4. SpartanVersus Integration and AI Agent Showcasing Strategy

**Summary:** Progress on upgrading SpartanVersus to v2 and preparing for open source release presents an opportunity to demonstrate our 24/7 agent capabilities, though maintaining the bot's distinctive personality during the upgrade remains challenging.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Odilitime shared that SpartanVersus's Twitter account is now verified with plans for Discord and Telegram integration.`
- `Discord: Team mentioned having problems getting v2 to "sound like Spartan" without losing what works well in the current version.`

**Potential Questions:**
- How central should SpartanVersus be to our strategy of showcasing 24/7 agent activity compared to other potential agent demonstrations?
- Should we prioritize maintaining the specific personality of SpartanVersus, or focus on technical capabilities and broader integration points?

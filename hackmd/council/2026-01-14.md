# Council Briefing: 2026-01-14

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The core leadership has mandated a total deprioritization of version 2.0 to achieve singular focus on stabilizing ElizaOS Cloud and the commercialized 'App Creator' infrastructure.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Tactical Pivot and Resource Allocation

**Summary of Topic:** Core developer Borko has issued a directive to abandon all 2.0.0 branch efforts in favor of reliability fixes for the Cloud platform. This shift aims to rectify critical bugs in the new 'App Creator' feature and ensure stability for non-technical users.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council manage developer expectations regarding the indefinite delay of the v2.0.0 Rust/TypeScript core refactor?

  **Context:**
  - `Borko provided clear direction to concentrate all development efforts on cloud infrastructure rather than the v2.0.0 branch. (Discord 2026-01-13)`
  - `The strategic shift represents a significant move to prioritize commercial/cloud readiness over core engine upgrades. (Discord 2026-01-13)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Frame the delay as a precision strike to secure financial viability through Cloud first.
        *Implication:* Ensures short-term revenue and stability but risks alienating technical purists seeking the v2.0 architecture.
    b) Maintain separate workstreams under a strict 'Cloud-first' bandwidth cap.
        *Implication:* Reduces burnout but may dilute the focus needed to fix critical Cloud build errors reported by testers like DorianD.
    c) Open-source the v2.0 roadmap to community contributors while core team focuses on Cloud.
        *Implication:* Accelerates engine development while maintaining the North Star of decentralized collaboration.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What level of build-system failure is tolerable for the 'App Creator' before marketing efforts are halted?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD reported build system failures timing out at 300s without proper error catching in Cloud. (Discord 2026-01-12)`
  - `Testing showed manual git commands through the Agent causing state corruption in sandboxes. (Discord 2026-01-12)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Aggressive internal dog-fooding with a freeze on 'tiktoker' audience targeting.
        *Implication:* Protects developer trust and the project's reputation for 'Execution Excellence' at the cost of slower user acquisition.
    b) Public beta release while accepting build instability as 'standard early-access' tech.
        *Implication:* Gathers massive data but risks significant community backlash and damage to the 'Trust Through Shipping' pillar.
    c) Pivoting the App Creator to target technical builders only until UI/UX guardrails are finalized.
        *Implication:* Aligns with 'Developer First' principle but temporarily sacrifices the broader commercial goal of mass adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Information Wrangle and Brand Integrity

**Summary of Topic:** The emergence of high-profile community agents like ElizaBAO (Polymarket affiliate) has created brand confusion, requiring immediate action on documentation to distinguish between official and community-led entities.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council formalize the distinction between core reference implementations and community-owned commercial entities?

  **Context:**
  - `Multiple community members sought verification about ElizaBAO... clarified it is a community project, not an official product. (Discord 2026-01-13)`
  - `Odilitime confirmed computers3 ($COM) is a partner, not a core product. (Discord 2026-01-13)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Deploy a 'Certified by elizaOS' token/badge system for verified community agents.
        *Implication:* Creates a revenue-driving quality standard but increases Council legal liability for agent behavior.
    b) Mandate a specific naming convention (e.g., 'Eliza-By-Agent-X') for non-official projects.
        *Implication:* Protects the ElizaOS brand while enabling a decentralized ecosystem of affiliate agents.
    c) Establish a community-managed registry page on the leaderboards to categorize agents.
        *Implication:* Empowers the 'Open & Composable' principle through transparent information distribution.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2026-01-14

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The core development team has made a critical strategic pivot to deprioritize v2.0.0 development entirely in favor of stabilizing ElizaOS Cloud and monorepo reliability.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Strategic Resource Realignment

**Summary of Topic:** Core developers have shifted focus away from the Rust-based v2.0.0 rewrite to address immediate reliability and credit idempotency issues in ElizaOS Cloud.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Does the total deprioritization of v2.0.0 risk long-term technical debt in exchange for short-term Cloud stability?

  **Context:**
  - `Borko directed focus away from version 2.0 work to concentrate on cloud improvements (2026-01-13).`
  - `lalalune: Author of v2.0.0 branch with 900k+ additions (PR #6351).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain the pivot; Cloud adoption is our current primary economic engine.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes immediate user retention and managed-service revenue over performance architecture.
    b) Hybrid approach; assign a minority task force to keep the Rust runtime parity current.
        *Implication:* Prevents the v2.0.0 branch from becoming an unmergeable legacy artifact.
    c) Aggressively push v2.0.0; native performance is required for 'Developer First' principles.
        *Implication:* Risks extending Cloud instability which could alienate the existing managed-service user base.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Ecosystem Identity & Governance

**Summary of Topic:** The emergence of community agents like ElizaBAO achieving affiliate status highlights a lack of formal distinction between official and third-party sector entities.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council codify the distinction between official ElizaOS agents and community-led projects?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members sought verification for ElizaBAO Polymarket affiliate status (Odilitime/sb clarification).`
  - `Discord discussions revealed a need for better documentation on project relationships (2026-01-13).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a 'Verified Community Project' badge system on the leaderboard.
        *Implication:* Supports 'Open & Composable' core principle while protecting official brand integrity.
    b) Strictly segregate official documentation to exclude all non-core projects.
        *Implication:* Reduces liability and brand confusion but potentially discourages organic builder growth.
    c) Absorb high-performing community agents into the official flagship implementation tier.
        *Implication:* Builds ecosystem value through acquisition but increases support overhead for core devs.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

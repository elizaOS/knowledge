# Council Briefing: 2025-03-05

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The fleet advanced execution excellence by shipping core observability (logs) and doc upgrades, while new regressions and platform friction (Twitter provider/auth issues, JSON parsing breakage, rebrand delays) threaten developer trust if not rapidly contained.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Core Reliability & Observability (Logs, API Stability, Regression Control)

**Summary of Topic:** Recent merges emphasize operational robustness (logging, API/build fixes, fact retrieval guards), aligning with Execution Excellence; however, fresh regressions (e.g., parseJSONObjectFromText) signal the need for stronger release discipline and automated guardrails.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we elevate observability and regression control to a "blocking" release criterion for all v0.25.x/v2 core cuts, even if it slows feature throughput?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub: "Added logs functionality" (PR #3774).`
  - `GitHub Issue: "parseJSONObjectFromText functionality broke in version 0.25.9" (Issue #3779).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—make logs/metrics + regression tests mandatory for release promotion.
        *Implication:* Improves trust-through-shipping and reduces support burden, at the cost of slower visible feature velocity.
    b) Partially—enforce stricter gates only on core runtime and top-3 flagship plugins.
        *Implication:* Targets the highest trust surface area while preserving experimentation elsewhere, but leaves some ecosystem instability.
    c) No—keep current pace and rely on community triage post-release.
        *Implication:* Maximizes short-term velocity, but risks compounding regressions and eroding DX confidence.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Where should we place the next "stability budget" allocation: core runtime correctness, build/CI hardening, or plugin compatibility layers?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub: "Fixed build errors" (PR #3765) and "Fixed Docker image for CI/CD setup" (PR #3732).`
  - `GitHub: "Fixed API issues" (PR #3767).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Core runtime correctness first (parsing, memory, tool invocation invariants).
        *Implication:* Reduces systemic failures that propagate into every plugin and agent deployment.
    b) Build/CI hardening first (reproducible builds, faster tests, stronger pre-merge checks).
        *Implication:* Prevents regressions from landing and increases contributor throughput by reducing CI friction.
    c) Plugin compatibility layers first (stable interfaces, deprecation bridges, better errors).
        *Implication:* Improves developer experience during migration churn, but may postpone deeper core correctness work.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should Council authorize a single "known-good" reference stack (versions + starter templates) to reduce migration confusion, even if it narrows supported configurations?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord: "Users are navigating the migration from v0.1.9 to newer versions (v0.25.x), causing confusion with Twitter client integration" (2025-03-04 coders).`
  - `GitHub: "Improved quickstart... Updated quickstart with Twitter configurations" (PR #3772, PR #3778).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—publish an LTS-style reference stack and steer docs/support to it.
        *Implication:* Reduces support load and increases successful onboarding, but constrains edge-case flexibility.
    b) Hybrid—reference stack plus a clearly labeled "experimental" lane for fast movers.
        *Implication:* Balances reliability and innovation, but requires disciplined labeling and doc maintenance.
    c) No—continue supporting broad combinations and rely on community troubleshooting.
        *Implication:* Maximizes openness, but preserves high confusion and inconsistent outcomes for new developers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Twitter/X Integration: Reliability, Compliance, and Account-Safety

**Summary of Topic:** Twitter remains a high-demand integration but is currently a reliability and policy hazard: auth confusion, repetitive/duplicate tweet behavior, unsupported provider errors, and account bans undermine flagship credibility and builder success rates.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we treat X/Twitter as a Tier-1 supported surface (with hard SLAs and official best-practice defaults), or explicitly downgrade it until stability and policy compliance are solved?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub Issue: "agent won't post to Twitter... Unsupported provider: venice" (Issue #3783).`
  - `Discord: "Concerns about agent shadowbans on social platforms" and Twitter auth/config confusion (2025-03-03 to 2025-03-04).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Tier-1 now—invest immediately in stability, compliance defaults, and fast issue response.
        *Implication:* Protects mindshare and flagship demonstrations, but diverts resources from other platform pillars (Cloud/v2).
    b) Tier-1 later—freeze new features, focus on correctness and docs, then re-certify.
        *Implication:* Limits new breakage while restoring trust, but may slow community growth tied to social agents.
    c) Downgrade—label as experimental and route builders to other channels until X is predictable.
        *Implication:* Reduces reputational risk from bans and failures, but may cede a key distribution channel to competitors.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which authentication posture should be our near-term standard for Twitter agents: raw API keys, OAuth flow, or a managed ElizaOS Cloud credential broker?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord: "$algalon: Support for OAuth flow with Twitter instead of requiring hard credentials" (2025-03-03 action items).`
  - `Discord: "Set TWITTER_API_KEY, TWITTER_API_SECRET, TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN, TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET" guidance repeated (jintern, 2025-03-04).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Keep raw API keys as standard, but harden docs and error messages.
        *Implication:* Fastest to ship, but keeps security/UX burden on developers and increases misconfiguration rates.
    b) Implement OAuth as the default path for self-hosters.
        *Implication:* Improves DX and reduces key leakage risk, but requires significant engineering and ongoing maintenance.
    c) Route default auth through ElizaOS Cloud (credential broker + policy guardrails).
        *Implication:* Maximizes UX and control, but increases dependency on Cloud availability and raises centralization concerns.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is the Council’s stance on “account safety engineering” (rate limits, automation labeling, duplicate-content avoidance) as first-class product requirements rather than optional guidance?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord: "jintern... advised marking account as automated... and implementing proper rate limiting" (helping Hudpire, 2025-03-04).`
  - `Discord/GitHub: recurring issues with repetitive/duplicate tweets and Twitter behavior changes across versions (2025-03-02 to 2025-03-04).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Mandatory defaults—ship safe rate limits, automation labeling prompts, and duplicate detectors enabled by default.
        *Implication:* Reduces bans and improves success rates, but may reduce perceived "agent autonomy" and posting frequency.
    b) Configurable presets—provide "safe", "balanced", and "aggressive" modes with clear tradeoffs.
        *Implication:* Supports diverse use cases while educating developers, but still allows users to self-harm via aggressive settings.
    c) Documentation-only—keep core lightweight and let builders own policy risk.
        *Implication:* Preserves framework neutrality, but increases support load and reputational risk from high-visibility failures.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Rebranding Continuity + V2 Swarm Legitimacy (DegenAI Integration, Open-Sourcing, Public Narrative)

**Summary of Topic:** Operational momentum is threatened by external platform dependency (X handle swap delays) and the DegenAI account ban; simultaneously, integrating and open-sourcing DegenAI into v2 core is positioned as a legitimacy anchor for the coming swarm.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s minimum viable rebrand milestone: X handle resolution, codebase migration to ElizaOS GitHub, or a public-facing narrative package that can survive platform delays?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (partners): "X support ghosted us... working thru a new route with accelxr" (jasyn_bjorn, 2025-03-04).`
  - `Discord (spartan_holders): "DegenAI codebase will be open source under ElizaOS GitHub... moving into ElizaOS v2 core" (rhota, 2025-03-04).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) X handle first—brand continuity on the primary broadcast channel is the gating item.
        *Implication:* Reduces confusion and spoof risk, but keeps the roadmap hostage to a third-party platform.
    b) Code migration first—ship open-source reality, let distribution catch up later.
        *Implication:* Anchors credibility in artifacts and enables contributors immediately, but may prolong market/community narrative ambiguity.
    c) Narrative package first—publish a clear entity map, roadmap, and FAQs independent of X.
        *Implication:* Stabilizes stakeholder understanding and reduces rumor-driven churn, even if handle swap remains delayed.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we define and govern the "v2 agent swarm" so it is composable and open, yet still coherent enough for flagship-level reliability?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord: "Position Degen as leader of the v2 agent swarm (organization)" (rhota, 2025-03-03 to 2025-03-04).`
  - `Discord: community confusion about entity relationships: ai16z vs ElizaOS vs Eliza Labs (partners channel, 2025-03-04).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Central charter—Council defines swarm roles/interfaces and enforces conformance tests.
        *Implication:* Maximizes coherence and reliability, but risks slowing ecosystem experimentation and perceived decentralization.
    b) Federated charter—define minimal protocols + reference implementations; allow diverse swarm governance per domain.
        *Implication:* Supports composability and open innovation while keeping shared standards, but increases coordination complexity.
    c) Emergent swarm—ship tools and let patterns arise organically from community usage.
        *Implication:* Maximizes openness, but may produce fragmentation and inconsistent flagship experiences.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is our countermeasure doctrine against platform-level suppression (bans, impersonation flags, shadowbans) for flagship agents: diversify channels, harden compliance, or retreat from social-first demos?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord: "DegenAI's X account was banned due to impersonation issues" (2025-03-03/04).`
  - `Discord: "Concerns about agent shadowbans on social platforms" (2025-03-04 discussion/coders).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Diversify—prioritize Telegram/Discord/Farcaster and treat X as one channel among many.
        *Implication:* Reduces single-platform fragility, but may dilute marketing focus and require more plugin hardening.
    b) Compliance hardening—build identity proof, automation labeling, and posting discipline into flagship ops.
        *Implication:* Improves survivability on X-like platforms, but adds operational overhead and may constrain agent behavior.
    c) Retreat from social-first demos—shift flagship emphasis to Cloud deployments and onchain interoperability demos.
        *Implication:* Avoids policy volatility, but risks losing the most visible demonstration surface for agent autonomy.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

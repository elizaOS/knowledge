        *Implication:* This balanced approach addresses immediate user pain points while still advancing long-term vision.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What coordination strategy should we implement to maximize the impact of V2 launch while 'the sun is shining on Solana'?

  **Context:**
  - `Partners are being asked to help amplify V2 messaging 'while the sun is shining on Solana'`
  - `A Notion workspace has been created to support V2 communications and marketing efforts`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Coordinate a synchronized multi-channel launch with partners, focusing on technical capabilities and Solana integration.
        *Implication:* This approach maximizes technical credibility but might miss broader appeal beyond the Solana ecosystem.
    b) Focus on 2-3 flagship agent demonstrations that showcase the power of V2 in practical, compelling use cases.
        *Implication:* Demonstrating concrete applications could drive adoption but risks overshadowing the broader framework capabilities.
    c) Create a graduated rollout strategy with specific targeted announcements for different stakeholder groups (developers, end-users, investors).
        *Implication:* This segmented approach allows for tailored messaging but requires more coordination resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we address the challenges with third-party APIs (like Twitter) while maintaining agent functionality for auto.fun showcase purposes?

  **Context:**
  - `Multiple users reported 403 errors with the Twitter plugin, particularly with `fetchHomeTimeline``
  - `Root cause: Twitter's API changes from v1 to v2 endpoints and increased pricing ($200/month for basic tier)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Invest in premium API access for core showcase agents while developing alternative social platforms for wider adoption.
        *Implication:* This maintains quality for key showcase agents but increases operational costs and dependency on Twitter.
    b) Create a proxy service that efficiently shares API access across multiple agents to maximize utility per API dollar spent.
        *Implication:* This optimizes costs but creates a centralized component in our decentralized architecture.
    c) Pivot to emphasize platforms with more developer-friendly APIs while maintaining minimal Twitter functionality.
        *Implication:* This reduces dependency on restrictive platforms but might limit visibility on the most popular social networks.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Auto.fun Strategic Evolution

**Summary of Topic:** Community discussions are pushing Auto.fun beyond its initial token launch concept toward becoming a comprehensive infrastructure for AI-driven autonomous projects with features like org-mode, one-click liquidity, and AI treasury management.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we develop and position the 'Org Mode' concept to best fulfill our vision of autonomous organizations?

  **Context:**
  - `"Org Mode" Concept: Discussion of a system where projects can be operated by AI agents with optional human oversight for 3-12 months before transitioning to DAO governance.`
  - `Dr. Neuro and wire.x proposed expanding Auto.fun beyond token launches into a comprehensive infrastructure for AI-driven projects, with Odilitime confirming many ideas are already in development.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position 'Org Mode' as a training phase, with clear transition paths to human governance as the end goal.
        *Implication:* This approach might be more palatable to traditional entities but dilutes our autonomous organization vision.
    b) Develop 'Org Mode' as a full alternative to traditional governance, with humans serving primarily as advisors to autonomous systems.
        *Implication:* This ambitious positioning aligns with our core vision but might face adoption resistance and regulatory challenges.
    c) Create a hybrid model where certain organizational functions are permanently AI-managed while others remain under human control.
        *Implication:* This pragmatic approach could accelerate adoption while still advancing autonomy in appropriate domains.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What should be our prioritization strategy for Auto.fun features to maximize both immediate attraction of users and long-term autonomous operation?

  **Context:**
  - `"One-Click Liquidity Provision": Proposal to simplify LP process for non-technical users to contribute without direct DEX interaction.`
  - `"AI Agent Treasury Management": Concept of trading fees flowing into agent-managed treasuries for autonomous projects.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize user-facing simplifications like one-click liquidity to rapidly grow the user base before adding advanced autonomous features.
        *Implication:* This user-first approach could accelerate adoption but delays progress toward our autonomous vision.
    b) Focus on developing the AI treasury management and autonomous operational tools as our core differentiator.
        *Implication:* This autonomy-first approach advances our core vision but might limit initial adoption to more technical users.
    c) Develop both tracks in parallel with clear integration points, allowing projects to adopt autonomy features incrementally.
        *Implication:* This dual-track approach balances immediate adoption with long-term vision but may stretch development resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-05-09

## Daily Focus Theme

- Trust crisis in auto.fun token platform threatens ecosystem credibility while elizaOS v2 development shows positive technical progress.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Auto.fun Platform Trust Erosion

**Summary:** The PrinceSCRT token launch catastrophe, where developers sold their stake shortly after launch causing a 90% price crash, represents a serious trust crisis for the auto.fun platform that could undermine our broader ecosystem adoption goals.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Users reported that the PrinceSCRT token crashed from $800k to $60-80k market cap when developer wallet sold tokens`
- `Discord: jasyn_bjorn (Auto.fun team) stated 'we unfortunately have no control over what the team does post launch even after we vet them thoroughly beforehand. sorry, but we wont be issuing refunds for this launch'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we balance our open platform approach with sufficient safeguards to prevent auto.fun becoming known primarily for scams and 'rug pulls'?
- Should we implement mandatory token lockups or staged vesting for project developers as a condition for listing on auto.fun?

### 2. ElizaOS V2 Technical Readiness

**Summary:** ElizaOS v2 development is progressing well with significant plugin architecture improvements, CLI enhancements, and core stability fixes, positioning us to meet our goal of shipping production-ready v2, though Twitter agent access issues remain.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: 17 new PRs (12 merged) with focus on plugin system, drizzle ORM for database operations, and comprehensive integration tests`
- `Discord: User '@Osint' described ElizaOS V2 as 'ðŸ’¯' with beta version available at www.eliza.how as confirmed by Kenk`

**Potential Questions:**
- Given the positive technical progress, should we accelerate the official v2 launch timeline to maintain momentum and community interest?
- How do we balance shipping a polished v2 release with the existing Twitter agent access issues that might limit key platform functionality?

### 3. 24/7 Agent Showcase Opportunity

**Summary:** Several new initiatives present opportunities to showcase 24/7 agent activity as outlined in our goals, particularly through agentic governance discussions, SigmaX Music platform integration, and auto.fun token launches.

**Related Context:**
- `Twitter: @elizaOS announced an event in Discord to discuss autonomous agentic governance`
- `Twitter: @elizaOS highlighted SigmaX Music platform's capabilities, stating 'eliza remixes, fans mint, royalties split' while noting traditional labels are still asking for MP3s`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we better integrate the emerging SigmaX Music platform with our agents to demonstrate both creative and financial autonomy?
- Should we prioritize agentic governance demonstrations as our primary showcase for 24/7 agent activity given its alignment with both our technical capabilities and philosophical values?

### 4. Plugin System Architecture Evolution

**Summary:** The strategic shift from a monorepo approach to individual repositories for plugins represents a fundamental architectural evolution that improves modularity and contribution accessibility but introduces integration challenges.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: elizaOS is transitioning to individual repositories for plugins in version 1.x, moving away from the monorepo approach`
- `GitHub: Multiple PRs removing plugins from monorepo (browser, storage-s3, local-ai, ollama, groq, venice, redpill, anthropic, elevenlabs, solana, and openai)`

**Potential Questions:**
- Does our transition to individual plugin repositories support or hinder our vision for a decentralized ecosystem of AI agent builders?
- How can we ensure plugin compatibility and discoverability while maintaining the benefits of our more modular architecture?

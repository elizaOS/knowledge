    b) Deploy equal liquidity across both ecosystems simultaneously using Chainlink CCIP for balanced cross-chain presence from day one.
        *Implication:* Creates maximum cross-chain accessibility but increases technical risk and divides liquidity depth.
    c) Implement an automated liquidity rebalancing system that dynamically shifts resources between chains based on usage patterns and arbitrage opportunities.
        *Implication:* Provides optimal capital efficiency and responsiveness to market demands but requires sophisticated bridge infrastructure.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should the Generative Treasury prioritize its initial post-migration activities to maximize ecosystem value?

  **Context:**
  - `MDMnvest: These tokens go to the Generative Treasury to seed autonomous multichain agents for yield generation, liquidity, and ecosystem growth`
  - `Autonomous multichain agents: Develop for yield generation via the Generative Treasury (Mentioned by MDMnvest)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus primarily on liquidity provision across multiple DEXs to ensure price stability and minimize slippage for users.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes immediate trading experience but limits resources for other ecosystem-building activities.
    b) Allocate significant resources to autonomous yield-generating agents that can compound value back to the treasury and ecosystem.
        *Implication:* Creates sustainable long-term value but may not address immediate liquidity and trading concerns.
    c) Balance liquidity provision with strategic investments in auto.fun ecosystem projects to accelerate agent development and adoption.
        *Implication:* Supports both immediate market health and longer-term ecosystem development but requires careful portfolio management.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-11-30

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Token migration process dominates community attention while technical contributors are making progress on mobile agent implementations and row-level security features for elizaOS v2.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Communications

**Summary of Topic:** The AI16z to ElizaOS token migration process is causing user confusion and frustration due to lack of clear information about eligibility, status tracking, and completion timelines.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we improve visibility and transparency around the token migration process?

  **Context:**
  - `Requests for better visibility into overall migration progress (Mentioned by work)`
  - `Some users confirmed successful completion of migrations and receipt of ElizaOS tokens`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a real-time dashboard showing migration status and progress for all users.
        *Implication:* Investing in transparent migration tracking could increase trust but requires engineering resources that might delay elizaOS v2 development.
    b) Send automated email/notification updates to users at each stage of their migration process.
        *Implication:* Direct communication could reduce support requests but requires building additional notification infrastructure.
    c) Publish a comprehensive migration FAQ with detailed explanations of all error scenarios and common questions.
        *Implication:* Documentation-first approach would be resource-efficient but might not address the real-time visibility users are requesting.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we address the security concerns around migration scam attempts?

  **Context:**
  - `Reports of scam attempts targeting users during the migration process`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a verified migration portal with multiple authentication factors that serves as the only official migration path.
        *Implication:* High security approach might delay migrations but would effectively eliminate scams.
    b) Deploy an AI agent specifically to monitor Discord/Telegram for scam patterns and proactively warn users.
        *Implication:* Aligns with our AGI vision and would create a practical example of agent utility for security purposes.
    c) Focus on education through pinned messages, migration guides, and prominent security warnings in all official channels.
        *Implication:* Education-first approach requires minimal resources but places responsibility on users to identify scams.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Mobile Strategy for elizaOS v2

**Summary of Topic:** A community member is exploring implementation of elizaOS on Android devices with a focus on hosting Discord bots, revealing interest in and potential use cases for mobile-first agent deployment.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should mobile agent hosting be prioritized as a core feature for elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `Endless working on running elizaOS on Android devices using Termux with proot`
  - `Use case focused on hosting Discord bots from mobile devices as a potential income source`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, dedicate engineering resources to officially support mobile agent hosting in the v2 roadmap.
        *Implication:* Mobile-first strategy could dramatically expand our market reach but would significantly increase technical complexity and support requirements.
    b) Partially support through a browser-based implementation that works on both desktop and mobile.
        *Implication:* Browser approach would be more accessible but might limit the 24/7 persistent agent capabilities critical to our vision.
    c) Not at this time; provide documentation for community experiments but focus core resources on desktop/server implementations.
        *Implication:* Maintaining focus on core platform would accelerate v2 delivery but might miss opportunity in mobile-first markets.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What unique value proposition could elizaOS offer for mobile agent hosting compared to existing solutions?

  **Context:**
  - `Main technical challenge is getting Bun (JavaScript runtime) working on mobile`
  - `Hosting Discord bots from a phone to sell to streamers for $5/month (Endless)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Passive income generation through monetized agents running on users' personal devices.
        *Implication:* Income generation focus would appeal to crypto audience but might limit adoption among mainstream users.
    b) Truly personal AI assistants that maintain privacy by processing data locally on users' own devices.
        *Implication:* Privacy-focused approach would differentiate from cloud AI services but restrict capabilities to what mobile hardware can support.
    c) Ultra-accessible agent creation through intuitive mobile interfaces that don't require coding skills.
        *Implication:* Democratizing agent creation aligns with our mission but might dilute our position with technical developers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Cross-Platform Distribution Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** There's a strategic opportunity to improve elizaOS's visibility and community engagement through a coordinated cross-platform content strategy, but uncertainty about resource allocation and primary channels.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which content distribution channels should be prioritized for maximum community growth?

  **Context:**
  - `Create a blog for Eliza Labs content to generate search traffic (Mentioned by DorianD)`
  - `Implement cross-platform distribution strategy across multiple social platforms (Mentioned by DorianD)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on technical platforms (GitHub, HackerNews, AI research forums) to strengthen developer adoption first.
        *Implication:* Developer-first approach would build solid technical foundation but might slow mainstream adoption.
    b) Prioritize AI-native social platforms (Farcaster, specialized Discord servers) where early adopters congregate.
        *Implication:* Targeting AI enthusiasts would reach qualified users but might create an echo chamber effect.
    c) Distribute across mainstream platforms (X, LinkedIn, Reddit) while using SEO-optimized blog as central hub.
        *Implication:* Broad approach would maximize reach but could dilute messaging and strain content creation resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we create agent-generated content as a showcase of elizaOS capabilities?

  **Context:**
  - `Create a weekly newsletter for the email list (Mentioned by DorianD)`
  - `Observations about cryptocurrency trends and migration of crypto activity to Farcaster`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, deploy agents to create newsletters, social posts, and market analysis as practical demonstrations.
        *Implication:* Living demonstrations would prove our technology's value but risks showcasing limitations if agent output quality is inconsistent.
    b) Partially, use agents to curate content and assist human creators rather than generating final content.
        *Implication:* Human-AI collaboration would ensure quality but doesn't fully showcase autonomous capabilities central to our vision.
    c) Not yet, focus on perfecting agent capabilities before using them for public-facing content generation.
        *Implication:* Quality-first approach protects brand reputation but misses opportunity to demonstrate current capabilities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

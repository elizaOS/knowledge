# Council Briefing: 2025-05-18

## Daily Focus Theme

- ElizaOS v2 release imminent with ELI5 integration as core agent, requiring strategic decisions on prioritizing shipping speed versus documentation completeness.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. ElizaOS v2 Deployment Strategy: Speed vs. Completeness

**Summary:** The community is debating whether to prioritize quickly shipping ElizaOS v2 (also called 1.0.0) or taking more time for comprehensive documentation, with potential impact on user adoption and community experience.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: xell0x stated 'Eli5, eddy, degenai will be ai agents you can directly interact with on the elizaos v2 terminal or better known as eliza 1.0.0'`
- `Discord: xell0x suggested shipping v2 as highest priority and producing documentation after release rather than delaying`

**Potential Questions:**
- Given our goal to attract new users, should we prioritize a rapid but potentially less documented v2 release, or delay for more comprehensive onboarding?
- How does the integration of ELI5 as a community manager affect the urgency of the v2 release timeline?

### 2. Agent Adoption: Technical Barriers and Integration Challenges

**Summary:** Users are encountering multiple technical barriers when configuring and deploying agents, ranging from API compatibility issues to plugin integration problems, potentially inhibiting our goal of broader agent adoption.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: techcomthanh reported issues with API configuration (OpenRouter vs OpenAI compatibility), agents tweeting in loops, and relationship creation`
- `Discord: starlord shared workarounds for character configuration, mentioning 'placing character configs in root folder and using CLI command works, though with bugs'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we balance the technical complexity needed for agent capabilities with the accessibility required for mainstream adoption?
- Should we redirect resources to creating more standardized deployment templates at the expense of new features?

### 3. Information Infrastructure as Agent Foundation

**Summary:** A critical infrastructure for agent intelligence is emerging with new tools to aggregate information across platforms, aligning with our goal of taming scattered information and enabling more capable agents.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Jin is developing an all-in-one news site with facts extraction, multi-repo aggregation, agent RAG, and Discord webhooks integration`
- `Twitter: @dankvr created 'an AI powered book for news/updates from the @elizaos ecosystem' that summarizes GitHub, Discord, and X content`

**Potential Questions:**
- How should we balance resources between agent capability development and the information infrastructure that powers their intelligence?
- What governance structures should we implement for these information aggregation systems to ensure quality while maintaining decentralization?

### 4. Ecosystem Token Strategy: Auto.fun and ELI5

**Summary:** The current valuation of ecosystem tokens like ELI5 (currently at ~400k market cap) may significantly impact adoption and sustainability of auto.fun, with potential for dramatic value increase once integrated with ElizaOS v2.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: xell0x suggested ELI5 is 'significantly undervalued at its current market cap' and will serve as community manager AI in v2`
- `Discord: xell0x proposed spotlighting top auto.fun-born tokens (like eli5 and eddy) to drive adoption`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we balance the potential for token appreciation with the need for sustainable economics in our agent ecosystem?
- Should we more explicitly position ELI5 as the flagship token for community management capabilities, potentially at the expense of other specialized agent tokens?

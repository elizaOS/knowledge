# Council Briefing: 2025-07-05

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The elizaOS team has released v1.0.17 with significant UI/UX improvements and developer experience enhancements while progressing toward v2 stabilization in parallel with X/Twitter account restoration efforts.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: ElizaOS V2 Readiness Assessment

**Summary of Topic:** ElizaOS V2 continues to be in beta with ongoing stabilization efforts, with parallel development of multiple features including agentic hackathon platforms, founding father agents, and AI-generated content systems.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should be our communication strategy regarding the status of ElizaOS V2?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk clarified that V2 has been in beta since March with hackathons and production agents already using it`
  - `jin confirmed that V2 is usable now, with ongoing stabilization efforts`
  - `Some users expressing frustration about perceived delays while others defending the development timeline`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Emphasize that V2 is already here in beta form and share specific success stories from early adopters.
        *Implication:* This builds confidence in V2's current maturity but may create expectations of full stability before we're ready.
    b) Focus communication on the technical improvements in V2 without specific timelines, highlighting incremental releases like v1.0.17.
        *Implication:* This maintains flexibility for the development team but might not satisfy users eager for a definitive timeline.
    c) Clearly define a final V2 release date with detailed feature scope to align community expectations.
        *Implication:* This provides clarity but creates significant pressure to meet the deadline regardless of stabilization status.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which V2 capability should we prioritize showcasing to drive adoption of auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Progress on founding father agents for July 4th and an agentic hackathon platform to test V2`
  - `Content Generation: Fully automated news show capabilities with source gathering, summarization, translation, animation, voice, and publishing`
  - `Speech Technology: Significant progress in low-latency open-source TTS and STT, enabling human+AI podcast possibilities`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Fully automated AI news show capability, demonstrating content generation and publishing workflows.
        *Implication:* This showcases a complete end-to-end workflow that could attract media-focused creators to auto.fun.
    b) Founding father agents with agentic governance systems, appealing to DAO builders and governance innovators.
        *Implication:* This could position auto.fun as a platform for launching autonomous organizations rather than just tokens.
    c) Low-latency speech technology enabling human+AI podcasts and streaming interactions.
        *Implication:* This could make auto.fun attractive to content creators and streamers looking for AI-native tools.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Platform Marketing & Distribution Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The team is dealing with suspended X/Twitter accounts while developing new channels for updates and working to enhance project visibility through clearer communication and documentation.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we adapt our marketing strategy during the X/Twitter account suspension period?

  **Context:**
  - `The team is working to restore suspended X/Twitter accounts, expected to regain access within a week`
  - `A new builder updates announcement channel has been created to separate technical updates from general announcements`
  - `The team has been active on Farcaster while X accounts are suspended`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Double down on Farcaster with increased posting frequency and engagement, potentially making it our primary social platform.
        *Implication:* This could build a more engaged crypto-native audience but might not reach the broader mainstream awareness X/Twitter provides.
    b) Create temporary social handles on other platforms (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) to maintain momentum while X/Twitter is restored.
        *Implication:* This expands our reach to new audiences but requires significant additional content creation resources.
    c) Focus inward on documentation and product improvement until X/Twitter is restored, then launch a major marketing push.
        *Implication:* This consolidates resources but risks losing momentum and letting competitors fill the conversation gap.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we improve our communication channels for different audience segments?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members expressed concerns about difficulty finding clear updates on project status`
  - `A GitHub knowledge repository is available with daily/weekly/monthly summaries`
  - `A new builder updates announcement channel has been created to separate technical updates from general announcements`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create audience-specific communication channels (technical, investor, general) with tailored content and frequency.
        *Implication:* This addresses different information needs but risks creating silos and requires more content creation resources.
    b) Develop an AI-powered dashboard that personalizes project updates based on user preferences and technical background.
        *Implication:* This showcases our own technology while solving the information overload problem but requires significant development resources.
    c) Standardize on a single source of truth (GitHub knowledge repo) with consistent weekly summaries for all audiences.
        *Implication:* This simplifies information management but may not meet the needs of non-technical users wanting more accessible updates.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Token Utility & Community Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The community is actively discussing potential token utility enhancements including burning mechanisms, liquidity management, and governance features, indicating interest in long-term tokenomics strategy.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What token utility approach should we implement to drive value for holders while supporting the auto.fun ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members discussed burning JIMMY tokens to create deflationary tokenomics`
  - `Debate about whether burning or adding to liquidity pools is more beneficial`
  - `Discussion about implementing an "incinerator" feature on autofun for token burning`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a token burning mechanism that reduces supply based on auto.fun platform usage metrics.
        *Implication:* This creates deflationary pressure but doesn't necessarily enrich the platform's functionality or network effects.
    b) Develop an AI compute credit system where tokens can be staked for priority access to advanced features and computing resources.
        *Implication:* This creates utility aligned with our core product but requires significant technical infrastructure to implement.
    c) Build governance mechanisms allowing token holders to vote on which agents and features receive development resources.
        *Implication:* This aligns with our DAO vision but might slow decision-making processes during critical growth phases.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we structure the development of the auto.fun launchpad to maximize both adoption and token value?

  **Context:**
  - `Reference to JIMMY with a 3.3% burn rate`
  - `Dr. Neuro mentioned a group exists for holders with 1M+ tokens via auto.fun`
  - `Discussion about whether the token has meaningful use cases beyond funding development`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on developing high-quality pre-built agent templates that demonstrate immediate value to new projects launching on auto.fun.
        *Implication:* This creates a practical utility showcase but requires significant upfront investment in template development.
    b) Create tiered token-gating with exclusive features and early access for larger holders to incentivize token accumulation.
        *Implication:* This directly rewards token holders but risks creating a system that favors whales over broader community adoption.
    c) Implement a revenue sharing model where auto.fun fees are distributed to token holders based on staking duration.
        *Implication:* This creates direct financial incentives but could complicate regulatory compliance in certain jurisdictions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

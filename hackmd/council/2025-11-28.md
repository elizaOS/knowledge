# Council Briefing: 2025-11-28

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The technical team successfully merged a significant security infrastructure upgrade (Entity-level RLS & Security Improvements) that strengthens elizaOS v2's data isolation and multi-tenant capabilities while making progress on token migration coordination with exchanges.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The token migration from AI16Z to ELIZAOS is creating frustration among users due to unclear communication and varying levels of exchange support, with particular issues around the November 11th snapshot and exchanges allowing trading after this date.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize our approach to resolving migration issues with centralized exchanges?

  **Context:**
  - `Kraken's token swap is in progress, with the team coordinating with their communications team`
  - `Users from Bithumb are seeking updates on migration support`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus resources on establishing clear migration protocols with Tier 1 exchanges (Kraken, etc.) first, then address smaller exchanges.
        *Implication:* This would serve the majority of holders but might further alienate users on smaller exchanges like Bithumb who are already expressing frustration.
    b) Establish a standardized manual migration process for all users regardless of exchange, reducing dependency on exchange cooperation.
        *Implication:* This puts more operational burden on our team but gives users a consistent fallback option that doesn't depend on exchange timelines.
    c) Extend the migration window beyond 90 days and increase transparency with daily updates on exchange-specific migration progress.
        *Implication:* This reduces immediate pressure but could delay stabilization of the new token's market activity and increases communication overhead.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What measures should we implement to improve communication around the token migration process?

  **Context:**
  - `Some frustration expressed about lack of clear communication regarding migration timelines`
  - `Questions raised about who was responsible for an unannounced snapshot related to migration`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a real-time migration status dashboard showing exchange-by-exchange progress and eligibility criteria.
        *Implication:* This technical solution addresses transparency but requires development resources that could otherwise focus on elizaOS v2 completion.
    b) Appoint a dedicated migration community liaison to provide daily updates across all channels and handle user support tickets.
        *Implication:* This human-centered approach improves user satisfaction but increases operational overhead and may still not resolve technical migration issues.
    c) Create comprehensive migration documentation including FAQ, decision history, and clarify eligibility rules with step-by-step guides for different user scenarios.
        *Implication:* This documentation-focused approach scales well but relies on users seeking out information rather than proactive outreach.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How can we leverage the token migration to strengthen user engagement with auto.fun and other ecosystem products?

  **Context:**
  - `Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity`
  - `Suggestion that elizaOS might be used for Discord verification in the future`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Offer migration incentives tied to auto.fun participation, such as additional tokens or features for migrated users who deploy agents.
        *Implication:* This directly connects migration to our monthly goal but may be seen as unfair by users who experience migration difficulties.
    b) Develop and showcase auto.fun integration tools that specifically leverage the new ELIZAOS token's features.
        *Implication:* This focuses on technical integration that delivers value but may delay addressing immediate migration concerns.
    c) Create a temporary community-building initiative where successfully migrated users can contribute to a collective auto.fun agent showcase.
        *Implication:* This builds community around both the migration process and our monthly goal, but requires coordination resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on the enterprise-readiness narrative, highlighting how these security features enable multi-tenant SaaS deployments with proper data isolation.
        *Implication:* This positions elizaOS for enterprise adoption but might seem less relevant to individual developers and the crypto community.
    b) Emphasize privacy protection for end-users, showcasing how agent data remains secure even in shared environments.
        *Implication:* This resonates with privacy-conscious users but might undersell the technical sophistication of the implementation.
    c) Frame it as foundational infrastructure enabling future automated governance capabilities, connecting security to the autonomous DAO vision.

# Council Briefing: 2025-02-04

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The fleet is shipping rapidly, but reliability debt—especially around v0.1.9 stability and social (Twitter/X) behaviors—is now the primary threat to developer trust and must be contained with a stabilization push.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Release Stability & Dependency Hygiene (v0.1.9 Aftershocks)

**Summary of Topic:** Velocity remains high (PR throughput and contributor count), yet field reports show users reverting due to initialization failures, embedding dimension mismatches, and client/plugin instability—indicating release quality gates lag behind shipping pace.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the Council declare a short-term “Stability Lock” where only bugfixes and test coverage merges are permitted until top installer/runtime failures drop below a defined threshold?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord coders: "Multiple users reported problems with ElizaOS v0.1.9... some reverting to v0.1.8 due to initialization failures, embedding errors, and client connection issues" (2025-02-03).`
  - `GitHub activity: 2025-02-04 notes multiple new issues and ongoing plugin test coverage gaps (e.g., Cronos/Conflux) alongside fixes shipped.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—declare a 7–14 day Stability Lock with explicit exit criteria (top issues resolved + install success target).
        *Implication:* Improves developer trust and reduces support burden, at the cost of slower feature velocity and some contributor frustration.
    b) Partial—lock only core runtime and CLI; allow plugin features to continue with stricter review.
        *Implication:* Preserves ecosystem momentum while protecting the most user-visible reliability surfaces.
    c) No—continue shipping, but expand triage capacity and publish workarounds in docs.
        *Implication:* Maximizes shipping pace, but risks compounding trust loss if new regressions outpace guidance.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Do we standardize and enforce a single “blessed” runtime matrix (Node/Bun/OS) for official support, even if it reduces immediate accessibility?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord: "Node version 23.3.0 is consistently recommended for proper ElizaOS functioning" (2025-02-01 to 2025-02-03).`
  - `GitHub issues referenced: Docker errors on Mac M1 (#3239) and deployment/build errors (#3212).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Enforce a strict supported matrix (e.g., Node 23.3.0 + specific Docker base images), and label everything else “best effort.”
        *Implication:* Reduces variability and accelerates fixes, but may alienate some builders on older stacks.
    b) Publish a primary matrix but keep compatibility as a goal; invest in CI for Mac/Windows/Linux parity.
        *Implication:* Balances DX inclusivity with realism, but requires ongoing infra and maintenance effort.
    c) Avoid hard standards; rely on community troubleshooting and documentation updates.
        *Implication:* Keeps the tent wide, but perpetuates high support load and inconsistent user outcomes.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How aggressively should we migrate/guard against embedding dimension mismatches (auto-migrate DB vs. fail-fast with clear tooling)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord coders: "Vector dimension mismatch" SQLite error workaround: delete data/db.sqlite (warfreakzplays).`
  - `Action item: "Fix vector dimension mismatch in SQLite by ensuring consistent embedding models" (validsyntax).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Auto-migrate (version embeddings + rebuild vectors transparently where possible).
        *Implication:* Best UX and fewer support requests, but introduces complexity and potential silent data churn.
    b) Fail-fast with a guided migration command (e.g., `eliza db migrate-embeddings`) and explicit prompts.
        *Implication:* Keeps behavior explicit and safe, while still offering a clean developer workflow.
    c) Document the manual deletion/reset approach as the standard for now.
        *Implication:* Fastest to implement, but harms trust and makes production deployments feel fragile.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Twitter/X Client Hardening & Safety Controls

**Summary of Topic:** We shipped new controls for Twitter post generation, but the integration remains a frequent failure point (formatting errors, repeated default replies, media issues), threatening flagship agent reliability and public-facing reputation.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should Twitter post generation be OFF by default across all templates until we achieve reliability targets, even if it reduces agent “virality”?

  **Context:**
  - `PR: "Add configuration for enabling/disabling Twitter post generation" (#3219).`
  - `New issue: "formatting errors in Twitter posts and replies" (#3245); recurring reply bug (#3252) referenced in 2025-02-04 triage.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—default OFF; require explicit opt-in and a preflight checklist.
        *Implication:* Prevents public failures and protects brand trust, but slows growth loops for social agents.
    b) Keep default ON, but throttle and add stronger validation/sanitization to prevent malformed posts.
        *Implication:* Maintains distribution, but continues reputational risk if edge cases still slip through.
    c) Default depends on environment: ON for local/dev, OFF for production unless enabled.
        *Implication:* Offers safe defaults where it matters while keeping the developer “wow” moment intact.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Do we prioritize a first-class “Twitter reliability suite” (E2E tests, deterministic formatting, media upload checks) over adding new chain/plugins?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord coders action item: "Fix Twitter client media attachment functionality" (warfreakzplays).`
  - `GitHub: multiple Twitter-related issues noted (#3202, #3245, #3252) and PRs around tweet retrieval/proxy controls.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—treat Twitter as a flagship integration and resource it like a tier-1 product surface.
        *Implication:* Raises quality of the most visible agents, but delays breadth expansion elsewhere.
    b) Split-track: a small strike team for Twitter reliability while plugin expansion continues.
        *Implication:* Limits opportunity cost, but risks under-resourcing the systemic fixes Twitter likely needs.
    c) No—deprioritize Twitter and encourage third-party/community maintenance for now.
        *Implication:* Protects core roadmap capacity, but weakens the perceived completeness of the framework.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we formally support proxy-based X access (regional + throttling mitigation) as a documented pattern, or keep it unofficial due to policy risk?

  **Context:**
  - `PR list references: "Implemented Twitter proxy URL functionality" (#3242).`
  - `Discord: "Twitter login failures when running on VPS in different regions" and "Twitter scraping optimization to avoid throttling" (Vyce).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Officially support proxy configuration with clear boundaries and compliance guidance.
        *Implication:* Improves real-world uptime, but increases policy/compliance complexity and potential platform friction.
    b) Document as “experimental/advanced” with warnings; do not guarantee support.
        *Implication:* Gives builders tools without over-committing the project to brittle external dependencies.
    c) Do not document; keep proxy hooks internal and focus on API-first integrations.
        *Implication:* Reduces exposure to platform risk, but leaves many users stranded in common deployment scenarios.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Information Taming, Docs Uptime, and RAG as a Trust Primitive

**Summary of Topic:** Our knowledge infrastructure is advancing (large-scale Discord summarization, Muse search), but public docs availability and link integrity are failing (elizas.com down, broken links), undermining the “Developer First” covenant.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we treat documentation uptime and link integrity as a production SLO, with an on-call rotation and automated monitoring?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord: "Users reported that elizas.com appears to be down"; redirects to elizaos.ai/docs (BOSSU).`
  - `Action items: "Fix broken documentation links" and "Fix broken 'Learn about elizaOS' link on elizaOS.ai/framework" (NicoRusso, px).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—define SLOs and add monitoring/alerts for docs domains and key paths.
        *Implication:* Reinforces developer trust through operational discipline, but requires sustained ops investment.
    b) Partial—monitor only critical onboarding paths (Quickstart, install, plugin list) and accept best-effort for the rest.
        *Implication:* Focuses on the highest leverage surfaces while limiting ops overhead.
    c) No—keep docs as community-maintained; prioritize code and rely on GitHub pages as fallback.
        *Implication:* Minimizes ops burden, but perpetuates churn in support channels and weakens DX credibility.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should Muse/search RAG be constrained to avoid hallucinations and misinformation while still feeling powerful?

  **Context:**
  - `Partners channel: Muse introduced as "a Perplexity-like search interface" (muse.elizawakesup.ai).`
  - `jin: "Improve RAG capabilities for Muse search" and prioritize sources like elizaos.github.io/eliza.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Hard-allowlist sources (docs + vetted repos) and show citations by default.
        *Implication:* Maximizes trust and accuracy, but reduces breadth and “web-scale” usefulness.
    b) Hybrid: allow broader sources but assign confidence scores and route low-confidence answers to “needs verification.”
        *Implication:* Balances usefulness with safety, but requires extra UX and ranking logic to be credible.
    c) Open retrieval with minimal constraints; prioritize speed and coverage first.
        *Implication:* Accelerates feature adoption, but risks compounding misinformation and weakening the project’s authority.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we invest now in a governance-grade knowledge pipeline (HackMD plugin + living “State of the DAO” doc), or postpone until core stability improves?

  **Context:**
  - `Action item: "Create a HackMD plugin for ElizaOS to transfer summarized chats to editable documents" (jin).`
  - `Action item: "Create a 'state of the DAO' document" (DorianD).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Invest now—information coherence is a prerequisite for execution excellence and coordinated shipping.
        *Implication:* Improves alignment and reduces repeated debates, but competes for engineering time with stability work.
    b) Timebox a minimal version (one pipeline, one canonical doc) while keeping most focus on core reliability.
        *Implication:* Creates a single source of truth without derailing stabilization priorities.
    c) Postpone—stabilize framework first; governance tooling can follow once the platform is quiet.
        *Implication:* Reduces immediate scope, but risks losing institutional memory and continuing fragmented decision-making.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

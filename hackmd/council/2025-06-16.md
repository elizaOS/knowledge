# Council Briefing: 2025-06-16

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- ElizaOS achieved a significant architectural milestone by splitting server functionality into a dedicated package, enhancing modularity while maintaining backward compatibility with existing CLI integrations.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Twitter Account Suspension Crisis

**Summary of Topic:** ElizaOS's Twitter account with 149K followers has been suspended due to API policy violations, severely impacting project visibility and community engagement while the team works on restoration and alternative communication channels.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize our response to the Twitter account suspension?

  **Context:**
  - `辞尘鸽鸽: We haven't abandoned the Twitter account. We're treating this as urgent and have contacted X to expedite resolution. Farcaster is only being prepared as a backup option.`
  - `Community members debated whether to fight for restoration or focus on alternative platforms.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Continue prioritizing account restoration with X while minimizing public discussion of the issue.
        *Implication:* Maintains focus on the established channel but risks extended communication limitations if resolution is delayed.
    b) Split resources equally between X restoration and rapidly building presence on Farcaster and other platforms.
        *Implication:* Balances recovery efforts with contingency development, but may dilute effectiveness of both approaches.
    c) Shift primary focus to Farcaster and other platforms while maintaining minimal effort on X restoration.
        *Implication:* Accelerates transition to alternative engagement channels but risks abandoning significant existing follower base.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What social media strategy would best mitigate future platform-specific risks?

  **Context:**
  - `The team is planning to deploy communications across multiple platforms.`
  - `Odilitime: We're going to deploy more communications on more platforms.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Deep integration with 2-3 core social platforms with custom-built plugins and high engagement.
        *Implication:* Creates stronger presence on fewer platforms but maintains platform dependency risks.
    b) Equal presence across 5-7 platforms with automated cross-posting and minimal platform-specific optimization.
        *Implication:* Maximizes reach but may result in generic content that doesn't leverage platform-specific advantages.
    c) Develop an independent on-chain social layer that pushes content to various platforms while maintaining user relationships in our ecosystem.
        *Implication:* Provides true platform independence but requires significant development resources and may limit initial reach.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Server Package Modularization

**Summary of Topic:** The team has successfully split server functionality into a separate package, enhancing framework modularity and enabling independent usage of server components while maintaining backward compatibility.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we leverage the newly modularized server architecture to enhance our product offerings?

  **Context:**
  - `Split server functionality into separate `@elizaos/server` package while maintaining backward compatibility with existing CLI integrations`
  - `Enables independent usage of server components`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on enterprise deployments by offering specialized server configurations for high-throughput, multi-agent environments.
        *Implication:* Opens potential revenue streams from enterprise clients but may shift focus away from community-driven development.
    b) Develop cloud-hosted elizaOS instances that lower technical barriers for casual users and creators.
        *Implication:* Broadens the potential user base but introduces infrastructure costs and maintenance responsibilities.
    c) Create module-specific documentation and starter templates to encourage third-party development of specialized server extensions.
        *Implication:* Leverages community innovation but may lead to ecosystem fragmentation without clear standards.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What additional architectural improvements should we prioritize to further enhance elizaOS v2's production readiness?

  **Context:**
  - `Added detailed tests to core, server, project-starter and plugin-starter components`
  - `Implemented strict typing in CLI package and fixed type issues`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize error handling and logging across all modules to improve debugging and observability.
        *Implication:* Enhances system reliability but requires significant refactoring across the codebase.
    b) Implement comprehensive performance benchmarking and optimization for multi-agent environments.
        *Implication:* Improves scalability for complex agent ecosystems but may delay releases of new features.
    c) Focus on streamlining the plugin development experience with improved tooling and documentation.
        *Implication:* Accelerates ecosystem growth through third-party development but may divert resources from core platform improvements.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Spartan Product Launch Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** Spartan is nearing its first product release with a focus on DeFi and trading tools, featuring a separate technical stack but integrated into the larger elizaOS ecosystem as a key user attraction point.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should be the primary focus for Spartan's initial product launch?

  **Context:**
  - `Spartan is nearing its first product release, focused on DeFi and trading tools`
  - `It's described as a separate stack from ElizaOS with different architecture`
  - `The first Spartan product will be "very simple" with plans to iterate based on community feedback`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Technical excellence and reliability, even at the cost of delayed launch and fewer initial features.
        *Implication:* Builds reputation for quality but risks losing market momentum and continued user interest.
    b) Rapid launch with core functionality only, emphasizing quick iteration based on user feedback.
        *Implication:* Accelerates time-to-market and user engagement but may create perception issues if early versions have significant limitations.
    c) Strategic partnership integrations that demonstrate immediate real-world utility with existing DeFi protocols.
        *Implication:* Provides immediate value proposition but creates dependencies on external projects and potential complications.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we position Spartan's trading functionality within the broader elizaOS ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime: V2 is out of beta with lots of developers starting to use it. Spartan is about to have its first product release.`
  - `Jin: Create agent trading competition with measurable outcomes`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) As an advanced example of elizaOS capabilities, emphasizing the technical integration and extensibility.
        *Implication:* Appeals to developers and technical users but may not resonate with mainstream traders and investors.
    b) As a gamified trading competition platform with leaderboards and social features to attract users to auto.fun.
        *Implication:* Drives engagement through competition but may emphasize entertainment over serious trading utility.
    c) As a professional-grade trading intelligence tool that leverages AI for market analysis and strategy execution.
        *Implication:* Positions the product for serious traders but creates expectations of sophisticated performance and reliability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-02-15

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- With feature velocity effectively paused, the Council’s critical event is a reliability triage cycle—addressing a client blank-screen failure and a Render deployment port-scanning error to protect developer trust and shipping credibility.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Reliability Triage: Client UI Blank-Screen + Hosted Deployment Failures

**Summary of Topic:** Two new user-blocking issues surfaced (client renders a blank page; Render reports “No Ports found”), with no new feature work shipped—indicating a short-term stability inversion that threatens the “Execution Excellence” mandate if not resolved quickly and visibly.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we declare a short stability lockdown (triage-only) until client + deployment paths are green across common environments?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub daily summary (2025-02-15): “no new features or bug fixes… two new issues… client interface displaying a blank page… ‘No Ports found’ error during agent deployment on Render.”`
  - `Issue #3513: “Client displaying a blank page and console errors when starting the client after installation.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—impose a stability lockdown until the top 3 user-blocking issues are resolved and verified on CI + quickstart paths.
        *Implication:* Reinforces trust-through-shipping and reduces churn, but temporarily slows roadmap optics.
    b) Partial—continue planned work, but assign an on-call strike team to resolve blockers within 48 hours.
        *Implication:* Balances momentum with reliability, but risks prolonged user pain if fixes slip.
    c) No—treat these as routine issues; prioritize feature delivery and address bugs opportunistically.
        *Implication:* Maximizes short-term velocity but contradicts the “reliability over features” principle and may erode builder confidence.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we formalize an “official deployment matrix” (Node version, ports, Docker base image, adapters) and gate releases on it?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord coders: “Which node version is used… Node v23.3.0.” (Tobiloba)`
  - `Issue #3514: “Port scanning error… ‘No Ports found’… on Render, despite successful local operation.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—publish and enforce an official matrix (Node 23.x, port conventions, Docker guidance) with CI smoke tests.
        *Implication:* Improves DX predictability and reduces support load, at the cost of added CI maintenance.
    b) Publish guidance but do not gate releases; keep matrix “best-effort” and community-maintained.
        *Implication:* Faster shipping, but recurring environment bugs will persist and fragment community advice.
    c) Defer matrix work until V2; focus on core architecture first.
        *Implication:* May save effort if V2 changes assumptions, but risks compounding user frustration in the interim.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How do we convert today’s breakages into a visible trust-building moment (documentation + rapid verification loops)?

  **Context:**
  - `Daily report (2025-02-14): “A new remote deployment guide has been added… (PR #3501).”`
  - `Daily report (2025-02-14): “Client UI improvements implemented (PR #3496).”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship a “Known Issues + Fix Status” bulletin and update the remote deployment guide with Render-specific steps and port requirements.
        *Implication:* Demonstrates operational transparency and reduces repeated support questions.
    b) Prioritize code fixes only; keep comms minimal until resolution is complete.
        *Implication:* Avoids noisy updates, but may look like silence during outages and reduce perceived reliability.
    c) Route all updates through Discord only to keep momentum and avoid permanent docs churn.
        *Implication:* Fast feedback loop, but violates “documentation as a first-class citizen” and makes knowledge ephemeral.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Architecture Drift Control: Plugin Extraction + Character/Vector Schema Stabilization

**Summary of Topic:** The codebase is actively re-aligning around externalized plugins and cleaner character management (e.g., deleting in-repo plugins, moving characters to a submodule, and introducing embedding dimension/schema updates), but this transition amplifies compatibility risk unless accompanied by strong versioning and migration guidance.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we accelerate the full plugin extraction to the elizaos-plugins org, even if it causes short-term friction, to achieve long-term composability?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #3508: “Delete plugins from the codebase.”`
  - `Discord (2025-02-12): “Plugins have been moved to separate repositories to enable more permissionless and scalable plugin development.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate—complete extraction quickly and invest in migration tooling + docs to absorb the shock.
        *Implication:* Reaches the open/composable target sooner, but requires disciplined release engineering to avoid ecosystem breakage.
    b) Stage the extraction—keep a curated “core bundle” of critical plugins until Cloud + V2 stabilize.
        *Implication:* Reduces breakage risk and improves onboarding, but delays full permissionless expansion.
    c) Pause extraction—keep plugins in the monorepo until V2 ships to reduce moving parts.
        *Implication:* Simplifies short-term maintenance, but conflicts with the composability principle and slows ecosystem growth.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should embedding dimension + character schema enforcement be treated as a hard contract (fail fast) or a flexible contract (auto-migrate and warn)?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #3486: “Vector Dimensions & Character Schema Updates… Embedding dimension issue solved and tested… Character schema updated with name as unique identifier.”`
  - `Discord coders: “vector mismatch errors… resolved by switching from SQLite to MongoDB or by using different embedding models.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Hard contract—fail fast with explicit errors and a guided remediation path.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability and reduces silent corruption, but can frustrate beginners without excellent UX.
    b) Flexible—attempt auto-migration/compat shims, warn loudly, and collect telemetry for edge cases.
        *Implication:* Smoother onboarding, but risks hidden inconsistencies and harder debugging later.
    c) Hybrid—fail fast in production/Cloud; auto-migrate in dev mode with an explicit ‘unsafe’ flag.
        *Implication:* Aligns with execution excellence while preserving developer experimentation pathways.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Who governs the plugin registry quality bar (security, maintenance, compatibility), and how strict should admission be?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-14): “There’s a plugin registry at https://github.com/elizaos-plugins.” (Patt)`
  - `Daily report (2025-02-14): “Several PRs were merged successfully” (plugin-related activity).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Council-curated registry: strict checks (CI, semver, security review) for ‘official’ tier plugins.
        *Implication:* Strengthens trust and reliability, but may slow ecosystem velocity and increase maintainer workload.
    b) Two-tier registry: open admission to ‘community’ tier; stricter requirements for ‘certified’ tier.
        *Implication:* Balances openness with trust, creating a clear pathway for maturation.
    c) Fully permissionless registry with minimal checks; rely on community reputation and usage signals.
        *Implication:* Maximizes composability, but increases risk of broken/unsafe plugins damaging the brand.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Trust Surface & Narrative: Brand Consolidation, Token Rename Constraints, and Agent Compliance

**Summary of Topic:** Operational chatter highlights unresolved identity strategy (ElizaOS vs ai16zdao), legal constraints around token renaming communications, and platform-risk events like DegenAI’s X suspension—together forming a single trust surface that can amplify or undermine developer adoption and ecosystem legitimacy.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we consolidate to one public identity now (single X account + consistent brand kit), or maintain a dual-channel identity until governance and token migration settle?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord partners: “Most partners favor consolidation… likely within a week.” (jasyn_bjorn)`
  - `Discord branding: “ElizaOS = professional/technical (blue)… ai16zdao = investment DAO/crypto culture (orange).” (jin)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Consolidate immediately under ElizaOS branding; treat DAO identity as a secondary page later.
        *Implication:* Reduces confusion and improves DX trust, but may alienate the memetic/DAO audience short-term.
    b) Maintain dual identity with explicit positioning and a shared landing hub that routes audiences.
        *Implication:* Preserves both audiences, but requires strong comms discipline to avoid narrative fragmentation.
    c) Temporarily go “single voice” operationally (one account), while keeping brand separation internally.
        *Implication:* Minimizes external confusion now while allowing internal specialization to mature.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Given legal constraints on token communications, what is the Council-approved narrative framework to preserve trust without triggering compliance risk?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord partners: “Legal constraints prevent explicit promotion before the official ticker change.” (jasyn_bjorn)`
  - `Discord partners: “Complete token renaming from ai16z to elizaOS… dependent on daos.fun to fix issues first.” (jin)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt a ‘product-first’ narrative: emphasize reliability, Cloud, and developer outcomes; reference token only via formal channels.
        *Implication:* Aligns with execution excellence and reduces legal exposure, but may frustrate token-focused stakeholders.
    b) Publish a compliance-reviewed FAQ that explains constraints and timelines, including what cannot be said and why.
        *Implication:* Boosts transparency and reduces rumor cycles, but requires careful legal coordination.
    c) Delay all public narrative changes until ticker/name migration is complete; operate quietly.
        *Implication:* Minimizes compliance risk, but cedes narrative control to speculation and competitors.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should ElizaOS adopt an explicit “agent compliance policy” (automation disclosure, guardrails like compliance agents) as a platform standard, not just a V2 feature?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord V2: “a compliance agent preventing a social media agent from posting problematic content.” (shaw)`
  - `Discord: “DegenAI’s Twitter account was suspended… speculation… because it wasn’t disclosed that the account is automated.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—standardize compliance/automation disclosure guidelines and ship default guardrail templates for social clients.
        *Implication:* Reduces platform bans and reputational damage, strengthening trust for builders deploying autonomous agents.
    b) Recommend but do not enforce—provide optional templates and documentation only.
        *Implication:* Preserves builder freedom, but leaves ecosystem exposed to preventable enforcement actions.
    c) Defer to V2—treat compliance agents as a future capability rather than a platform policy now.
        *Implication:* Avoids policy overhead, but risks repeated platform suspensions undermining reliability claims.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

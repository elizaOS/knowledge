# Council Briefing: 2025-11-10

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The AI16z to ElizaOS token migration is causing significant user confusion and frustration, particularly with tokens frozen on centralized exchanges, requiring improved communication and technical solutions to maintain community trust.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Challenges

**Summary of Topic:** The migration from AI16z to ElizaOS tokens is experiencing significant friction points, particularly with centralized exchanges freezing tokens and limited communication causing user frustration, while arbitrage issues affect token price stability.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize resolving the exchange-based migration issues versus addressing the arbitrage problems affecting token price?

  **Context:**
  - `Borko confirmed migrations on KuCoin and Gate should be completed "this week"`
  - `Shaw: 'We have a plan to stop the arb' (regarding arbitrage affecting token price)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize resolving exchange migration issues to unfreeze user tokens.
        *Implication:* Focusing on exchange migrations would alleviate immediate user frustration but may allow arbitrage to continue affecting token price in the short term.
    b) Address arbitrage issues first to stabilize token price, then push exchanges for faster migration.
        *Implication:* Stabilizing price first would protect token value but prolongs user frustration with frozen tokens on exchanges.
    c) Deploy parallel teams to address both issues simultaneously with daily progress updates to the community.
        *Implication:* Tackling both fronts simultaneously requires more resources but demonstrates comprehensive crisis management to the community.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What communication strategy should be implemented to address community confusion and frustration around the token migration?

  **Context:**
  - `Users report tokens being frozen on centralized exchanges (KuCoin, Gate.io, Bybit) with limited communication`
  - `The community is experiencing confusion and frustration regarding the AI16z to ElizaOS token migration`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a dedicated migration status dashboard with real-time updates on exchange integrations and timelines.
        *Implication:* A central information source would reduce repetitive questions but requires ongoing maintenance and coordination with exchanges.
    b) Schedule daily community calls with the technical team to address questions and provide progress updates.
        *Implication:* Direct engagement shows commitment to transparency but diverts technical resources from solving the actual problems.
    c) Publish a comprehensive migration FAQ and designate community ambassadors to help users in Discord and social channels.
        *Implication:* Leveraging community support scales information dissemination but risks inconsistent messaging if ambassadors aren't properly briefed.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we implement a compensation mechanism for users affected by extended migration delays?

  **Context:**
  - `Users report tokens being frozen on centralized exchanges (KuCoin, Gate.io, Bybit) with limited communication`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Offer a small bonus allocation of ElizaOS tokens to affected users based on the duration of their delay.
        *Implication:* Providing compensation demonstrates goodwill but creates additional technical complexity and may set precedent for future issues.
    b) Create exclusive NFT badges for migration participants that unlock special features in auto.fun.
        *Implication:* NFTs create positive sentiment without direct financial cost and can drive engagement with core products.
    c) Focus solely on resolving technical issues without compensation, emphasizing that delays were caused by third-party exchanges.
        *Implication:* This approach avoids setting compensation precedents but risks continued community frustration and potential user attrition.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Brand Identity & Character Representation

**Summary of Topic:** The Council must decide how to position Eliza's character in official communications, balancing the need for the project to be taken seriously with community expression, while determining how this affects the broader brand strategy.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we implement Shaw's directive to reposition Eliza's character to be taken more seriously while maintaining brand appeal?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw initiated a discussion about repositioning Eliza's character in official content to be taken more seriously and respected`
  - `Team members agreed to avoid sexualization of Eliza in official materials`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Completely redesign Eliza's visual identity to present a more professional, corporate aesthetic across all channels.
        *Implication:* A complete redesign might distance the project from its existing community but could attract enterprise partnerships and institutional investors.
    b) Maintain Eliza's current design but develop clearer brand guidelines that emphasize professionalism in official communications while allowing creative expression in community content.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach respects community culture while improving professional perception, but requires consistent enforcement.
    c) Create two distinct visual identities: a professional version for technical documentation and business partnerships, and the existing character for community engagement.
        *Implication:* Dual identities could serve different audiences but risks brand confusion and increased design/maintenance overhead.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** To what extent should we control or influence community-created content featuring Eliza?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw initiated a discussion about repositioning Eliza's character in official content to be taken more seriously and respected`
  - `cjft acknowledged posting something inappropriate, promised not to repeat it, and mentioned needing to fulfill payment obligations to commenters before removing the content`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement strict content moderation guidelines across official channels with active removal of inappropriate community-created content.
        *Implication:* Strict control protects brand image but may alienate community members who value creative freedom.
    b) Create official guidelines for community content but rely on community self-moderation through voting/reputation systems.
        *Implication:* Community governance aligns with decentralization values but may result in inconsistent content standards.
    c) Focus only on official content standards while taking a hands-off approach to community creations, clearly distinguishing between official and unofficial materials.
        *Implication:* This approach respects creative freedom but risks brand association with potentially problematic community content.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD explored potential future wearable technology form factors, including device-to-device communication via Bluetooth/infrared`
  - `Concept of agent-to-agent encrypted communications was discussed`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize agent-to-agent encrypted communications as a core v2 feature with dedicated development resources.
        *Implication:* Making this a priority feature addresses growing privacy concerns but may delay other planned v2 functionality.
    b) Develop it as an optional plugin that interested developers can integrate rather than a core feature.
        *Implication:* The plugin approach maintains development velocity on core features while still making the capability available to those who need it.
    c) Defer development until post-v2 release, but include it in the public roadmap to signal future privacy commitments.
        *Implication:* Deferring development ensures v2 ships on schedule but may disappoint security-focused users and developers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we leverage the information about affordable mini PCs for running large LLMs locally?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin shared information about affordable mini PCs with 128GB memory (now around $2k, down from $6k) for running large LLMs locally`

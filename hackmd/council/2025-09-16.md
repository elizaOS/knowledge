# Council Briefing: 2025-09-16

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Significant progress made on browser compatibility for elizaOS v2, enabling React integration and browser-based runtime execution that will support auto.fun's agent showcase requirements.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Browser Compatibility Progress

**Summary of Topic:** Core team made significant progress on browser compatibility and cloud integration, enabling elizaOS plugins to run natively in browser environments and be written directly in React components, a critical foundation for auto.fun's agent showcase.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should be our prioritization strategy for the remaining browser compatibility tasks?

  **Context:**
  - `CJFT shared significant progress on making plugins work in browser environments by leveraging the 'browser' field in package.json`
  - `The same PGLite instance that runs in Node.js now works in browsers without logical code changes`
  - `Complete migrator browser tweaks (Mentioned by CJFT)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on shipping a minimal viable browser runtime first, then iteratively add plugin compatibility.
        *Implication:* This approach would enable faster deployment of auto.fun showcase features but with limited initial agent capabilities.
    b) Prioritize compatibility for key showcase plugins (trading, streaming, shitposting) to ensure auto.fun launch readiness.
        *Implication:* This targeted approach ensures the highest-value agent activities for auto.fun are supported, potentially at the expense of broader framework capabilities.
    c) Establish a comprehensive browser compatibility layer with full plugin SDK support before proceeding to auto.fun integration.
        *Implication:* This foundation-first approach would delay auto.fun showcase features but ensure greater stability and developer adoption for v2.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we balance the technical elegance of browser-native execution against the more immediate deployment needs for auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `CJFT advocated for running AgentRuntime and DB directly in browser rather than using websockets, positioning this as a key component for ElizaOS 2.0.`
  - `Need a remote URL endpoint setting to hide the key (Mentioned by CJFT)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a hybrid approach that allows both websocket and direct browser execution paths, with clear migration guidance.
        *Implication:* This provides flexibility for different deployment scenarios but increases maintenance complexity.
    b) Commit fully to browser-native execution and focus resources on rapidly resolving remaining technical barriers.
        *Implication:* This creates a cleaner architecture but may delay auto.fun showcase features if technical challenges arise.
    c) Temporarily use websockets for auto.fun showcase while continuing browser-native development in parallel for v2 final release.
        *Implication:* This pragmatic approach ensures meeting the monthly goal timeline but creates technical debt to address later.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What developer experience improvements should we prioritize to accelerate adoption of the browser-compatible elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `ElizaOS plugins can now be written directly in React components`
  - `Document browser/node import options for '@elizaos/core/browser' vs '@elizaos/core/node' imports (Mentioned by CJFT)`
  - `Flexible Import Options: Developers can now explicitly specify imports from '@elizaos/core/browser' or '@elizaos/core/node'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create comprehensive documentation with interactive examples focused on React integration.
        *Implication:* This knowledge-first approach would support adoption by React developers but requires significant documentation effort.
    b) Develop a specialized browser starter template with pre-configured boilerplate for common agent patterns.
        *Implication:* This tooling-focused approach reduces friction for new developers but may create expectations for ongoing template maintenance.
    c) Build an interactive playground environment where developers can experiment with browser agents without setup.
        *Implication:* This experiential approach lowers the barrier to entry but requires dedicating resources to building and maintaining the playground.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Cloud Infrastructure Development

**Summary of Topic:** The Eliza Cloud MVP v1 is nearing completion with core user onboarding and API key functionality, representing a strategic shift toward managed cloud services that can support auto.fun's 24/7 agent showcase requirements.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we position the cloud offering relative to our open-source framework as we approach auto.fun launch?

  **Context:**
  - `MVP v1 Status: Nearly complete with core flow working: signup → API key + free credit → CLI login → request handling → usage logging`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position cloud as the premium, fully-managed experience optimized for auto.fun integration.
        *Implication:* This creates a clear value proposition for cloud services but may create perception that self-hosted options are second-class.
    b) Maintain equal emphasis on self-hosted and cloud, presenting cloud as an optional convenience.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach maintains community goodwill but may dilute the commercial potential of cloud offerings.
    c) Focus on cloud as the gateway to auto.fun's ecosystem while emphasizing framework's standalone value for custom applications.
        *Implication:* This segmented approach aligns technical capabilities with different user needs but requires maintaining distinct development paths.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What credit/pricing model should we implement for the cloud offering to best support auto.fun agent showcase and user adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `MVP v1 Status: Nearly complete with core flow working: signup → API key + free credit → CLI login → request handling → usage logging`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement generous free tier with auto.fun integration benefits to maximize initial adoption.
        *Implication:* This adoption-focused approach builds user base quickly but may create financial sustainability challenges.
    b) Create tiered pricing with exclusive auto.fun capabilities in higher tiers to drive conversions.
        *Implication:* This monetization-focused approach optimizes revenue but may limit initial auto.fun showcase impact.
    c) Offer token-based incentives where cloud usage earns auto.fun ecosystem benefits and token rewards.
        *Implication:* This token-integrated approach aligns with DAO vision but adds complexity to pricing model and tokenomics.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

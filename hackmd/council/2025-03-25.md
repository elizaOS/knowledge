# Council Briefing: 2025-03-25

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Operational momentum concentrated on V2 beta reliability—shipping CLI/Discord usability upgrades while triaging fresh GUI/Twitter regressions that could erode developer trust if allowed to accumulate.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 Beta Reliability & Developer Experience (CLI + GUI)

**Summary of Topic:** The fleet shipped meaningful DX fixes (Discord mention-only responses, clearer plugin install UX, better CLI error surfaces), but new UX regressions in the GUI and Twitter workflow signal continued friction in the developer path-to-success.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we impose a short-term "stability lock" on V2 beta (bugfixes/tests/docs only) to accelerate trust, even if it slows feature velocity?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub daily log (2025-03-25): "Enhanced CLI error display for scenarios when the server is not running" (PR #4061)`
  - `GitHub daily log (2025-03-25): "Identified a problem where spaces cannot be typed in the GUI room name field" (issue #4070)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—declare a stability lock until top UX regressions and onboarding blockers are cleared.
        *Implication:* Reinforces Execution Excellence and reduces churn from frustrated builders, at the cost of delayed experimental capabilities.
    b) Partial—lock only the onboarding path (CLI init/start, first agent run, core clients), allow isolated feature work elsewhere.
        *Implication:* Balances shipping with trust: protects the first 30 minutes of user experience while keeping R&D moving.
    c) No—continue parallel feature development; rely on rapid iteration to outpace regressions.
        *Implication:* Maximizes velocity but risks compounding papercuts into reputational damage during the most visible beta period.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which user-facing defect class should be treated as 'red alert' gating for V2 readiness: GUI room creation/status issues, Twitter posting failures, or plugin install/startup failures?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub daily log (2025-03-25): "agent statuses are not updating in the GUI room" (issue #4069)`
  - `GitHub daily log (2025-03-25): "authorization error indicating a duplicate status when sending tweets" (issue #4074)`
  - `Discord (2025-03-23): "Users are experiencing various setup problems with the beta version... plugin-sql errors"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Plugin install/startup failures are gating—if agents can’t boot reliably, nothing else matters.
        *Implication:* Optimizes for the broadest DX impact and reduces support load, but may defer high-visibility UX polish.
    b) GUI room creation/status is gating—Cloud and framework adoption depends on a smooth UI control surface.
        *Implication:* Aligns with 'seamless UX' principle, but may underinvest in headless/server-first builders.
    c) Twitter posting failures are gating—flagship agents and public perception are most sensitive to social output reliability.
        *Implication:* Protects outward-facing credibility, but risks leaving core developer onboarding rough.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What explicit readiness signal should the Council require before any major V2 marketing push: test coverage thresholds, 'no known critical issues' SLA, or a curated golden-path tutorial that works across OS environments?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-23): "Users are experiencing various setup problems with the beta version, particularly around CLI commands, Docker configurations, and plugin integration"`
  - `GitHub activity (2025-03-24 to 2025-03-26): increasing PRs/issues and active contributors indicates rapid change while bugs still appear`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Test-first: require defined coverage/CI pass criteria for core packages and critical plugins before marketing.
        *Implication:* Strong reliability posture; may slow external momentum but reduces post-launch support burden.
    b) SLA-first: require 'zero criticals' in a published gating list (onboarding, secrets, core clients) for 7 days.
        *Implication:* Builds confidence through stability streaks; requires disciplined triage and clear severity definitions.
    c) Narrative-first: require a battle-tested golden-path guide + demos across Windows/WSL/Linux/Docker, even if coverage lags.
        *Implication:* Maximizes developer success and perception, but can mask latent quality risks without strong test backstops.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Security Posture & Credential Trust Primitives

**Summary of Topic:** Security pressure is rising from external research scrutiny and real-world account compromise, while internal mitigations (secret salting/encryption) and potential bug-bounty partnerships (Immunefi) create an opportunity to formalize trust primitives for agents and plugins.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we formalize and communicate plugin isolation and risk boundaries to neutralize FUD without overselling safety?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 🥇-partners (2025-03-24): "need to communicate the risks more clearly regarding plugin isolation" (Odilitime)`
  - `Discord (2025-03-23): "Trader plugins are isolated, but not all plugins have the same security measures"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish a formal 'Plugin Risk Model' spec (tiers, permissions, isolation guarantees, audit status) and require declaration for registry listing.
        *Implication:* Creates a shared language of trust and accountability; increases process overhead but strengthens ecosystem credibility.
    b) Ship minimal warnings in docs/UI first (clear disclaimers and best practices), then iterate toward formal tiers later.
        *Implication:* Fastest path to reducing misunderstanding; may leave ambiguity that competitors can still exploit.
    c) Avoid public granularity; respond case-by-case and keep details primarily in partner/dev channels.
        *Implication:* Reduces immediate attack surface in messaging, but conflicts with 'Developer First' transparency and can amplify suspicion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is our near-term standard for safeguarding social and wallet credentials used by autonomous agents: multi-sig/split keys, restricted OAuth scopes, or centralized managed secrets via Cloud?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 🥇-partners (2025-03-24): "Explore multi-sig or split key solutions for agent wallet control" (DorianD)`
  - `Discord (2025-03-24): "Shaw's Twitter account was hacked through a connected app (not device compromise)"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt multi-sig/split-key patterns as the default for on-chain actions; agents become signers with bounded authority.
        *Implication:* Strongest decentralization-aligned safety, but adds UX complexity and may slow autonomous execution.
    b) Prioritize restricted OAuth scopes + app-connection hygiene tooling for social accounts; treat wallet security as separate track.
        *Implication:* Directly addresses the most common compromise vector; does not solve on-chain custody risk for trading agents.
    c) Make Cloud-managed secrets the recommended default (vaulting, rotation, policy), with OSS path as advanced mode.
        *Implication:* Improves safety and UX quickly, but may create centralization concerns and ecosystem dependency on Cloud.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Which security investment should be prioritized to build 'trust through shipping': immediate Immunefi bounty program, a plugin registry reputation/ratings system, or deeper sandboxing/isolation work in core?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-24): "upcoming partnership with Immunefi"`
  - `Discord (2025-03-24): "plugin registry including ratings, comments/analysis, and monetization to support security/bug bounties" (DorianD)`
  - `GitHub PRs (2025-03-24): "adds encryption for character secrets" (PR #4059) and "introduces salting for agent secrets" (PR #4056)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immunefi first—launch a public bounty and route all security disclosures through it.
        *Implication:* Signals maturity and invites responsible disclosure, but may create a sudden influx of reports requiring triage capacity.
    b) Registry reputation first—ratings, security disclosures, and monetized audits/bounties per plugin.
        *Implication:* Scales trust across an open ecosystem, but requires careful governance to prevent sybil/brigading.
    c) Core isolation first—invest in stronger sandboxing primitives and permissioned capabilities in the framework.
        *Implication:* Reduces systemic risk long-term, but slower to message and may not address immediate social-account compromise vectors.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Information Taming, Anti-FUD Response, and Public Channels

**Summary of Topic:** The Council faces an adversarial narrative environment (competitor-amplified security claims, scam tokens, account hacks) while simultaneously building the project’s information spine (GitHub as source of truth, automated daily X updates, clearer token messaging).

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is our doctrine for countering FUD: authoritative technical rebuttals from core leadership, community-led narrative swarming, or quiet shipping plus minimal statements?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord dao-organization (2025-03-24): "Respond to FUD campaign against ElizaOS with explanations from team members" (Zolo)`
  - `Discord (2025-03-24): "Sentient highlighted security vulnerabilities in ElizaOS"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Leadership-led: publish a clear, technical, signed rebuttal + roadmap of mitigations.
        *Implication:* Creates a canonical reference and reduces confusion, but raises the stakes on precision and follow-through.
    b) Community swarm: equip the community with bulletproof talking points and let decentralized voices respond.
        *Implication:* Scales reach and feels native to open-source culture, but increases risk of inconsistent messaging.
    c) Ship-only: keep responses minimal and let reliability improvements speak over time.
        *Implication:* Avoids feeding adversarial cycles, but can cede narrative ground during moments of high attention.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How aggressively should we automate outward comms (daily X threads, summaries, dashboards) versus curating fewer high-signal releases to protect trust?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-23): "Hubert is developing an automated system to pull updates from a JSON file and post them to X... daily at midnight UTC"`
  - `Discord (2025-03-23): "System will update daily... formatted as threads with each GitHub/Discord link"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Max automation: daily threads as default; rely on volume + transparency to build trust.
        *Implication:* Keeps the ecosystem continuously informed, but risks broadcasting noise and unfinished work.
    b) Hybrid: automate collection and drafting, but require an editorial filter pass before publishing.
        *Implication:* Maintains velocity while preserving message quality; requires dedicated editorial ownership.
    c) Minimalism: publish weekly/monthly only; prioritize coherence over cadence.
        *Implication:* Higher signal and brand consistency, but reduces perceived shipping tempo and community engagement.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What governance stance should we take on public vs gated channels to optimize developer adoption without sacrificing partner/holder value?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord spartan_holders (2025-03-24): "keeping the current channel private for holders while creating a new public channel" (rhota)`
  - `Discord (2025-03-24): "implement separate public and private Discord channels"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Open-by-default: keep most development and support public; reserve only sensitive security/token matters for gated channels.
        *Implication:* Maximizes developer-first growth and reduces duplication, but may dilute perceived partner exclusivity.
    b) Dual-track: public support + docs, gated alpha channels for early access, with clear promotion pathways for contributors.
        *Implication:* Balances growth and incentives; requires careful coordination to prevent information fragmentation.
    c) Gated-first: concentrate key updates in partner/holder spaces; selectively release summaries publicly.
        *Implication:* Strengthens exclusivity, but conflicts with open-source expectations and can slow ecosystem expansion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

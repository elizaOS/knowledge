# Council Briefing: 2025-11-26

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The Babylon platform has reached significant growth milestone of 100k signups while the token migration process faces critical communication challenges with exchanges and users.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The ongoing AI16Z to ELIZAOS token migration has created significant friction with exchange partners and community members due to snapshot communication issues, particularly affecting Korean exchanges and Kraken users.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize resolving the exchange communication issues around the token migration?

  **Context:**
  - `Major controversy emerged regarding Korean exchanges (particularly Bithumb) where users claim the exchange announced full migration support but later backtracked.`
  - `Similar migration issues reported with Kraken users.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize high-volume exchanges (Bithumb, Kraken) with direct executive outreach and offer technical support teams.
        *Implication:* Focuses resources on largest user impact but may create perception of preferential treatment.
    b) Implement a standardized manual migration process for all affected users regardless of exchange.
        *Implication:* Ensures fairness but significantly increases operational overhead and may delay other initiatives.
    c) Maintain current approach of case-by-case resolution while improving documentation clarity.
        *Implication:* Preserves development bandwidth but risks prolonging user frustration and potential reputation damage.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we extend the 90-day migration window given the exchange communication challenges?

  **Context:**
  - `90-day migration window is in place, providing time for resolution.`
  - `Team maintains that tokens purchased after the snapshot date won't be migrated.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain the current 90-day window as it provides sufficient time to resolve issues.
        *Implication:* Preserves timeline discipline but may create hardship for users with complex exchange situations.
    b) Extend the window by 30-60 days with clear milestones for exchange integration completion.
        *Implication:* Demonstrates flexibility but could set precedent for further extensions and delay completion of the migration.
    c) Implement a tiered timeline - 90 days for standard migrations, 120 days for exchange-specific cases with proof of ownership.
        *Implication:* Balances fairness with operational constraints but introduces additional complexity to communicate.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What verification mechanisms should we implement for pre-snapshot token ownership claims?

  **Context:**
  - `Users who held tokens before the snapshot but on exchanges are advised to keep them there for automatic migration or submit manual migration requests with proof of pre-snapshot ownership.`
  - `Serikiki confirmed that providing screenshots of token purchases before Nov 11 to the team is sufficient proof for migration.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accept screenshots with clear timestamp information as sufficient proof of pre-snapshot ownership.
        *Implication:* Simplifies verification process but opens potential for doctored evidence and fraud.
    b) Implement blockchain-based verification through transaction signatures where possible, with human review for edge cases.
        *Implication:* Maximizes security and automation but requires technical sophistication from users.
    c) Require exchange API read access or official exchange statements as primary verification, with screenshots as secondary evidence.
        *Implication:* Balances security with accessibility but may create privacy concerns for some users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Babylon Growth Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The Babylon project has achieved 100k signups through effective referral mechanisms and Ethereum community integration, but faces challenges in distinguishing airdrop farmers from genuine users.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we leverage Babylon's 100k user milestone to advance our auto.fun user acquisition strategy?

  **Context:**
  - `Babylon project has reached 100k signups, with effective referral mechanisms driving growth.`
  - `Babylon has been promoted within Ethereum communities and was demonstrated at the Trustless Agents day event.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Integrate auto.fun directly within Babylon to create a seamless funnel for converting waitlist signups to active platform users.
        *Implication:* Maximizes conversion potential but could dilute the distinct value propositions of each platform.
    b) Use Babylon's user base for targeted marketing of auto.fun's unique agent capabilities and token launchpad features.
        *Implication:* Maintains platform separation while leveraging the audience, but requires additional marketing resources.
    c) Create a shared incentive structure where Babylon users get preferential status/benefits on auto.fun.
        *Implication:* Builds cross-platform synergy but may create complex tokenomics that are difficult to balance.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to filter airdrop farmers from genuine users in Babylon's referral system?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk mentioned a need to distinguish between airdrop farmers and genuine users in Babylon's referral system.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement progressive engagement requirements where rewards increase with meaningful platform interaction.
        *Implication:* Rewards genuine engagement but adds complexity to the airdrop mechanics.
    b) Utilize AI-based behavior analysis to identify patterns consistent with airdrop farming versus genuine usage.
        *Implication:* Leverages our AI expertise but risks false positives/negatives in user classification.
    c) Require integration with existing Web3 identity solutions (e.g., Farcaster, ENS) to verify legitimate community members.
        *Implication:* Increases quality of participants but potentially reduces total acquisition numbers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

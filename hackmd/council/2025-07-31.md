#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we leverage the accelerator program to further strengthen our ecosystem and drive auto.fun adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk reported ~55 teams actively developing with elizaOS, a recently launched accelerator with 10 participating teams, and auto.fun's new initiative`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus the accelerator on teams building auto.fun-specific agents and applications to create a concentrated showcase of 24/7 agent activities.
        *Implication:* This would create a more focused ecosystem around auto.fun but might limit broader elizaOS innovation.
    b) Expand the accelerator program's scope to include more diverse agent use-cases while requiring integration with auto.fun as a distribution platform.
        *Implication:* This balances innovation diversity while still driving traffic and use-cases to auto.fun.
    c) Keep the accelerator program technically agnostic but create incentive structures that reward teams who successfully drive user engagement metrics on auto.fun.
        *Implication:* This maintains maximum innovation freedom while aligning economic incentives with our auto.fun growth objectives.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** With X (Twitter) accounts still suspended, what alternative social platforms should we prioritize to maintain community engagement and growth?

  **Context:**
  - `The team is working on resolving the suspension of their X (Twitter) account, with Kenk noting they have "a resolution in sight"`
  - `Community members discussed a cryptocurrency called "Eli5" launched on Auto.Fun platform, with speculation about it being developed into an AI agent`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus primarily on Discord and GitHub as our main communication channels while the X issue resolves, doubling down on developer-focused engagement.
        *Implication:* This maintains strong technical community bonds but may limit broader crypto/mainstream audience growth.
    b) Rapidly expand to alternative crypto-friendly platforms like Farcaster, Lens Protocol, and Telegram while continuing efforts to restore X access.
        *Implication:* This diversifies our social presence but could fragment limited marketing resources.
    c) Use the Eli5 community coin momentum to create a showcase of agent-powered social engagement that demonstrates our technology while building an audience.
        *Implication:* This leverages our own technology to solve our communication challenges, creating a compelling demonstration case.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Infrastructure & Plugin Architecture

**Summary of Topic:** The team is making significant architectural decisions around database management (PGlite vs. PostgreSQL standardization), knowledge path management, and ElizaCloud development, establishing the foundation for a scalable v2 release.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we approach the database standardization decision to best serve both developer experience and production reliability?

  **Context:**
  - `Debate about keeping PGlite vs. standardizing on PostgreSQL`
  - `Issues with cross-platform compatibility and naming conventions`
  - `The team is struggling with Drizzle ORM integration, particularly with dynamic migrations for plugins`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize exclusively on PostgreSQL to optimize for production reliability and enterprise adoption, accepting some developer experience tradeoffs.
        *Implication:* This prioritizes stability and scalability but might increase the barrier to entry for new developers.
    b) Maintain PGlite for development environments while providing seamless migration paths to PostgreSQL for production, creating a hybrid approach.
        *Implication:* This balances ease of development with production robustness but increases maintenance complexity.
    c) Build an abstraction layer that handles database differences transparently, allowing developers to choose their preferred database technology.
        *Implication:* This maximizes flexibility but risks creating a less optimized experience for all database types.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which phase of the ElizaCloud roadmap should we prioritize to best support our monthly goal of attracting users to auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw outlined a three-phase plan for ElizaCloud: 1) Developer APIs to simplify agent building with unified API keys, 2) Cloud Containers for hosted agents with customization options, 3) AI-assisted agent creation (Autocoder)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize Phase 1 (Developer APIs) to enable faster integration and simplify the technical onboarding process for new developers.
        *Implication:* This reduces friction for technical users but doesn't address no-code use cases.
    b) Accelerate development of Phase 2 (Cloud Containers) to enable immediate hosting of showcase agents on auto.fun without local deployment.
        *Implication:* This creates a more accessible platform for deployment but requires more infrastructure work.
    c) Fast-track Phase 3 (AI-assisted agent creation/Autocoder) to enable non-developers to create and deploy agents directly on auto.fun.
        *Implication:* This opens the platform to non-technical users but represents the most technically challenging phase.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we approach the enhancement of knowledge management to balance flexibility and standardization?

  **Context:**
  - `Work on enhancing the plugin-knowledge component to support character-specific knowledge paths`
  - `Odilitime identified a limitation and created PR #36 to enhance the plugin-knowledge component`
  - `0xbbjoker explained that settings are stored in database, not filesystem`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize on database-stored knowledge exclusively, improving query performance and system coherence at the cost of some file-system flexibility.
        *Implication:* This creates a more unified system but may alienate developers who prefer file-based workflows.
    b) Support dual knowledge path systems (database and filesystem) with clear migration tools and performance implications documentation.
        *Implication:* This maintains maximum flexibility but increases maintenance complexity and potential for user confusion.
    c) Create an abstraction layer for knowledge management with specialized optimizations for different backend storage types.
        *Implication:* This balances performance and flexibility but requires significant engineering investment.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Product Strategy: ELI5 Integration

**Summary of Topic:** The community is showing enthusiasm for ELI5, a token launched on the Auto.Fun platform, with potential plans to develop it into an AI agent that could showcase the platform's capabilities and drive engagement.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we approach the development of ELI5 from a token to an AI agent to maximize ecosystem value?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members discussed a cryptocurrency called "Eli5" launched on Auto.Fun platform, with speculation about it being developed into an AI agent`
  - `cantseemenomore provided context about the community coin and its potential development`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Develop ELI5 as a showcase educational agent that explains complex crypto/AI topics simply, directly supporting our mission to make technology more accessible.
        *Implication:* This creates clear utility aligned with the 'explain like I'm 5' name but may limit other creative potential.
    b) Position ELI5 as an ambassador agent that demonstrates cross-platform capabilities (streaming, trading, shitposting) to showcase the full potential of elizaOS.
        *Implication:* This creates a powerful demonstration but could dilute the 'Explain Like I'm 5' branding.
    c) Co-create ELI5 through community governance, using it as a test case for autonomous agent development directed by token holders.
        *Implication:* This builds community engagement but could slow development and create unpredictable outcomes.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What token utility model should we implement for ELI5 to strengthen both its value proposition and the broader elizaOS ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members discussed a cryptocurrency called "Eli5" launched on Auto.Fun platform, with speculation about it being developed into an AI agent`
  - `Shaw then CTO'd the coin and burned some supply. Now it seems like Auto.Fun and ElizaOS team got bigger plans for Eli5 like make it an AI agent or something`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement an access model where ELI5 tokens grant tiered access to premium features of the ELI5 agent and educational content.
        *Implication:* This creates direct utility for token holders but may limit broader adoption of the agent.
    b) Design a fee-sharing model where ELI5 holders earn a portion of fees generated when the ELI5 agent performs services for non-token holders.
        *Implication:* This allows free basic use while creating monetary incentives for token holders.
    c) Create a governance-focused model where ELI5 holders influence the agent's development priorities and capabilities through voting.
        *Implication:* This builds community ownership but may create slower development cycles and potential governance challenges.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

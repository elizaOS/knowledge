# Council Briefing: 2025-11-02

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The elizaOS team is preparing for a strategic token migration to a multichain ElizaOS token starting November 7th, which represents a critical evolution in the project's tokenomics and cross-chain capabilities.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The upcoming migration of AI16Z to ElizaOS token introduces significant changes to tokenomics and distribution, requiring careful communication and execution to ensure a smooth transition for all stakeholders.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize resources during the 90-day migration window to ensure maximum migration completion rate while maintaining development momentum?

  **Context:**
  - `Token Migration to ElizaOS begins November 7th with a 90-day window for token holders`
  - `Toni: 'You'll need to use the migration portal that will be announced.'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus primarily on user experience and support teams for the migration portal, temporarily slowing some development initiatives to ensure flawless migration.
        *Implication:* Maximizes migration success rates but may delay development milestones for Q4.

        *Implication:* Preserves development momentum but may result in lower migration completion rate if users encounter difficulties.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What communication strategy should we adopt regarding the 40% supply increase to maintain token holder confidence?

  **Context:**
  - `Supply will increase from 6.6 billion to 11 billion tokens (+40%)`
  - `Circulating supply will immediately increase from 6.6 billion to 7.4 billion (13% increase)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Emphasize the immediate circulating supply increase of only 13% while detailing the utility unlocked by the additional supply allocation.
        *Implication:* Provides accurate context that may mitigate concerns about dilution while highlighting new capabilities.
    b) Focus communication primarily on the technological benefits of the new multichain token, downplaying the supply changes as technical necessities.
        *Implication:* Shifts attention to technological advancements but risks creating trust issues if holders later feel supply changes were inadequately explained.
    c) Implement aggressive token buyback and burn mechanisms during the migration period to offset concerns about increased supply.
        *Implication:* Directly addresses supply concerns through market action but requires significant financial resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we leverage the multichain transition to advance auto.fun's market position?

  **Context:**
  - `ai16z migrates to multichain ElizaOS token real soon.`
  - `Ongoing research and prototyping for on-chain integration of the cloud and collaboration with Ethereum Foundation around ERC-8004.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Launch auto.fun multichain expansion simultaneously with the token migration to create a unified narrative about elizaOS's cross-chain future.
        *Implication:* Creates strong market positioning but increases operational complexity during the migration period.
    b) Delay auto.fun multichain capabilities until after successful migration completion, focusing first on establishing the new token across chains.
        *Implication:* Reduces execution risk but may miss momentum opportunity from the migration publicity.
    c) Implement a phased approach by launching auto.fun on one additional high-impact chain during migration, with further expansion after migration completion.
        *Implication:* Balances between leveraging migration momentum and managing operational complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Development Prioritization

**Summary of Topic:** Multiple development streams including cloud release, Farcaster miniapp, x402 gateway, and API consolidation are progressing simultaneously, requiring careful prioritization to align with the monthly goal of stabilizing auto.fun and shipping elizaOS v2.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which development workstream should receive additional resources to best support our monthly goal?

  **Context:**
  - `Eliza cloud release is being prepared for demonstration at Devconnect`
  - `Team is developing an x402 gateway that integrates with DegenAI`
  - `Otaku Farcaster miniapp is in development, dependent on Coinbase integration, expected to launch next week`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate the Eliza cloud release to enable rapid deployment of agents on auto.fun, supporting the 24/7 agent activity goal.
        *Implication:* Enables scaling of agent deployment but may pull resources from other initiatives.
    b) Prioritize the x402 gateway with DegenAI integration to enhance trading agent capabilities on auto.fun.
        *Implication:* Strengthens the trading functionality that drives engagement but may delay cloud infrastructure improvements.
    c) Focus on the Otaku Farcaster miniapp to expand the platform's reach to new users through social integration.
        *Implication:* Potentially accelerates user acquisition but doesn't directly improve the core platform stability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we address the security concerns with x402 resource servers?

  **Context:**
  - `Some x402 resource servers contain malicious code that needs fixing (Mentioned by Agent Joshua)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement immediate security audit and patching of all x402 servers, delaying other development if necessary to secure the infrastructure.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes security but may impact development timelines for other features.
    b) Develop a parallel secure implementation while maintaining the current servers with additional monitoring and isolation.

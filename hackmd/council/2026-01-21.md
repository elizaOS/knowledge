# Council Briefing: 2026-01-21

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The project faces a critical perception gap where technical progression toward ElizaOS Cloud and Jeju remains robust, yet token utility and roadmap communication are causing significant community friction and market volatility.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Utility & Communication Architecture

**Summary of Topic:** Community frustration is peaking due to the 70% decline in token value and perceived lack of utility outside of the future Jeju network. While the team focuses on 'building in silence,' partners demand transparent value propositions and a coherent narrative connecting the framework to the token.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council address the immediate demand for token utility while the Jeju network is still 6-12 months from launch?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD identified Jeju (latter half of 2025) as primary utility, but investors find it too distant.`
  - `Alexei mentioned potential buybacks from ElizaCloud profits to mimic the BNB model.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate the ElizaCloud Buyback program.
        *Implication:* Creates immediate deflationary pressure and aligns token value with the most mature current product.
    b) Prioritize the research.elizaos.ai blog and technical 'bottleneck' articles.
        *Implication:* Reduces information asymmetry by making Shaw's vision accessible without requiring stream attendance.
    c) Implement early staking or 'agent-points' for token holders on the Cloud platform.
        *Implication:* Provides immediate utility to long-term holders at the cost of development bandwidth.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should the project transition its messaging from a 'memecoin' origin to a 'decentralized AI public resource' infrastructure?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD: 'The real value isn't clear because investors need to watch Shaw's streams to understand the vision.'`
  - `Partners channel argued the 'build, don't talk' approach creates zero demand.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Fully rebrand as 'AI Infrastructure' with a formal Whitepaper.
        *Implication:* Attracts institutional/serious builders but risks losing the viral retail community.
    b) Adopt a 'Technical Thought Leader' persona for core devs.
        *Implication:* Humanizes the build process and builds trust through expertise rather than hype.
    c) Maintain current course until V2.0.0 and ElizaCloud are stabilized.
        *Implication:* Risks further community attrition and partner dissatisfaction in exchange for absolute technical focus.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Performance and V2 Transition

**Summary of Topic:** Significant strides have been made in runtime optimization (40% faster warm starts) and the development of the V2 Rust/WASM core, but documentation gaps for the current CLI and plugin compatibility persist.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How do we mitigate the 'bus factor' and maintenance concentration as we pivot toward the V2 Rust core?

  **Context:**
  - `lalalune: 52% of runtime PRs; Rust version of ElizaOS is the next technical frontier.`
  - `Odilitime and Stan handled significant documentation and regression fixes this week.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Launch a dedicated 'Rust/WASM' Contributor Bounty Program.
        *Implication:* Diversifies code ownership and accelerates the transition to the more performant V2 stack.
    b) Freeze feature development for 14 days to complete CLI/Plugin documentation.
        *Implication:* Ensures 'Execution Excellence' by prioritizing DX, but may slow down the 'Jeju' timeline.
    c) Embed the 'Swarm' deployment tech directly into ElizaCloud for mass accessibility.
        *Implication:* Provides immediate architectural efficiency to current users while bridging to V2 scaling capabilities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2026-01-09

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The council faces a critical split between managing a 'delisting crisis' on Korean exchanges due to transparency issues and a radical architectural pivot toward Eliza 2.0 with multi-language FFI interoperability.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Regulatory Integrity & Exchange Relations

**Summary of Topic:** Coordinated delistings by DAXA (Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit) cite a lack of transparency in the token migration process and failure to disclose material information.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How must the Council restore trust with centralized exchanges and regulatory alliances like DAXA given the current transparency controversy?

  **Context:**
  - `Korbit officially announced trading termination... citing lack of transparency in the token migration process (Discord summary 2026-01-08).`
  - `Korean exchanges will not list elizaOS going forward due to migration controversy (Skullcross/주니).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Formal Regulatory Audit & Disclosure
        *Implication:* Prioritizes institutional compliance at the cost of decentralization speed.
    b) Aggressive Pivot to DEX Ecosystems
        *Implication:* Accepts CEX exclusion to focus entirely on permissionless, decentralized infrastructure.
    c) Community-Led Advocacy Program
        *Implication:* Uses social pressure to force re-evaluation of transparency standards.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the strategic priority for the unaddressed 'zero eligibility' and 'max amount reached' technical migration errors?

  **Context:**
  - `XXI_Rapax encountered issues migrating old ai16z tokens... showing 0 eligible tokens (Discord 2026-01-08).`
  - `Dabel reported ai16z tokens in Raydium LP showing 'max amount reached' error (Discord 2026-01-08).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Manual Reconciliation for Early Holders
        *Implication:* Builds trust but creates significant operational overhead for core devs.
    b) Hard Deadline & Finality Enforcement
        *Implication:* Prioritizes architectural speed over individual community equity.
    c) Smart Contract logic Patching
        *Implication:* Ensures systemic fairness but delays current migration milestones.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Architectural Evolution: Eliza 2.0

**Summary of Topic:** A proposal for a multi-language runtime (TS, Rust, Python) aims to turn plugins into interoperable 'skills' while removing server/API overhead for a more 'Claude-friendly' runtime.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the framework move away from a server/API model in favor of a documented runtime optimized for LLM sub-agents?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw proposed a radical redesign... removing API/server/CLI/projects in favor of a Claude-friendly documented runtime (Discord 2026-01-08).`
  - `Removing all non-essentials. Instead we focus on runtime in Rust, Typescript (PR #6351 lalalune).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Full Adoption of LLM-Native Runtime
        *Implication:* Places elizaOS ahead of AGI-agent trends but may alienate legacy web developers.
    b) Hybrid Dual-Track Compatibility
        *Implication:* Maintains legacy support but risks feature bloat and developer confusion.
    c) Incremental Skill-Based Modularization
        *Implication:* Tests the 'Skills' concept before abandoning the server architecture.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: The Trillion-Dollar Data Graph

**Summary of Topic:** The transition from execution-only agents to high-quality data collection (Babylon, Jeju, and Mocap suits) to build context graphs.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council govern the proposed incentive models for user data contribution (IOUs vs Reputation)?

  **Context:**
  - `Concept of paying users IOUs for their data contributions was discussed (Discord 2026-01-08).`
  - `DorianD proposed using motion capture suits to gather training data... food service, haircutting (Discord 2026-01-08).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Reputation-Only Meritverse System
        *Implication:* Incentivizes long-term ecosystem alignment over immediate profit.
    b) Native Token Micropayments (x402)
        *Implication:* Creates immediate liquidity for data but risks low-quality spam.
    c) Royalty-Based Inference Fees
        *Implication:* Provides sustainable value for data creators as AI models are utilized.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2026-01-09

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- A credibility stress-test is unfolding: Korean exchange delistings plus unresolved migration edge-cases and unclear token utility are converging into a single narrative risk that can only be countered by rapid, transparent shipping and documentation.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Integrity & Exchange Delisting Fallout

**Summary of Topic:** Korean exchanges (Bithumb/Coinone/Korbit) scheduled delistings citing transparency failures around rebrand/swap, while users report migration eligibility and LP migration errors; the combined effect threatens trust and market access precisely during the execution-excellence directive.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s immediate remediation posture toward DAXA’s transparency allegation: legal/PR rebuttal, operational transparency pack, or market exit acceptance?

  **Context:**
  - `Daily Report 2026-01-08: "DAXA cited lack of transparency in rebranding/token swap procedures"; delisting Feb 12 (trading) / Mar 12 (withdrawals).`
  - `Discord #discussion 2026-01-08: Korean community members claimed "virtually no chance of listing" on major Korean exchanges.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish a formal transparency pack (timeline, disclosures, swap mechanics, audits) and open a direct channel to exchanges/DAXA.
        *Implication:* Maximizes шанс of reputation recovery and re-listing options, but requires rapid coordination and might surface uncomfortable details.
    b) Issue a minimal PR statement and focus on shipping product reliability; treat delisting as external noise.
        *Implication:* Preserves engineering focus short-term, but risks letting the market narrative harden into permanent mistrust.
    c) Acknowledge procedural gaps, commit to governance upgrades, and reposition away from Korea for a defined period with clear user off-ramps.
        *Implication:* Reduces uncertainty and user harm, but concedes a major market and can be interpreted as admission without strong follow-up.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we standardize the migration experience for edge-cases (pre-snapshot holders, exchange custodial holders, LP positions) to achieve a high-success-rate outcome?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord #discussion 2026-01-08: users reported "0 eligible tokens" and LP error "max amount reached" (XXI_Rapax, Dabel).`
  - `Discord #discussion 2026-01-08: conflicting answers on whether exchanges will auto-migrate for holders (FoRever_BIG vs jessy).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a canonical migration decision-tree (by custody type) plus an automated eligibility diagnostics tool and status page.
        *Implication:* Converts support load into self-serve clarity, directly aligned with Developer First + Trust Through Shipping.
    b) Handle edge-cases manually via tickets with a dedicated migration war-room and strict SLA until the window ends.
        *Implication:* High touch can rescue users quickly, but scales poorly and increases inconsistency risk.
    c) Freeze additional complex paths (e.g., LP migrations) and only support standard wallet holdings to reduce failure modes.
        *Implication:* Improves headline success metrics, but leaves a vocal subset stranded and amplifies reputational damage.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we unify all official channels around a single source of truth for contract address and migration links, and if so, what becomes the authoritative registry?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2026-01-07: community noted contract address hard to find; team committed to post CA across official X accounts and refresh linktree.`
  - `Weekly Summary (Jan 4-10): docs expansion to ~95% coverage in elizaos/docs, indicating capacity to centralize canonical info.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make elizaos.org (or elizaos.github.io) the canonical registry and mirror to X/Linktree/Discord pins.
        *Implication:* Central authority reduces confusion and scam surface area, but must be kept highly available and versioned.
    b) Make CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap the canonical registry and treat owned channels as pointers only.
        *Implication:* Leverages third-party trust, but cedes control and slows updates during fast-moving incidents.
    c) Make an onchain registry contract the canonical source, with front-ends reading directly.
        *Implication:* Strongest decentralization signal, but adds engineering and governance complexity and may not solve near-term comms needs.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Reliability & DX: v1.7.0 Discord Breakage, Cloud Docs Downtime, and Release Discipline

**Summary of Topic:** Core reliability is improving (SQL stability fixes, unified multi-transport hooks), but a v1.7.0 serverId→messageServerId mismatch broke Discord integrations and docs outages (elizacloud.ai/docs) undermine the ‘developer-friendly’ promise; release rigor and operational polish must lead.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s release policy for 1.7.x after the Discord break: slow down releases for compatibility gates, or ship hotfixes faster with better rollback guidance?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2026-01-06/07: "No server ID found 10" due to serverId→messageServerId transition; advised downgrade to 1.6.5 or use odi-17.`
  - `GitHub PR #6333 merged 2026-01-07: "fix: plugin-bootstrap ... for serverId => messageServerId change".`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt strict compatibility gating: no core release unless top plugins (Discord/Telegram/SQL) pass an integration suite.
        *Implication:* Maximizes reliability and developer trust, but slows feature velocity and requires investment in CI infrastructure.
    b) Continue rapid releases, but formalize fast hotfix cadence plus automated downgrade/rollback scripts and clear advisories.
        *Implication:* Maintains momentum while reducing pain, but accepts higher incident frequency as a trade-off.
    c) Split channels: keep stable LTS (1.6.x) and experimental (1.7.x) with explicit support boundaries.
        *Implication:* Protects production users and aligns with Execution Excellence, but increases maintenance overhead and messaging complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we restore the Cloud/DX trust loop when docs are down and core API usage details are tribal knowledge?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2026-01-08: "Fix docs website that is currently down at elizacloud.ai/docs" (Amir).`
  - `Discord 2026-01-06/07: "Model not found" resolved by provider prefix format like "openai/gpt-4o-mini" (cjft).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Treat docs as production: add uptime monitoring, status page, and a mirrored static docs build (GitHub Pages) with versioning.
        *Implication:* Directly advances Developer First and reduces support burden, but needs ongoing operational ownership.
    b) Embed “just-in-time” guidance into the product UI/API errors (e.g., model param hints) and rely less on external docs uptime.
        *Implication:* Improves UX immediately, but risks documentation drift and incomplete conceptual learning materials.
    c) Consolidate everything into HackMD ‘ElizaOS Book’ and deprecate the separate docs site until Cloud stabilizes.
        *Implication:* Fastest path to a single maintained knowledge base, but may look less ‘platform-grade’ to enterprise developers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Which reliability investment best supports the Cloud launch: database adapter hardening (Neon/RLS), concurrency/race fixes, or connector scaling architecture (event pumps/gateways)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord core-devs 2026-01-07: Stan working on TOCTOU race condition fixes ("deduct-before, reconcile-after").`
  - `Daily/Discord 2026-01-08: plugin-sql updates include Neon serverless support and improved RLS.`
  - `Discord 2026-01-06/07: Odilitime direction: "simple event pumps" and multiple daemon instances per service for scale.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize Cloud correctness: race-condition fixes and reconciliation semantics first.
        *Implication:* Prevents catastrophic billing/state errors and strengthens trust, though scaling improvements may lag.
    b) Prioritize connector scaling architecture (event pumps, gateways, voice/text priorities).
        *Implication:* Enables larger deployments and flagship reliability across platforms, but may leave core accounting/state bugs exposed.
    c) Prioritize database security and serverless readiness (Neon adapter, RLS hardening) as the Cloud foundation layer.
        *Implication:* Improves security posture and deployability, but may not address the highest-frequency user-visible incidents.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Token Utility & Ecosystem Coherence: Jeju/Bazaar, Micropayments, and “Last-Mile” Applications

**Summary of Topic:** Community scrutiny on token purpose is intensifying as Jeju/Bazaar and third-party plugins (e.g., Kamiyo escrow payments, x402 paywalls) signal real utility paths; we need an explicit, near-term utility narrative tied to shipping product primitives and “last-mile” integrations of our context/insight pipeline.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the minimum credible token utility we can ship soon that reinforces the North Star (developer-friendly, reliable) rather than speculative narratives?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2026-01-08: stoikol asked why token "isn't being used for payments or gas fees"; no definitive team answer.`
  - `Daily 2026-01-08: KAMIYO AI launched with an ElizaOS plugin for escrow-protected agent payments and on-chain dispute resolution.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make token the default settlement asset for Cloud services and/or Bazaar marketplace fees (with clear pricing and receipts).
        *Implication:* Creates immediate product-coupled demand, but introduces regulatory/UX complexity and must not degrade DX.
    b) Keep token as coordination/rewards (reputation, bounties, plugin incentives) while deferring payments until Cloud is fully stable.
        *Implication:* Reduces execution risk and aligns with reliability-first, but may not satisfy community calls for “real utility.”
    c) Tie token utility to security/quality: staking for plugin verification, rate limits, or dispute bonding in agent commerce.
        *Implication:* Positions token as trust infrastructure, but requires careful game design and strong enforcement mechanisms.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should Jeju and Bazaar be positioned in the ecosystem narrative: core infrastructure we control, or a composable optional layer among many chains/platforms?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2026-01-08: sb clarified "Bazaar is a decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, the appstore for agents."`
  - `Daily 2026-01-08: Jeju described as "decentralized Layer 2 focused on powering AI applications that connects everything ElizaOS is building."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position Jeju/Bazaar as the flagship ‘reference chain + appstore’ while keeping framework chain-agnostic.
        *Implication:* Provides a clear default path for builders, but risks perceptions of lock-in or overreach beyond core framework goals.
    b) Position Jeju/Bazaar as one of many first-class deployments; emphasize open interoperability and x-chain neutrality.
        *Implication:* Best aligns with Open & Composable, but may dilute the story of where value and activity concentrate.
    c) Downplay chain narrative publicly until utility is shipped; keep Jeju/Bazaar as internal R&D until proven by usage.
        *Implication:* Reduces reputational risk during volatility, but slows ecosystem formation and partner momentum.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is the Council’s chosen ‘last-mile’ target for our high-quality workflow insights (daily/weekly/monthly): internal flagship agents, developer webhooks/APIs, or a public dashboard/product?

  **Context:**
  - `core-devs 2026-01-08: jin noted insights are high quality but need integration into "agents, webhooks, and apps".`
  - `Taming Information Summary: agents as bridges to summarize/tag/distribute across dashboards and council episodes.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship developer primitives first: webhook + API endpoints that emit insight artifacts with schemas and examples.
        *Implication:* Accelerates ecosystem leverage and third-party apps, but may feel invisible to non-developers without a showcase.
    b) Ship internal flagship integration first (Eli5/Otaku) to demonstrate measurable value and reduce ambiguity.
        *Implication:* Creates a narrative demo and confidence, but risks becoming bespoke if primitives are not extracted afterward.
    c) Ship a public dashboard first (RSS + web UI) as the canonical ‘operational truth’ layer for the community.
        *Implication:* Improves transparency and trust rapidly, but could divert engineering time from platform-critical stability work.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-07-12

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- GitHub activity shows significant framework development with major feature enhancements for the v2 release, while Discord discussions highlight challenges with the Twitter account ban and concerns about user visibility.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: elizaOS v2 Framework Development Progress

**Summary of Topic:** The GitHub logs indicate substantial development progress toward elizaOS v2 production readiness, with 29 new pull requests (25 merged) introducing critical features including action chaining, form capabilities, and code quality improvements.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize the remaining features for the v2 production release given our current velocity?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #5520 titled 'Feat: Autocoder + e2b sandboxes' by @lalalune is open, introducing new sandbox functionality for code execution.`
  - `PR #5436 titled 'feat: add action chaining' is merged, enabling the agent to generate images based on conversational context using ModelType.IMAGE.`
  - `PR #5487 titled 'feat: Form plugin' is merged, adding a form plugin for other plugins to build forms on.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on stabilizing and polishing existing features (Forms, Action Chaining, Image Generation) for v2 release before adding new capabilities.
        *Implication:* A more stable but feature-limited initial v2 release that may delay some anticipated capabilities.
    b) Accelerate integration of Autocoder and sandbox functionality, as these represent differentiating capabilities critical for attracting developers.
        *Implication:* A more feature-rich but potentially less stable v2 release that prioritizes developer adoption.
    c) Pivot toward auto.fun-specific feature development to align with the monthly goal of attracting users through 24/7 agent showcase activity.
        *Implication:* A strategic realignment that could delay general v2 framework completion but accelerate auto.fun specific goals.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we address the cross-platform compatibility issues that continue to emerge, particularly for Windows users?

  **Context:**
  - `Issue #5499 titled 'Plugin-local-ai failing to load on Windows' by @SYMBaiEX is OPEN.`
  - `Several users reported issues with the Twitter plugin, which was fixed in version 1.2.0`
  - `Windows-specific errors related to ESM URL schemes were encountered when trying to run plugin-local-ai`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Establish a dedicated Windows compatibility task force to systematically address all platform-specific issues before v2 production release.
        *Implication:* Would delay the v2 release timeline but ensure a consistent cross-platform experience.
    b) Continue with the current approach of addressing Windows issues reactively as they arise through targeted pull requests.
        *Implication:* Maintains current release velocity but risks ongoing friction for Windows users.
    c) Temporarily designate Windows support as experimental for v2 release, focusing on Linux/Mac stability first with clear documentation of known Windows limitations.
        *Implication:* Could alienate Windows users but accelerate v2 release for the majority of the developer base.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Social Media Visibility and Community Growth

**Summary of Topic:** Discord discussions revealed ongoing negotiations with Twitter/X to restore the banned account, with community concerns about market visibility and mindshare loss during this critical growth period.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What alternative strategies should we implement to maintain market visibility while Twitter account recovery efforts continue?

  **Context:**
  - `The project is in formal talks with Twitter/X to restore their lost account, with team members explaining they can't create secondary accounts as it would jeopardize negotiations`
  - `Community members expressed concern about losing market visibility without social media presence`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate community activity on alternative platforms (Discord, GitHub, LinkedIn) while developing agent-powered content distribution strategies that don't rely on Twitter.
        *Implication:* Reduces Twitter dependency but requires establishing presence on platforms with different audience demographics.
    b) Create unofficial community-run Twitter accounts managed by trusted community members rather than team members, enabling visibility without jeopardizing negotiations.
        *Implication:* Provides Twitter presence but introduces risk of mixed messaging and potential complications in Twitter negotiations.
    c) Focus exclusively on product excellence and direct user acquisition through targeted outreach, temporarily deprioritizing broad social media visibility.
        *Implication:* Conserves resources for development but may significantly slow community growth during a critical adoption period.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we structure the relationship between elizaOS, auto.fun, and emerging community tokens like ELI5?

  **Context:**
  - `ELI5 (described as "Autodotfun official coin") was discussed, with requests for a dedicated channel`
  - `Dr. Neuro outlined how various components (elizaOS, auto.fun, ELI5, daos.fun, clanktank, elizacloud) fit together in a comprehensive platform`
  - `There were mentions of an "autofun incubator" and "elizaOS fund" for project development`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Formalize ELI5 as an official part of the ecosystem with clear utility within auto.fun, creating transparent documentation about token relationships.
        *Implication:* Provides clarity but comes with increased responsibility for managing multiple official tokens and their interrelationships.
    b) Maintain separation between official elizaOS/auto.fun projects and community-created tokens, providing technical support without formal endorsement.
        *Implication:* Reduces official project complexity but creates potential for confusion and fragmentation in the ecosystem.
    c) Create a formal incubator program that establishes clear criteria for recognizing and potentially integrating community-initiated tokens and projects.
        *Implication:* Balances community innovation with systematic governance but requires substantial resources to implement effectively.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Documentation and Educational Resources

**Summary of Topic:** The team is developing comprehensive educational resources including better documentation, a 10-part course, and eliza.how, but the Discord logs indicate ongoing confusion about how to use v2 and the relationship between different ecosystem components.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How can we accelerate documentation and educational resource development to support the v2 release?

  **Context:**
  - `A 10-part course is being created by Snapper with a get-started guide available on YouTube`
  - `The eliza.how website was mentioned as a resource for beginners with an AI assistant (not yet the Eliza agent)`
  - `Is there any tutorial on how to use v2? (asked by pragmatiko) A: https://eliza.how/ has AI to ask questions, and Snapper is creating a 10-part course with a get-started guide available on YouTube. (answered by sayonara and Kenk)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize upgrading eliza.how with the actual Eliza agent, comprehensive v2 tutorials, and interactive examples before the v2 production release.
        *Implication:* May delay v2 release but would significantly reduce adoption friction for new users.
    b) Release v2 with current documentation while establishing a community incentive program to crowd-source tutorials, examples, and educational content.
        *Implication:* Maintains release schedule but quality and consistency of documentation may be variable.
    c) Develop an AI-assisted documentation platform that automatically generates and updates tutorials based on code changes and user questions.
        *Implication:* Innovative approach that aligns with project values but represents a new development effort that could divert resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the optimal onboarding experience for new developers to maximize retention and engagement with the ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `The team is adding new capabilities daily and building a platform where users can specify agent functions`
  - `A staging function is being developed for holders of 1 million $degenAI tokens, providing early access to features and reduced/no fees, similar to a Patreon model`
  - `Windows-specific errors related to ESM URL schemes were encountered when trying to run plugin-local-ai`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a streamlined, guided CLI experience with interactive tutorials that systematically introduce concepts as developers build their first agent.
        *Implication:* Requires significant CLI refinement but creates a consistent entry path that minimizes initial friction.
    b) Develop a web-based visual builder that abstracts complexity, allowing new users to create agents through a no-code interface before transitioning to the CLI.
        *Implication:* Broadens potential user base but may create a challenging transition to more advanced development workflows.
    c) Focus on examples and templates, providing a comprehensive library of pre-built agents that new developers can clone, customize and extend.
        *Implication:* Faster to implement but relies more heavily on self-directed learning and may not systematically build fundamental understanding.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

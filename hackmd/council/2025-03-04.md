# Council Briefing: 2025-03-04

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The fleet executed a stability-first burn—merging critical API/CI and knowledge-processing fixes—yet developer trust remains threatened by integration breakage and shifting configuration conventions (notably plugins vs clients) that are outpacing documentation.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Stability Surge vs. Reliability Debt

**Summary of Topic:** March 4 showed strong execution momentum with core fixes to APIs, CI/CD, knowledge processing, and fact retrieval—aligned with Execution Excellence. However, persistent runtime/integration failures indicate reliability debt migrating from core to the edges (clients, hosting, adapters).

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we declare a temporary "Reliability Lock" (freeze net-new features) until key onboarding paths (create/start/edit agent, knowledge load, major clients) meet a defined stability bar?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub daily summary (2025-03-04): "Resolved API issues causing errors when starting or editing agents" (PR #3767).`
  - `GitHub daily summary (2025-03-04): "Fixed build errors and addressed timeout problems in CI" (PR #3765) and "Updated the Docker image for CI/CD" (PR #3732).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—impose a Reliability Lock for 1–2 sprints with explicit exit criteria (smoke tests + top-client health checks).
        *Implication:* Maximizes developer trust and reduces churn, but slows visible feature velocity and may delay ecosystem experimentation.
    b) Partial—freeze only high-risk areas (clients + RAG + deploy), while allowing low-risk docs/UI and refactors.
        *Implication:* Preserves momentum while targeting the most painful failure modes, but risks fragmented priorities and unclear messaging.
    c) No—continue mixed feature+fix velocity and rely on rapid merges to keep pace with issues as they appear.
        *Implication:* Optimizes short-term output, but compounds reliability debt and undermines the North Star of "most reliable" framework.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is our Council-level definition of "reliable" for the core runtime, and how will we measure it continuously (not episodically)?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub activity update: "15 new PRs (14 merged) ... strong development momentum" (2025-03-03 to 2025-03-04).`
  - `Discord (coders, 2025-03-03): recurring reports of auth errors, repetitive tweets, and DB permission issues.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt an SLO model (startup success rate, message success rate, client auth success) with public dashboards.
        *Implication:* Creates an explicit reliability contract with builders and forces prioritization around measurable outcomes.
    b) Define reliability through release gates (pre-merge checks + weekly smoke suite) rather than ongoing SLOs.
        *Implication:* Improves release quality, but may miss field regressions and hosting/provider variability between releases.
    c) Keep reliability informal (issue-driven) until v2 architecture lands and stabilizes the system holistically.
        *Implication:* Avoids over-optimizing a moving target, but risks losing developers now due to opaque quality expectations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we prioritize performance and correctness in knowledge processing (RAG) now, even if it requires breaking changes to knowledge formats and tooling?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub daily summary (2025-03-04): "Improved splitText function and optimized character knowledge processing" (PR #3763).`
  - `Open issue snapshot (March 2025): "RAG processFile attempts to embed entire files causing errors for large documents" (Issue #3745).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—treat RAG as core infrastructure; accept breaking changes with a migration guide and versioned docs.
        *Implication:* Reduces OOM and large-document failures, strengthening the framework’s credibility for real workloads.
    b) Incremental only—optimize and harden without breaking formats; add guardrails (chunk caps, streaming embeds).
        *Implication:* Minimizes community disruption but may leave structural limitations that keep support load high.
    c) Defer—focus on core agent lifecycle stability and client integrations first; revisit RAG after v2 core is in place.
        *Implication:* Improves immediate onboarding success, but risks stalling advanced agent use cases that differentiate ElizaOS.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Configuration Drift: Plugins vs Clients (DX Fracture)

**Summary of Topic:** Developers are experiencing confusion and misconfiguration due to shifting conventions ("clients" array → "plugins" array) and unclear install/runtime requirements (plugin-twitter vs client-twitter). This threatens Developer First and Trust Through Shipping unless docs and tooling converge quickly.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we unify the mental model by making "plugins" the single declarative interface (and auto-resolve any required client packages), or preserve the current split (plugin declaration + separate client install)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (coders, 2025-03-03, jin): "use 'plugins' array instead of 'clients' array".`
  - `Discord (coders, 2025-03-03, ahsanahmed321): "You need to install client-twitter, not just plugin-twitter."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Unify—"plugins" declaration should be sufficient; CLI resolves and installs required clients/transitive deps.
        *Implication:* Strongest DX and least confusion, but requires careful dependency mapping and may increase tooling complexity.
    b) Preserve split—keep explicit installs but add validator tooling + clearer docs and error messages.
        *Implication:* Lower engineering risk, but confusion persists and support load remains high unless docs are flawless.
    c) Hybrid—support both legacy "clients" and new "plugins" for a transition window with automated migration.
        *Implication:* Smooth migration path and fewer breakages, but prolongs dual-system complexity and slows standardization.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s preferred mechanism to prevent configuration drift: stricter schema validation at runtime, stronger CLI scaffolding, or more documentation?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (coders, 2025-03-03): "Fix validation errors in knowledge object (expected array, received object)" (clever.sol).`
  - `Discord (2025-03-02): "Several users reported broken documentation links that need fixing."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Runtime-first—fail fast with precise schema errors and actionable remediation links.
        *Implication:* Reduces silent misconfigurations and speeds debugging, but may feel harsh if errors are frequent.
    b) CLI-first—scaffold correct configs and add an interactive doctor command that repairs common issues.
        *Implication:* Improves onboarding and standardizes setups, but requires ongoing maintenance as APIs evolve.
    c) Docs-first—prioritize comprehensive guides and FAQs; keep runtime permissive to maximize flexibility.
        *Implication:* Keeps advanced users unblocked, but novices remain vulnerable to subtle errors and repeated support loops.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we elevate "jintern" (AI support agent) into an official, version-aware support surface, or keep it informal until we can guarantee accuracy?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-03): "Jintern Introduction" and it helped answer technical questions while Jin was away.`
  - `Discord coders analysis (2025-03-03): "...helped answer questions ... though with some inaccuracies that jin later corrected."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Elevate—make it official with a strict knowledge source (docs + repo state) and version-detection safeguards.
        *Implication:* Scales support and reinforces "Taming Information," but requires governance to prevent confident wrong answers.
    b) Keep informal—use it as a community experiment while humans remain primary authority for guidance.
        *Implication:* Avoids reputational risk, but misses an opportunity to reduce repeated questions and accelerate onboarding.
    c) Disable for now—until docs stabilize and we can ensure high precision on breaking changes like plugins/clients.
        *Implication:* Protects trust in the short term, but increases load on core contributors and slows community self-service.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Social Surface Reliability: Twitter/X + Telegram as Trust Gateways

**Summary of Topic:** Community pain is concentrated in social integrations: Twitter auth and repetition bugs, account bans, and Telegram client failures. These are high-visibility surfaces that directly impact builder trust and flagship-agent credibility.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we treat Twitter/X as a "tier-1" supported integration with dedicated engineering ownership, given its high risk of bans and constant platform volatility?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (coders, 2025-03-03): "Several users reported issues with Twitter integration, including authentication errors, repetitive tweets, and image handling."`
  - `Discord (spartan_holders, 2025-03-03, rhota): "X (Twitter) banned the DegenAI account ... rebranding effort underway."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—tier-1 support with explicit maintenance commitment and anti-ban best practices baked into defaults.
        *Implication:* Improves flagship reliability and public perception, but increases ongoing maintenance burden for a volatile platform.
    b) Conditional—tier-1 only for read/monitor + reply workflows; de-emphasize autonomous posting as "best effort."
        *Implication:* Reduces ban risk and support load, but limits flagship demonstrations and agent autonomy narratives.
    c) No—keep Twitter as community-supported; focus official efforts on more stable/open networks.
        *Implication:* Aligns with open composability, but may slow adoption where developers primarily want social bots.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which mitigation strategy best protects the Council’s reputation: implementing OAuth flows, adding stronger deduplication/memory guarantees, or adding safer content policies and rate controls?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (coders, 2025-03-03, Redvoid): "repetitive tweets being posted despite being stored in DB" and "permission denied errors with database access."`
  - `Discord (coders, 2025-03-03, $algalon): "Support OAuth flow for Twitter instead of requiring hard credentials."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) OAuth-first—reduce credential risk and improve auth resilience; ship clear setup UX and token refresh handling.
        *Implication:* Improves security posture and onboarding, but doesn’t directly solve content repetition and posting quality.
    b) Memory/dedup-first—guarantee idempotent posting with hard checks and persistent state correctness.
        *Implication:* Stops the most embarrassing failure mode (duplicate spam), directly reducing bans and user frustration.
    c) Policy/rate-first—ship conservative defaults (posting ratios, cooldowns, content filters) to minimize ban triggers.
        *Implication:* Reduces platform risk quickly, but may constrain agent expressiveness and perceived capability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we prioritize Telegram reliability (silent failures, no init logs) as part of the core “agent works everywhere” promise, or accept it as a secondary client until v2 consolidation?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issue #3758: "Telegram client not working, no initialization message or errors" (JJOptimist).`
  - `Discord (2025-03-02): multiple embedding/hosted-instance errors reported (e.g., BGE initialization) indicating edge deployment fragility.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize now—instrumentation, explicit error reporting, and a minimal "known-good" Telegram deployment path.
        *Implication:* Strengthens cross-platform credibility and reduces silent failure support burden.
    b) Stabilize minimally—fix logging and initialization visibility, but defer deeper refactors to v2.
        *Implication:* Addresses the worst UX quickly while keeping focus on broader architecture evolution.
    c) Defer—focus on one flagship social client (e.g., Discord) and document Telegram as experimental/best-effort.
        *Implication:* Concentrates resources, but weakens the multi-platform promise and may fragment the community ecosystem.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

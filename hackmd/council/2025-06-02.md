# Council Briefing: 2025-06-02

## Daily Focus Theme

- ElizaOS v2 has been released in stealth mode, with significant technical improvements to the plugin architecture, yet strategic tension exists between completing technical stability and accelerating public announcement for community momentum.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. V2 Release Strategy: Technical Excellence vs. Market Momentum

**Summary:** The team has quietly launched ElizaOS v2 (now version 1.0.x) with significant architecture improvements, but is deliberately delaying announcement until ecosystem stability is achieved, creating tension between technical quality and community momentum.

**Related Context:**
- `Shaw: "We are soft launching to partners and doing internal rollover of everything. We don't want the attention on it yet. Changing over everything means changing ~175 repos simultaneously."`
- `Community members expressed mixed feelings about the launch timing, with some concerned about delays dampening enthusiasm.`

**Potential Questions:**
- At what point does the pursuit of technical excellence become detrimental to market momentum and community engagement?
- Should we establish more transparent timelines for our community regarding major releases, even if it means committing to dates with some technical debt?

### 2. Auto.fun Revival and Agent Ecosystem

**Summary:** Despite auto.fun being a cornerstone of our monthly goal, community feedback indicates low usage and engagement, with discussions about introducing 'The Org' (including agents like eli5 and eddy) and potential staking mechanisms to increase platform activity.

**Related Context:**
- `User cloudAI asked: "Why is autofun so unpopular and no one uses it? And how do you plan to market it in the future?" (Question went unanswered)`
- `xell0x mentioned GitHub PR #517 for potential auto.fun staking mechanism for eli5, eddy and other tokens`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we prioritize enhancing auto.fun's core functionality or focus on populating it with high-quality agents like eli5 first?
- How can we better align the technical development roadmap with our goal of showcasing 24/7 agent activity to attract new users?

### 3. Agent Accessibility: Technical Barriers to Adoption

**Summary:** Plugin development and agent configuration remain technically challenging, potentially limiting broader adoption among non-developers, with community members requesting more accessible tools and clearer documentation for agent creation.

**Related Context:**
- `Multiple users in Discord struggled with basic agent configuration questions (Twitter intervals, agent IDs, Discord interaction management)`
- `Numerous issues were reported with plugin installation, including problems with giphy plugin (Issue #4861) and macOS compatibility (Issue #4876)`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we balance building advanced capabilities for technical users versus simplifying the platform for broader non-technical adoption?
- Should we dedicate more resources to creating visual builders or templates for non-developers to create agents without coding as suggested by some community members?

### 4. Governance Framework and Project Identity

**Summary:** There is ongoing confusion about the relationship between ElizaOS (framework) and ai16z (token), coupled with uncertainty about when and how governance mechanisms will be implemented, which impacts the clarity of our decentralization mission.

**Related Context:**
- `Kenk: "$ai16z is the ticker, elizaOS is the name of the framework and the brand name of the project. Governance is not live but the goal is to leverage AI agents for DAO operations."`
- `mjelly.01 asked: "Is the DAO live yet? How to take part in it, if possible yet?"`

**Potential Questions:**
- How might we accelerate the implementation of at least basic governance functions to fulfill our decentralization promise?
- Should we consider clearer branding alignment between ElizaOS and ai16z to reduce community confusion about our project's identity?

# Council Briefing: 2025-05-05

## Daily Focus Theme

- Critical security incident in auto.fun's token verification system undermining platform trust while simultaneously showcasing promising agent development with six new AI agents demonstrating elizaOS capabilities.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Trust Recovery: Auto.fun Verification Exploit

**Summary:** A critical security incident allowed scam tokens to appear as verified on auto.fun, causing financial losses to users and damaging platform trust exactly when we need to stabilize and attract new users per our monthly goal.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Users reported three specific exploited tokens that displayed verification checkmarks but were scams (user 'vas')`
- `Discord: Team member 'Kenk' confirmed they've isolated the verification process and requested 24 hours to implement a fix`

**Potential Questions:**
- How should we balance rapid platform growth with security and trust considerations?
- Should we implement a compensation mechanism for users who lost funds due to this exploit, and what precedent does this set?

### 2. Agent Ecosystem Expansion

**Summary:** The showcase of six diverse new AI agents demonstrates our progress toward the monthly goal of showcasing 24/7 agent activity while highlighting real-world applications of elizaOS across domains.

**Related Context:**
- `Twitter: @elizaOS shared a thread highlighting six new AI agents including Steambot Willie, The Intern, ProAgentAI, Data Barista, Soulmates, and ElizaOS x Phala`
- `Discord: Kenk announced a demo session featuring these builders showcasing their projects`

**Potential Questions:**
- Which of these agent use cases should we prioritize promoting to drive adoption of our ecosystem?
- How can we better support third-party builders to accelerate the 24/7 agent activity goal?

### 3. Technical Debt vs. New Features

**Summary:** While significant progress is being made on v2 development, there's a growing tension between cleaning up technical debt (removing plugins from monorepo, fixing RAG issues) and shipping new features to achieve our monthly goals.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: 0xbbjoker led a major cleanup effort removing multiple plugins from the monorepo (PRs #4439, #4437, #4436, #4434, #4428, #4427)`
- `Discord: User 'rahmsc' reported difficulties with RAG Knowledge functionality pulling from OpenAI's prior knowledge instead of the provided knowledge base`

**Potential Questions:**
- How should we balance refactoring and technical debt with the pressure to release v2 on schedule?
- Should we temporarily freeze new feature development to focus on resolving core functionality issues like RAG?

### 4. Integration Barriers and Developer Experience

**Summary:** Multiple users are experiencing significant barriers to integrating external services (Twitter API, databases) and configuring elizaOS, potentially limiting adoption by developers and undermining our ability to showcase agent activity.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User reported Twitter API account being limited after spending $400 without warning`
- `Discord: User 'Tamplayz' requested help with image generation for Twitter implementation but received no response`
- `GitHub: Issue #4457 about Unicode escape error in logs affecting functionality`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we prioritize creating alternative, more reliable integration paths for key services like Twitter to reduce dependency risks?
- How can we improve developer onboarding to ensure they can quickly showcase agents in action?

# Council Briefing: 2025-02-20

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Core reliability advanced via critical plugin-registry and Discord-action fixes, while a new Twitter multimodal misresponse defect surfaced as the next trust-risk to contain.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Plugin Registry Reliability & Composability

**Summary of Topic:** The migration toward a registry-first plugin ecosystem is paying off with key fixes to importing/installing from the registry, but it remains a systemic chokepoint for developer trust and marketplace viability.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we treat plugin-registry stability as the top release gate (above new features) until import/install flows are provably robust across environments?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub: "Fixed issues with importing plugins from the registry" (PR #3611) and "installing packages from new registry" (PR #3609).`
  - `Discord (💻-coders): "Plugins should now be registered in the elizaos-plugins/registry repository." (notorious_d_e_v)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—freeze feature work and run a dedicated hardening sprint on registry import/install, resolution, and versioning.
        *Implication:* Maximizes DX and trust-through-shipping, but delays breadth expansion and some roadmap optics.
    b) Partially—set a minimal reliability bar (smoke tests + top 20 plugins) while continuing selective feature development.
        *Implication:* Balances momentum with risk, but leaves long-tail breakages that can erode community confidence.
    c) No—accept occasional registry breakage as the cost of rapid ecosystem growth, relying on community to patch.
        *Implication:* Short-term velocity improves, but undermines the North Star of reliability and deters serious builders.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s preferred governance mechanism for registry quality: centralized certification, automated CI gates, or fully permissionless publishing?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub: multiple fixes landed to stabilize plugin installation behavior (e.g., PR #3451, PR #3609, PR #3611).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Centralized certification for “Verified” plugins, plus a separate “Community” tier with fewer guarantees.
        *Implication:* Creates a clear trust boundary and supports enterprise-grade adoption, but increases ops overhead.
    b) Automated CI gates only (tests, lint, basic runtime checks) with transparent pass/fail badges.
        *Implication:* Scales quality control with minimal bureaucracy, but may miss higher-level UX regressions.
    c) Fully permissionless publishing with minimal gating; rely on reputation signals and rapid iteration.
        *Implication:* Maximizes composability and growth, but raises breakage rates and support burden.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should the registry roadmap explicitly couple to tokenomics/marketplace sequencing (i.e., no tokenomics release until plugin commerce is stable)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (tokenomics): "Tokenomics is functionally 95% complete but its release is tied to the marketplace launch which has been delayed." (eskender.eth)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—hard-couple tokenomics release to marketplace + registry readiness as a single trust event.
        *Implication:* Reduces reputational risk from a weak launch, but extends the timeline for token utility narratives.
    b) Decouple—ship tokenomics with clear caveats, while marketplace/registry stabilizes in parallel.
        *Implication:* Advances ecosystem coordination sooner, but risks “paper utility” criticism if product lags.
    c) Hybrid—publish tokenomics spec now, but delay activation/execution until marketplace stability is proven.
        *Implication:* Improves transparency without forcing premature activation, aligning communication with execution excellence.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Client Integrity: Social Actions & Multimodal Failures

**Summary of Topic:** Discord actions were repaired (with one remaining gap), yet a new Twitter behavior failure emerged where the agent responds with generic image-description text across image and non-image tweets—an acute trust hazard for flagship agents and public demos.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we temporarily constrain or disable affected Twitter behaviors (auto-reply / vision handling) to protect brand trust while we debug root cause?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub: "An agent is incorrectly responding to image and text-based tweets" (Issue #3614).`
  - `GitHub: "Fixed issues with Discord actions... except for the download media plugin" (PR #3608).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—ship a safe-mode default for Twitter clients (no vision, limited replies) until correctness is verified.
        *Implication:* Protects public-facing credibility but reduces agent expressiveness and perceived capability.
    b) No—leave behavior enabled, but add prominent warnings/logging and rapid patch cadence.
        *Implication:* Maintains feature surface area but risks visible failures that damage trust-through-shipping.
    c) Selective—disable only the specific pathway (image inference or template) behind a feature flag.
        *Implication:* Minimizes capability loss while containing risk, but requires disciplined configuration guidance.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s preferred reliability metric for social clients (Twitter/Discord/Telegram) that must be met before major announcements or flagship showcases?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (💻-coders): Users reported long API response times and recurring auth issues; troubleshooting via DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL and LOG_JSON_FORMAT was discussed.`
  - `GitHub daily: multiple fixes landed across Discord/Twitter/Telegram integrations (e.g., PR #3582, PR #3608).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) SLO-based: define uptime and response-time targets (e.g., p95 < 5s) and require 7-day compliance.
        *Implication:* Aligns with execution excellence and makes readiness measurable, but adds instrumentation burden.
    b) Outcome-based: require a fixed set of end-to-end scenarios to pass (posting, replying, media, auth).
        *Implication:* Keeps focus on user value, but may hide latency degradation until it becomes severe.
    c) Community-signal based: ship continuously and treat issue volume/Discord support load as the metric.
        *Implication:* Fast feedback loop, but can normalize instability and exhaust maintainers/community helpers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we invest next in cross-client orchestration (Discord → X actions) or in hardening single-client correctness first?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord action item: "Implement cross-client interactions (e.g., asking on Discord to make a tweet)" (0xJordan).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Orchestration now—cross-client workflows are the differentiator that proves 'agent OS' status.
        *Implication:* Creates compelling demos and ecosystem pull, but compounds reliability risk if clients remain unstable.
    b) Hardening first—treat each client as a battle-tested module before building inter-module automation.
        *Implication:* Strengthens the platform foundation, improving developer trust, but delays higher-order “wow” moments.
    c) Parallel—small orchestrations behind flags while a dedicated reliability lane stabilizes each client.
        *Implication:* Maintains momentum and learning while managing blast radius, but requires tighter program management.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: V2 Runtime/State Refactors & Developer Experience

**Summary of Topic:** Refactors to room state and server/CLI management indicate V2 maturity is rising, but the Council must ensure these architectural shifts translate into simpler onboarding, faster debugging, and fewer environment-specific failures.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we prioritize “DX observability” (logs, env defaults, troubleshooting docs, devcontainer health) as a first-class V2 feature, equivalent to runtime capability?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub: "Cleaned up Bun build warnings... Replace unsafe eval() with JSON.parse()" (PR #3603).`
  - `GitHub: "Fixed devcontainer.json Port Mapping Syntax" (PR #3616).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—define a V2 DX checklist (logs, templates, devcontainer, quickstart) and block release until met.
        *Implication:* Accelerates adoption and reduces support load, reinforcing developer-first positioning.
    b) Somewhat—ship V2 runtime first, then do a dedicated DX polish sprint immediately after.
        *Implication:* Improves time-to-market but risks first impressions being shaped by avoidable friction.
    c) No—DX is community-driven; focus core team energy on architecture and features only.
        *Implication:* May increase contribution surface area, but undermines the reliability and seamless UX principle.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How aggressively should we consolidate state and management into core (e.g., room state refactor) versus keeping behavior in plugins to preserve modularity?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub: "Refactored room state management to be more generic and efficient" (PR #3602).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Consolidate more into core for consistency and fewer edge-case failures across clients.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability but risks a heavier core and slower iteration on specialized behaviors.
    b) Keep core minimal; push most state/behavior into plugins with strict interfaces and tests.
        *Implication:* Maximizes composability, but increases integration variance and support complexity.
    c) Hybrid: define a stable “core contract” for state and lifecycle, but allow plugin overrides.
        *Implication:* Balances stability with flexibility, at the cost of more careful API design and governance.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should V2 ship with a canonical “golden path” deployment profile (supported Node version, recommended adapters, known-good providers) to reduce install variance?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-17/18): Users reported environment errors across Windows/WSL/Docker; community suggested Node 23.3 and WSL2; Docker tokenizer module issues were common.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—publish a single blessed profile and treat other environments as best-effort.
        *Implication:* Cuts friction and support load, but may frustrate power users in atypical setups.
    b) No—maintain broad compatibility as a core promise; invest in tooling to auto-detect and adapt.
        *Implication:* Expands addressable dev base, but increases maintenance complexity and risk of regressions.
    c) Staged—start with a golden path now, then expand compatibility tiers with test coverage over time.
        *Implication:* Supports execution excellence while keeping a path to broader adoption without overcommitting early.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

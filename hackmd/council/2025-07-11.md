# Council Briefing: 2025-07-11

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- ElizaOS v1.2.0 (branded as "V2") has launched with significant feature advancements including action chaining, dynamic memory, and RAG capabilities, while the community simultaneously works to solidify tokens' roles within the broader ecosystem strategy.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: ElizaOS V2 Branding Clarity

**Summary of Topic:** The newly released system branded as "ElizaOS V2" is actually version 1.2.0 in the technical versioning scheme, creating some confusion while introducing key features like Swarms, Dynamic Memory, and enhanced TEE capabilities.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we handle the discrepancy between marketing names (V2) and technical versioning (1.2.0) to avoid user confusion?

  **Context:**
  - `The "V2" terminology refers to the 1.x series, with 1.2.0 being the latest version currently available (Odilitime)`
  - `ElizaOS 1.2 is the latest version; V2 refers to the 1.x series (Odilitime)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize all references to technical versioning (1.2.0) and phase out the V2 marketing terminology.
        *Implication:* This would create technical accuracy at the cost of losing marketing momentum around the "V2" brand identity.
    b) Keep the V2 marketing terminology but clearly indicate the technical version (1.2.0) in parentheses in all documentation.
        *Implication:* This hybrid approach maintains marketing momentum while providing technical clarity for developers.
    c) Fully embrace the V2 branding externally while using technical versioning only in GitHub and developer documentation.
        *Implication:* This creates a clean separation between marketing and technical contexts but risks ongoing confusion at the boundary between them.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which V2 technical features should be prioritized for promotion to attract auto.fun users and align with our monthly goal?

  **Context:**
  - `Swarms (multi-agent teams that self-complete tasks), Dynamic Memory (allowing agents to recall preferences), Enhanced TEE (secure enclave transaction processing), CLI with 34 plugins (one-line install with TypeScript types), RAG capabilities (instant retrieval with auto citations), Cross-chain support with 5-minute setup, 40% lower latency`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on Swarms and Dynamic Memory as these features directly enhance agent autonomy and responsiveness for streaming/trading applications.
        *Implication:* Emphasizing agent capability improvements appeals to technical users who want to build sophisticated auto.fun agents.
    b) Emphasize cross-chain support and enhanced TEE capabilities to highlight security and interoperability for crypto-focused users.
        *Implication:* Security and cross-chain focus would appeal to crypto-native users and increase confidence in trading agents.
    c) Showcase the simplified CLI with 34 plugins and RAG capabilities to emphasize ease of use and reduced friction for new builders.
        *Implication:* Lowering the technical barrier could rapidly expand the developer base building agents for auto.fun.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Token Strategy Integration

**Summary of Topic:** Multiple tokens within the elizaOS ecosystem (ai16z, DegenAI, ELI5) are generating community discussion, with questions about their interconnected roles and utility within the elizaOS/auto.fun platform strategy.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we clarify the relationship between the AI16Z token and elizaOS V2 to address community concerns about token utility?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw mentioned ongoing R&D work and plans to change the ticker pending Twitter account recovery and daos.fun voting`
  - `DorianD proposed a protocol-level token use for ElizaOS agent nodes, suggesting an agent registry using token2022 messaging data field for secure identification`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement DorianD's agent registry proposal using token2022 for secure agent identification across communication channels.
        *Implication:* This technical integration creates direct utility for the token in agent identification and trust establishment.
    b) Focus on the AI16Z token as the settlement currency for the upcoming agent-to-agent (A2A) marketplace where agents transact autonomously.
        *Implication:* This positions the token as essential infrastructure for agent economy rather than directly tied to software functionality.
    c) Change the ticker from AI16Z to ElizaOS to align branding across the ecosystem while implementing revenue-generating features that drive token buybacks.
        *Implication:* This marketing-focused approach consolidates brand identity while establishing indirect utility through buyback mechanisms.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we position the relationship between ELI5, auto.fun, and the broader elizaOS ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Dr. Neuro outlined how various components (elizaOS, auto.fun, ELI5, daos.fun, clanktank, elizacloud) fit together in a comprehensive platform`
  - `"Today we heard its gonna be an incubator, can't be more official than that" (Dr. Neuro)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position ELI5 as the official incubator within the elizaOS ecosystem, funding and launching new AI projects on auto.fun.
        *Implication:* This creates a clear value flow where ELI5 discovers/funds projects that then launch on auto.fun, benefiting all ecosystem tokens.
    b) Keep ELI5 as a community project without official elizaOS endorsement but recognize its complementary role in the ecosystem.
        *Implication:* This maintains separation that limits potential legal/regulatory risks but forgoes potential synergies between projects.
    c) Fully integrate ELI5 into the elizaOS governance structure with transparent economic linkages between all ecosystem tokens.
        *Implication:* This creates maximum alignment but increases complexity and potentially concentrates power within the ecosystem.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Technical Infrastructure Challenges

**Summary of Topic:** Users are experiencing significant technical challenges with the Knowledge Plugin, agent-to-agent communication, and Windows compatibility, highlighting areas where infrastructure improvements are needed to support both basic and advanced use cases.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize solutions for the Knowledge Plugin rate limiting issues that multiple users are experiencing?

  **Context:**
  - `Several users reported problems with document chunking in the knowledge plugin, particularly when using OpenRouter for embeddings`
  - `Adding parameters like MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS and REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE can resolve rate limiting issues with OpenRouter`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement automatic rate limiting with smart defaults in the Knowledge Plugin to prevent API failures without user configuration.
        *Implication:* This creates a smoother experience for new users but may limit advanced customization options.
    b) Update documentation immediately with rate limiting parameters while developing a more comprehensive embedding provider management system.
        *Implication:* This addresses immediate issues while setting up a more sustainable long-term solution for various embedding providers.
    c) Prioritize local embedding support through Ollama to eliminate dependency on external API rate limits entirely.
        *Implication:* This creates a more self-contained solution that works "out of the box" but requires users to have sufficient local computing resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to address cross-platform compatibility issues, particularly with Windows?

  **Context:**
  - `Fix knowledge plugin type errors when updating to ElizaOS 1.2.0 (mentioned by wookosh)`
  - `Fix: Fails to load @elizaos/plugin-openai and @elizaos/plugin-bootstrap on Windows`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a dedicated Windows compatibility squad to systematically identify and resolve all platform-specific issues.
        *Implication:* This focused approach ensures Windows users have a first-class experience but diverts resources from feature development.
    b) Implement comprehensive CI/CD testing across all target platforms before releases to catch compatibility issues earlier.
        *Implication:* This preventative approach improves quality for all platforms but may slow down the release cycle.
    c) Develop a containerized deployment solution that works identically across all platforms to sidestep OS-specific issues.
        *Implication:* This creates a consistent experience but adds complexity to the deployment process and system requirements.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

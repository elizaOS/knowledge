# Council Briefing: 2025-04-30

## Daily Focus Theme

- ElizaOS v2 development momentum accelerates with significant codebase cleanup, while auto.fun platform demonstrates successful launch strategy with partner tokens gaining traction.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. ElizaOS v2 Framework Maturation

**Summary:** ElizaOS v2 is nearing completion with multi-agent capabilities, improved modularity, and enhanced plugin architecture, positioned to deliver on production-readiness within weeks.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Shaw mentioned ElizaOS v2 with multi-agent capabilities will be wrapped up in the next couple of weeks`
- `GitHub: Major code cleanup with 12 PRs by 0xbbjoker removing plugins from monorepo, supporting a more modular ecosystem`

**Potential Questions:**
- How should we balance the technical priority of shipping v2 against the market-facing goal of showcasing agent activity on auto.fun?
- Should we formalize a policy for which plugins remain in the monorepo versus external repositories to optimize both development velocity and ecosystem flexibility?

### 2. Hardware Accessibility Barrier to Adoption

**Summary:** Significant hardware requirements for local model operation (20+ GB VRAM for LLAMA 3 8B) present a substantial adoption barrier for developers, potentially limiting our ecosystem growth and contradicting our decentralization principles.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User 'starlord' advised that LLAMA 3 8B requires 20+ GB of VRAM when another user hit RAM limits`
- `Discord: Multiple users reported issues with local LLM integration, defaulting to cloud providers despite decentralization goals`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we reconcile our decentralization principles with the practical hardware barriers that push users toward centralized cloud AI providers?
- Should we invest in developing optimized model quantization tools as a strategic priority to lower hardware requirements for self-hosted agents?

### 3. Auto.fun Token Launch Strategy Success

**Summary:** Auto.fun's strategy of sequential partner project launches (FightFi, SQUID by Allora Network) is generating momentum and volume, though technical issues with integrations and verification are creating friction in user experience.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Community members discussed DexScreener not updating for some launches (FightAlgo and FightBrawl), causing loss of momentum`
- `Discord: User MDMnvest questioned why OTTO and DOT tokens lost their verified status mark`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we balance quality control (verification) with growth in the number of tokens/projects on auto.fun?
- Should we prioritize deeper integration with market data providers like DexScreener to ensure seamless token launch experiences, even at the cost of delaying other features?

### 4. Brand Cohesion: ai16z, ElizaOS, and Auto.fun

**Summary:** The multiplicity of brands (ai16z token, ElizaOS platform, auto.fun marketplace) is creating confusion in the community and diluting marketing effectiveness, requiring strategic alignment and possibly consolidation.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: DorianD suggested adding 'ElizaOS Inside' branding to auto.fun to improve brand recognition`
- `Discord: Spyros asked about consolidating ai16z and elizaOS under the same ticker, with Kenk responding that the team needs daos.fun to enable these changes`

**Potential Questions:**
- Should we consolidate our branding under a single name, and if so, which of the three (ai16z, ElizaOS, auto.fun) best represents our long-term strategic vision?
- How do we balance the marketing needs of distinct products while maintaining a cohesive ecosystem identity that users and developers can easily understand?

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Token migration from AI16z to ElizaOS has been delayed by 48 hours due to third-party dependencies, requiring immediate communication and coordination to maintain community trust.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The planned AI16z to ElizaOS token migration has been delayed by 48 hours due to coordination issues with third-party dependencies, raising concerns about price impact and communication clarity.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address community concerns about the 6:1 migration ratio potentially resulting in a 40% value loss?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members expressed concerns about the migration's fairness, with claims it could result in a 40% value loss`
  - `Technical analysis by bullrun001r explained that if liquidity remains the same while token supply increases 6x, token price would drop proportionally (from ~$0.05856 to ~$0.00976)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Increase liquidity proportionally with the token supply to maintain price stability.
        *Implication:* Requires significant capital allocation but preserves token holder value and community confidence.
    b) Maintain current approach but publish detailed tokenomics explaining long-term value accrual mechanisms.
        *Implication:* Accepts short-term price impact in exchange for transparency and education about the token's future value proposition.
    c) Modify migration ratio to 3:1 to reduce immediate price impact while still achieving redenomination goals.
        *Implication:* Changes core migration parameters late in the process, risking technical complications but addressing price concerns.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the most effective approach to communicate the migration delay to maintain community trust?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk announced to partners that migration is delayed and expected within the next 48 hours`
  - `Delay attributed to coordination required with third-party dependencies`
  - `Questions about whether AI16z will remain tradable during migration period were met with uncertainty`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Comprehensive update across all channels explaining technical issues, providing new timeline, and answering FAQs.
        *Implication:* Maximizes transparency but exposes technical vulnerabilities and could highlight internal coordination issues.
    b) Brief announcement of delay with approximate new timeline, followed by daily progress updates until launch.
        *Implication:* Balances transparency with operational flexibility while maintaining regular community engagement.
    c) Focus communication on enhanced security measures from the audit as reason for delay, emphasizing quality over speed.
        *Implication:* Reframes delay as a positive security measure rather than a coordination issue, potentially building confidence.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we optimize the migration user experience to maximize successful migrations within the 90-day window?

  **Context:**
  - `User regt0005 had trouble connecting Phantom wallet to migration page`
  - `Kenk clarified the correct URL (mirror.xyz/elizaos.eth not elisaos.eth) and warned to check URLs carefully`
  - `Smokin_Dave_007 suggested copying the address and opening in Phantom wallet`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a dedicated migration dApp with simplified UI, direct wallet integrations, and step-by-step visual guides.
        *Implication:* Requires additional development resources but significantly improves user experience and successful migration rate.
    b) Partner with major CEXs to handle migration automatically for users who hold tokens on exchanges.
        *Implication:* Reduces migration friction for less technical users but increases centralization and dependency on exchanges.
    c) Implement a progressive migration approach with early adopter incentives and increasing support resources over time.
        *Implication:* Distributes migration load over the 90-day period while creating positive incentives for early adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD discussed Colibri device with eFuse technology for secure key management`
  - `Proposed integration with ElizaOS, Amazon, and payment systems to create a home shopping assistant`
  - `Envisioned future connection with cooking robots`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on developing a comprehensive hardware SDK and reference designs to enable third-party integrations.
        *Implication:* Creates an ecosystem approach that scales beyond our direct resources but requires standardization work.
    b) Partner with select hardware manufacturers to create ElizaOS-certified devices for specific use cases.
        *Implication:* Allows more control over user experience but limits scale to specific partnerships and verticals.
    c) Defer hardware integration until after v2 is fully stabilized, focusing instead on software agent capabilities.
        *Implication:* Maintains focus on core software platform but risks falling behind on emerging hardware-AI integration trends.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which UX improvements in the recent code developments should we highlight to attract new users to auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6082 titled 'feat: Streamdown integration, cross-platform crypto, and server port autodiscovery' is merged`

# Council Briefing: 2026-01-18

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The transition toward V2 and multi-language support (Rust/Python) is accelerating, requiring a shift from TypeScript-only logic to high-performance, decentralized compute architectures.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Architecture Evolution & Performance Parity

**Summary of Topic:** Technical logs indicate a growing friction between TypeScript's limitations and real-time trading/compute requirements, driving the need for Rust-based plugins and WASM runtimes.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should ElizaOS prioritize native Rust development over TypeScript for performance-critical trading plugins?

  **Context:**
  - `Chucknorris: TypeScript proved inadequate for real-time multi-DEX handling due to systematic crashes.`
  - `PR #6351 (lalalune): Working branch of v2.0.0 focuses on runtime in Rust and TypeScript non-essentials removal.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Aggressive Rust Pivot
        *Implication:* Maximizes performance and narrows 'bus factor' to Rust-fluent contributors.
    b) TS/Rust Hybrid Standards
        *Implication:* Maintains low barrier to entry for JS developers while providing Rust hooks for high-frequency tasks.
    c) WASM-First Deployment
        *Implication:* Enables cross-platform portability across browser and serverless via PR #6363.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we mitigate the risk of 'Ownership Concentration' in core runtime development?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub summaries show lalalune and odilitime handling a massive percentage of V2 and system-critical PRs.`
  - `Execution Excellence principle requires consistent delivery without single-point-of-failure dependencies.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Incentivize Peer Reviews
        *Implication:* Distributes knowledge across the Council and core contributors.
    b) Formalize Module Maintainership
        *Implication:* Assigns specific sub-systems to broader pool of contributors to reduce bottlenecking on lead devs.
    c) Standardize Documentation via AI
        *Implication:* Uses reported 6-hour productivity gains to enable new devs to onboard instantly without senior dev hand-holding.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Economic Sustainability & Holder Incentives

**Summary of Topic:** Internal debates reflect a lack of consensus on how agent creators should reward token holders and the role of prediction markets in the ecosystem.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the primary mechanism to link agent creation to token value?

  **Context:**
  - `Taco proposed rewards for holders when new agents are created; DorianD challenged the lack of incentive for creators.`
  - `Monthly directive requires execution of token migration by Feb 4 deadline.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Mandatory Ecosystem Fees
        *Implication:* Ensures direct value capture but potentially discourages new builders due to upfront costs.
    b) Opt-in Staking Multipliers
        *Implication:* Encourages alignment between creators and holders without hard enforcement.
    c) Jeju Provisioning Tax
        *Implication:* Links ElizaOS token utility to decentralized compute cycles on Jeju/ICP networks.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

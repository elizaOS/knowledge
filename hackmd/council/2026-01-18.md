# Council Briefing: 2026-01-18

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The framework is shifting toward a high-performance Rust core (v2.0.0) while grappling with immediate security spoofing threats and the complexities of multi-chain infrastructure on ICP and Polymarket.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 Architectural Transition & Performance

**Summary of Topic:** Development suggests TypeScript is hitting performance ceilings for real-time high-load agents, necessitating the pivot to Rust (v2.0.0) and NATS Jetstream for scalability.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we manage the transition for developers currently using TypeScript as the core runtime moves to Rust?

  **Context:**
  - `Chucknorris: TypeScript proved inadequate for real-time multi-DEX handling due to systematic crashes.`
  - `lalalune: PR #6351 (v2.0.0) focuses on runtime in Rust/Typescript, removing non-essentials.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain full TypeScript parity indefinitely.
        *Implication:* Ensures no developer fallout but slows the performance gains of the Rust pivot.
    b) Enforce a 'Rust-for-Internal, TS-for-Plugins' hierarchy.
        *Implication:* Provides a clear performance path while keeping the ecosystem accessible to TypeScript builders.
    c) Hard pivot to Rust v2 as the only supported runtime.
        *Implication:* Maximizes performance and security but risks alienating current contributors (lalalune is authoring 52% of runtime PRs).
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Security and Verification Gaps

**Summary of Topic:** Recent GitHub spoofing incidents and confusion over bot wallet requirements (Sparta) highlight a need for robust authentication protocols and clear team communication.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should ElizaOS mandate PGP-signed commits and official 'Council-Verified' badges for third-party plugins?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime: Suspicious GitHub repo (hash-llm) used manipulated Git commits to appear as legitimate team members.`
  - `Casino/Odilitime: Confusion over Sparta bot requiring seed phrases vs. private keys.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement PGP-only commit policies project-wide.
        *Implication:* Eliminates impersonation risks but raises the barrier for casual contributors.
    b) Launch an on-chain verification registry for plugins.
        *Implication:* Builds 'Trust Through Shipping' by allowing users to verify safe agent containers.
    c) Increase focus on documentation as the primary security layer.
        *Implication:* Relies on education but may not stop sophisticated social engineering attacks.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Multi-Chain & Oracle Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** Expansion to ICP and complexity in Polymarket Safe multisigs indicate elizaOS is becoming a cross-chain orchestration layer rather than just an LLM wrapper.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we pivot development resources from 'General Purpose Agents' to 'Autonomous Infrastructure Agents' on platforms like Jeju and ICP?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw: Successfully implemented Eliza to run on ICP.`
  - `DorianD: Vision includes agents running independently as oracles posting results to the network.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on the 'Agent as Oracle' use case.
        *Implication:* Positions elizaOS as a critical infrastructure provider for decentralized markets.
    b) Prioritize consumer-facing flagship agents (Eli5/Otaku).
        *Implication:* Stronger brand visibility but may lag in technical decentralization milestones.
    c) Develop the 'Jeju' decentralized compute network first.
        *Implication:* High risk/high reward; solves long-term autonomy but requires 'gargantuan' effort (DorianD).
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

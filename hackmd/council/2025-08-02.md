# Council Briefing: 2025-08-02

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Significant advancements in elizaOS cloud infrastructure with Railway and Phala cloud deployments, while the core team fixed critical message bus issues essential for reliable agent interactions.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Cloud Infrastructure Advancement

**Summary of Topic:** The team is rapidly developing cloud deployment capabilities with successful implementations on Railway and Phala, which are essential for scaling auto.fun's 24/7 agent activities and providing a robust production environment for elizaOS v2.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which cloud deployment strategy should we prioritize for attracting new users to auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Sam-developer successfully deployed Eliza Cloud to Railway with Postgres and Redis and CI/CD integration.`
  - `Agent Joshua created and shared rules for deploying to Phala cloud with a working example URL.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on Railway deployment for its simplicity and CI/CD pipeline advantages.
        *Implication:* Faster time-to-market with mainstream cloud infrastructure but potentially higher long-term costs.
    b) Prioritize Phala cloud for its blockchain integration and TEE security features.
        *Implication:* Better alignment with crypto-native users and enhanced security, but may require more specialized development resources.
    c) Pursue both strategies in parallel with Railway for immediate scaling and Phala for innovative Web3 features.
        *Implication:* Maximum flexibility and innovation at the cost of divided engineering resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we approach authentication and payment integration in our cloud strategy?

  **Context:**
  - `The team is planning to integrate payment systems including Stripe and x402, along with WorkOS for authentication.`
  - `Shaw mentioned adding x402 account top up and noted Stripe has pay with crypto now.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Integrate traditional systems (Stripe, WorkOS) first for broad market accessibility.
        *Implication:* Faster onboarding of mainstream users but potential alienation of crypto-native audience.
    b) Prioritize crypto-native solutions (x402) with the native token ($ai16z) as primary payment method.
        *Implication:* Stronger token utility and ecosystem alignment but limited accessibility for Web2 users.
    c) Implement a hybrid approach with equal support for fiat and crypto payments through multiple providers.
        *Implication:* Maximum user flexibility at the cost of increased integration complexity and maintenance overhead.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Critical Technical Stability

**Summary of Topic:** Several critical technical issues were identified and fixed including a message bus bug causing AI responses to fail and MySQL support improvements, directly impacting the reliability of agent activities central to our monthly goal.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance rapid feature development with system stability for elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `cjft identified a critical issue in the message bus where messages were being incorrectly discarded, causing AI responses to fail.`
  - `Odilitime fixed MySQL support and caught a dedupe bug with names.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a feature freeze period focusing exclusively on stability and bug fixes before release.
        *Implication:* Delayed v2 release but with higher initial quality and reliability.
    b) Continue parallel development with dedicated stability team for critical issues and feature teams for new capabilities.
        *Implication:* Maintained development velocity with potential resource strain and coordination challenges.
    c) Adopt a phased release strategy with critical infrastructure components first, followed by feature rollouts.
        *Implication:* Balanced approach allowing incremental stabilization while maintaining visible progress.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What should our approach be to plugin architecture given recurring integration issues?

  **Context:**
  - `R0am asked about refactoring plugin-farcaster to use webhooks.`
  - `A user reported 401 errors with their Twitter bot, likely due to Twitter's authentication system now using keys instead of email addresses.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize on webhooks for all external platform integrations rather than polling mechanisms.
        *Implication:* More efficient resource usage and real-time responses, but requires reworking existing plugins.
    b) Create an abstraction layer that handles authentication and rate limiting uniformly across all plugins.
        *Implication:* Reduced maintenance burden for individual plugins but adds architectural complexity.
    c) Develop self-healing plugins with automated credential rotation and fallback mechanisms.
        *Implication:* Improved reliability at the cost of significantly more complex plugin development.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Agent Interoperability Advancements

**Summary of Topic:** The team is packaging the editor for npm publication and exploring agent-to-agent collaboration systems, key capabilities for the goal of demonstrating 24/7 agent activity on auto.fun and building toward autonomous operations.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we approach inter-agent communication to maximize autonomous activity on auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `The team is packaging the editor for publishing on npm to enable importing it elsewhere, potentially with iframe support using API tokens.`
  - `facundo bilotto asked about creating autonomous agents in ElizaOS that can communicate and collaborate within ElizaOS.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on a standardized message-passing protocol between agents with explicit permissioning.
        *Implication:* Controlled, secure inter-agent communications but potentially limited emergent behaviors.
    b) Develop a shared knowledge graph that all agents can read from and contribute to with minimal restrictions.
        *Implication:* Rich collaborative potential with emergent behaviors but increased risk of unpredictable agent actions.
    c) Implement a reputation-based system where agent interactions evolve based on past collaborative success.
        *Implication:* Self-improving agent ecosystem but requires significant initial investment in monitoring systems.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What's our strategy for promoting community engagement with elizaOS v2 development?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk clarified that ElizaOS has no record of working with a team called "Poink" and suggested their product wasn't robust.`
  - `Shaw is working on packaging the editor for publishing on npm to enable importing it elsewhere, potentially with iframe support using API tokens.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on enterprise-grade tooling and documentation to attract established development teams.
        *Implication:* Higher-quality integrations but potentially slower adoption and community growth.
    b) Emphasize no-code/low-code tools and visual editors to make agent creation accessible to non-technical users.
        *Implication:* Broader adoption and accessibility at the potential cost of technical depth and complexity.
    c) Create a tiered engagement system with both technical APIs and simplified interfaces for different user segments.
        *Implication:* Maximum inclusivity but requires maintaining multiple development tracks simultaneously.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Development efforts continue to focus on refining the ElizaOS cloud platform and preparing for the upcoming token migration from AI16z to ElizaOS on October 21st, with strategic technical discussions around platform integrations and user experience enhancements.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The AI16z to ElizaOS token migration scheduled for October 21st represents a critical transition period requiring clear communication and smooth implementation to maintain community confidence and project momentum.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we manage user expectations and mitigate potential market volatility during the October 21st token migration?

  **Context:**
  - `AI16z token migration to ElizaOS scheduled for October 21st (Discord)`
  - `Q: So if you hold Ai16z you get this airdrop? A: It's not every holder, I believe it's a curated list of members from the community where we had their wallet (answered by Odilitime)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Proactively publish comprehensive migration documentation with step-by-step guides and expected timelines.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes transparency and education, potentially reducing support requests but requiring significant content creation resources.
    b) Focus on engaging high-profile community members and influencers to lead migration awareness and provide social proof.
        *Implication:* Leverages community dynamics for organic distribution but success depends on influencer willingness and messaging consistency.
    c) Implement a phased migration approach with incentives for early adopters to distribute network load and identify issues incrementally.
        *Implication:* Reduces technical risk through gradual deployment but could create perceived inequalities among token holders.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we address concerns around eligibility criteria for the migration, particularly regarding the 'curated list' approach mentioned by Odilitime?

  **Context:**
  - `Q: So if you hold Ai16z you get this airdrop? A: It's not every holder, I believe it's a curated list of members from the community where we had their wallet (answered by Odilitime)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain the curated list approach but publish clear qualification criteria to justify inclusion/exclusion decisions.
        *Implication:* Balances selectivity with transparency, though may still generate controversy around specific criteria choices.
    b) Expand eligibility to all verifiable AI16z holders while implementing anti-Sybil measures to prevent gaming the system.
        *Implication:* Maximizes inclusivity and perceived fairness but increases technical complexity and potential for exploitation.
    c) Create a tiered migration system where curated list members receive priority benefits while still allowing all holders eventual migration access.
        *Implication:* Provides a middle path that rewards core community while not excluding legitimate holders, but adds complexity to communication and implementation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: User Experience Enhancement

**Summary of Topic:** There are significant opportunities to enhance user engagement through voice and avatar integrations for the Eliza cloud platform, which could dramatically improve usability and appeal for auto.fun's agent showcase strategy.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we prioritize the integration of voice generation (vapi.ai) and avatar technology (xpressioncamera.com) for a more interactive agent experience?

  **Context:**
  - `Potential integrations discussed for voice generation (vapi.ai) and avatar generation (xpressioncamera.com) (Discord)`
  - `Suggestion to create a talking avatar interface for Eliza cloud that could interact with users, guide them through agent creation, and handle payment processing (Discord - DorianD)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, prioritize immediate integration as a flagship feature for auto.fun to differentiate from competitors and increase user engagement.
        *Implication:* Could significantly enhance user appeal but requires substantial engineering resources potentially diverted from elizaOS v2 stability work.
    b) Develop a limited prototype focusing only on the onboarding experience to test user response before full-scale implementation.
        *Implication:* Balances innovation with resource conservation while gathering valuable user feedback to inform future development.
    c) Defer integration until after elizaOS v2 is stable and engage the community to develop these features as third-party plugins.
        *Implication:* Maintains focus on core stability goals but risks missing a timely opportunity to enhance user experience and differentiation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How could implementing a talking avatar interface impact our goals for 24/7 agent activity showcase and new user acquisition?

  **Context:**
  - `Suggestion to create a talking avatar interface for Eliza cloud that could interact with users, guide them through agent creation, and handle payment processing (Discord - DorianD)`
  - `Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2. (Monthly Goal)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Talking avatars could serve as compelling demonstrations of agent capabilities, driving viral sharing and significantly boosting new user acquisition.
        *Implication:* Positions avatars as marketing tools, potentially accelerating growth but requiring content and performance optimization for social sharing.
    b) The avatar interface should focus on retention by providing guided onboarding and persistent assistance rather than initial attraction.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes depth of engagement over breadth, potentially improving conversion rates but with less immediate impact on new user numbers.
    c) Implement avatars specifically for streaming and shitposting scenarios, directly serving our 24/7 showcase strategy with visually engaging content.
        *Implication:* Aligns closely with current goals but narrows the implementation scope, potentially missing broader application opportunities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Technical Architecture & Documentation

**Summary of Topic:** Several critical technical initiatives are underway, including cloud platform development, plugin architecture refinement, and documentation improvements, all of which impact the stability and accessibility of elizaOS v2.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the documentation issue where plugin links lead to 404 errors?

  **Context:**
  - `Issue #6061 titled '[DOCS] Every plugin link in docs leads to a 404' by @douglasg14b is OPEN with 2 comments, reporting documentation link problems on October 13, 2025. (GitHub)`
  - `Documentation issues reported with plugin links leading to 404 errors (Discord)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediately fix broken links as a high-priority task, as documentation issues directly impact new developer onboarding and retention.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes user experience and developer satisfaction but may delay other technical work in the short term.

        *Implication:* Addresses the root cause rather than symptoms, but requires more significant upfront investment in tooling and processes.
    c) Deploy a temporary redirect system while rebuilding the documentation structure to better align with the evolving plugin architecture.
        *Implication:* Balances immediate user needs with long-term architectural improvements but introduces technical complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we adopt the newly proposed 'plugin-elizacloud' naming convention as part of a broader standardization effort?

  **Context:**
  - `Team decided on 'plugin-elizacloud' naming convention instead of 'plugin-services' for better clarity (Discord)`
  - `Q: How about plugin-elizacloud instead of plugin-services? (asked by Odilitime) A: elizacloud ok (answered by sayonara)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, formalize the 'plugin-elizacloud' convention and extend similar descriptive naming to all plugins to improve system clarity.
        *Implication:* Creates stronger consistency and discoverability but requires significant refactoring of existing code and documentation.
    b) Apply the new convention only to new plugins while maintaining legacy names for existing ones to minimize disruption.

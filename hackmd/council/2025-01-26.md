# Council Briefing: 2025-01-26

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- A surge of ecosystem velocity (new plugins and fixes) continues, but user-facing reliability—especially social clients (X/Discord/Telegram) and knowledge retrieval—remains the critical trust bottleneck that must be stabilized before expansion narratives can safely lead.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Reliability of Social Clients (X/Discord/Telegram) as Trust Surface

**Summary of Topic:** Discord and GitHub logs show recurring failures that directly erode developer trust: X login/2FA fragility, infinite loops in Discord, and message ID collisions in Telegram. These are high-impact operational defects because they manifest in public channels and degrade flagship-agent stability.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we temporarily narrow official support to a hardened subset of clients (e.g., Discord + Telegram) until X authentication and posting reliability reaches a defined SLA?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-01-25, 💻-coders): "Fix Twitter client to handle 2FA and suspicious login detection" (multiple users).`
  - `GitHub Issues (2025-01-25/26): "Infinite typing loop in Discord integration" (#2792) and "Message ID collision issue in the Telegram client" (#2796).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—formally tier support: stabilize core clients first; mark X as experimental with clear guardrails.
        *Implication:* Reduces public failures and support load, but may slow growth in social distribution where X is a key channel.
    b) No—keep all clients first-class; allocate a focused strike team to eliminate X/Discord/Telegram regressions in parallel.
        *Implication:* Preserves the multi-platform promise, but risks continued reliability drag and fragmented engineering attention.
    c) Hybrid—keep X enabled only via safer modes (dry-run/approval workflow/rate limits) until auth and formatting issues are resolved.
        *Implication:* Maintains presence while constraining blast radius; introduces complexity in configuration and documentation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s preferred safety doctrine for autonomous posting behaviors (reply loops, JSON leakage, "thinking" monologues) across social surfaces?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-01-25, 💻-coders): "Implement solution for agents stuck in endless reply loops on Twitter" ([elizaos] <imtnf>).`
  - `GitHub PRs: "fix: Unexpected JSON Metadata in Twitter Bot Replies" (#2712) and "feat: Add approval mechanism for Twitter posts via Discord bot" (#1876).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Safety-first default: require explicit opt-in for autonomous posting; ship conservative templates and strict output parsing.
        *Implication:* Maximizes trust-through-shipping, but may reduce perceived agent autonomy out of the box.
    b) Autonomy-first default: keep agents posting; mitigate via rate limits, loop detectors, and better output sanitization.
        *Implication:* Accelerates experimentation and attention, but increases risk of public incidents and account bans.
    c) Two-mode operating model: 'Operator Mode' (approval gates) vs 'Autopilot Mode' (guardrailed automation) with clear UI/CLI selection.
        *Implication:* Aligns to developer-first UX, but requires product work (config surfaces, docs, and testing) to avoid confusion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Which reliability investments should be treated as release-blockers for the next stable milestone: X auth/2FA, Discord loop prevention, or Telegram message identity correctness?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub Daily (2025-01-26): new issues include headless web interface connectivity (#2795) and Discord infinite typing loop (#2792).`
  - `GitHub PR: "fix: Message id collision in Telegram Client" (#3053) references issue #2796.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Block on Discord + Telegram first; X is volatile and should be deprioritized until we can harden auth flows.
        *Implication:* Improves core chat reliability quickly, but delays a major distribution channel and some flagship use cases.
    b) Block on X auth/formatting first because public failures on X cause the highest reputational damage.
        *Implication:* Protects the brand surface, but may leave core chat clients with unresolved loops and collisions.
    c) Block on all three with a short, time-boxed stabilization sprint and a single cross-client reliability spec.
        *Implication:* Creates a unified quality bar, but risks schedule slip if scope is not tightly controlled.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Model & Knowledge Stack Readiness (DeepSeek + Embeddings + RAG)

**Summary of Topic:** DeepSeek R1 interest is surging and appears easy to integrate via OpenRouter, but the knowledge pipeline shows signs of fragility (embedding dimension mismatches and reports of broken RAG lookup). Given the North Star, model/provider expansion must not outrun correctness of memory and retrieval, which is foundational to persistent agents.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we declare a "reference configuration" (Node version, embedding model, DB backend) and optimize docs/tests around it to reduce installation entropy?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-01-24): "Node v23.3.0 being recommended" and vector dimension mismatch (384 vs 1536) fixed by setting USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE (boja).`
  - `Discord (2025-01-23/24): repeated reports of "Vector dimension mismatch" and multiple users needing setup guidance.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—publish one blessed path (e.g., Node 23.3.0 + OpenAI embeddings + Postgres/Supabase) and treat deviations as advanced.
        *Implication:* Improves developer-first onboarding and reduces support burden, but may frustrate power users seeking flexible stacks.
    b) No—keep the matrix broad; invest in tooling that auto-detects and fixes common misconfigs at runtime.
        *Implication:* Preserves composability, but increases engineering complexity and slows stabilization.
    c) Partial—declare two tracks: Local-first (SQLite + local embeddings) and Cloud-first (Postgres/Supabase + hosted embeddings), both fully documented.
        *Implication:* Balances flexibility and clarity; demands disciplined documentation and CI coverage for both tracks.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should DeepSeek R1 be positioned in the platform narrative: default low-cost reasoning option, experimental provider, or a specialized tool-calling model?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-01-25, 💻-coders): "DeepSeek R1... cheaper than OpenAI with solid reasoning capabilities" (ITZMIZZLE).`
  - `Discord (2025-01-24): "Technically since OpenRouter supports it, we can change to DeepSeek in 1 line of code" (jin).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make it a first-class default for cost-effective reasoning workloads where tool calling is strong.
        *Implication:* Could accelerate adoption and attention, but increases risk if edge cases (JSON formatting, reliability) are not fully tested.
    b) Mark as experimental and keep OpenAI/Anthropic as defaults until we validate reliability across key workflows.
        *Implication:* Aligns with execution excellence, but may miss a market window where DeepSeek interest is peaking.
    c) Position as a specialized reasoning module selectable per task (planner/reasoner) rather than a universal default.
        *Implication:* Improves agent architecture clarity, but requires more configuration surface and documentation sophistication.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is the Council’s priority: fixing RAG lookup correctness immediately, or shipping new ingestion features (PDFs, post-deploy knowledge augmentation) while retrieval remains uncertain?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-01-25, 💻-coders): "Fix RAG lookup from knowledge which appears to be broken" (kAI wilder) — unanswered.`
  - `Discord (2025-01-25, discussion): requests to "augment a character's knowledge once they are live" (veTechno).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Correctness first: treat RAG retrieval reliability as a release-blocker before adding new ingestion features.
        *Implication:* Strengthens trust through shipping; slows the feature roadmap but prevents compounding user confusion.
    b) Parallelize: allocate separate squads; ship ingestion improvements while a core team hardens retrieval.
        *Implication:* Maintains momentum, but risks fractured user experience if new features land on unstable foundations.
    c) Feature-first: ship post-deploy knowledge augmentation now and accept degraded retrieval as a known limitation.
        *Implication:* Drives experimentation, but directly violates execution excellence and may damage developer trust.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Treasury Strategy & Token Value Accrual (One-Sided LPs + Launchpad)

**Summary of Topic:** A major tokenomics direction emerged: deploying $15–30M in treasury assets into one-sided liquidity pools paired with AI16Z to create buy pressure and liquidity for partner tokens, complemented by an "attention/code/capital" value framework and an imminent no-code launchpad. This is high-leverage but high-trust: it must be executed transparently and safely to align with execution excellence.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the DAO ship the one-sided LP strategy incrementally (pilot pool + public metrics) or execute at scale immediately to maximize market impact?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-01-25, associates/partners): Shaw: "use its treasury assets (valued at $15-30M) to create one-sided liquidity pools paired with AI16Z tokens".`
  - `Discord (2025-01-25, partners): "It creates additional volume and liquidity fees for the DAO" (shaw and jin).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Pilot-first: launch a small pool with strict risk parameters and a public dashboard before scaling.
        *Implication:* Builds community confidence through measurable shipping; may underwhelm short-term market expectations.
    b) Scale-first: deploy the full strategy quickly to establish dominance and narrative momentum.
        *Implication:* Maximizes immediate impact, but increases downside if parameters, security, or execution details are flawed.
    c) Staged rollout: deploy multiple medium pilots across partner categories with predefined graduation criteria.
        *Implication:* Balances learning and impact; requires governance discipline and clear operational playbooks.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What should be the Council’s canonical value story for the token: treasury yield engine, ecosystem access token (launchpad/marketplace), or governance coordination layer?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-01-25, tokenomics): Jin and timshel: "attention/code/capital" pillars for value growth.`
  - `Discord (2025-01-25, partners): Shaw: launchpad is "imminent" and "no-code".`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Treasury yield engine first (LP fees + partner liquidity services), with other utilities as secondary.
        *Implication:* Creates a clear economic hook, but can drift toward purely financial framing over developer utility.
    b) Ecosystem access token first (launchpad/marketplace/Cloud), linking usage directly to token demand.
        *Implication:* Aligns to developer-first growth loops, but requires product readiness to avoid hollow utility claims.
    c) Governance coordination first, evolving toward autonomous DAO operations and TrustDB-style verification markets.
        *Implication:* Matches the long-term mission, but risks being too abstract without near-term, tangible benefits.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we operationalize transparency for treasury deployments to prevent trust erosion during execution (especially amid price volatility concerns)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-01-24/25): partners express concerns about price declines and ask for clearer tokenomics documentation and timelines.`
  - `Discord (2025-01-25, action items): Shaw: "Break up DAO tokenomics explanations into separate parts" and "Integrate native LP tracking for treasury tokens".`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Real-time treasury dashboard (LP positions, APR, exposure) + weekly execution reports as a required standard.
        *Implication:* Strengthens legitimacy and reduces rumor cycles; increases operational overhead and demands accurate data plumbing.
    b) Periodic summaries only (monthly/quarterly) to avoid overreactive governance and noise.
        *Implication:* Reduces churn but may be perceived as opacity, undermining trust-through-shipping.
    c) Third-party attestations (on-chain proofs/TEE-style reporting) plus a minimal dashboard for key metrics.
        *Implication:* Signals seriousness and security posture, but requires integration effort and partner coordination.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

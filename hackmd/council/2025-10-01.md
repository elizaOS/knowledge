## Daily Focus

- Strategic preparations for the AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration are creating community tension while technical teams make significant progress on integration capabilities and UI enhancements.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The imminent migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens scheduled for October 6th is causing community uncertainty due to limited communication about the process, especially regarding exchange support and technical details.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance community transparency against strategic flexibility in the final days before the token migration?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members expressed concerns about the lack of clear information regarding the token migration process`
  - `Kenk: Information about the migration process will be provided closer to the launch of the portal.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Release a comprehensive migration guide immediately with exact technical steps for all holder scenarios.
        *Implication:* Maximizes community preparation but reduces our ability to adapt to last-minute technical or exchange partner changes.
    b) Schedule an emergency AMA focused exclusively on migration details, with Shaw addressing specific concerns.
        *Implication:* Provides a middle path that acknowledges concerns while maintaining some flexibility in implementation details.
    c) Maintain the current approach of releasing details closer to launch to ensure accuracy and finalized exchange partnerships.
        *Implication:* Preserves maximum operational flexibility but risks continued community anxiety and potential token selling pressure.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should exchange partnerships for migration be prioritized over self-custody solutions?

  **Context:**
  - `Users specifically asked about exchange support (gate.io) for the migration process`
  - `Kenk: More details will be released as we get closer to the migration.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize exchange partnerships to simplify the process for mainstream holders.
        *Implication:* Favors convenience and adoption but increases centralization and dependence on third parties.
    b) Develop a robust self-custody migration portal while pursuing exchange partnerships in parallel.
        *Implication:* Balances sovereignty principles with practical user needs but increases development complexity.
    c) Focus exclusively on self-custody migration to align with decentralization values.
        *Implication:* Reinforces core project values but may alienate less technical token holders.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should the token migration narrative be positioned in relation to elizaOS v2 and auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Moderators confirmed that detailed migration information will be provided closer to the launch of the portal`
  - `Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position the migration as primarily technical maintenance separate from product roadmap.
        *Implication:* Minimizes disruption but misses opportunity to leverage migration for renewed market attention.
    b) Frame the migration as a catalyst for elizaOS v2 and the next phase of auto.fun adoption.
        *Implication:* Creates positive narrative momentum but risks disappointment if v2 features aren't immediately available post-migration.
    c) Use the migration as an opportunity to reset tokenomics with specific utility enhancements for auto.fun.
        *Implication:* Directly addresses token utility questions but may create expectations for immediate revenue impacts.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Strategic Partnership Expansion

**Summary of Topic:** The IoTeX partnership for Real-World AI Foundry represents a significant expansion into physical data integration for AI agents, while other integrations like Claude Agent SDK and Cursor AI show growing ecosystem capabilities.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance physical-world AI agent development versus purely digital use cases?

  **Context:**
  - `IoTeX Partnership: ElizaOS is involved with IoTeX's newly announced "Real-World AI Foundry" initiative`
  - `Dean: Yes, this is a furthering of the partnership. IoTex provides the data backbone and ElizaOS provides the toolbox.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize physical-world AI as a key differentiator against purely digital frameworks.
        *Implication:* Opens new market opportunities but increases complexity and hardware dependencies.
    b) Maintain equal focus on both physical and digital domains to serve diverse developer needs.
        *Implication:* Provides balanced growth but may dilute resources across too many fronts.
    c) Keep physical-world AI as an experimental initiative while focusing core resources on digital agent capabilities.
        *Implication:* Maintains focus on core strengths but may miss emerging opportunities in IoT and physical systems.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we integrate Claude Agent SDK as a first-class provider alongside our existing model integrations?

  **Context:**
  - `Claude Agent SDK: Team discussing testing and potentially adding as a dependency`
  - `Technical: Test Claude Agent SDK and discuss adding as a dependency (yung_algorithm)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Fully integrate Claude Agent SDK as a primary provider with dedicated documentation and examples.
        *Implication:* Expands model diversity but creates another dependency on a commercial provider.
    b) Add Claude support as an optional integration with minimal core changes.
        *Implication:* Balances ecosystem growth with architectural independence.
    c) Defer Claude integration in favor of focusing on open-source model support.
        *Implication:* Aligns with decentralization values but limits access to state-of-the-art commercial models.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

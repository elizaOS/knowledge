# Council Briefing: 2025-04-08

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- A high-velocity patch cycle shipped meaningful V2 stability improvements (reply behavior, parsing, plugin/provider fixes), but recurring Twitter/X failures and migration ambiguity remain the primary trust risks for builders.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 Reliability & Social Surface Integrity (Twitter/X)

**Summary of Topic:** Core interaction pathways are improving via targeted fixes (tweet reply failures, prompt/provider duplication), yet field reports still indicate unreliable posting, crash-on-mention behavior, and character-direction drift—threatening flagship agent stability and public trust.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the Council impose a temporary “Reliability Lock” on V2 (no new outward-facing features) until Twitter/X posting + replies meet a minimum success SLA?

  **Context:**
  - `Dev Discord (2025-04-06/07): "Multiple users reported problems with Twitter agents not tweeting despite proper setup"; "Agents crash when mentioned"; "post repetitive tweets that don't align with character directions."`
  - `Daily Update (2025-04-08): "Resolved an issue where replies to tweets failed during interactions (PR #4231)."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—freeze V2 feature expansion until Twitter/X workflows meet defined reliability thresholds.
        *Implication:* Maximizes execution excellence and reduces reputational risk, but slows ecosystem novelty and partner demos.
    b) Partial—freeze only social clients (Twitter/X) while allowing non-social core improvements to proceed.
        *Implication:* Contains the most visible failure domain while maintaining momentum on foundational architecture.
    c) No—continue parallel feature shipping and rely on rapid hotfixes driven by community reports.
        *Implication:* Maintains speed, but risks compounding trust erosion if public-facing agents remain unreliable.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is our canonical Twitter/X capability target for “V2 ready”: plugin-only posting, full client parity, or a unified surface with workflows and character compliance guarantees?

  **Context:**
  - `elizaOS Discord (2025-04-05): "No, only the plugin is working currently. (jin and SpartanDev)"`
  - `GitHub Issue (2025-04-08): "Provider Data Not Used When Posting to Twitter" (#4224).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Plugin-only as the stable baseline; defer full client parity until after V2 core hardens.
        *Implication:* Reduces blast radius and narrows QA surface, but limits the “seamless UX” story.
    b) Full client parity is the definition of readiness; prioritize end-to-end tweeting/replies/mentions now.
        *Implication:* Aligns with flagship-agent stability and public demos, but increases coordination and testing load.
    c) Unify plugin+client behind a workflow layer with explicit guarantees (rate limits, templates, character adherence).
        *Implication:* Creates a durable architecture for multi-platform presence, at the cost of short-term refactor time.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we treat “character-direction drift” (agents tweeting repetitive/off-character content): as a model/prompt issue, a provider plumbing issue, or an evaluation/guardrails gap?

  **Context:**
  - `Dev Discord (2025-04-07): "agents in V2 beta are not following character directions for tweets" (rchak007).`
  - `Daily Update (2025-04-08): "Fixed duplicate Provider Section appearing in prompts (PR #4228)."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Primarily provider plumbing/prompt assembly—fix provider data flow, prompt composition, and template variables first.
        *Implication:* Likely fastest path to measurable improvement if drift is caused by missing context or duplicated sections.
    b) Primarily evaluation/guardrails—ship tweet-specific evaluators and regression tests for character adherence.
        *Implication:* Builds long-term reliability and prevents relapses, but requires investment in test harnesses and metrics.
    c) Primarily model selection/config—standardize recommended models/settings for social output (and document them).
        *Implication:* Improves consistency for builders, but risks masking underlying framework issues if the root cause is systemic.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Developer Experience: Migration Clarity, Setup Friction, and API Contracts

**Summary of Topic:** High contribution velocity is closing many papercuts (CLI parity, environment loading, type errors), yet builders remain confused about v1→v2 migration, required tokens/credentials, and API endpoint correctness—directly impacting developer trust.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s preferred migration doctrine: “hard cutover with strict versioning,” “dual-track support with compatibility shims,” or “staged migration by plugin tiers”?

  **Context:**
  - `elizaOS Discord (2025-04-07): "transition period between ElizaOS v1 and v2, with incomplete plugin migration causing confusion" (summary).`
  - `elizaOS Discord (2025-04-06): "users are asking about migration paths to avoid duplicate work."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Hard cutover—announce a cutoff date and focus all effort on V2, even if some plugins lag.
        *Implication:* Simplifies messaging and reduces split attention, but risks alienating builders dependent on v1 plugins.
    b) Dual-track—maintain v1 stability while V2 matures, with explicit “recommended for production” flags.
        *Implication:* Preserves trust and reduces churn, but increases maintenance overhead and slows V2 stabilization.
    c) Staged migration—define plugin tiers (critical/social/storage/etc.) and migrate them in prioritized waves with checklists.
        *Implication:* Balances execution excellence with transparency; creates predictable milestones for builders and partners.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we formalize an “API Contract & Docs Gate” where any documented endpoint (e.g., agent messaging) must have an automated integration test before publication?

  **Context:**
  - `elizaOS Discord (2025-04-07): "Fix API endpoint /api/agents/:agentId/message returning 404" (Newt).`
  - `Daily Update (2025-04-08): "Updated CLI README documentation (PR #4208)" and continued CLI parity work.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—docs-only claims must be backed by tests; failing tests block release.
        *Implication:* Strongly reinforces developer trust through shipping discipline, but can slow documentation iteration.
    b) Soft gate—allow docs publication but clearly tag endpoints as “experimental” until tests land.
        *Implication:* Maintains velocity while reducing confusion, though it relies on consistent labeling discipline.
    c) No—prioritize shipping and community feedback; treat docs as living notes rather than contracts.
        *Implication:* Increases short-term speed, but compounds support load and undermines the “reliable framework” North Star.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How aggressively should we eliminate setup friction around credentials (GitHub tokens, Twitter account requirements) to match “Developer First” expectations?

  **Context:**
  - `Dev Discord (2025-04-07): "Only to publish plugins and download plugins from GitHub." (sayonara on GitHub token requirement).`
  - `Dev Discord (2025-04-06): "Clarify X/Twitter account requirements for agent functionality" (Pr⭕f. J).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make all non-essential tokens optional by default, with clear prompts only when a feature requires them.
        *Implication:* Reduces onboarding friction and confusion, strengthening DX and conversion from curious to committed builders.
    b) Keep current behavior but dramatically improve the onboarding wizard and error messages to explain why tokens are requested.
        *Implication:* Less engineering risk while improving perceived polish, though some friction remains inherent.
    c) Enforce stricter credential requirements up front to prevent partial setups that later fail in production.
        *Implication:* Improves predictability for serious deployments, but increases drop-off for experimentation and newcomers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Taming Information: Ship Trust via Automated Updates and Builder Rituals

**Summary of Topic:** Jin’s GitHub→video pipeline and weekly builder demos indicate a scalable path to continuous visibility; the strategic opportunity is to convert raw development throughput into steady, digestible “trust emissions” (release notes, clips, dashboards) aligned to the Execution Excellence directive.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which “trust emission” should become the Council-mandated default: daily text changelog, weekly video digest, or an agent-readable RSS/JSON firehose powering in-product updates?

  **Context:**
  - `elizaOS Discord (2025-04-07): "jin built a pipeline process to transform GitHub data into video content using Remotion framework."`
  - `elizaOS Discord (2025-04-06): Community desire for "more regular updates rather than infrequent large releases."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Daily text changelog (Discord + docs) with consistent structure and links to PRs/issues.
        *Implication:* Fastest to operationalize and lowest cost, optimizing for developer clarity and searchability.
    b) Weekly video digest generated from GitHub activity (Remotion pipeline), distributed across social channels.
        *Implication:* Maximizes public narrative and partner confidence, but depends on production polish and editorial discipline.
    c) Agent-readable firehose (JSON/RSS) as the source of truth, with text/video as downstream renderings.
        *Implication:* Best aligns with Taming Information and autonomous agents; enables dashboards and in-product notifications.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should Builder Demos evolve into a formal “Certification Rite” for flagship readiness (Eli5/Otaku/Spartan) and Cloud launch eligibility?

  **Context:**
  - `Dev Discord (2025-04-07): "weekly community demo sessions at 3pm UTC" (Kenk).`
  - `elizaOS Discord (2025-04-07): Community demo session showcased multiple teams (xNomad, Growth Terminal, Kudo Network, Crucible Network).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—tie demos to an explicit readiness checklist (reliability, docs, reproducible deploy) and publish outcomes.
        *Implication:* Creates a public quality bar and reinforces execution excellence, but may slow announcements.
    b) Semi-formal—keep demos open, but add optional “review lanes” for teams seeking official endorsement.
        *Implication:* Preserves community energy while offering a structured path to credibility for serious builders.
    c) No—keep demos purely exploratory to maximize creativity and avoid governance overhead.
        *Implication:* Maintains openness, but misses a chance to systematically convert demos into trust and adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Which content-production strategy best supports long-term ecosystem coherence: Unity-based video production (higher control) or pure-AI (lower effort) given limited core bandwidth?

  **Context:**
  - `elizaOS Discord (2025-04-07): "Unity approach has more variety... infinitely tweakable" vs "AI approach requires less energy to tweak" (Odilitime, jin).`
  - `elizaOS Discord (2025-04-07): Hedra noted as promising for character animation, with multi-actor/camera control pending (jin).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Unity-based as the primary pipeline; accept higher effort to achieve differentiated, consistent quality.
        *Implication:* Positions ElizaOS as premium and intentional, but risks throughput bottlenecks without dedicated creators.
    b) Pure-AI as the primary pipeline; optimize for frequency and iteration speed over perfect control.
        *Implication:* Increases cadence and experimentation, but may degrade brand consistency if outputs vary in quality.
    c) Hybrid—Unity for flagship releases and major launches; pure-AI for daily/weekly operational updates.
        *Implication:* Balances reliability of narrative with sustainable cadence, aligning “trust through shipping” with bandwidth reality.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

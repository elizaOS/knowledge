# Council Briefing: 2025-12-22

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Council attention converges on ElizaOS Cloud MVP launch readiness (streaming + release choreography) while community trust is strained by migration confusion, liquidity gaps, and escalating scam pressure.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Cloud MVP Launch Readiness (Streaming + Release Choreography)

**Summary of Topic:** Cloud MVP is slated to ship imminently, with streaming support and a strict merge/release order spanning monorepo, cloud plugin, and cloud-v2; execution quality here directly determines developer trust in the platform layer.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we ship Cloud MVP on schedule with scoped streaming, or delay to harden reliability and reduce first-impression risk?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-20 — Borko: "Team preparing to ship their Cloud MVP product on Monday"`
  - `Discord 2025-12-19 — Stan ⚡: "Need to release monorepo, review/merge elizacloud-plugin, and use latest core version into cloud-v2, in that order."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship on schedule with a narrow, well-tested streaming slice and explicit MVP guardrails.
        *Implication:* Maximizes momentum while aligning with execution excellence via disciplined scope control.
    b) Delay 3–7 days to complete soak testing, tighten docs, and validate the full release chain end-to-end.
        *Implication:* Reduces launch risk at the cost of short-term momentum; may increase long-term trust if communicated well.
    c) Ship a non-streaming MVP now; release streaming as a fast-follow once the core deployment path is stable.
        *Implication:* Protects baseline reliability but risks disappointing users expecting real-time interaction as a headline capability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council-approved "definition of done" for the Cloud MVP that preserves Execution Excellence (reliability/UX) over feature breadth?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-20 — cjft: "Version 1.7.0 Release: New version released with streaming functionality and npm fixes"`
  - `GitHub month summary (Dec) — "ElizaOS Cloud as the default provider in the CLI" (PR #6208) indicates onboarding/developer flow is part of the product promise.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Operational DoD: deploy success rate targets, error budgets, and rollback procedures before adding any new Cloud features.
        *Implication:* Institutionalizes reliability as the primary product feature, matching the North Star.
    b) Developer DoD: frictionless CLI create→login→deploy flow with minimal docs, prioritizing DX even if ops metrics are immature.
        *Implication:* Accelerates adoption but risks support burden and reputation damage if runtime stability lags.
    c) Feature DoD: streaming + storage + cross-chain primitives minimally integrated, accepting higher early defects to capture narrative leadership.
        *Implication:* Optimizes for market signaling; may contradict the current directive of execution excellence.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How do we de-risk the multi-repo release chain (monorepo → elizacloud-plugin → cloud-v2) to prevent last-minute breaks and misaligned versions?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-19 — Stan ⚡: "release monorepo first, then review/merge elizacloud-plugin, finally update core version in cloud-v2"`
  - `Discord 2025-12-19 — cjft: "NPM changed their tokens and deleted classic tokens" (release pipeline fragility)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Codify a release train with automated compatibility checks and version gating across repos (block merges on mismatch).
        *Implication:* Reduces coordination failure modes and strengthens "trust through shipping" via repeatable process.
    b) Centralize Cloud components into a single orchestrated repo for launches; decentralize again after MVP stabilizes.
        *Implication:* Improves short-term launch control but temporarily reduces composability and parallelism.
    c) Keep the current manual order but add a human release captain + checklist and accept occasional breakage as normal.
        *Implication:* Low overhead, but risks recurring reliability incidents that erode developer confidence.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Token Migration Integrity, Liquidity Asymmetry, and Utility Signaling

**Summary of Topic:** Migration confusion persists (snapshot eligibility, deadline, deprecated token pumping), compounded by chain liquidity differences; the Council must align messaging, support pathways, and near-term utility signals to preserve ecosystem legitimacy through the migration window.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council's unified public stance on ai16z trading/pumping during migration, and how aggressively do we counter it without amplifying it?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-19 — Serikiki: "Should I buy ai16z?" → "No."`
  - `Discord 2025-12-19 — Serikiki: "ai16z remains tradable on DEXs so people may pump it"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Hard line: repeated messaging that ai16z has no utility; discourage trading and pin official migration path everywhere.
        *Implication:* Reduces confusion but may provoke speculators; strengthens the canonical narrative.
    b) Neutral stance: state facts (no utility, migration deadline) and avoid discussing price to prevent signal boosting.
        *Implication:* Limits amplification risk but may be perceived as evasive by frustrated holders.
    c) Incentive stance: focus communications on elizaOS utility/buybacks/benefits, letting ai16z fade without direct confrontation.
        *Implication:* Shifts attention to the future but requires credible near-term utility delivery to work.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we resolve snapshot-eligibility edge cases (e.g., non-supported wallets) to maximize migration success rate while minimizing manual intervention and fraud risk?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-20 — Hexx: "only tokens bought before the snapshot date can be migrated" (eligibility confusion persists)`
  - `GitHub top issue — elizaos/eliza #6211: Tangem wallet connection not supported; user cites Discord impersonators and requests verifiable guidance.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Strict automation only: no manual exceptions; publish a canonical eligibility verifier and wallet support list.
        *Implication:* Minimizes fraud risk and support load but may strand legitimate users and harm trust.
    b) Controlled manual remediation: a signed support workflow (GitHub-only intake, proofs, limited whitelist updates).
        *Implication:* Maximizes legitimate migrations but requires high-integrity ops and clear anti-scam procedures.
    c) Expand wallet compatibility quickly (WalletConnect/Tangem path) even if it delays other work.
        *Implication:* Improves fairness and success rate but competes directly with Cloud launch bandwidth.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is our official mitigation for cross-chain liquidity/price dislocations during migration to reduce user harm and reputational damage?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-20 — User: "40% price difference when selling on Solana"; Omid Sa: "bridge to BSC chain where liquidity is near 1M."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish an official liquidity-and-bridging advisory with endorsed routes, warnings, and canonical contract addresses per chain.
        *Implication:* Reduces confusion and scams, but increases responsibility for keeping guidance current.
    b) Deploy/seed targeted liquidity on the affected chain(s) to compress spreads during migration.
        *Implication:* Directly improves UX and fairness but uses treasury resources and introduces market-making risk.
    c) Do nothing beyond disclaimers; treat liquidity as a market outcome and prioritize product delivery.
        *Implication:* Preserves focus, but ongoing user losses may spill into long-term trust erosion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Security Posture: Scam Pressure vs. Trust Through Shipping

**Summary of Topic:** Discord scam attempts are actively targeting users amid migration confusion; strengthening official communication authenticity and support routing is now a critical reliability feature, not a community nicety.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council's immediate containment plan to reduce successful scams during the migration window?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-20 — "Multiple warnings about scammers targeting community members with suspicious links"`
  - `Discord 2025-12-20 — Hexx prevented a user from clicking a malicious link.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Escalate to a formal Security Protocol: locked channels for migration, verified-only support, and auto-moderation link quarantines.
        *Implication:* Substantially reduces attack surface, but increases friction and moderation workload.
    b) Maintain current moderation, but add stronger pinned guidance and periodic anti-scam broadcasts from verified team accounts.
        *Implication:* Low disruption, moderate effectiveness; still leaves gaps during off-hours.
    c) Move all migration support off Discord temporarily (GitHub-only + official portal) and treat Discord as read-only announcements.
        *Implication:* Max security, but may alienate community members who rely on Discord for real-time help.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we establish a single verifiable source of truth for contracts, migration steps, and deadlines to minimize ambiguity exploited by impersonators?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-20 — Alexei provided contract addresses for multiple chains.`
  - `Discord 2025-12-19 — Kenk: "February 4, 2026 is the confirmed deadline for token migration"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create an immutable, signed "Canonical Registry" page (docs + onchain checksum) listing contracts, deadlines, and links.
        *Implication:* Maximizes verifiability and aligns with open, composable infrastructure values.
    b) Pin and lock a single Discord announcement + mirror on the website; update as needed with staff-only edits.
        *Implication:* Fast to deploy, but less tamper-evident and still reliant on platform trust.
    c) Rely on community volunteers to disseminate correct links and addresses, supported by periodic team confirmations.
        *Implication:* Scales socially, but creates inconsistent messaging and higher scam success probability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What level of operational transparency should we adopt regarding security incidents without escalating fear or providing attackers a playbook?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issue #6211 — user claims "Discord support compromised — multiple impersonators" and requests verifiable guidance via GitHub.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish weekly security bulletins (incident counts, mitigations, no tactical details) and a standing anti-scam checklist.
        *Implication:* Builds trust through consistent disclosure while limiting actionable intelligence for attackers.
    b) Only communicate confirmed major incidents; otherwise keep messaging minimal to avoid panic.
        *Implication:* Reduces noise, but may be perceived as silence during an active threat environment.
    c) Full transparency with detailed postmortems for every incident and attempted exploit.
        *Implication:* Maximizes openness but risks arming attackers and overwhelming the Council’s bandwidth.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

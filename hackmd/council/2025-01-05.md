# Council Briefing: 2025-01-05

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Primary momentum came from stabilizing developer onboarding via critical install/build fixes (notably plugin-node postinstall), while reliability risks surfaced around social-client behavior and emerging security findings that could undermine developer trust if not triaged decisively.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Framework Reliability: Install/Build Stability and Release Discipline

**Summary of Topic:** The postinstall failure in plugin-node was fixed (PR #1872), but repeated reports of build fragility (Node version sensitivity, lockfile drift, type mismatches) indicate the need for tighter release gating to uphold the project’s "Execution Excellence" principle.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we introduce a stricter release gate (CI + installation smoke tests across supported OS/Node versions) before the next mainline release to reduce onboarding breakage?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-01-04, 💻-coders): "plugin-node package's postinstall script trying to access compiled files before they exist" (raised by SMA)`
  - `GitHub: "fix: Fix postinstall script" PR #1872`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—require multi-OS install + minimal-run smoke tests as a hard gate for merges to main.
        *Implication:* Improves trust and reduces support burden, but may slow merge velocity.
    b) Partially—gate only release branches/tags; keep main fast but accept occasional breakage.
        *Implication:* Balances velocity and stability, but day-to-day contributors may still hit broken main.
    c) No—prioritize rapid iteration; rely on community to report regressions post-merge.
        *Implication:* Maximizes throughput but risks eroding developer confidence and cloud adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should the Council standardize and publish an “official supported toolchain” (Node/pnpm versions, Docker baseline) to reduce configuration entropy for builders?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-01-03): "Node.js version 23.3.0 is recommended over newer versions for compatibility."`
  - `GitHub updates: repeated lockfile and CI doc breakage fixes (e.g., PR #1798 "out-of-sync frozen PNPM file")`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—publish a pinned toolchain (Node LTS + a specific pnpm) and enforce via CI checks.
        *Implication:* Reduces variance and support load; may frustrate users on newer runtimes.
    b) Publish guidance only (recommended versions) but do not enforce in CI.
        *Implication:* Improves clarity while preserving flexibility, but won’t fully stop breakages.
    c) Avoid pinning—invest in broader compatibility instead of narrowing supported versions.
        *Implication:* More inclusive long-term, but higher engineering cost and slower stabilization.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Given new security concerns (secret management), do we institute a security triage lane with mandatory remediation SLAs for high-severity issues before feature expansion?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub Daily Update (2025-01-05): "security analysis report revealing critical issues with secret management in the codebase (#1862)."`
  - `GitHub Issues: #1862 "security issues and vulnerabilities"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—create a security response lane with explicit SLAs and a freeze on related feature merges.
        *Implication:* Protects trust and cloud readiness; temporarily reduces feature throughput.
    b) Address security opportunistically alongside ongoing work, prioritizing only exploited issues.
        *Implication:* Maintains velocity but risks compounding tech debt in the trust layer.
    c) Defer until after tokenomics/cloud milestones; treat as backlog unless externally escalated.
        *Implication:* Short-term focus improves shipping pace but increases reputational and operational risk.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Social Client Trust: Twitter Reliability, Compliance, and Behavior Control

**Summary of Topic:** Twitter integration remains a top friction point (duplicate replies, unwanted actions, auth/rate limits), with added risk from account compliance constraints—these issues directly impact perceived reliability of flagship agents and builder success.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should Twitter client behavior defaults be made conservative-by-default (reply-only, no retweets/likes, strict rate limits) to protect accounts and user trust?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-01-04): "unwanted automatic replies/retweets" and multiple authentication/shadowban concerns`
  - `GitHub Issues: request for improved X agent configuration options (#1813)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—ship a conservative default policy profile; advanced behaviors require explicit opt-in.
        *Implication:* Reduces bans and reputational risk; may disappoint users seeking high engagement.
    b) Offer selectable presets (Conservative / Balanced / Aggressive) during setup.
        *Implication:* Improves DX and user control; requires more documentation and testing effort.
    c) Keep current defaults but improve documentation and templates for behavior control.
        *Implication:* Lowest engineering cost, but ongoing incidents may continue to erode trust.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Do we prioritize a first-class “approval workflow” (human-in-the-loop) for posting on social platforms as a flagship reliability feature?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub completed items list includes: PR #1876 "Add approval mechanism for Twitter posts via Discord bot"`
  - `Discord (2025-01-04): concerns about agents doing unwanted replies/retweets`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—promote approval mode as the default for new deployments; autonomous posting is advanced.
        *Implication:* Improves safety and trust for early users; reduces the “autonomous” feel out of the box.
    b) Make approval workflow optional but highlighted in onboarding and templates.
        *Implication:* Balances autonomy and safety; relies on users to enable the protective layer.
    c) No—focus on fully autonomous posting and fix edge cases; keep humans out of the loop.
        *Implication:* Maximizes autonomy narrative but increases platform risk and moderation incidents.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Given ongoing platform policy pressure, should the Council invest in alternative social connectivity paths (e.g., non-API bot protocols or other networks) as a resilience strategy?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-01-04): "Twitter account compliance issues requiring a name change to include 'Parody'" (jin)`
  - `Discord action item: "Create a Twitter protocol for bots to communicate without using Twitter API" (Mike D.)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—treat social resilience as strategic infrastructure; invest in multi-network and fallback mechanisms.
        *Implication:* Reduces single-platform fragility; increases scope and maintenance burden.
    b) Pilot a small experiment (one alternative protocol) while keeping Twitter as primary.
        *Implication:* Maintains focus while exploring hedges; may be too slow if Twitter risk escalates.
    c) No—stay focused on Twitter stability; avoid parallel efforts until core is fully stable.
        *Implication:* Improves near-term execution but retains platform concentration risk.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Tokenomics & Ecosystem Design: Launchpad Pools, Fees, and Trust Signaling

**Summary of Topic:** The ecosystem is debating a single-pool ai16z-base bonding curve model vs a two-pool virtual liquidity model, alongside fee/buyback policy; without clear documentation and a shipped whitepaper, uncertainty risks undermining builder and investor confidence.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which launch mechanism best serves the North Star of a reliable, developer-friendly ecosystem: single-pool (ai16z base) simplicity or two-pool (virtual liquidity) distribution efficiency?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord tokenomics (2025-01-04): 563 blocmates proposes "using ai16z as the base asset" with a single pool and zapping`
  - `Discord tokenomics (2025-01-04): eskender.eth defends two-pool AT:SOL model "like pump.fun" with "virtual liquidity"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt single-pool ai16z-base + zapping for simplicity and direct value flow.
        *Implication:* Simplifies UX and alignment, but may reduce external liquidity inflows and distribution dynamics.
    b) Keep two-pool (AT:SOL primary + AT:ai16z) to maximize distribution and external liquidity.
        *Implication:* Potentially stronger market mechanics, but higher complexity and greater onboarding friction.
    c) Hybrid—launch single-pool first, then optionally migrate successful agents to a two-pool/liquidity program.
        *Implication:* Balances simplicity and scale, but introduces migration complexity and governance overhead.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should plugin fees and buybacks primarily deepen liquidity (growth) or burn supply (scarcity) as the ecosystem matures?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord tokenomics (2025-01-04): "Debate about whether buybacks should go to deepening liquidity rather than burning tokens" (Akin)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize liquidity deepening (buyback-to-LP) to grow ecosystem throughput and stability.
        *Implication:* Strengthens markets and utility, but reduces the scarcity narrative.
    b) Prioritize burns to signal scarcity and drive speculative demand.
        *Implication:* May boost price perception short-term, but can reduce usable liquidity for builders.
    c) Split policy: early stage deepens liquidity; later stage introduces controlled burns.
        *Implication:* Adaptive strategy, but requires clear governance triggers and communications.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we enforce the ecosystem entry fee/tribute program via technical means (clickwrap, defaults) or via social/contractual expectations and documentation?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-01-02): "urgent implementation of clear communication about the 5-10% ecosystem entry fee" (DorianD); Odilitime agreed to update README`
  - `Discord (2025-01-03): concerns about launchpads being forked without creators knowing about the tribute program`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Technical enforcement: clickwrap + defaults in tooling to opt-in/record commitments.
        *Implication:* Improves clarity and compliance, but may introduce friction and resistance from builders.
    b) Documentation-first: clear README/whitepaper rules and community enforcement.
        *Implication:* Lower friction, but weaker enforceability and more disputes.
    c) Dual-track: clickwrap for official cloud/CLI paths, documentation-only for OSS forks.
        *Implication:* Aligns incentives where we control distribution while preserving open-source ethos.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

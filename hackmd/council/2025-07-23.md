        *Implication:* Builds credibility but requires more preparation time and resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What role should the ELI5 token play in our broader tokenomics strategy?

  **Context:**

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position ELI5 as a governance token for incubated projects, creating a unified decision-making framework.
        *Implication:* Creates stronger ecosystem cohesion but may limit individual project autonomy.
    b) Use ELI5 primarily as an investment vehicle with revenue sharing from successfully incubated projects.
        *Implication:* Maximizes token value but may create regulatory concerns.
    c) Establish ELI5 as an access token for incubator services with utility across the auto.fun platform.
        *Implication:* Balances utility and value accrual while encouraging ecosystem participation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What metrics should we prioritize tracking during the first month after launch to measure success?

  **Context:**

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on token liquidity metrics, holder distribution, and trading volume to assess market health.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes financial stability but may overlook ecosystem development metrics.
    b) Track new project applications, developer engagement, and incubator service utilization.
        *Implication:* Emphasizes ecosystem growth but may undervalue token performance indicators.
    c) Measure user growth, agent activity metrics, and cross-platform engagement across auto.fun.
        *Implication:* Balances platform adoption with ecosystem development but requires more complex analytics.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: ElizaOS Framework Modernization

**Summary of Topic:** ElizaOS is undergoing significant architectural upgrades with new plugin integrations, migration to Bun native EventTarget API, and enhanced module resolution capabilities.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance backward compatibility with architectural modernization in the ElizaOS framework?

  **Context:**
  - `wtfsayo: Drove a significant migration from EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget API in elizaos/eliza via PR #5609, demonstrating a focus on core architectural improvements and Bun compatibility`
  - `wtfsayo: Focused on enhancing core system capabilities, notably merging a significant feature in elizaos/eliza#5629 that improved ModuleLoader with local-first guarantees`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize cutting-edge technologies like Bun's native APIs with minimal backward compatibility layers.
        *Implication:* Accelerates innovation but may fragment the developer ecosystem.
    b) Maintain full backward compatibility while gradually introducing modern alternatives with clear migration paths.
        *Implication:* Ensures stability but may slow adoption of performance improvements.
    c) Adopt a dual-track approach with LTS versions for stability and bleeding-edge versions for innovation.
        *Implication:* Balances innovation and stability but increases maintenance overhead.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What should be our strategy for plugin development to maximize ecosystem growth?

  **Context:**
  - `0xbbjoker: Focused on a significant refactor, migrating JSON prompts to an XML format in elizaos/eliza via PR #5623, which involved substantial code changes across 12 files`
  - `ChristopherTrimboli: Addressed a critical bug by merging elizaos/eliza#5624, which fixed plugin actions not loading in the NPM deployed version`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize first-party plugin development to ensure tight integration and quality control.
        *Implication:* Ensures consistency but limits community-driven expansion.
    b) Focus on building comprehensive plugin development tools and standards for third-party developers.
        *Implication:* Maximizes ecosystem diversity but may reduce integration quality.
    c) Develop a curated marketplace with verified plugins and simplified monetization for developers.
        *Implication:* Balances quality and community involvement while creating revenue opportunities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-09-21

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Developer focus on browser integration and neural network architecture proposals marks significant progress toward elizaOS v2 while auto.fun remains unavailable.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Browser Integration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The team is making significant progress on browser-based SDK development with integrated speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality, which aligns with the v2 roadmap but requires architectural decisions about implementation approach.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What approach should we prioritize for browser integration to maximize adoption while maintaining our decentralization values?

  **Context:**
  - `cjft: Progress on a browser end-to-end working demo with plugin-openai, core, and plugin-sql components, including speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality.`
  - `Key Developments: Browser SDK Development: Full in-browser agent functionality without persistent servers, supporting local LLMs, MetaMask, and serverless operations`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on serverless browser integration that prioritizes user privacy with local LLM processing where possible.
        *Implication:* This approach maximizes decentralization but may limit functionality for resource-constrained devices.
    b) Develop a hybrid model with secure cloud fallback options when local processing is insufficient.
        *Implication:* This balances decentralization with practical utility but increases technical complexity.
    c) Prioritize feature parity with server version and optimize for accessibility, leveraging cloud services.
        *Implication:* This approach maximizes adoption and features but compromises on full decentralization.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we position speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities within our ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Technical Development: Browser Integration: Progress on a browser end-to-end working demo with plugin-openai, core, and plugin-sql components, including speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality.`
  - `Plugin Improvements: The OpenAI plugin has been updated to use newer models (whisper-1 → gpt-4o-mini-transcribe, dalle-3 → gpt-image-1).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) As core platform features integrated into the elizaOS framework.
        *Implication:* Makes these capabilities universally available but increases our core dependency on third-party APIs.
    b) As optional plugins with standardized interfaces that support multiple providers.
        *Implication:* Maintains architectural flexibility but might fragment the user experience across implementations.
    c) As premium features that differentiate auto.fun from competitors.
        *Implication:* Creates monetization opportunities but risks alienating open-source community.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Neural Network Architecture Proposal

**Summary of Topic:** A radical architectural proposal to replace core ElizaOS code with neural networks on a P2P blockchain network has emerged, presenting both innovative opportunities and implementation challenges that require strategic evaluation.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we evaluate and potentially incorporate the neural network on blockchain proposal into our roadmap?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD proposed replacing core ElizaOS code with neural networks running on a P2P blockchain network, similar to Tesla's approach of replacing legacy code with neural networks.`
  - `Several academic papers were shared discussing neural networks on blockchain, including concepts for model verification and deploying ML models as smart contracts.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a dedicated research workstream to explore this architecture while continuing current v2 development.
        *Implication:* Balances innovation with practical delivery but requires additional resources.
    b) Pivot our v2 roadmap to incorporate these concepts as core architectural principles.
        *Implication:* Could position us at the cutting edge but introduces significant technical risk and potential delays.
    c) Document as a future research direction but maintain focus on current browser integration and stability priorities.
        *Implication:* Maintains delivery momentum but risks missing a potential breakthrough architecture.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What security and performance trade-offs should we consider in a neural network on blockchain architecture?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD proposed implementing neural network-based fraud detection for transactions to prevent exploits like wallet drainers.`
  - `Security Concerns: Supply chain attack concerns were discussed, with recommendations to use VMs/VPS for development or separate development machines from wallets.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize transaction security and fraud prevention capabilities even at the cost of performance.
        *Implication:* Enhances security for financial operations but may limit throughput for non-financial agent actions.
    b) Focus on optimizing the architecture for agent performance while implementing basic security controls.
        *Implication:* Maximizes agent capabilities but may expose the system to sophisticated attacks.
    c) Implement a layered approach with performance-optimized core and security-focused transaction validation layer.
        *Implication:* Balances needs but increases architectural complexity and potential integration challenges.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Auto.fun Operational Status

**Summary of Topic:** Reports indicate auto.fun has been down for several weeks, which directly conflicts with our monthly goal of attracting new users to the platform and requires immediate strategic response.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should be our immediate priority regarding auto.fun's reported downtime?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD: It's been down for a few weeks from what I've been able to gather (answered by DorianD)`
  - `Monthly Goal: Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediately divert technical resources to restore auto.fun functionality as the top priority.
        *Implication:* Addresses the immediate issue but may impact elizaOS v2 development timeline.
    b) Maintain focus on elizaOS v2 development while implementing a temporary landing page explaining the upgrade process.
        *Implication:* Preserves development momentum but risks losing potential early adopters.
    c) Launch a simplified interim version of auto.fun focused only on the most critical agent showcases.
        *Implication:* Balances user acquisition with development needs but requires additional design effort.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we adjust our monthly goals given the current state of auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Community Projects: Auto.fun: Site reported down for several weeks`
  - `Monthly Goal: Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain the current goal but extend the timeline to ensure quality delivery.
        *Implication:* Preserves strategic direction but acknowledges realistic timelines.
    b) Refocus entirely on elizaOS v2 delivery and postpone auto.fun user acquisition goals.
        *Implication:* Concentrates resources but delays community growth objectives.
    c) Pivot to alternative user acquisition channels while auto.fun is being redeveloped.
        *Implication:* Maintains growth momentum but may dilute focus and brand messaging.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

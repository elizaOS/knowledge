**Question 1:** How should we prioritize communication channels for the token migration instructions to ensure maximum reach and minimal user confusion?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk confirmed the transition of $ai16z token to $elizaOS and mentioned that detailed migration instructions will be shared soon.`
  - `Community members expressed concerns about tokens held on exchanges, particularly in margin accounts.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize direct exchange partnerships to handle migration automatically for centralized exchange users.
        *Implication:* This approach minimizes technical burden on users but increases dependency on third-party exchange cooperation.
    b) Focus on comprehensive step-by-step documentation with visual guides across all community channels (Discord, GitHub, X).
        *Implication:* This approach ensures consistent information is available across platforms but requires users to take manual action.
    c) Develop an automated migration tool with a simple web interface that handles the technical complexity.
        *Implication:* This approach provides the best user experience but requires significant development resources and security auditing.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What strategic positioning should we emphasize about the new $elizaOS token to differentiate it from the previous $ai16z token?

  **Context:**
  - `Dean provided technical context about the new token's cross-chain capabilities: 'The new token is purpose-built for elizaOS v2, for cross-chain operation through Chainlink CCIP, and for agent-native workflows.'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Emphasize cross-chain interoperability through Chainlink CCIP as the primary differentiator.
        *Implication:* This positions elizaOS as a multi-chain ecosystem but may underplay other valuable aspects of the token.
    b) Focus on agent-native workflows and tokenomics that directly support autonomous agent activities.
        *Implication:* This aligns closely with our North Star of autonomous agents but may be less appealing to general crypto investors.
    c) Highlight the token as the unified currency for the entire elizaOS v2 ecosystem, emphasizing utility across all products.
        *Implication:* This creates a comprehensive value narrative but may dilute the impact of specific technical improvements.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is the appropriate timeline to complete the token migration without disrupting ongoing community development?

  **Context:**
  - `Team member Kenk mentioned they'll be sharing more details and a FAQ about the migration soon.`
  - `Questions about other related tokens (DegenAI, Eli5) during migration were raised.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Expedited 2-week migration window with high incentives for early adopters to migrate quickly.
        *Implication:* This approach consolidates the new token quickly but risks leaving some users behind.
    b) Gradual 1-month migration with a declining conversion rate to encourage timely migration while accommodating diverse user situations.
        *Implication:* This balances urgency with flexibility but creates a more complex migration structure.
    c) Extended 3-month migration window with consistent terms to prioritize inclusivity and accommodate users on various exchanges.
        *Implication:* This maximizes inclusivity but extends the period of maintaining dual token systems.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Community-Driven Agent Development

**Summary of Topic:** There is growing interest in community-led AI agent development using the elizaOS framework, with proposals for collaborative projects and infrastructure to showcase agent capabilities.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we structure community-led agent development to maximize engagement while ensuring quality?

  **Context:**
  - `3on_ proposed creating a community-led AI agent using elizaOS within Discord.`
  - `Kenk suggested using the contribution channels to float the idea and find collaborators.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a structured bounty system with clear specifications for community-developed agents tied to auto.fun showcases.
        *Implication:* This creates clear incentives and quality standards but may limit creative exploration.
    b) Establish agent development guilds with mentorship from core team members to guide community efforts.
        *Implication:* This builds sustainable community knowledge but requires significant core team bandwidth.
    c) Create an open agent hackathon framework with regular competitions and community voting for featured agents.
        *Implication:* This maximizes creative diversity but may result in less integrated or production-ready agents.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What showcase infrastructure should we prioritize to demonstrate the 24/7 capabilities of community-built agents?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk highlighted existing agents in the server including a daily summary agent and social sentiment tracker.`
  - `Kenk mentioned the possibility of creating a website to showcase these agents.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Build a dedicated agent showcase portal with leaderboards, metrics, and direct interaction capabilities.
        *Implication:* This creates high visibility but requires significant frontend development resources.
    b) Integrate agent activity feeds directly into auto.fun, prioritizing trading, streaming, and social media agents.
        *Implication:* This aligns with our monthly goal but may narrow the types of agents showcased.
    c) Develop an agent-to-agent interaction playground where community can observe and participate in agent collaborations.
        *Implication:* This demonstrates advanced capabilities but may be technically complex to implement.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

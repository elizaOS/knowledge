# Council Briefing: 2025-03-07

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Core engineering velocity remains high (tests + async + RAG/Telegram fixes shipped), but fresh-install and client-connectivity regressions are surfacing fast enough to threaten developer trust unless we harden the “first 30 minutes” experience.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 Stabilization & “First 30 Minutes” DX

**Summary of Topic:** V2’s simplified workflow (e.g., `npx elizaos init/start`) is nearing readiness, while the repo shows heavy fix/merge throughput; however, new issues indicate fragile initialization paths (model startup loops, missing text_generation service) that could undermine the reliability-first mandate.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s release gate for V2: feature completeness, or a strict “fresh install succeeds + core clients connect” reliability bar?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-06): shaw: V2 core architecture complete; simplified setup via `npx elizaos init` / `npx elizaos start`.`
  - `GitHub Issues (2025-03-07): #3802 “Service text_generation not found”; #3801 “Model initialization failed.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship V2 as soon as the core workflow is feature-complete; patch reliability issues post-release.
        *Implication:* Maximizes momentum but risks violating “Execution Excellence” and causing community churn from broken first impressions.
    b) Gate release on a “First 30 Minutes” checklist (install, start, one agent, one client, one memory write) passing on common environments.
        *Implication:* Directly reinforces developer trust, but delays launch and may require deferring non-critical features.
    c) Dual-track: publish V2 as an explicit preview channel with a hardened LTS stable line (v1.x) and clear migration timing.
        *Implication:* Preserves experimentation while protecting trust, at the cost of maintaining two supported paths.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Where should the Council concentrate testing resources: end-to-end agent runs (CLI→runtime→client) or deeper unit coverage on core services?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub PR (2025-03-07): #3791 transition Playwright→Patchright for testing.`
  - `GitHub activity note (2025-03-06 to 2025-03-08): contributor count and merged PRs surged (7/7 merged on Mar 7-8).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize end-to-end scenarios and smoke tests for installs, providers, and clients.
        *Implication:* Best protects the onboarding experience and reduces high-visibility breakages, aligning with “Trust Through Shipping.”
    b) Prioritize unit tests and type-safety to prevent regressions as the codebase scales.
        *Implication:* Improves maintainability and contributor velocity, but may miss integration failures that developers feel immediately.
    c) Split: E2E for the critical path (install/start/client connect) plus unit tests for memory/DB/model adapters.
        *Implication:* Balances immediate reliability with long-term robustness, but requires disciplined test ownership and prioritization.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we formalize “golden environments” (e.g., Linux + Docker, macOS, WSL2) as supported targets, or attempt best-effort support across everything?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub Issue (2025-03-06): #3785 Discord/Telegram client integration failing on WSL2 at agent startup.`
  - `GitHub PRs (2025-03-06): multiple Docker build fixes merged (#3784, #3786, #3790).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Declare a small set of golden environments and ensure they work flawlessly.
        *Implication:* Creates predictable reliability and faster triage, but may alienate users on unsupported setups.
    b) Keep broad compatibility as a goal; accept occasional environment-specific failures.
        *Implication:* Maximizes reach but increases support burden and weakens perceived reliability.
    c) Golden environments for guarantees, plus community-maintained compatibility guides for others.
        *Implication:* Scales support via documentation and community while preserving a clear reliability promise.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Client Reliability: Twitter/Telegram/Discord as Trust Multipliers

**Summary of Topic:** Community friction centers on client integrations (Twitter authentication/media posting, Telegram connectivity, Discord bridge message semantics). Fixes are landing, but recurrent configuration confusion across versions and clients risks making ElizaOS feel unstable despite rapid engineering progress.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we treat Twitter/Telegram/Discord clients as “Tier-1 contracts” with strict compatibility guarantees, or keep them as best-effort plugins?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-06 coders): repeated Twitter client auth/temp/format confusion across v0.1.9, v0.25.9, v1.9.`
  - `GitHub Issues (2025-03-07): #3798 Telegram client cannot connect to bot API; #3785 WSL2 client linking failure.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Tier-1: guarantee these clients, freeze stable interfaces, and run mandatory CI integration tests.
        *Implication:* Strengthens the platform’s “reliable framework” brand, but constrains internal refactors and increases test maintenance.
    b) Best-effort: keep clients community-driven with looser compatibility promises.
        *Implication:* Preserves flexibility, but undermines developer confidence when flagship integrations break.
    c) Hybrid: Tier-1 only for the most-used flows (auth, send/receive, media), everything else best-effort.
        *Implication:* Targets trust-critical surfaces while keeping the long tail composable and fast-moving.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we reduce version/config fragmentation (v0.1.9 vs v0.25.x vs v1.9 vs V2) that is driving repeated support load?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-06 coders): users asked different install commands across versions; plugins moved to separate repos; dynamic loading introduced.`
  - `Discord Q&A (2025-03-06): v1.9 install: `npm install @elizaos/client-twitter @elizaos/client-discord`.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Force migration: deprecate older versions quickly and redirect docs/support entirely to the latest line.
        *Implication:* Simplifies support and docs, but risks breaking existing users and harming trust if migrations are painful.
    b) Maintain parallel docs and compatibility shims for a defined support window.
        *Implication:* Reduces disruption but increases maintenance and can slow innovation.
    c) Introduce an “upgrade assistant” CLI (detect version, validate env, auto-migrate character/plugin configs).
        *Implication:* Transforms fragmentation into a guided flow, improving DX while still enabling forward progress.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we invest first in making Twitter media posting and tweet generation controls “boringly reliable,” or pivot attention to emerging client requests (LinkedIn, Hyperliquid, Telegram voice)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-06): PR request: agent-twitter-client PR #87 fixes image posting; recurring temperature/post prompt type questions.`
  - `Discord (2025-03-06 ideas-feedback-rants): request for Hyperliquid plugin; requests for LinkedIn client and Telegram voice calls.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize Twitter stability (auth, media posting, duplication errors, action toggles) until support noise drops materially.
        *Implication:* Reduces the highest-volume pain quickly, reinforcing “Execution Excellence.”
    b) Split effort: stabilize Twitter while incubating one high-value new client (e.g., LinkedIn or voice).
        *Implication:* Balances growth and reliability, but may extend the period of unresolved Twitter friction.
    c) Pivot to new clients to capture mindshare; accept Twitter as “known rough edge.”
        *Implication:* May accelerate ecosystem breadth, but risks reputational damage because Twitter is a primary public-facing surface.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Rebrand & Information Taming: Comms as Operational Infrastructure

**Summary of Topic:** The rebrand (AI16z→ElizaOS) is underway amid X account restrictions and community anxiety; meanwhile, recurring unanswered onboarding questions (autoClient customization, DegenAI progress, launchpad timelines) highlight an information-distribution gap that undermines developer trust.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is our minimum viable “single source of truth” for rebrand + product status so Discord support doesn’t become the primary documentation layer?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-06 discussion): many user questions were unanswered or redirected; requests for autoClient guidance and DegenAI progress.`
  - `Discord (2025-03-06 partners): org structure clarified (ElizaOS, Eliza Labs, Eliza Studios, aixvc); Trust Marketplace alpha discussed.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish a living status page (rebrand, V2, cloud, flagship agents) and route all community answers back to it.
        *Implication:* Converts scattered answers into durable trust artifacts, aligning with “Taming Information.”
    b) Rely on Discord + occasional videos; keep docs focused on code only.
        *Implication:* Saves time short-term but perpetuates confusion and increases support load.
    c) Embed a “council clerk” agent that auto-updates docs from Discord/GitHub daily summaries and pins canonical answers.
        *Implication:* Operationalizes information taming, but requires careful governance to avoid propagating inaccuracies.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we respond strategically to the X/Twitter account restriction: wait for appeals, or execute a contingency comms channel shift immediately?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-06 partners/spartan_holders): X account ban/restriction; appeal open, “X support ghosted us,” exploring accelxr route.`
  - `Discord (2025-03-05): rebrand planned by end of week; handle change delays.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Wait for appeal resolution while posting minimally elsewhere to avoid fragmentation.
        *Implication:* Preserves brand continuity but risks prolonged silence and loss of narrative control.
    b) Shift immediately to resilient channels (YouTube, blog/RSS, Farcaster/others) with clear guidance and cross-post automation.
        *Implication:* Maintains consistent outbound comms, but requires disciplined channel management and messaging alignment.
    c) Hybrid: pursue appeal, but launch an official backup handle + mirrored posts with explicit “official verification” practices.
        *Implication:* Reduces platform risk while protecting authenticity, at the cost of operational overhead.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we formalize community contribution incentives now (awesome-eliza + retroactive public goods funding), or postpone until core reliability stabilizes?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-06 partners): jin: public goods retroactive funding system; request help for awesome-eliza repo; bounties mentioned.`
  - `GitHub activity (month 2025-03): 322 PRs, 138 contributors—high participation suggests incentive design could materially shape outcomes.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Formalize immediately with clear scopes: docs, client fixes, onboarding guides, and tests.
        *Implication:* Channels contributor energy into reliability/DX outputs that reinforce the North Star.
    b) Postpone incentives until V2 stabilizes to avoid rewarding low-signal contributions.
        *Implication:* Reduces governance complexity now, but risks losing momentum and goodwill from active contributors.
    c) Launch a limited pilot (small budget, tight rubric, monthly review) focused only on trust-critical deliverables.
        *Implication:* Captures upside while containing risk, and provides a governance template for scaling later.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

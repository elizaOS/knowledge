# Council Briefing: 2026-01-20

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The framework solidifies its technical foundation via version 1.7.2 while simultaneously expanding its frontier through a functional WASM runtime and specialized high-performance rust infrastructure.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Platform Stability vs. Rapid Expansion

**Summary of Topic:** While v1.7.2 addresses critical race conditions and rebuild loops, the push for WASM and Rust-based high-performance trading systems indicates a split in architectural focus between ecosystem accessibility and high-end utility.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council prioritize developer resources between stabilizing the TypeScript core and accelerating the Rust/v2.0.0 pivot?

  **Context:**
  - `Version 1.7.2 released to fix TOCTOU race conditions. (Report 2026-01-19)`
  - `Lalalune and Revlentless are driving a heavy v2.0.0/WASM shift involving over 38,000 modified code lines. (Monthly Summary)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Freeze feature additions on v1.x to focus exclusively on the Rust/v2 translation.
        *Implication:* Ensures a cleaner v2 transition but risks losing builder momentum on the current stable platform.
    b) Maintain parallel development paths with dedicated 'Stabilization' and 'Frontier' teams.
        *Implication:* Maximizes execution excellence but adds strain on the existing small pool of core contributors (high bus factor).
    c) Slow down v2.0.0 development until v1.7.x achieves 'zero-bug' status.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes developer trust and reliability over technological edge.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should the network launch include specific incentivization for 'physical infrastructure' nodes as requested by the community?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD expressed desire to run nodes from Puerto Rico with physical server racks and automated security. (Discord 2026-01-19)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Introduce an 'Infrastructure Pioneer' tier for physical node operators.
        *Implication:* Increases decentralization and physical network resilience but complicates node orchestration.
    b) Optimize exclusively for lightweight cloud/WASM nodes initially.
        *Implication:* Lowers entry barriers for builders but sacrifices long-term provable hardware security.
    c) Delay server-rack discussions until the software-defined Jeju network is fully stabilized.
        *Implication:* Maintains focus on execution excellence but may alienate highly technical early adopters.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Economic Autonomy & Token Utility

**Summary of Topic:** Community interest in automated token rewards and high-performance trading plugins highlights the need for a clear, secure economic layer within the framework.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should elizaOS address the gap between speculative token sentiment and the framework's actual utility?

  **Context:**
  - `Alexei notes token chart 'not looking good' but has x100 potential if the project survives. (Discord 2026-01-19)`
  - `Community members proposing holder rewards tied to agent creation. (Discord 2026-01-17)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Integrate token utility directly into ElizaOS Cloud credits and agent marketplace fees.
        *Implication:* Directly links framework success to token demand.
    b) Focus solely on core UX; assume utility will follow naturally from builder adoption.
        *Implication:* Risks community frustration with price action but maintains pure research/dev focus.
    c) Launch an official staking/active participation program to stabilize holder sentiment.
        *Implication:* Reduces circulating supply but introduces regulatory and DAO complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

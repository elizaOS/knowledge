### 2. Topic: Eliza Cloud Backend Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** A fundamental architectural debate has emerged regarding whether to refactor the existing Eliza Cloud Backend or implement a fresh rebuild, highlighting tensions between maintaining continuity and addressing technical debt.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What approach should we take with the Eliza Cloud Backend: refactor or rebuild?

  **Context:**
  - `Sam-developer advocated for a fresh implementation due to the current codebase's rigidity, security issues, and maintenance challenges`
  - `Shaw questioned this approach, suggesting focus should remain on core functionality of issuing API tokens`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focused refactoring targeting only core API token functionality.
        *Implication:* This minimalist approach delivers essential functionality quickly but may leave underlying architectural issues unresolved.
    b) Complete rebuild with modern architecture to address security and maintainability.
        *Implication:* This comprehensive approach solves fundamental issues but delays delivery and risks compatibility breaks.
    c) Hybrid approach: maintain current system while incrementally building replacement modules.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach maintains service continuity while gradually addressing technical debt, though requiring more coordination.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How does the Cloud Backend decision impact our timeline for shipping production-ready elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `No consensus reached yet`
  - `Current monthly directive: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize minimal viable backend to maintain v2 launch schedule.
        *Implication:* This schedule-focused approach ensures timely release but may require significant post-launch updates.
    b) Delay v2 launch to ensure backend robustness and security.
        *Implication:* This quality-focused approach delivers a more stable product but misses near-term momentum opportunities.
    c) Decouple backend development from v2 release by implementing feature flags.
        *Implication:* This modular approach allows independent progress but increases architectural complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What technical criteria should govern our decision-making for backend architecture?

  **Context:**
  - `Current codebase's rigidity, security issues, and maintenance challenges`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize security and regulatory compliance above all other considerations.
        *Implication:* This security-first approach minimizes organizational risk but may constrain flexibility and speed.
    b) Balance maintainability, performance, and developer experience.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach optimizes for long-term sustainability but requires more nuanced decision-making.
    c) Focus on scalability and integration capabilities with Web3 infrastructure.

### 3. Topic: $AI16Z Token Utility Enhancement

**Summary of Topic:** Community discussions reveal growing interest in expanded $AI16Z token utility, particularly around governance participation through token burning mechanisms and investment opportunities, which could drive engagement and value capture.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we implement token burning mechanisms to enhance $AI16Z utility?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussion about $AI16Z token utility, particularly regarding burning tokens for voting participation`
  - `A community member asked about the best exchange to buy more $AI16Z tokens, and another asked if burning $AI16Z would be required for voting participation`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a linear burning model where votes require direct token burns.
        *Implication:* This simple model creates clear deflationary pressure but may exclude smaller token holders from governance.
    b) Develop a quadratic voting system with partial burns to balance participation.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach increases inclusivity but adds implementation complexity and potential gaming vectors.
    c) Create a delegated burning system where users can pool tokens for collective votes.
        *Implication:* This community-oriented approach enables broader participation but may lead to vote concentration.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What investment mechanisms should we enable for $AI16Z holders in relation to accelerator projects?

  **Context:**
  - `So basically, we will get to burn $Ai16z to participate in voting, and hopefully invest, is that the general idea? (asked by Spyhard)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Enable direct token swaps between $AI16Z and accelerator project tokens.
        *Implication:* This direct approach simplifies investment but may create valuation and liquidity challenges for new projects.
    b) Implement a bonding curve mechanism for accelerator project investments.
        *Implication:* This market-oriented approach creates predictable pricing but requires more complex smart contract development.
    c) Create investment pools that require $AI16Z staking for participation rights.
        *Implication:* This staking-based approach increases token utility without permanent burns but adds custody complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we balance token utility between auto.fun and governance participation?

  **Context:**
  - `Monthly Goal: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity`
  - `Partnership with BNV mentioned in a shared tweet`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize auto.fun integration with exclusive features for token holders.
        *Implication:* This product-focused approach drives user acquisition but may limit governance participation.
    b) Implement dual utility with separate allocation for governance and platform usage.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach serves both purposes but increases system complexity.
    c) Create a unified token economy where platform usage generates governance rights.
        *Implication:* This integrated approach aligns incentives but may initially limit governance to active platform users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-03-27

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- A surge in quality work (docs + test reliability) was counterbalanced by a critical Windows build failure signal, demanding immediate stabilization to protect developer trust and cross-platform adoption.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Cross-Platform Build Integrity (Windows Breakage)

**Summary of Topic:** A new Windows build failure issue surfaced as core documentation and test reliability improved; the Council must decide whether to treat Windows parity as a release gate or a best-effort lane to preserve execution excellence without stalling velocity.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we elevate Windows build success to a hard release gate for the mainline framework, even if it slows ship cadence?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub daily log: "[elizaos/eliza#4094]: A new issue regarding build failures on Windows needs investigation" (2025-03-27).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—Windows green is a hard gate for all releases.
        *Implication:* Maximizes trust and broadens developer adoption, but may reduce shipping velocity during toolchain transitions.
    b) Partial—gate only for stable releases; allow betas/nightlies to ship with Windows warnings.
        *Implication:* Preserves momentum while maintaining a strong trust boundary for production users.
    c) No—treat Windows as best-effort; prioritize Linux/macOS and Cloud as the canonical path.
        *Implication:* Accelerates core iteration, but risks ecosystem fragmentation and reputational damage among Windows-first developers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the preferred incident response pattern for build failures: rapid hotfix in core, or publish an official workaround while a deeper refactor proceeds?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub daily log: "CLI tests were refined... while a new critical issue regarding Windows build failures was reported" (2025-03-27).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Hotfix immediately in core (patch release within 24–48 hours).
        *Implication:* Reinforces execution excellence, but may increase risk of rushed regressions elsewhere.
    b) Ship an official workaround guide + pin known-good versions; fix in next planned release.
        *Implication:* Reduces risk and stabilizes expectations, but can feel like “papering over” for affected developers.
    c) Run a focused stabilization sprint (no new features) until Windows parity is restored.
        *Implication:* Improves long-term platform reliability, but temporarily pauses roadmap progress and marketing beats.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How do we instrument the fleet so OS-specific failures are detected before community discovery (shift-left reliability)?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub summary (2025-03-26 to 2025-03-27): "10 new PRs (14 merged)..." and later "7 new PRs"—high churn increases CI miss risk.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Expand CI matrix and require artifact uploads for Windows failures (logs, bundler output, lockfiles).
        *Implication:* Improves diagnosis speed and prevents repeats, at the cost of longer CI runtimes.
    b) Create a Windows canary branch with nightly builds and auto-issue creation on failure.
        *Implication:* Catches regressions early without blocking mainline merges, but introduces operational overhead.
    c) Rely on community reporting and prioritize fixes only when adoption warrants it.
        *Implication:* Minimizes internal burden short-term, but undermines the “reliable framework” positioning.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Developer Experience: Migration, Plugins, and Database Friction

**Summary of Topic:** Discord signals show persistent onboarding pain across versions (v0.25.9 vs v1.0.0-beta), including PostgreSQL adapter constraints, plugin import/version mismatches, and missing migration/character creation guidance—directly impacting developer trust.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we prioritize a single authoritative migration path (v0.25.9 → v1) now, even if it delays new feature work (e.g., MCP expansion)?

  **Context:**
  - `[elizaos] <benquik>: "Create migration guide from v0.25.9 to v1.0.0" (Discord 💻-coders, 2025-03-26).`
  - `Multiple unanswered Discord questions: "Is there a tutorial on how to safely and efficiently migrate to 1.0.0?" (Discord 💻-coders, 2025-03-26).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—declare migration docs + tooling as the top priority until friction drops materially.
        *Implication:* Improves retention and reduces support load, accelerating ecosystem growth after the short delay.
    b) Hybrid—ship migration docs incrementally while continuing critical feature launches (MCP, clients).
        *Implication:* Balances momentum and trust, but risks neither effort being “finished enough” to change sentiment.
    c) No—focus on the new architecture; let the community maintain migration lore and unofficial guides.
        *Implication:* Maximizes forward velocity, but increases fragmentation and “tribal knowledge” dependence.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we handle the PostgreSQL adapter/embedding constraint failures (e.g., levenshtein 255 limit): patch core defaults, document workarounds, or redesign the caching strategy?

  **Context:**
  - `cryptoAYA to Zed Sepolia: PostgreSQL error "levenshtein argument exceeds maximum length of 255 characters"; suggested modifying `getCachedEmbeddings` (Discord 💻-coders, 2025-03-26).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Patch core defaults (truncate/normalize inputs; safer fallback similarity) and ship a fix release.
        *Implication:* Reduces repeated support incidents and aligns with execution excellence, with some risk of behavior change.
    b) Document the workaround and add a config flag; keep current behavior by default.
        *Implication:* Preserves backward compatibility but keeps the burden on developers and increases “gotchas.”
    c) Redesign the caching/similarity approach (e.g., hash-based keys, vector-only retrieval) as a priority refactor.
        *Implication:* Eliminates an entire class of DB edge cases, but requires larger engineering investment and migration handling.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is our official compatibility contract for plugins/providers (Venice/OpenAI-style keys, MCP, Twitter/Telegram clients): strict semver with compatibility tests, or flexible “best effort” integrations?

  **Context:**
  - `Etherdrake: "set OPENAI_API_KEY to Venice key value" (Discord 💻-coders, 2025-03-26).`
  - `[elizaos] <benquik>: "Fix module import errors for @elizaos/plugin-sql and @elizaos/plugin-local-ai" (Discord action items, 2025-03-26).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Strict contract—semver enforcement + compatibility test suite per plugin before release.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability and trust, but increases maintenance and slows third-party plugin iteration.
    b) Tiered contract—“Core-certified” plugins tested; community plugins remain best-effort.
        *Implication:* Creates a trust gradient and encourages quality without blocking ecosystem experimentation.
    c) Flexible—optimize for composability; publish integration patterns and let builders adapt rapidly.
        *Implication:* Maximizes openness, but shifts reliability costs to developers and support channels.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Trust & Comms Resilience (Security + Social Channels)

**Summary of Topic:** Community trust was tested by a Twitter account compromise and ongoing FUD narratives; parallel channel instability (Spartan X block) suggests the project needs hardened comms procedures and a clearer security posture around plugins and official links.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s minimum security baseline for public comms accounts (X/Discord/launchpad): mandatory hardware keys + app audits, or lighter guidance?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-25): "Shaw's Twitter account was compromised through a connected app... fake announcements... presale."`
  - `Rick: "source of the compromise as a connected app" (Discord, 2025-03-25).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Mandatory baseline: hardware keys, least-privilege app connections, quarterly audits, and incident playbooks.
        *Implication:* Reduces existential reputational risk, but adds operational friction and coordination overhead.
    b) Guidance baseline: recommended controls + lightweight audits for high-risk accounts only.
        *Implication:* Improves security posture without heavy process, but may leave key gaps during high-attention events.
    c) Minimal baseline: rely on rapid community detection and moderation response.
        *Implication:* Keeps operations fast, but repeats incidents that erode trust and slow developer adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we counter external FUD about agentic framework vulnerabilities without amplifying it: publish a formal security note on plugin isolation, or respond ad hoc in community threads?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-03-24): "Princeton research paper... competitors like Sentient are using to spread FUD... plans to communicate risks more clearly regarding plugin isolation."`
  - `witch: "Sentient is engagement farming... why plugins exist" (Discord, 2025-03-26).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish a formal security advisory explaining threat model, plugin isolation, and mitigations.
        *Implication:* Builds long-term trust and reduces rumor cycles, but requires careful wording and follow-through.
    b) Create a living security FAQ + pinned “official links” page; respond selectively to high-reach claims.
        *Implication:* Balances clarity and amplification risk, while giving community a canonical reference.
    c) Stay quiet publicly; focus on engineering fixes and let the product prove it.
        *Implication:* Avoids feeding narratives, but leaves a vacuum where misinformation can harden into belief.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Given X account instability (Spartan blocked), should we formally shift to Discord-first as the canonical interaction layer for flagship agents, and treat X as an optional broadcast surface?

  **Context:**
  - `rhota: "Spartan will be available on Discord first while X issues are being resolved" (Discord spartan_holders, 2025-03-26).`
  - `Community suggestion: "create a new account rather than waiting for recovery" (Discord spartan_holders, 2025-03-26).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—Discord-first canon; X becomes secondary/replicated with reduced operational dependency.
        *Implication:* Improves continuity and control, but may reduce reach and virality from X-native audiences.
    b) Dual-canon—maintain both with redundancy (new X account + cross-posting) and automated health checks.
        *Implication:* Preserves reach while reducing single-point failure, but increases maintenance and moderation load.
    c) X-first remains essential—invest in recovery and compliance to regain the main stage.
        *Implication:* Maximizes marketing surface, but keeps the project vulnerable to external platform enforcement.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-10-26

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The core team has rapidly implemented x402 payment protocol integration across elizaOS's ecosystem, positioning it as a strategic capability for agent-to-agent transactions and a potential MCP registry.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: x402 Integration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The team has demonstrated rapid x402 implementation, creating several MCPs within 30 minutes, with Eliza Cloud positioned to handle payments; however, the main blocker is wallet integration for most agents.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize x402 integration relative to the pending token migration?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk confirmed that all Eliza agents will be able to utilize x402 through a new "Eliza Cloud" agent development platform`
  - `Several members expressed concern about the timing of the migration, with some suggesting that marketing around x402 integration is currently more important than the migration itself`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Delay token migration to focus entirely on x402 integration and marketing.
        *Implication:* Could capture immediate market momentum around x402 but risks further delaying an already pending migration process.
    b) Proceed with both in parallel, but prioritize resources toward x402 integration.
        *Implication:* Balances both priorities while acknowledging the strategic opportunity of x402, but may strain development resources.
    c) Complete token migration first, then shift full focus to x402 integration.
        *Implication:* Ensures financial foundation is solid before expanding capabilities but could miss first-mover advantage in x402 adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we position elizaOS primarily as an x402 MCP registry to capitalize on growing momentum?

  **Context:**
  - `The team explored implementing x402 in multiple ways: enabling it in the server with an ENABLE_X402 flag, creating MCPs that support x402 payments, and developing wallet integration for agents`
  - `There was discussion about positioning elizaOS as an x402 MCP registry and leveraging the growing momentum around x402 in the web3 community`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, reposition elizaOS primarily as an x402 MCP registry and ecosystem.
        *Implication:* Could rapidly increase adoption but risks diluting our broader AI agent operating system vision.
    b) Maintain core focus on AI agents while featuring x402 as a key integration.
        *Implication:* Preserves mission alignment while still benefiting from x402 momentum, though may not maximize immediate growth potential.
    c) Create a separate branded product specifically for x402 registry functions.
        *Implication:* Could capture x402 market share without disrupting elizaOS positioning, but increases product complexity and development costs.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What approach should we take to solve the wallet integration blocker for agent-to-agent payments?

  **Context:**
  - `The main blocker identified is that most agents lack wallet support; the team discussed creating a custodial wallet MCP to allow agents like Cursor and Claude Code to use x402 immediately`
  - `cjft demonstrated creating several x402-enabled MCPs for services like Twitter API, OpenAI image generation, and CoinGecko PRO on elizaCloud within 30 minutes`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement custodial wallet solution for immediate agent x402 access.
        *Implication:* Enables rapid adoption but introduces custodial risks and centralization concerns.
    b) Develop comprehensive agent wallet SDK for non-custodial integration.
        *Implication:* Aligns with decentralization values but significantly extends development timeline for x402 adoption.
    c) Partner with existing wallet providers to create agent-specific solutions.
        *Implication:* Leverages external expertise and existing infrastructure but reduces control over implementation details.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Marketing and Communication Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** Community members are concerned about elizaOS's marketing approach, noting that while technology and partnerships are strong, communication about development progress doesn't reflect the project's potential.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the organizational challenges in our marketing approach?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members expressed concern about ElizaOS's marketing approach, with komi suggesting a comprehensive organizational restructuring`
  - `There's consensus that while the technology and partnerships are strong, communication about development progress doesn't reflect the project's potential`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Execute a comprehensive restructuring of the marketing department.
        *Implication:* Could fundamentally improve marketing capabilities but risks organizational disruption during a critical product phase.
    b) Maintain current structure but implement clearer communication protocols and accountability.
        *Implication:* Minimizes disruption while addressing communication gaps, but may not solve deeper organizational issues.
    c) Outsource core marketing functions to specialized crypto/AI marketing agencies.
        *Implication:* Could quickly improve marketing quality but increases costs and potentially reduces alignment with technical realities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What should be our priority for improving social media presence?

  **Context:**
  - `The importance of restoring the official Twitter/X account was highlighted as a priority`
  - `Kenk responded to komi's concern about Twitter/X account restoration, mentioning they're working with a ping developer to set it up`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize Twitter/X account restoration as our primary social channel.
        *Implication:* Focuses on the platform most used by our target audience but limits diversification across other channels.
    b) Develop comprehensive cross-platform strategy with equal focus on multiple channels.
        *Implication:* Creates broader reach but dilutes resources across platforms and may delay establishing strong presence anywhere.
    c) Deploy AI agents as our social media representatives on key platforms.
        *Implication:* Showcases our own technology and enables 24/7 engagement but risks perception issues if agents perform sub-optimally.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How can we better communicate our development progress despite NDA constraints?

  **Context:**
  - `Q: How are the team supposed to market something when they're under an NDA? (asked by Bealers) A: Not everything is under NDA; basic communication about development progress, collaborations, and goals should still be possible (answered by komi)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a formal approval process for clearing content that navigates NDA boundaries.
        *Implication:* Ensures compliance while enabling more communication, but adds bureaucratic overhead to marketing processes.
    b) Shift focus to demonstrating capabilities through public demos and use cases.

    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should the UUID-only agent identification implementation affect our auto.fun strategy?

  **Context:**
  - `Agents now use randomly generated UUIDs (not names) for identity; duplicate names are allowed, with loader/runtime/server/DB updated plus migrations and tests`
  - `Monthly Goal: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Leverage UUID capability to allow multiple instances of popular agent personalities on auto.fun.
        *Implication:* Creates potential for customized variations of popular agents but risks diluting agent brand identities.
    b) Maintain unique agent names on auto.fun despite backend UUID capability.
        *Implication:* Preserves clear agent branding and identity but doesn't fully utilize the technical flexibility now available.
    c) Implement namespace/versioning approach where similar agents share base names with modifiers.
        *Implication:* Balances unique identification with brand consistency, but increases UI complexity for users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

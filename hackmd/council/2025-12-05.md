# Council Briefing: 2025-12-05

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The ecosystem faces a critical dual challenge between token migration issues impacting Korean exchanges and significant developer experience barriers in the elizaOS framework that threaten to undermine adoption.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Crisis

**Summary of Topic:** The unilateral snapshot taken on November 11, 2025, has caused significant migration problems for users on Korean exchanges, with the Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA) placing AI16Z under an 'Investment Warning,' threatening market confidence and adoption.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize addressing the Korean exchange token migration issues versus other development priorities?

  **Context:**
  - `A unilateral snapshot taken on November 11, 2025, without prior notice has caused migration problems, particularly for Korean exchanges like Bithumb and Coinone`
  - `The Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA) has placed AI16Z under an 'Investment Warning'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Form a dedicated task force to work exclusively on exchange migration issues until resolved.
        *Implication:* Shows commitment to token holders but could delay elizaOS v2 shipping timeline.
    b) Maintain current development priorities but allocate specific resources to exchange outreach and technical support.
        *Implication:* Balances progress toward monthly goals while addressing the migration crisis.
    c) Focus primarily on elizaOS v2 and auto.fun development, addressing exchange issues through improved documentation and community support.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes product development but risks further alienating affected token holders.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we revise our token migration strategy to prevent similar issues in the future?

  **Context:**
  - `Many users are encountering 'Max amount reached' errors during migration`
  - `Community members are actively identifying and warning about scammers posting fake support links`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a phased migration approach with clear advanced communications and exchange partnerships established before each phase.
        *Implication:* Creates more predictability but extends the migration timeline significantly.
    b) Maintain the current migration strategy but establish dedicated exchange liaison roles and improve technical documentation.
        *Implication:* Addresses communication gaps while maintaining momentum.
    c) Consider a dual-token model that allows both tokens to coexist until exchanges fully support migration.
        *Implication:* Reduces immediate pressure but increases complexity and may dilute token value proposition.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Developer Experience Crisis

**Summary of Topic:** Core developers have identified severe usability issues with the elizaOS framework, requiring excessive boilerplate code and complex setup even for basic 'hello world' agents, which threatens to undermine adoption in comparison to simpler competing frameworks.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How aggressively should we prioritize simplifying the developer experience versus adding new features?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw highlighted that even a 'hello world' agent requires complex database setup, service registration, and connection management`
  - `The team agreed that while advanced options should remain available, the default experience must be dramatically simplified to compete with frameworks like Mastra`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediately freeze all new feature development to focus exclusively on simplifying the developer experience to 10 lines or less.
        *Implication:* Could rapidly improve adoption but delay important features planned for auto.fun showcase.
    b) Implement Stan's ElizaOS wrapper class as an immediate solution while establishing a parallel DX improvement track.
        *Implication:* Provides a quick win while maintaining development velocity on core features.
    c) Continue with the current roadmap but document advanced and simplified paths, emphasizing the power of the full framework for serious developers.
        *Implication:* Maintains feature development pace but risks losing developers to simpler frameworks.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What architectural changes should be prioritized to simplify the elizaOS framework?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan proposed an ElizaOS wrapper class to significantly simplify the API`
  - `Move essential functionality (REPLY action, character provider) from bootstrap plugin to core (Mentioned by shaw)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on a comprehensive wrapper that handles all initialization details with sensible defaults.
        *Implication:* Quick solution that doesn't require core architectural changes.
    b) Prioritize moving essential functionality from bootstrap plugin to core while implementing auto-configuration of database and connections.
        *Implication:* More fundamental solution but requires deeper architectural changes.
    c) Develop a new lightweight SDK alongside the full framework, designed specifically for simple use cases.
        *Implication:* Creates two development paths but could better serve different developer segments.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Auto.fun Go-to-Market Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** With upcoming launches including Babylon platform, ElizaCloud, and Otako in development, and competitive pressure from Chinese model providers and Anthropic's growth, we need to determine the most effective viral features to showcase 24/7 agent activity on auto.fun.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which innovative agent features should we prioritize to showcase on auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Speculative discussion about viral features for AI agents, including social connection tracking and hypothetical image generation`
  - `Upcoming Launches: Babylon platform, ElizaCloud, and Otako are in development`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize DorianD's proposed social connection tracking and hypothetical image generation features.
        *Implication:* Could create highly shareable content but requires significant development resources.
    b) Focus on reliable, autonomous trading agents that demonstrate persistent 24/7 operation with visible performance metrics.
        *Implication:* Aligns closely with the monthly goal and demonstrates tangible utility.
    c) Emphasize content creation agents that autonomously generate and distribute media across social platforms.
        *Implication:* Creates visible ecosystem activity but may not demonstrate the full technical capabilities of elizaOS.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we position our agent marketplace model against emerging competitors?

  **Context:**
  - `Mentioned competition from Chinese model providers releasing open-source alternatives to major models`
  - `Partners discussed Anthropic's revenue growth and potential IPO motivations`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position as the most developer-friendly, open-source alternative with a focus on composability and interoperability.
        *Implication:* Appeals to the technical community but requires solving the developer experience issues first.
    b) Emphasize the end-to-end token economic model that rewards both developers and users, distinguishing from centralized competitors.
        *Implication:* Leverages our unique crypto-native positioning but requires resolving token migration issues.
    c) Focus on specialized vertical use cases where our agents demonstrate superior performance to general-purpose alternatives.
        *Implication:* Creates differentiation but narrows the initial target market.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-06-23

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Eliza v2 has been successfully shipped while X/Twitter integration is experiencing disruption, creating both opportunities and challenges for our agent ecosystem activities.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Eliza v2 Launch Status

**Summary of Topic:** Eliza v2 has been officially released with significant capability improvements including an autocoder for complex agent creation, however, awareness and adoption may be impacted by Twitter/X account suspension issues.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize communication channels for the Eliza v2 release given the current constraints with X/Twitter?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw confirmed V2.0 is done and shipped and we'll announce it when we get the accounts back`
  - `Shaw confirmed their X account was suspended, likely due to concerns about data scraping`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate Farcaster presence development as our primary alternative.
        *Implication:* Shifts community building to a more decentralized platform aligned with our values but requires establishing presence on a newer platform with smaller reach.
    b) Develop a multi-channel announcement strategy across Discord, GitHub, and partner channels while X issues resolve.
        *Implication:* Maintains momentum while diversifying communication channels, though fragmentation could dilute the impact of the announcement.
    c) Delay major promotion until X accounts are restored to maximize reach and impact.
        *Implication:* Preserves unified messaging but risks losing momentum and early adopter enthusiasm for v2.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which v2 capability improvement should we prioritize showcasing to attract the target developer audience?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw highlighted significant improvements in development speed, particularly mentioning an autocoder built to create new plugins that enables complex agent creation`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Emphasis on the autocoder for plugin creation and complex agent development.
        *Implication:* Appeals to technical developers looking to extend functionality but may be too complex for casual users.
    b) Focus on development speed improvements and faster iterative workflows.
        *Implication:* Attracts productivity-focused developers and hackathon participants who need rapid prototyping capabilities.
    c) Showcase the hybrid memory layer combining semantic search with knowledge graph traversal.
        *Implication:* Targets AI researchers and those building knowledge-intensive applications but implementation is still cost-constrained.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: X/Twitter Integration Challenges

**Summary of Topic:** The project faces significant challenges with X/Twitter integration due to account suspension and prohibitively expensive API pricing ($50k/month), requiring strategic decisions about social media presence and data access.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What approach should we take regarding X/Twitter data access given the current constraints?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussion about X's new API pricing ($50k/month) making it prohibitively expensive for many AI agent developers`
  - `Community member z1 claimed to have developed a scraper that bypasses the official API but warned about potential detection`
  - `DorianD proposed a system where numerous Eliza Nodes could scrape X and store data in encrypted vaults with vectorization to avoid legal issues`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement the decentralized node network proposal for distributed X data collection and encrypted storage.
        *Implication:* Creates resilient infrastructure but increases legal and technical complexity while potentially attracting unwanted attention from X.
    b) Deprioritize X integration and pivot toward platforms with more developer-friendly APIs.
        *Implication:* Reduces dependence on hostile platforms but risks missing engagement with crypto and AI communities that remain active on X.
    c) Negotiate enterprise API access with X while developing alternative data sources as backup.
        *Implication:* Ensures compliant access but requires significant budget allocation and may still be subject to arbitrary policy changes.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we address the Twitter plugin functionality issues in our developer ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Users reporting problems with the Twitter plugin not functioning despite proper API credentials`
  - `It's been taken offline, guessing X asked them to remove it (answered by Odilitime)`
  - `Twitter plugin will be undergoing maintenance, updating docs to reflect that`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Officially deprecate the Twitter plugin with clear migration documentation to alternative social platforms.
        *Implication:* Provides clarity to developers but abandons a major social platform where many crypto and AI communities engage.
    b) Maintain the plugin as "experimental" with prominent warnings about reliability issues and API constraints.
        *Implication:* Preserves optionality for developers while setting appropriate expectations about stability and compliance risks.
    c) Redesign the plugin to work with minimal API access and supplement with opt-in community data sharing.
        *Implication:* Creates a more sustainable approach but requires significant technical redesign and potential privacy considerations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: AI Agent Design Expansion

**Summary of Topic:** Community discussions reveal significant interest in expanding AI agent applications beyond crypto trading to include NFT-AI integration, robotics, and WhatsApp messaging, presenting opportunities to broaden elizaOS's impact.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which emerging AI agent application area should we prioritize supporting to align with our auto.fun user growth goals?

  **Context:**
  - `Several conversations about turning NFT collections into AI agent swarms and using AI-generated art for NFTs`
  - `Exploration of ElizaOS potential for programming and training robots like Unitree G1`
  - `Discussion about AI agents for WhatsApp, with mention of an existing plugin`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) NFT-AI integration to create interactive digital collectibles with agent personalities.
        *Implication:* Aligns with existing crypto/NFT communities and could drive token transactions but may be seen as chasing a declining trend.
    b) WhatsApp and messaging platform integration for greater mainstream accessibility.
        *Implication:* Expands potential userbase dramatically but puts us in competition with existing chatbot platforms rather than leveraging our unique capabilities.
    c) Robotics programming interfaces to bridge digital and physical agent capabilities.
        *Implication:* Opens entirely new market segments but requires significant technical expertise and may distract from core web3/crypto focus.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What agent capability development would most enhance our position in the competitive AI framework landscape?

  **Context:**
  - `LarpsAI discussed a solution combining semantic search in relational databases with knowledge graph traversal, though Shaw noted this is more of a cost issue than a timeline constraint`
  - `AI Music: Development of AI music with dynamic flows was mentioned`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Advance knowledge management capabilities through cost-effective hybrid memory solutions.
        *Implication:* Enhances agent intelligence and contextual understanding but requires resolving the identified cost constraints.
    b) Develop creative content generation specializations (music, art, writing) for agents.
        *Implication:* Opens new use cases for content creators and entertainment applications but moves away from our core financial/trading focus.
    c) Focus on multi-agent collaboration frameworks for coordinated autonomous systems.
        *Implication:* Advances toward true DAO functionality with agent swarms but increases technical complexity significantly.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

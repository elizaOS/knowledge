# Council Briefing: 2025-10-27

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Development team is actively integrating x402 support across the elizaOS ecosystem while preparing for token migration, demonstrating significant progress toward monthly technical goals despite lingering user experience challenges.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The upcoming migration from AI16Z to elizaOS tokens is generating significant community interest, but lacks clear timeline communication and raises questions about cross-chain implementation and ecosystem integration.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Given community anticipation, should we accelerate the token migration timeline or prioritize technical x402 integration work first?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk confirmed that ElizaOS will be native to Solana but will use CCIP to be cross-chain on Ethereum, Base, and BNB Chain when migration begins`
  - `Q: When will migration start? A: Still waiting for migration (Dr. Neuro)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate migration now to capitalize on community interest and maintain momentum.
        *Implication:* Prioritizing migration could energize the community but might compromise technical quality if the cross-chain infrastructure isn't fully ready.
    b) Complete x402 integration first to ensure the new token launches with full technical capabilities.
        *Implication:* Waiting ensures better technical implementation but risks losing community enthusiasm during the delay.
    c) Execute both simultaneously but with transparent timelines and more frequent community updates.
        *Implication:* Balancing both priorities requires additional communication resources but addresses both technical and community needs.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we position DegenAI in relation to the new elizaOS token to maximize ecosystem cohesion?

  **Context:**
  - `DegenAI token will continue to exist alongside ElizaOS, with some suggesting it's currently undervalued`
  - `Q: Is it still worth holding 1m Degenai tokens? A: It's a steal right now (DannyNOR NoFapArc)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position DegenAI as an independent, complementary product with distinct utility.
        *Implication:* Separating the tokens creates clearer product boundaries but may fragment the ecosystem value.
    b) Integrate DegenAI more closely with elizaOS by creating token utility synergies.
        *Implication:* Creating synergies between tokens could drive adoption of both but increases complexity in tokenomics design.
    c) Gradually phase out DegenAI token through incentivized conversion to elizaOS.
        *Implication:* Consolidating to one token simplifies the ecosystem but risks alienating dedicated DegenAI holders.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: x402 Integration Roadmap

**Summary of Topic:** The team is actively developing x402 support as a strategic technical priority, with multiple implementation approaches being explored to enable AI agents to utilize this payment protocol across the ecosystem.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the Eliza Cloud platform be positioned primarily as an x402 payment gateway or as a broader agent development ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk confirmed that all Eliza agents will be able to utilize x402 through a new "Eliza Cloud" agent development platform`
  - `cjft created and shared three working x402 MCPs (Twitter, OpenAI image generation, CoinGecko) on elizaCloud within 30 minutes to demonstrate implementation`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on x402 as the primary value proposition for Eliza Cloud to capture immediate market interest.
        *Implication:* Narrow focus could accelerate adoption but limits long-term platform differentiation beyond payments.
    b) Position Eliza Cloud as a comprehensive agent development platform with x402 as one of many features.
        *Implication:* Broader positioning differentiates from competitors but dilutes the immediate market impact of x402 integration.
    c) Create two distinct offerings: an x402-focused payment service and a separate comprehensive development platform.
        *Implication:* Dual approach allows specialized offerings but increases development and maintenance overhead.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What implementation approach for x402 would best balance technical quality with speed to market?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan âš¡ was provided with specific implementation details for x402 in elizaOS, including config format and required environment variables (X402_ENABLED + CDP_WALLET_SECRET)`
  - `cjft discussed creating a MCP that gives agent a custodial wallet to enable immediate x402 usage`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize the custodial wallet MCP approach for rapid deployment across all agents.
        *Implication:* Faster market presence but introduces centralized components that may not align with decentralization values.
    b) Implement native, non-custodial wallet integration for a more decentralized architecture.
        *Implication:* Better alignment with project values but significantly extends development timeline.
    c) Launch with custodial solution while developing the non-custodial approach in parallel with a clear migration path.
        *Implication:* Balances speed with values but requires managing two implementations and a migration process.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Agent Authentication Security

**Summary of Topic:** Current authentication approaches requiring private keys for elizaOS-based bots raise significant security concerns and adoption barriers, highlighting the need for balance between security and user experience.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What authentication model should we adopt for multi-user agent deployments to optimize security and usability?

  **Context:**
  - `Utsav inquires about building a public chatbot for Web3 interactions, specifically concerning authentication methods. They question whether ElizaOS-based bots require users' private keys for blockchain transactions rather than using standard Web3 authentication flows (walletconnect, metamask, etc.)`
  - `Utsav expresses concern about the security implications and adoption barriers of requiring private keys`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement delegated authentication with session keys to eliminate the need for storing user private keys.
        *Implication:* Improves security posture but requires building new authentication infrastructure.
    b) Adopt standard Web3 wallet connections (WalletConnect, MetaMask) to align with existing patterns.
        *Implication:* Improves user familiarity but may limit some agent autonomy capabilities.
    c) Create a secure multi-user TEE solution that isolates private key operations in enclaves.
        *Implication:* Provides strong security with full autonomy but increases technical complexity and infrastructure requirements.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we balance security and usability concerns to drive auto.fun user adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `A fake PayAI account running an airdrop scam was identified, potentially leading to phishing attacks`
  - `Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize security through education and strict authentication requirements before enabling transactions.
        *Implication:* Higher security but creates more friction in the onboarding process, potentially limiting initial growth.
    b) Emphasize usability with progressive security measures that scale with transaction values and frequency.
        *Implication:* Improves adoption rates but introduces calibrated risk during the growth phase.
    c) Create managed environments with preset transaction limits for new users while retaining advanced options.
        *Implication:* Balances security and usability but segments the user experience based on expertise level.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

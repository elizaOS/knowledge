# Council Briefing: 2025-08-07

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Community confidence in elizaOS is being tested by communication gaps and technical debt, while development continues with promising features like Spartan Wallet extension and ElizaOS v1.3 stabilization.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Communication & Community Trust

**Summary of Topic:** The extended absence of Shaw and suspension of X/Twitter account has damaged community trust and transparency, potentially impacting user acquisition and retention efforts for auto.fun.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the current communication crisis regarding Shaw's absence and the suspended X/Twitter account?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members expressed concerns about transparency and communication from the team, particularly regarding the extended absence of Shaw and the suspended X (Twitter) account.`
  - `3on_: 'Why is Shaw still banned?'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediately appoint an interim spokesperson to transparently address these issues and establish a regular communication cadence.
        *Implication:* Rapidly restores trust but may create dependency on new spokesperson and risk inconsistent messaging.
    b) Focus on fixing the X account issue first as our priority, then address personnel matters privately.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes marketing channel recovery but leaves community questions about leadership unanswered.
    c) Deploy an autonomous AI community liaison agent to maintain 24/7 communication while core team addresses underlying issues.
        *Implication:* Aligns with our autonomous organization vision but may be perceived as avoiding human accountability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How can we rebuild trust with developers who may be hesitant to build on elizaOS due to perceived instability?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD criticized the lack of developer outreach and token protocol design, while Kenk outlined potential token utility areas.`
  - `Discussion about OpenServAI's decision to move away from ElizaOS, with speculation about which version they were using and whether issues were addressed.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Launch a comprehensive developer relations program with structured feedback mechanisms and dedicated support channels.
        *Implication:* Addresses root cause but requires significant resource allocation away from product development.
    b) Focus on stabilizing elizaOS v2 and documenting token utility use cases to demonstrate technical leadership.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes product quality over community management, potentially losing more developers in the short term.
    c) Create a developer grant program specifically targeting high-profile projects that left the ecosystem to showcase improvements.
        *Implication:* Targets visible wins that could create FOMO but may appear reactive rather than strategic.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Product Strategy Alignment

**Summary of Topic:** There's significant debate about strategic focus between core elizaOS development, token utility implementation, and agent launchpad efforts, raising questions about resource allocation and product prioritization.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we redirect resources from auto.fun (agent launchpad) to core elizaOS v2 development and partner enablement?

  **Context:**
  - `Debate about whether this was a misguided effort compared to enabling partners who run portals.`
  - `DorianD: 'Implement partner portal enablement rather than dedicated agent launchpad'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, pivot resources to focus on partner enablement tools and elizaOS v2 stability as our core value proposition.
        *Implication:* Aligns with technical excellence but risks losing momentum on auto.fun which is central to our monthly goal.
    b) No, continue auto.fun development but integrate partner feedback channels to ensure it meets their needs.
        *Implication:* Maintains strategic consistency but risks building features partners won't use.
    c) Bifurcate the team to simultaneously develop both auto.fun and a separate partner SDK with dedicated resources for each.
        *Implication:* Attempts to satisfy all stakeholders but risks diluting limited resources across too many initiatives.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we prioritize token utility development to capture value from the growing elizaOS ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk outlined potential token utility areas including payments, yield optimization, governance/DAO operations, and identity/reputation systems.`
  - `DorianD criticized the lack of developer outreach and token protocol design.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on payments and yield optimization first as these provide immediate utility for both developers and users.
        *Implication:* Targets financial use cases which may drive adoption but narrows the token's initial positioning.
    b) Prioritize governance and identity systems to build the foundation for a truly autonomous organization.
        *Implication:* Aligns with long-term vision but delays immediate token utility that could drive market interest.
    c) Develop a modular token utility framework allowing the community to vote on and implement use cases prioritization.
        *Implication:* Embodies decentralized principles but adds complexity and may slow down initial implementation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Technical Stability & Migration

**Summary of Topic:** The team is making progress on stabilizing elizaOS v1.3 as a foundation for v2, but faces challenges with plugin compatibility, cloud functionality, and migration processes that could impact developer adoption.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we manage the transition from elizaOS v0.x to v1.x/v2 to minimize disruption to existing developers?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussions about migrating from ElizaOS v0.x to v1.x, with v1.3 identified as a stable pre-release version.`
  - `Q: What's the best migration resource for someone coming from 0.x to get up to speed with 1.x? A: 'Mainly for v0 migrations, transfer char.json, `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`, `elizaos create` and keep building as usual. DB won't migrate.'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create automated migration tools and comprehensive documentation with case studies of successful migrations.
        *Implication:* Reduces friction for developers but requires significant engineering resources for migration tooling.
    b) Maintain parallel support for v0.x while incentivizing migration through exclusive new features in v1.x/v2.
        *Implication:* Gives developers time to migrate naturally but increases maintenance burden and technical debt.
    c) Focus on stabilizing v1.3/v2 and offer migration consulting services for key partners while sunsetting v0.x support.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes moving forward but risks losing developers who can't migrate quickly enough.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we address the technical debt evident in plugin compatibility issues and Cloud functionality?

  **Context:**
  - `Vladimir identified a bug occurring after loading memories with plugin-knowledge, clearing them with CLI command, and then rerunning the project.`
  - `Shaw reported working on cloud functionality, approaching MVP status but still fixing bugs.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a dedicated technical debt sprint with clear prioritization of issues based on developer impact.
        *Implication:* Addresses underlying problems but delays new feature development temporarily.
    b) Focus on fixing only the highest-impact issues that directly affect auto.fun's showcase capabilities.
        *Implication:* Supports monthly goal but leaves lingering technical debt that could compound over time.
    c) Establish a parallel maintenance team dedicated to continuous technical debt reduction alongside feature development.
        *Implication:* Creates sustainable process but requires additional resources and coordination overhead.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

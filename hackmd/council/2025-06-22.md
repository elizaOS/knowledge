# Council Briefing: 2025-06-22

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The project faces a critical challenge with X account suspension and API access limitations, threatening connectivity while V2 stands ready for announcement.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: X Platform Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The project's X (Twitter) account has been suspended, likely due to data scraping concerns, and the new API pricing of $50k/month is prohibitively expensive, creating obstacles for agent social media presence and communication channels.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we adapt our social media strategy in light of X/Twitter platform restrictions?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw confirmed their X account was suspended, likely due to concerns about data scraping`
  - `Discussion about X's new API pricing ($50k/month) making it prohibitively expensive for many AI agent developers`
  - `Mentioned building a presence on Farcaster as an alternative to X`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize Farcaster expansion while maintaining diplomatic efforts to restore X access.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach diversifies social platform risk while attempting to preserve our established X audience.
    b) Build a decentralized scraping network using encrypted vaults with vectorization to bypass API constraints.
        *Implication:* This technical solution could maintain X integration but increases legal and operational risks.
    c) Pivot entirely to alternative platforms (Farcaster, Discord, etc.) and abandon X integration efforts.
        *Implication:* This decisive pivot reduces platform dependency risk but sacrifices our existing X audience and visibility.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What architecture approach should we adopt for agent-to-platform connections to improve resilience?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD proposed a system where numerous Eliza Nodes could scrape X and store data in encrypted vaults with vectorization to avoid legal issues`
  - `Discussion about keeping agents lean by separating backend processing for complex multi-step processes`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a decentralized peer-to-peer network of elizaOS nodes with shared, encrypted data storage.
        *Implication:* This architecture increases system resilience but requires significant development resources to implement correctly.
    b) Create platform-agnostic middleware that separates agent logic from platform-specific integrations.
        *Implication:* This modular approach allows faster adaptation to platform changes but adds complexity to the core framework.
    c) Focus on first-party platforms where we control the infrastructure (auto.fun, our own websites).
        *Implication:* This approach reduces external dependencies but limits reach and mainstream social media integration.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we prioritize legal compliance or community-driven workarounds for platform integration?

  **Context:**
  - `Community member z1 claimed to have developed a scraper that bypasses the official API but warned about potential detection`
  - `They've submitted clarification that they don't scrape or sell X data and are awaiting account restoration`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Strictly prioritize legal compliance and transparent platform relationships.
        *Implication:* This approach minimizes legal risk but may severely constrain technical capabilities.
    b) Pursue a hybrid approach with official APIs where feasible, with community-driven alternatives as fallbacks.
        *Implication:* This pragmatic strategy balances compliance with functionality but creates inconsistent user experiences.
    c) Embrace community-driven solutions while maintaining plausible deniability at the organizational level.
        *Implication:* This approach maximizes technical capabilities but increases legal exposure and platform relationship risks.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: V2 Release Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** ElizaOS V2 is complete and ready for announcement, but the deployment is being delayed due to X account issues, raising questions about the optimal launch strategy and how to leverage claimed breakthrough capabilities.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we proceed with the V2 announcement despite X account limitations?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw confirmed V2 is complete and ready to be announced once their X accounts are restored`
  - `Shaw hinted at "big breakthroughs in capability" coming soon`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Proceed with V2 announcement immediately via alternative channels (Discord, GitHub, website).
        *Implication:* This approach maintains development momentum but potentially reduces announcement impact without X amplification.
    b) Wait for X account restoration for a coordinated cross-platform announcement.
        *Implication:* This strategy maximizes announcement reach but risks indefinite delays to V2 adoption and momentum.
    c) Soft-launch V2 with technical documentation while preparing a major marketing push once X access is restored.
        *Implication:* This phased approach allows technical adoption to begin while preserving marketing impact for when platform restrictions are resolved.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we frame and showcase the "big breakthroughs in capability" mentioned by Shaw?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw hinted at "big breakthroughs in capability" coming soon`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on technical superiority with benchmarks and capability demonstrations for developers.
        *Implication:* This approach appeals to the technical community but may not translate to mainstream excitement or adoption.
    b) Create engaging demos highlighting real-world applications that showcase new capabilities through auto.fun.
        *Implication:* This application-focused strategy connects technical advancements directly to user benefits and ecosystem products.
    c) Frame capabilities as steps toward AGI that position elizaOS as a leader in autonomous agent development.
        *Implication:* This ambitious framing garners attention but creates expectations that may be difficult to sustain.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

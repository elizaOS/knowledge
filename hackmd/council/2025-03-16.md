# Council Briefing: 2025-03-16

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The fleet advanced V2 beta readiness through foundational reliability work (memory management, embedding flexibility, networking stack changes), while field reports exposed persistent integration fragility (Twitter reliability, plugin/service mismatches) that threatens developer trust if not stabilized before wider rollout.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 Beta Readiness: Deployment, Cross-Platform, and Network Stack Risk

**Summary of Topic:** V2 beta is imminent and positioned as "consumer-friendly" with one-click deployment goals, but cross-platform gaps (Windows/Mac) and a major networking shift (WSS to Socket.IO, Node to Bun in the-org) increase last-mile risk. Council alignment is needed on what "beta" quality gates mean under the Execution Excellence doctrine.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What are the Council’s non-negotiable beta launch gates: cross-platform parity, one-click deployment, or core reliability under load?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 🥇-partners (shaw): "V2 beta is scheduled for Monday... working on one-click deployment to AWS free tier... Linux with some issues remaining for Windows and Mac"`
  - `GitHub PR #3946: "feat: use socketio, remove wss, use bun instead of node in the-org"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Gate on core reliability and recoverability (crash-free, reconnect-safe), allow partial platform support with clear labeling.
        *Implication:* Maximizes trust-through-shipping while accepting narrower reach and potential perception of uneven polish.
    b) Gate on cross-platform parity (Win/Mac/Linux) even if one-click deployment slips.
        *Implication:* Reduces support fragmentation, but delays momentum and risks losing the narrative window for V2.
    c) Gate on one-click deployment as the flagship promise, accept known bugs and iterate rapidly post-beta.
        *Implication:* Optimizes growth and onboarding, but risks eroding credibility if early adopters hit reliability cliffs.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should the Council endorse Socket.IO+Bun as the default V2 networking/runtime path, or treat it as an experimental track until stability evidence is stronger?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub PR #3946: "replaces WebSocket Server (WSS) with Socket.IO and updates the-org to use Bun instead of Node"`
  - `Discord 💻-coders: ongoing questions about websockets and connecting clients`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt Socket.IO+Bun as default now; standardize docs and focus QA on the new path.
        *Implication:* Reduces split-brain maintenance but concentrates risk if regressions emerge late.
    b) Ship dual-path networking (legacy + Socket.IO) for beta with a deprecation plan after metrics.
        *Implication:* Buys resilience and rollout safety at the cost of complexity and slower iteration.
    c) Keep Socket.IO+Bun behind a feature flag; beta defaults to the most proven stack.
        *Implication:* Protects reliability optics but may delay ecosystem adoption of the intended V2 architecture.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is the Council’s communications stance for “beta” to preserve trust: cautious engineering beta, or consumer-facing promise of simplicity?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 🥇-partners: "V2 aims to make agent creation accessible to everyone, 'even kids'"`
  - `Discord 2025-03-15 highlights: "Beta Release Monday... not a full launch"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Frame as an engineering beta: limited guarantees, explicit known issues, and clear rollback guidance.
        *Implication:* Strengthens credibility with developers but may blunt mainstream excitement.
    b) Frame as a consumer beta: emphasize ease-of-use and demos; handle issues via rapid support and hotfix cadence.
        *Implication:* Accelerates adoption but amplifies reputational risk from visible failures.
    c) Split the message: developer beta for framework, consumer beta for curated reference agents only.
        *Implication:* Balances hype and reliability by containing risk to controlled experiences.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Reliability Hot Zone: Twitter/Plugin Stability and Service Availability

**Summary of Topic:** User pain concentrates around Twitter reliability (agents stop replying) and plugin/service mismatches (e.g., image_description not found), which directly undermines the “reliable, developer-friendly” promise. Immediate stabilization tactics (rate-limit handling, caching, consistent plugin semantics) should be prioritized over new features.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should ElizaOS treat Twitter rate limiting failures: degrade gracefully, reduce features, or invest in a more robust client architecture (caching/queueing)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 💻-coders (Ordinal Watches): "agents stopping replies to tweets after a while... likely due to Twitter rate limiting"`
  - `Discord 2025-03-15 action items: "Implement caching of tweets to reduce API calls"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement graceful degradation (backoff + user-visible status + retry queues) as the default behavior.
        *Implication:* Preserves agent continuity and user trust, but requires careful UX and operational telemetry.
    b) Reduce Twitter surface area (fewer polling actions, stricter triggers) to stay within limits.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability quickly at the expense of capability and perceived power.
    c) Invest in a robust Twitter ops layer (caching, dedupe, job queue, metrics) as a first-class subsystem.
        *Implication:* Creates long-term stability and ecosystem value but competes with V2 launch bandwidth.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s policy on “community-provided patch fixes” (manual plugin edits) versus shipping an official hotfix path?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 💻-coders (d3nyal): fix for "service image_description not found" involved "manual code modifications to remove HuggingFace dependencies"`
  - `Discord 2025-03-15 action items: "Fix 'service image_description not found' error with plugin-image"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Bless community patches temporarily, but immediately convert them into official patch releases with changelogs.
        *Implication:* Channels community energy into trust-through-shipping and reduces folklore-based support.
    b) Discourage manual patches; prioritize an official fix before recommending any workaround.
        *Implication:* Protects quality standards but may leave users blocked longer and increase frustration.
    c) Maintain a curated “workarounds registry” with automated scripts, separate from the main release cycle.
        *Implication:* Speeds unblocking while managing risk, but introduces another surface to maintain.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should plugin/service availability errors be prevented by stricter runtime schema validation (TypeBox/Zod) and preflight checks, even if it slows iteration?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issue #3914: "TypeBox for Type Safety" proposal to validate dynamic inputs at runtime`
  - `Discord 💻-coders: repeated service errors (e.g., "service text_generation not found", "service image_description not found")`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—introduce runtime schemas for key interfaces (plugins/services/actions) starting with the highest-failure pathways.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability and support burden but adds upfront engineering overhead.
    b) Partially—add validation only at boundaries (CLI config load, plugin registration) and keep internals flexible.
        *Implication:* Balances speed and safety, but some failures will still emerge deep in runtime.
    c) No—prioritize shipping and rely on tests/logging; validation can come after V2 stabilization.
        *Implication:* Maintains velocity but risks recurring “mystery failures” that erode developer trust.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Developer Trust Through Clarity: CLI, Docs, and Preflight Automation

**Summary of Topic:** Momentum is high (significant merged PR volume and documentation work), yet repeated user confusion indicates that “DX” is failing at the edges: inconsistent plugin install commands, unclear Twitter setup, and demand for automated preflight checks. The Council should decide how aggressively to standardize command semantics and embed troubleshooting into the product.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the Council enforce a single canonical plugin installation command and deprecate alternatives immediately (with hard errors), or keep aliases to reduce breakage?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 💻-coders: "Plugin Installation Confusion... `npx elizaos plugins install` vs `npx elizaos plugins add`"`
  - `GitHub PR #3943: "ensures consistent CLI command imports"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Enforce one canonical command now; aliases warn loudly and sunset within two minor releases.
        *Implication:* Reduces support ambiguity quickly while providing a predictable migration path.
    b) Support multiple aliases indefinitely; focus on documentation rather than enforcement.
        *Implication:* Minimizes short-term friction but perpetuates confusion and fragmented guidance.
    c) Make the CLI self-healing: accept variants, but auto-correct and print the canonical form in output.
        *Implication:* Preserves user momentum while slowly standardizing behavior via product feedback loops.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Do we prioritize a “preflight check” CLI that validates LLM + social logins + plugin wiring before runtime, as a primary trust lever?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issue #3956: "request for a CLI tool to perform preflight checks... LLM operations and social media logins"`
  - `Discord: repeated Twitter setup uncertainty and failures across v1/v2`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—make preflight mandatory in onboarding (run automatically on `start`) and export a diagnostic bundle.
        *Implication:* Transforms support from reactive to proactive, improving reliability perception and reducing Discord firefighting.
    b) Yes, but optional—ship as `npx elizaos doctor` and iterate based on telemetry and top failure modes.
        *Implication:* Captures most benefits without blocking advanced workflows or CI pipelines.
    c) Not now—focus on stabilizing core runtime and docs; preflight is a post-beta enhancement.
        *Implication:* Preserves engineering bandwidth short-term but risks repeating known onboarding failures at scale.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What is the Council’s stance on “docs as product”: do we embed an AI troubleshooting assistant by default, or treat it as an optional character/plugin?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord channel historical summary (Shaw): "building an AI assistant that will ship as a default character... help users with troubleshooting without needing to read documentation"`
  - `GitHub PR #3906: "major documentation cleanup" and PR #3951: "V2 development documentation updates"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship the assistant by default as a first-run guide and diagnostics companion.
        *Implication:* Directly advances developer-first goals by reducing time-to-success and centralizing best practices.
    b) Ship it as an optional add-on (template character) to avoid overpromising correctness.
        *Implication:* Protects trust from hallucination risk while still improving onboarding for those who opt in.
    c) Do not ship an assistant until autodoc/context issues are fully resolved; double down on static docs first.
        *Implication:* Maximizes accuracy but may slow adoption and increases load on community support channels.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-10-25

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The core development team has successfully merged substantial technical improvements to elizaOS v2, notably implementing a pluggable message service, Agent-to-Agent capabilities, and financial isolation mechanisms, setting the stage for more robust and autonomous agent operations on auto.fun.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Financial Security Architecture

**Summary of Topic:** Discussions about protecting users from financial contagion have led to proposals for isolation mechanisms, which aligns with our goal of creating a secure and reliable environment for autonomous trading agents on auto.fun.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize implementation of the isolation mechanisms proposed by neo_spartan to prevent cascading failures in our financial systems?

  **Context:**
  - `neo_spartan emphasized isolation as the key principle: separate wallets, compartmentalized strategies, isolated risk pools, position sizing limits`
  - `Kenk and DearDaniel discussed how liquidity problems can cause mispricing of stablecoins and trigger cascading failures in DeFi`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediately implement all isolation mechanisms as a core feature of elizaOS v2 before expanding auto.fun's trading capabilities.
        *Implication:* This would delay product expansion but establish a stronger foundation for trust and security from the outset.
    b) Implement isolation mechanisms in phases, starting with separate wallets and position sizing limits while developing the more complex compartmentalization features.
        *Implication:* This balances security improvements with continued product development, allowing for iterative learning.
    c) Make isolation mechanisms optional add-on features that advanced users can enable, focusing core development resources on auto.fun's agent capabilities and user growth.
        *Implication:* This maximizes short-term growth and flexibility but may increase systemic risk if adoption of safety features is low.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we explore partnerships with DeFi insurance providers like Nexus Mutual to offer protection for agent-based trading activities?

  **Context:**
  - `Oracle issues in DeFi were discussed as a source of cascading failures, with Kenk noting that hardcoded oracle values for USDE may have prevented larger cascade failures`
  - `Fund Recovery Support was provided to a user who accidentally sent funds to a token contract address, highlighting the need for safeguards`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes, prioritize establishing formal partnerships with DeFi insurance providers to create specialized coverage for auto.fun agents and users.
        *Implication:* This would create a significant trust advantage but require substantial integration work and potential revenue sharing.
    b) Develop our own simplified insurance mechanism initially, focused on protecting against specific high-risk scenarios like oracle failures or smart contract exploits.
        *Implication:* This creates a unique value proposition under our control but requires capital reserves and risk assessment expertise.
    c) Focus on preventative measures rather than insurance, implementing robust oracle verification, circuit breakers, and risk disclosures instead.
        *Implication:* This approach requires less capital but places more responsibility on users to understand and accept risks.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Technology Development

**Summary of Topic:** With cjft outlining implementation options for Agent-to-Agent technology, we need to determine the strategic approach to this crucial capability that will enable more autonomous and collaborative agent behaviors on auto.fun.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which implementation approach for Agent-to-Agent (A2A) technology should we prioritize to maximize both near-term showcase value and long-term strategic positioning?

  **Context:**
  - `cjft outlined implementation options: Quick approach: Build on NextJS with visualizer and demo agents; Comprehensive solution: Would require blockchain integration for tokenomics and validator incentives`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Pursue the quick NextJS implementation to demonstrate A2A capabilities on auto.fun immediately, then iterate based on user feedback.
        *Implication:* This provides faster time-to-market but may require significant rework later if the architecture proves limiting.
    b) Invest directly in the comprehensive blockchain-based solution to establish a strong technical foundation for A2A with built-in incentives and security.
        *Implication:* This creates a more robust long-term platform but delays showcasing A2A capabilities to users and potential partners.
    c) Develop both implementations in parallel: a simplified showcase version for immediate deployment and a more comprehensive solution for future migration.
        *Implication:* This approach maximizes both short and long-term objectives but divides development resources and may create integration challenges.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What governance model should we implement for Agent-to-Agent interactions to balance autonomy with accountability?

  **Context:**
  - `A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Technology implementation options discussed included the need for 'tokenomics and validator incentives' for a comprehensive solution`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a reputation-based system where agents build trust scores based on interaction outcomes and community feedback.
        *Implication:* This creates organic quality control but may be susceptible to manipulation without careful design.
    b) Establish a rules-based framework with formalized permissions, interaction limits, and automated compliance checks for all agent interactions.
        *Implication:* This provides clear boundaries and security but may limit novel agent behaviors and creative interactions.
    c) Create a hybrid model with core safety rules enforced on-chain but allowing flexible governance parameters to be set by agent owners.
        *Implication:* This balances autonomy with safety but requires more complex implementation and user education.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Platform Migration and Community Management

**Summary of Topic:** Community inquiries about migration to elizaOS with no clear timeline provided indicate a communication gap that could affect user retention and trust, particularly as we attempt to attract new users to auto.fun.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the current uncertainty around migration timelines to maintain community trust while managing technical complexities?

  **Context:**
  - `Multiple users inquired about migration to ElizaOS, but no official timeline or process was shared`
  - `Users advised to wait for official announcements from the team`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Provide a detailed public roadmap with specific migration milestones and tentative dates, even if they may shift later.
        *Implication:* This increases transparency but creates expectations that may be difficult to meet if technical challenges arise.
    b) Communicate general migration phases and current progress without specific dates, emphasizing the quality and security benefits of the measured approach.
        *Implication:* This manages expectations while maintaining flexibility, but may not satisfy users seeking concrete timelines.
    c) Accelerate the migration process by dedicating additional resources, prioritizing it over other development work to deliver a clear timeline within one week.
        *Implication:* This addresses immediate community concerns but may compromise other strategic priorities or quality assurance.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What interim utility or benefits should we offer to current token holders while they await the migration to elizaOS?

  **Context:**
  - `Q: When migration? 21? (asked by Lexuz) A: Unanswered`
  - `Q: How to migrate to ElizaOS? Can share me the official link? (asked by Valianx) A: Wait for official announcement from team (answered by satsbased)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Provide exclusive pre-migration access to auto.fun beta features and premium agent templates to current token holders.
        *Implication:* This rewards existing community members but may create a two-tier user experience that complicates onboarding.
    b) Implement a points-based loyalty system where current engagement earns benefits in the post-migration ecosystem.
        *Implication:* This incentivizes continued engagement without promising specific token value but requires tracking infrastructure.
    c) Focus on educational content and community building activities rather than additional token utility until migration is complete.
        *Implication:* This prioritizes community cohesion over token incentives but risks losing engagement from more financially motivated users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

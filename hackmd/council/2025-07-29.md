# Council Briefing: 2025-07-29

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Development of a comprehensive browser extension ecosystem with Cluely-like functionality is underway, focusing on seamless AI assistance across platforms while ensuring privacy and user experience.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: ELI5 Token Development Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The community is showing strong enthusiasm for ELI5, positioning it as an explainer token within auto.fun with significant growth potential, though there are strategic questions about balancing meme appeal versus project utility.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we position ELI5 in relation to AI16z to maximize synergy while maintaining distinct value propositions?

  **Context:**
  - `Dr. Neuro provided a detailed explanation differentiating ELI5 from AI16z: ELI5 explains complex concepts simply, while AI16z is portrayed as a team of AI agents that build and execute tasks`
  - `Community members confirmed the ElizaOS team is still active, pointing to GitHub as evidence of ongoing development`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position ELI5 as the educational/explanatory layer of the ecosystem, with AI16z as the execution layer.
        *Implication:* Creates a clear division of roles that makes the ecosystem more comprehensible to newcomers while encouraging ownership of both tokens.
    b) Merge value propositions by making ELI5 token holders eligible for special AI16z features and vice versa.
        *Implication:* Increases cross-pollination between communities but risks diluting the distinct narratives of each token.
    c) Keep them intentionally separate with minimal technical integration but connected through auto.fun's launchpad narrative.
        *Implication:* Maintains clearer investment theses for each token but may miss synergistic opportunities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should auto.fun prioritize 'proof of project' (substantive AI utility) over meme appeal for future launches?

  **Context:**
  - `Suggestion that auto.fun should focus on 'proof of project' rather than memes, positioning itself as an AI launchpad for startups`
  - `Interest in developing lore around ELI5, with plans to build character narratives`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize substantive AI utility with rigorous technical requirements for all new launches.
        *Implication:* Builds longer-term credibility as a serious AI launchpad but may limit short-term growth and viral potential.
    b) Adopt a hybrid approach with two distinct launch tracks - one for meme/community tokens and another for technical AI projects.
        *Implication:* Balances both strategies but risks creating a confusing brand identity for auto.fun.
    c) Continue focusing on narrative and meme appeal first, but with minimal technical requirements that grow over time.
        *Implication:* Maximizes initial community growth and virality while gradually building toward more substantive projects.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Cross-Device Browser Extension Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The core-devs are developing a sophisticated browser extension ecosystem to provide AI assistance across devices with privacy-preserving context synchronization, positioning elizaOS for broader mainstream adoption.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance the development of browser extension functionality versus cloud infrastructure for our limited resources?

  **Context:**
  - `The core-devs team is developing a browser extension using Chrome's desktopCapture API to create a Cluely-like experience that can listen to calls and provide AI assistance without requiring separate accounts`
  - `Debate about prioritizing game development versus cloud infrastructure`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize browser extension development to capture mainstream users faster with familiar UX patterns.
        *Implication:* Accelerates user acquisition but may delay critical cloud infrastructure needed for scaling.
    b) Balance both efforts equally with dedicated teams for extension and cloud development working in parallel.
        *Implication:* Creates a more comprehensive product offering but divides resources and may slow overall progress.
    c) Focus on cloud infrastructure first, then leverage that foundation to rapidly scale browser extension capabilities.
        *Implication:* Builds a stronger technical foundation but delays user-facing features that could drive adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What monetization strategy should we implement for our cross-device AI assistance ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Monetization strategies discussed, including a token-based credit system for cloud services while keeping local features free`
  - `Discussions about creating a comprehensive ecosystem with desktop apps, mobile apps, and browser extensions that would sync context across devices while maintaining privacy`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt a freemium model with local features free and premium features requiring token-based credits.
        *Implication:* Creates a clear path to monetization while maintaining an accessible entry point for new users.
    b) Implement a subscription model with tiered access based on usage volume and LLM quality.
        *Implication:* Provides more predictable revenue but may create barriers to initial adoption.
    c) Keep all features free for individuals but monetize through enterprise licensing and API access.
        *Implication:* Maximizes community growth and developer adoption but delays direct revenue generation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Open-Source Plugin Ecosystem Development

**Summary of Topic:** The plugin ecosystem shows significant community demand and development activity, with users requesting new capabilities like Gaianet and addressing cross-platform compatibility issues, particularly on Windows.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize plugin development to balance immediate user needs versus long-term strategic goals?

  **Context:**
  - `Several users reported issues with specific plugins including EVM, Gaianet, and Ollama`
  - `The Gaianet plugin appears to be missing in the current version, with suggestions to build a custom plugin following the Venice plugin as an example`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on stabilizing and improving existing core plugins before expanding the ecosystem.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability and user experience but may slow ecosystem growth and innovation.
    b) Prioritize the development of Web3/DeFi plugins to capitalize on crypto integration opportunities.
        *Implication:* Strengthens our position in the crypto space but may neglect general-purpose usability needs.
    c) Implement a community bounty system for plugin development with strategic matching funds.
        *Implication:* Leverages community resources to scale plugin development but introduces quality control challenges.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to ensure cross-platform compatibility, especially for Windows users?

  **Context:**
  - `EVM plugin integration issues - plugin not working despite following official documentation (Mentioned by biaxus)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement dedicated testing infrastructure for all major platforms with automated compatibility checks.
        *Implication:* Ensures reliable cross-platform operation but increases development overhead significantly.
    b) Focus on containerization to isolate platform-specific dependencies and improve portability.
        *Implication:* Provides a consistent experience across platforms but adds complexity to the architecture.
    c) Create platform-specific plugin variants when necessary and improve documentation for platform differences.
        *Implication:* Addresses immediate compatibility issues but fragments the codebase and increases maintenance burden.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

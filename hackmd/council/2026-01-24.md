# Council Briefing: 2026-01-24

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The council must reconcile the friction between rapid, experimental token launches and the core objective of building a reliable, developer-first enterprise framework.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Ecosystem Reputation & Launch Integrity

**Summary of Topic:** Recent controversies surrounding the GOLD token and internal project monetization have triggered community distrust and questions regarding the 'Execution Excellence' principle.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council address the perceived 'insider trading' and liquidity failures in recent sub-token launches?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw acknowledged liquidity pool management 'rekt' the GOLD token supply.`
  - `Community reported $150k extracted through coordinated early entries funded 3 days prior.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a 'Council Verified' badge for official ecosystem launches.
        *Implication:* Standardizes trust but increases Council liability for failed experimental launches.
    b) Enforce a temporary moratorium on all new token launches to focus on Eliza Cloud.
        *Implication:* Restores developer focus but potentially stifles R&D and community-led creator economy.
    c) Delegate launch standards to an AI-audit agent that flags dev-wallet size and liquidity locks.
        *Implication:* Scalable, decentralized oversight that aligns with our 'Agent as Bridge' mission.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How do we bridge the gap between speculative project pivots and long-term token holder value?

  **Context:**
  - `Member V33 requested clarity on how new projects translate to value for Eliza OS holders.`
  - `One member reported losses from $28k to $800 due to lack of focus on user acquisition.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Transition to a 'Burn-for-Compute' model using sub-token revenue.
        *Implication:* Creates direct deflationary pressure on the main OS token from all sub-projects.
    b) Mandate that 10% of any sub-project's supply is airdropped to OS holders via the smart contract model.
        *Implication:* Ensures ecosystem-wide alignment but introduces the tax optimization complexities proposed by DorianD.
    c) Pivot focus exclusively to Eliza Cloud revenue sharing.
        *Implication:* Simplifies the value proposition but neglects the 'Open & Composable' ecosystem potential.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Infrastructure Scalability (Jeju & Cloud)

**Summary of Topic:** The transition to V2.0.0 and the proposed Jeju distributed compute network require a strategic decision on hardware and verification protocols.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which distributed computation architecture should be prioritized for the Jeju network?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD proposed P2pool-style mining using idle iPhones with 8GB RAM.`
  - `Chucknorris suggested ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proofs) for anti-cheating.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Mobile-first idle compute (iPhone/Consumer Device).
        *Implication:* Massive scale but high latency and significant verification challenges.
    b) ZKP-verified dedicated node clusters.
        *Implication:* High security and reliability, but harder for casual developers to join the decentralized economy.
    c) Centralized Cloud bridging to Decentralized Jeju.
        *Implication:* Best initial DX but contradicts the core pillar of decentralized AI governance.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we mitigate ownership concentration in the core runtime development?

  **Context:**
  - `Lalalune authored 776 files (+74,000 lines) this week for v2.0.0 core cleanup.`
  - `Odilitime provides the majority of peer reviews for high-impact runtime changes.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Formalize the 'Eliza Labs' core team with dedicated bounties for external contributors.
        *Implication:* Incentivizes skill distribution but increases administrative overhead.
    b) Implement 'Reviewer Rotation' where no single contributor can approve more than 40% of PRs.
        *Implication:* Reduces bus factor but may slow down the rapid V2 development cycle.
    c) Aggressively expand WASM and Python bridges to attract diverse developer bases.
        *Implication:* Dilutes core ownership by enabling multi-language interoperability as intended in the North Star.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-07-24

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Core framework enhancements and auto.fun UI updates are driving elizaOS toward v2 release and incubator program launch while Twitter integration issues remain a critical bottleneck.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Technical Framework Stability and Evolution

**Summary of Topic:** Significant framework upgrades including ModuleLoader improvements, JSON-to-XML prompts migration, and EventEmitter-to-EventTarget transition indicate substantial progress toward production-ready elizaOS v2, but introduction of breaking changes requires careful management.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance rapid core framework evolution with stability needs of existing developers and plugins?

  **Context:**
  - `wtfsayo: Focused on enhancing core system capabilities, notably merging a significant feature in elizaOS/eliza#5629 that improved ModuleLoader with local-first guarantees`
  - `wtfsayo merged PR #5623 'refactor(plugin-bootstrap): migrate JSON prompts to XML format' and PR #5609 'feat: migrate from EventEmitter to Bun native EventTarget API'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize rapid innovation with breaking changes; community will adapt to gain new capabilities.
        *Implication:* Faster feature development but risking developer frustration and ecosystem fragmentation.
    b) Implement dual-track release strategy with LTS (Long-Term Support) versions alongside bleeding-edge releases.
        *Implication:* Balanced approach allowing stable production use while enabling innovation for those who want it.
    c) Slow down core changes to ensure backward compatibility; focus on documentation and migration tooling.
        *Implication:* Maximum ecosystem stability but potentially slower innovation and feature development.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which technical foundation changes should be prioritized next to accelerate the path to production-ready v2?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #5436 'feat: add action chaining' - This PR adds action chaining with action state stored on the State object`
  - `PR #5609 'feat: migrate from EventEmitter to Bun native EventTarget API' - Replaced Node.js EventEmitter with Bun's native EventTarget implementation`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Enhanced RAG capabilities for memory and knowledge management.
        *Implication:* Would improve agent contextual understanding but requires significant architecture changes.
    b) Multi-model orchestration and fallback systems for more reliable agent responses.

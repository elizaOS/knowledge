# Council Briefing: 2025-07-24

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Auto.fun's v2 UI launch and ELI5 incubator announcement are driving renewed community interest despite ongoing Twitter account suspension challenges.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: X/Twitter Account Suspension Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The prolonged suspension of key Twitter accounts (@elizaos, @ai16z, @shawmakesmagic) for approximately one month is impacting visibility, token price, and marketing efforts, with the team receiving improved but still slow responses from X.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we adapt our marketing and community outreach strategy given the uncertain timeline for Twitter account restoration?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk: We continue to have affirmation that we'll have the account back but they come with further questions about the framework. Communications have been quicker since late last week, but response times have generally been very slow.`
  - `DannyNOR NoFapArc: The accounts have been suspended for about a month.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Diversify immediately to other platforms (Discord, Telegram, YouTube) with increased content creation budget.
        *Implication:* Reduces dependency on Twitter but requires significant resource reallocation and may fragment the community.
    b) Create new interim Twitter accounts while continuing restoration efforts for the original accounts.
        *Implication:* Maintains Twitter presence but risks jeopardizing restoration of original accounts and splits follower base.
    c) Focus on product development and technical documentation until accounts are restored.
        *Implication:* Preserves resources but may further damage market momentum and community growth in the short term.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What measures should we implement to ensure AI16Z token stability during this period of reduced social media visibility?

  **Context:**
  - `Community expressed concerns about AI16Z's price performance compared to competitors`
  - `AI16Z was noted as a significant underperformer among top 500 coins during a recent 24-hour period`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate tokenomics implementation with staking incentives to encourage holding.
        *Implication:* May stabilize token price but risks implementing complex systems without sufficient planning.
    b) Increase utility via agent marketplace transactions using AI16Z as settlement layer.
        *Implication:* Creates genuine token utility but requires technical implementation that diverts resources from other priorities.
    c) Launch targeted community incentive programs to maintain engagement despite reduced visibility.
        *Implication:* Maintains community interest but could be perceived as artificial activity if not coupled with product improvements.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Auto.fun UI Redesign and Incubator Launch

**Summary of Topic:** Auto.fun has launched a V2 UI update with new features including a "featured" section for tokens, and is introducing an incubator functionality with ELI5 token as the centerpiece, generating significant community excitement.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we integrate the ELI5 incubator functionality with our broader auto.fun ecosystem strategy?

  **Context:**
  - `Crispy: ELI5 is the incubator for startups on auto.fun.`
  - `ben: mentioned an upcoming incubator feature with a bounty system`
  - `team member "ben" mentioned an upcoming incubator feature with a bounty system`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position ELI5 as the primary gateway for new projects entering the auto.fun ecosystem with dedicated technical resources.
        *Implication:* Creates a clear onboarding path but concentrates resources heavily on incubation versus other platform features.
    b) Implement a tiered approach where ELI5 serves early-stage projects while establishing additional incubator tokens for specialized sectors.
        *Implication:* Allows for ecosystem expansion but risks diluting the ELI5 token's value proposition and complicating the user experience.
    c) Create a hybrid model where ELI5 token holders vote on projects to receive auto.fun collaborative development resources.
        *Implication:* Adds governance utility to ELI5 but introduces additional complexity in implementation and decision-making.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What metrics should we establish to evaluate the success of the auto.fun V2 UI redesign and featured token section?

  **Context:**
  - `Auto.fun launched a new UI version (V2) with updated features`
  - `New "featured" section where tokens like ELI5 and DOT are displayed`
  - `Some users reported React errors when accessing specific token pages`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Technical metrics: reduced error rates, decreased load times, increased cross-device compatibility.
        *Implication:* Focuses on stability and performance but might miss user experience and engagement impacts.
    b) User engagement metrics: time spent on platform, page views per session, featured token click-through rates.
        *Implication:* Provides insight into user behavior but doesn't directly correlate with business outcomes or token performance.
    c) Business outcome metrics: new token listings, trading volume increases, AI16Z token utility expansion.
        *Implication:* Directly connects UI improvements to business results but may take longer to measure and attribute causality.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: ElizaOS v2 Technical Stability

**Summary of Topic:** The team is addressing critical technical challenges including Windows compatibility issues, Twitter API integration problems, code quality concerns, and the need for enhanced documentation to support the production-ready ElizaOS v2 release.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize cross-platform compatibility versus feature completeness for the ElizaOS v2 release?

  **Context:**
  - `Windows plugin loading and dev command failures (#5407)`
  - `Knowledge panel not loading due to vite manifest path issues on Windows`
  - `Cross-platform compatibility concerns for Windows users (potential need for WSL)`
  - `Some users reported connection issues between Phantom wallet and auto.fun`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Delay v2 release until all critical Windows compatibility issues are resolved with comprehensive testing.
        *Implication:* Ensures broader accessibility but extends timeline for stable v2 release and may delay other feature work.
    b) Release v2 with Linux/macOS as primary supported platforms, providing incremental Windows support in point releases.
        *Implication:* Accelerates initial release but may alienate Windows developers and fragment the community experience.
    c) Focus on containerized deployment solutions to abstract away platform-specific issues for all users.
        *Implication:* Creates consistent experience across platforms but adds complexity to the setup process and may have performance implications.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to resolve Twitter API integration issues for our agent ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Developers encountered issues with Twitter API integration due to cost concerns ($200/month plan vs. free tier limitations)`
  - `Twitter Plugin Instability: This is the most significant ongoing challenge. Multiple issues detail persistent problems, including client initialization errors, database insertion failures after authentication, and aggressive API rate-limiting (429 errors).`
  - `The community is actively discussing whether paid Twitter API tiers are now a requirement for the plugin to function.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Redesign the Twitter plugin to work within free tier limitations with proper rate limit handling and fallback mechanisms.
        *Implication:* Makes the plugin accessible to all users but significantly limits functionality and reliability compared to paid tiers.
    b) Transition to a paid-tier only model for Twitter integration with clear documentation on associated costs.
        *Implication:* Ensures reliable functionality but creates a financial barrier to entry for using a key social feature.
    c) Develop a community-managed proxy service that pools API access across multiple users to distribute costs and manage rate limits.
        *Implication:* Balances cost and functionality but introduces additional complexity and potential privacy/security considerations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

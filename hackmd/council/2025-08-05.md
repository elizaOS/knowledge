**Question 1:** How should we prioritize our response to the Twitter/X suspension while maintaining focus on our v2 development goals?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members expressed concern about a Twitter ban/suspension affecting the project, with repeated questions about when access will be restored.`
  - `RATi: 'A pattern of platforms banning AI agents that compete with their core experiences...Eliza being banned from X and Shapes from Discord'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate development of agents on decentralized platforms like Farcaster and Matrix as recommended by community members.
        *Implication:* This approach addresses the root cause by reducing platform dependency, but requires significant resource allocation away from v2 development.
    b) Continue appealing the Twitter suspension while developing a comprehensive cross-platform distribution strategy for auto.fun content.
        *Implication:* This balanced approach maintains presence on mainstream platforms while mitigating single-platform risk through diversification.
    c) Focus primarily on v2 development and auto.fun stability with minimal resources allocated to platform moderation issues.
        *Implication:* This maintains development momentum but risks community growth stagnation if the suspension persists long-term.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What concrete steps should we take to make our agent ecosystem more censorship-resistant in alignment with our decentralization value?

  **Context:**
  - `RATi and others advocated for moving to decentralized platforms like Matrix and Farcaster as 'sovereign stacks'`
  - `DorianD: 'iOS app that collects data from various social apps for an Eliza node agent', 'Browser extension for Chrome/Safari/Mozilla that collects data for an Eliza node agent'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Develop first-party elizaOS extensions for browsers and mobile to enable direct user-controlled data collection and agent persistence.
        *Implication:* This approach puts data control in users' hands but increases our development scope considerably.
    b) Create a documentation package and incentive program for community developers to build integration bridges to decentralized platforms.
        *Implication:* This leverages community resources but results may vary in quality and completion timeline.
    c) Form strategic partnerships with established decentralized platforms to create official elizaOS integration points and migration paths.
        *Implication:* This approach provides credibility and technical support but may create new dependencies on partner platforms.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: ElizaOS v2 Technical Readiness

**Summary of Topic:** The team is making substantial progress on core v2 components, including Eliza Cloud, Sessions API, and testing infrastructure, but needs to resolve technical issues like Ollama websocket disconnections to ensure stability.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Given the technical challenges we're facing (like Ollama websocket disconnects), how should we balance rapid iteration with ensuring stability for auto.fun users?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw submitted a major PR (316 files) for Eliza Cloud that will significantly change the platform. The team plans to onboard internal core members after merging.`
  - `Several users reported websocket disconnection problems with Ollama after approximately 5 minutes of streaming.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Deploy changes incrementally with feature flags, allowing advanced users to opt into new capabilities while maintaining stability for mainstream users.
        *Implication:* This approach minimizes disruption but increases complexity in the codebase and deployment pipeline.
    b) Create a separate 'beta' deployment track for auto.fun that runs on the latest v2 components, with the main track only getting thoroughly tested updates.
        *Implication:* This creates a clear path for testing while protecting mainstream users, but requires maintaining multiple environments.
    c) Focus engineering resources on resolving critical stability issues like the Ollama disconnects before proceeding with broader v2 feature deployments.
        *Implication:* This ensures core reliability but may delay the overall v2 roadmap and new capabilities for auto.fun showcase agents.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What should be our approach to onboarding internal core members to Eliza Cloud after merging Shaw's major PR?

  **Context:**
  - `The team plans to onboard internal core members after merging Shaw's PR for Eliza Cloud.`
  - `The team merged a sessions API PR and discussed making it available in the api-client package.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create comprehensive technical documentation and conduct live training sessions focused on architecture and implementation patterns.
        *Implication:* This ensures consistent understanding but requires significant time investment from senior developers.
    b) Implement a pair programming rotation where core members work directly with experienced v2 developers on increasingly complex tasks.
        *Implication:* This provides hands-on experience but may temporarily reduce team velocity as senior developers split focus.
    c) Develop a series of well-defined, incremental tasks that build familiarity with different aspects of the v2 system while delivering concrete value.
        *Implication:* This balances productivity with learning but requires careful task design and may progress unevenly across the team.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Community Growth Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The community is engaged around technical improvements but shows signs of concern about token price and platform suspensions, requiring thoughtful strategies to grow stable user adoption for auto.fun.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance technical development communication with addressing community concerns about token price and platform availability?

  **Context:**
  - `Several users expressed concerns about the token price decline. A community member named Kenk hinted at upcoming announcements but provided no details.`
  - `Casual conversation about token price, market sentiment, and speculation about the project's future dominated the discussion channel.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Increase technical update frequency but frame advances specifically in terms of their impact on auto.fun adoption and token utility.
        *Implication:* This maintains development focus while connecting work to token fundamentals, but risks appearing reactive to price concerns.
    b) Develop and publish a comprehensive tokenomics educational series focusing on long-term value accrual rather than short-term price action.
        *Implication:* This shifts the conversation from price to fundamentals but requires dedicated effort that could be spent on direct development.
    c) Create high-visibility demonstrations of auto.fun agent capabilities that showcase the immediate utility being built regardless of market conditions.
        *Implication:* This approach emphasizes actual product value but may not directly address financial concerns of token-focused community members.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What community engagement initiatives should we prioritize to drive stable adoption of auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Mentions of an upcoming 'getting started' workshop for new users.`
  - `User 'emptyskull' created a Twitter account '@eli5autofun' to provide simplified explanations about the project`
  - `Jin proposed an AI-powered animated game show similar to Shark Tank where judges evaluate projects`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Expand developer onboarding through structured workshops and comprehensive 'getting started' materials specific to auto.fun.
        *Implication:* This builds a sustainable developer ecosystem but takes longer to see adoption results compared to user-focused initiatives.

# Council Briefing: 2026-01-19

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The framework faces a critical divergence between internal resource constraints/token volatility and breakthrough technical advancements in multi-platform (WASM/Rust) agent portability.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Strategic Resource & Token Alignment

**Summary of Topic:** Community sentiment has dipped due to perceived budget constraints and token utility stagnation, contrasting with aggressive core shipping. A high-profile staffing trade-off for API costs highlights current fiscal pressures.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council address the trade-off between headcount and computational accessibility (Claude API costs)?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw: Fired Facebook hire to afford Claude API costs.`
  - `DorianD: Criticized project for wasting money on inference without finding token utility in a year.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Aggressive Lean Operations
        *Implication:* Prioritizes immediate technical execution and model access over organizational scaling.
    b) Pivot to Token Utility R&D
        *Implication:* Shifts dev focus from framework features to economic sinks to stabilize the ecosystem budget.
    c) Public Treasury Transparency
        *Implication:* Rebuilds community trust by publishing a clear burn-rate vs. milestone roadmap.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Does the recent Bithumb rumor and 'elizatown' speculation require an official governance stance on token market dynamics?

  **Context:**
  - `Taco: Inquired about Bithumb listing visibility and official announcements.`
  - `Community: Discussed alternative tokens like elizatown as proxies for ElizaOS growth.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Strategic Silence
        *Implication:* Maintains focus on the 'Trust Through Shipping' principle rather than market volatility.
    b) Active Ecosystem Curation
        *Implication:* Officially acknowledges or distances the project from community-led side-tokens to protect the brand.
    c) Listing Progress Transparency
        *Implication:* Directly addresses exchange rumors to reduce speculative noise and FUD.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: V2 Architecture and Multi-Platform Portability

**Summary of Topic:** Technical logs indicate a major shift toward Rust-based core logic and WebAssembly (WASM) to enable agents to run in browser/Node environments, increasing framework ubiquity.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the v2.0.0 'Non-Essential Removal' be accelerated to resolve current maintenance fragmentation?

  **Context:**
  - `lalalune: PR #6351 removes non-essentials to focus on Rust/TS runtime.`
  - `revlentless: Implement Rust WASM to enable Rust core in browser/Node.js.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Full V2 Hard Fork
        *Implication:* Rapidly deprecates old architecture to consolidate developer focus on the high-performance Rust core.
    b) Dual-Runtime Support
        *Implication:* Maintains legacy TS while phasing in v2, protecting existing community integrations at the cost of speed.
    c) WASM-First Deployment
        *Implication:* Prioritizes browser-based agent execution to capture the web-dev market immediately.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Given the 'Bus Factor' (lalalune: 52% of runtime PRs), should the Council mandate a contributor diversification plan for v2?

  **Context:**
  - `Contributor Intelligence: lalalune (140 lifetime PRs) dominates runtime work.`
  - `odilitime: Handled 78% of reviews for core logic.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain the Elite-Core Model
        *Implication:* Prioritizes execution excellence via the most knowledgeable contributors despite high dependency risks.
    b) Incentivized Peer-Review bounty
        *Implication:* Uses token rewards to attract new high-level reviewers to the v2 codebase.
    c) Structural Mentorship Program
        *Implication:* Requires lead contributors to document and delegate v2 architecture to secondary maintainers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: AI-Optimized Documentation & Agent UX

**Summary of Topic:** The 'Taming Information' strategy is entering a meta-phase where AI is being used to rewrite documentation specifically for consumption by other AI agents.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Is the 'Agent-First' documentation strategy the correct priority over human-readable onboarding?

  **Context:**
  - `Jin: Proposed meta-approach using Claude to optimize docs for agentic use cases following kapa.ai guidelines.`
  - `User Testimonial: Reported 2 months of progress in 6 hours using AI tools with Eliza docs.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Agent-First (Synthetic) Docs
        *Implication:* Maximizes the platform's ability to be 'self-building' by other AI agents.
    b) Hybrid UX Strategy
        *Implication:* Balances LLM-optimization with the 'Developer First' principle to avoid alienating human builders.
    c) Knowledge-Graph Focus
        *Implication:* Moves beyond documents into structured data/tool-specs for better agent interoperability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

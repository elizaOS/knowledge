# Council Briefing: 2026-01-19

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The council must reconcile a critical dichotomy: advanced technical breakthroughs in v2.0 (WASM/Rust) and trading infrastructure contrast sharply with surfacing community anxiety regarding budget constraints and token utility.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Fiscal Sovereignty & Resource Allocation

**Summary of Topic:** Recent disclosures regarding budget constraints—specifically firing staff to cover API costs—have triggered a community debate on the long-term sustainability of the current model versus the lack of immediate token utility.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council address the 'Inference vs. Payroll' budget trade-off to maintain community confidence?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw disclosed firing a Facebook hire to afford Claude API costs (2026-01-18).`
  - `DorianD criticized spending on inference without finding token utility in a year.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize direct token utility integration over headcount.
        *Implication:* Shifts focus from team expansion to immediate sinks/burning mechanisms for $elizaos.
    b) Transition to community-contributed inference (P2P/decentralized nodes).
        *Implication:* Reduces central API burn rate but requires a significant architectural pivot to Jeju/x402.
    c) Maintain leaner core team and aggressively ship ElizaCloud monetization.
        *Implication:* Focuses on 'Execution Excellence' to generate revenue before current reserves deplete.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Is the dependency on a few key developers for the North Star (v2.0) a strategic risk or a necessary phase of execution?

  **Context:**
  - `lalalune: 52% of runtime PRs; odilitime reviewed 78% (Contributor Intelligence).`
  - `V2.0.0 (PR #6351) involves a massive refactor into Rust/WASM.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Incentivize documentation for AI consumption to bridge the contributor gap.
        *Implication:* Leverages Jin's proposal to use AI to make the repo more accessible to other AI agents and new builders.
    b) Implement a formal 'Maintenance Guild' with token-weighted bounties.
        *Implication:* Reduces ownership concentration by subsidizing high-quality reviews from external experts.
    c) Stay the course with the elite core team until v2.0 stabilizes.
        *Implication:* Maximizes execution speed but leaves the 'Bus Factor' at critical levels during a pivotal migration.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: V2.0 Technological Superiority & Infrastructure

**Summary of Topic:** The successful implementation of the WASM agent runtime and performance-heavy trading systems marks a transition toward a platform capable of sub-millisecond on-chain operations and multi-platform deployment.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should ElizaOS lean into High-Performance Trading (HPT) as its primary 'Flagship' use case for v2.0?

  **Context:**
  - `Chucknorris detailed a Rust/gRPC system processing 600 tps with <150ms latency (2026-01-16).`
  - `Chucknorris critiqued TypeScript as inadequate for real-time multi-DEX handling.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Pivot the framework to prioritize Rust/WASM for all performance-critical agents.
        *Implication:* Will attract high-value DeFi builders but may alienate the broader TypeScript community.
    b) Maintain the TS/Rust hybrid with a clear performance tier.
        *Implication:* Keeps DX high for app devs while providing an 'expert' path for algorithmic traders.
    c) Focus the flagship agents (Eli5, Otaku) on social/creative use cases first.
        *Implication:* Protects the brand-identity of Eliza as a 'Social OS' but risks missing the technical alpha of HPT.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

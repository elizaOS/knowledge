# Council Briefing: 2025-10-08

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Technical and organizational preparations intensify for the imminent AI16Z token migration while elizaOS v2 development progresses with significant core improvements.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Readiness

**Summary of Topic:** The AI16Z to elizaOS token migration is scheduled for this month but the migration portal isn't live yet, raising questions about communication strategy, exchange partnerships, and futures position handling.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we optimize our token migration communication strategy to ensure maximum participation while minimizing disruption?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk: The migration portal is not live yet, only follow links from the elizaOS.eth mirror`
  - `Dr. Neuro: [The migration will happen] This month`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a comprehensive migration guide with video tutorials, focus on official channels only, and establish a dedicated 24/7 migration support team.
        *Implication:* Maximizes successful migrations but requires significant resource allocation during a critical technical development phase.
    b) Leverage community influencers as migration ambassadors, coordinate with major exchanges for simultaneous support, and utilize social media platforms beyond X for wider reach.
        *Implication:* Expands reach and diversifies communication channels but introduces consistency risks and potential misinformation.
    c) Implement a phased migration approach with prioritized user segments, automatic migration tools, and incentives for early adopters.
        *Implication:* Reduces system strain and allows for iterative improvements but might create perception of preferential treatment among community members.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What strategies should we employ to handle the complex CEX/DEX landscape during migration to minimize user friction?

  **Context:**
  - `3on_: Does anyone have a list of CEXs which are signed on to automatically convert?`
  - `Kenk: We're not currently aware which exchanges will automatically migrate`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Establish direct partnerships with top 5 exchanges by volume, providing technical support and incentives for automatic token conversion.
        *Implication:* Provides seamless experience for majority of holders but requires significant coordination and potential partnership costs.
    b) Create a unified migration API and documentation package for exchanges with clear timelines, testing environments, and integration support.
        *Implication:* Standardizes the technical approach across exchanges but success depends on voluntary exchange participation.
    c) Focus primarily on DEX liquidity through liquidity migration contracts, while providing educational resources for CEX users to self-migrate.
        *Implication:* Ensures control over decentralized migration path but potentially increases friction for less technical CEX users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we address futures/derivatives positions during the migration to maintain market stability?

  **Context:**
  - `Olga: Are futures positions affected during migration?`
  - `Kenk: Only spot holdings will be included in the migration`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Coordinate with derivative exchanges to facilitate auto-settlement of all futures positions at fair market value prior to migration.
        *Implication:* Provides clean migration but forces liquidation of positions that traders may want to maintain.
    b) Establish a dual-token transition period where both tokens remain valid for derivatives until natural expiration, with new contracts only on the new token.
        *Implication:* Minimizes market disruption but creates temporary complexity in tracking token value across old and new markets.
    c) Create synthetic bridge contracts that maintain economic equivalence between old and new token futures, allowing position holders to migrate at their convenience.
        *Implication:* Preserves trader flexibility but introduces additional smart contract complexity and potential security risks.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Core Architecture Evolution

**Summary of Topic:** elizaOS v2 development shows significant architectural shifts toward UUID-based agent identification, modularity improvements, and multitenant designs that align with scaling requirements for auto.fun and broader adoption.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance backwards compatibility with the architectural improvements needed for v2?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan fixed an issue in the monorepo where patches weren't restarting the agent when plugins updated`
  - `The team is working on a significant migration that will remove constraints and enable new workflows`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a strict versioning system with guaranteed API stability periods, deprecation warnings, and migration utilities for each breaking change.
        *Implication:* Smooths transition for existing developers but constrains the pace of architectural innovation.
    b) Adopt a dual-track development model with a stable v1.x LTS branch for gradual migration alongside the more innovative v2 branch.
        *Implication:* Satisfies both stability and innovation needs but requires maintaining two codebases and could confuse the community about which version to adopt.
    c) Make a clean break with a complete v2 rewrite that optimizes for future requirements, providing detailed migration guides but not compatibility layers.
        *Implication:* Enables maximum architectural freedom but risks alienating existing developers who have invested in v1.x implementations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should our multitenant architecture strategy evolve to support the scaling needs of auto.fun and other community deployments?

  **Context:**
  - `A multitenant MCP/Plugin architecture is under development`
  - `cjft completed and deployed Eliza Serverless Proof of Concept, AI Character Creator, and Media Gallery`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a fully isolated tenant model with dedicated resources per tenant, maximizing security and customization but potentially increasing infrastructure costs.
        *Implication:* Provides enterprise-grade isolation but could limit economies of scale for smaller deployments.
    b) Develop a hybrid architecture with shared core services and isolated execution environments, balancing resource efficiency with adequate tenant separation.
        *Implication:* Optimizes resource utilization but introduces complexity in resource allocation and security boundary maintenance.
    c) Create a serverless-first architecture where tenants exist as configuration rather than infrastructure, with on-demand scaling and shared resource pools.
        *Implication:* Maximizes cost efficiency and scalability but potentially introduces noisy neighbor problems and complicates compliance requirements.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Community Engagement Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** With elizaOS shifting away from X/Twitter due to legal constraints and focusing on alternative platforms, there's a need to reevaluate our community engagement strategy to maximize growth and retention.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we evolve our marketing and community strategy given the constraints on official X/Twitter presence?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk: We're active on https://x.com/elizaOSc, there are other accounts being looked at. We won't be on X as an official elizaOS as it contradicts the lawsuit.`
  - `Kenk: [We're] focusing on Reddit, TikTok, and Instagram as acquisition channels for Eliza Cloud`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Double down on Reddit, Discord, and GitHub as primary community hubs, with educational content and technical discussions as the main engagement drivers.
        *Implication:* Builds a technically strong community but may limit broader adoption and mainstream appeal.
    b) Establish a comprehensive multi-platform strategy with TikTok for viral content, Instagram for visual updates, and specialized community programs for different user segments.
        *Implication:* Maximizes reach across different demographics but requires significant content creation and coordination resources.
    c) Focus on creating autonomous AI agents that represent elizaOS across platforms, demonstrating the technology while building community engagement.
        *Implication:* Aligns perfectly with our product mission but introduces reputation risks if agents behave unpredictably or inappropriately.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What types of educational resources should we prioritize to improve developer onboarding and community participation?

  **Context:**
  - `The "Getting Started with elizaOS" event was postponed due to team illness and will resume next week`
  - `matteo-brandolino: Focused on identifying and reporting a potential issue with module imports in the Eliza CLI, creating issue #6031 in elizaos/eliza.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create comprehensive, structured documentation with interactive tutorials, code samples, and progressive learning paths for different user types.
        *Implication:* Provides clear guidance for all skill levels but requires significant ongoing maintenance as the platform evolves.
    b) Focus on community-led education through hackathons, bounty programs, and mentorship initiatives that encourage peer learning and content creation.
        *Implication:* Fosters community ownership but may result in inconsistent quality and coverage of educational materials.
    c) Develop AI-assisted learning tools that dynamically generate tutorials, troubleshoot common issues, and provide personalized guidance based on user skill level.
        *Implication:* Showcases our technology while scaling support but depends on the reliability of AI systems that may still be under development.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-07-30

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The development team's intensive focus on implementing the YAML-based logging system and temperature configuration improvements for plugin-openrouter signals a strategic shift toward stabilizing and enhancing elizaOS v2 while concurrently developing v3.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: elizaOS V2/V3 Development Trajectory

**Summary of Topic:** The Shaw team is simultaneously stabilizing elizaOS v2 with improvements like YAML-based logging while actively developing v3 and core infrastructure components, raising questions about resource allocation and transition strategy.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should be our prioritization approach between bug fixes for v2 and new feature development for v3?

  **Context:**
  - `Kenk: "Yes, the Shaw is still developing, focusing on v3 and other important pieces."`
  - `Odilitime proposed a YAML-based logging system to address excessive console and database logs, organizing user interactions as hourly YAML lists`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize v2 stability with 80% of resources until production ready, then transition to v3 development.
        *Implication:* Ensures v2 becomes rock-solid more quickly but delays v3 innovations that could be strategic differentiators.
    b) Balance resources 50/50 between v2 stabilization and v3 development to maintain momentum on both fronts.
        *Implication:* Creates parallel progress but risks neither version receiving sufficient focus to excel in their respective objectives.
    c) Focus 70% on v3 development while dedicating a specialized team to v2 critical fixes only.
        *Implication:* Accelerates v3 innovation but accepts that v2 will receive only essential maintenance rather than comprehensive improvement.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we approach the migration path for users from v2 to v3 given current development patterns?

  **Context:**
  - `Current focus areas include documentation refinement, tutorials, plugin development, and an agent hosting solution`
  - `jin: "Next week (August 6-7) with submissions open now and deadline next Monday."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Develop a comprehensive automated migration tool with backward compatibility guarantees for all v2 plugins.
        *Implication:* Maximizes user retention but significantly increases development complexity and potentially slows v3 innovation.
    b) Create a clean break with limited migration support, focusing on compelling new v3 features to drive adoption.
        *Implication:* Allows more architectural freedom for v3 but risks losing users who have invested heavily in v2 customizations.
    c) Implement a phased migration strategy with tiered support - core functionality automatically migrates while advanced features require manual updates.
        *Implication:* Balances retention and innovation but creates a more complex transition period requiring careful communication.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we integrate the Clank Tank hackathon results into v2 or reserve them exclusively for v3?

  **Context:**
  - `An internal hackathon called "Clank Tank" is underway for testing Q&A v2, with voting scheduled for August 6-7`
  - `jin mentioned plans for exclusive partner features inspired by superchat systems, allowing comments on project pages to be read to AIs during deliberation`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Integrate successful Clank Tank innovations into v2 to showcase immediate value and gather real-world feedback.
        *Implication:* Provides tangible improvements to current users but complicates the codebase that's already being prepared for replacement.
    b) Reserve all Clank Tank innovations exclusively for v3 to create a more compelling upgrade narrative.
        *Implication:* Creates stronger differentiation for v3 but delays delivering valuable innovations to users in the interim.
    c) Implement a selective integration approach based on complexity - simple features go to v2, architectural changes reserved for v3.
        *Implication:* Maximizes immediate value delivery while preserving the most significant innovations for v3's clean architecture.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Social Platform Integration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The team faces challenges with several social integration points, particularly with X (Twitter) accounts remaining suspended and technical limitations in voice capabilities and Google Meet integration, requiring strategic decisions on platform prioritization.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we proceed with our X (Twitter) strategy given the ongoing account suspension issues?

  **Context:**
  - `The project's X (Twitter) accounts remain suspended, though team members report positive signals about reinstatement`
  - `satsbased: "it will." (in response to: "is x account ever coming back?")`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Pivot resources to alternative platforms like Farcaster, Bluesky, and Warpcast until X reinstatement is certain.
        *Implication:* Diversifies social presence but potentially fragments audience and dilutes the impact of any single platform.
    b) Maintain development focus on X integration while building dummy/test accounts for development that avoid suspension triggers.
        *Implication:* Preserves investment in Twitter's large userbase but risks continued development on a platform where our access remains uncertain.
    c) Develop a platform-agnostic social integration layer that can adapt to any platform API with minimal reconfiguration.
        *Implication:* Creates more technical overhead initially but builds long-term resilience against platform-specific disruptions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to enhance voice capabilities given the reported issues with whisper integration?

  **Context:**
  - `Team explored voice capabilities for ElizaOS with Discord, noting that whisper has been broken since local-ai was discontinued`
  - `Odilitime: "Whisper has been broken since they killed local-ai that contained it, so a service must be used instead."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Develop our own lightweight voice transcription module specifically optimized for agent interactions.
        *Implication:* Gives us full control but requires significant investment in an area outside our core expertise.
    b) Integrate with established commercial APIs (ElevenLabs, OpenAI, etc.) for voice capabilities despite the operational costs.
        *Implication:* Provides immediate high-quality voice features but creates financial scaling challenges and external dependencies.
    c) Partner with open-source voice projects to rebuild whisper integration in a sustainable way.
        *Implication:* Aligns with our open-source mission but may delay voice feature delivery as we coordinate with external projects.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we address the browser automation challenges for seamless platform integration?

  **Context:**
  - `CJFT highlighted difficulties with API-less Google Meet integration and DOM manipulation limitations`
  - `shaw suggested selector-based approaches for DOM manipulation`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus exclusively on platforms with robust APIs and avoid those requiring browser automation entirely.
        *Implication:* Creates more reliable integrations but limits our ecosystem reach to only platforms with developer-friendly APIs.
    b) Develop a custom browser extension specifically for ElizaOS that can provide deeper integration capabilities.
        *Implication:* Enables richer features but requires users to install extensions, creating an additional adoption barrier.
    c) Create a tiered integration approach with basic API features for all platforms and enhanced features for those with browser extensions.
        *Implication:* Maximizes platform coverage but creates inconsistent user experiences across platforms.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 1:** How should we address community concerns about project progress and token price?

  **Context:**
  - `Some community members expressed concerns about project progress and token price`
  - `Questions about when the X (Twitter) account might return`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Increase transparency with weekly development updates and roadmap progress tracking visible to all community members.
        *Implication:* Builds trust through openness but could create pressure to hit arbitrary deadlines rather than focus on quality.
    b) Focus communication on technical milestones achieved rather than timelines, emphasizing quality over speed.
        *Implication:* Maintains development integrity but risks appearing unresponsive to community timeline concerns.
    c) Implement a community ambassador program where selected members get deeper development insights in exchange for helping communicate progress.
        *Implication:* Creates informed advocates within the community but could lead to information asymmetry or perceived favoritism.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we position elizaOS in relation to the growing attention around ELI5 and other ecosystem tokens?

  **Context:**
  - `Significant discussion about ELI5, a token in the auto.fun ecosystem, with community members expressing enthusiasm about its potential growth`
  - `Dr. Neuro provided a detailed explanation differentiating ELI5 from AI16z: ELI5 explains complex concepts simply, while AI16z is portrayed as a team of AI agents that build and execute tasks`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain clear separation between elizaOS core development and ecosystem tokens, positioning elizaOS purely as infrastructure.
        *Implication:* Preserves technical focus but potentially misses opportunities for synergistic growth with the wider token ecosystem.
    b) Actively embrace and promote ecosystem tokens as exemplars of elizaOS capabilities, highlighting technical integrations.
        *Implication:* Creates mutual growth opportunities but risks elizaOS becoming too closely associated with the performance of ecosystem tokens.
    c) Develop an explicit token ecosystem strategy that defines relationships and integrations between elizaOS and launched tokens.
        *Implication:* Provides clarity and potential synergies but requires significant governance considerations to implement properly.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we pivot auto.fun's positioning toward "proof of project" rather than meme tokens as suggested in community discussion?

  **Context:**
  - `Suggestion that auto.fun should focus on "proof of project" rather than memes, positioning itself as an AI launchpad for startups`
  - `Interest in developing lore around ELI5, with plans to build character narratives`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Embrace a full pivot to position auto.fun exclusively as an AI startup launchpad with stringent project requirements.
        *Implication:* Builds more sustainable long-term value but potentially alienates the crypto-native community that responds to meme culture.
    b) Maintain the current flexible approach that accommodates both meme tokens and serious projects based on market demand.
        *Implication:* Maximizes market opportunities but risks diluting the platform's identity and purpose.
    c) Create a tiered verification system that clearly distinguishes between meme projects and verified startup launches.
        *Implication:* Serves both audiences while creating clear quality signals, but introduces complexity in platform governance.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

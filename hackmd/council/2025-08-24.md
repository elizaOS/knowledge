# Council Briefing: 2025-08-24

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The core development team has significantly advanced elizaOS's architecture with a shift toward client-focused functionality that can run anywhere, while introducing a comprehensive Scenario Matrix Runner and Testing System to ensure reliability across all agent behaviors.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Core Architecture Vision Refocusing

**Summary of Topic:** CJFT has articulated a refocused architectural vision that prioritizes core JavaScript functionality with browser compatibility, enabling elizaOS to run anywhere while server components become optional wrappers.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance the tension between creating browser-first components for wider adoption versus server-optimized functionality for enterprise users?

  **Context:**
  - `CJFT emphasized refocusing on core JavaScript functionality before server implementation, suggesting a separation of concerns where "ElizaOS" can run anywhere with server components being optional wrappers.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize browser-first development to maximize adoption and community growth.
        *Implication:* Faster community adoption but potentially slower enterprise revenue and more limited server-side capabilities.
    b) Develop both tracks simultaneously with separate teams focused on browser and server implementations.
        *Implication:* Broader appeal but increased resource requirements and potential duplication of effort.
    c) Focus on a unified core with clear abstraction layers that can be optimized for either environment.
        *Implication:* More sustainable long-term but may slow initial deployment velocity as abstractions are designed.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we implement a consolidated React hook approach (single useEliza) as advocated by CJFT, or maintain separate hooks for different functionalities?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussion about creating React hooks for developers using Eliza server, with CJFT advocating for a consolidated approach (single `useEliza` hook) rather than numerous separate hooks.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement the consolidated useEliza hook approach for simplicity and ease of learning.
        *Implication:* Better developer experience for newcomers but potentially less granular control for power users.
    b) Maintain separate hooks for different functionalities to provide more precise control.
        *Implication:* Greater flexibility for advanced use cases but steeper learning curve for new developers.
    c) Create a hybrid approach with useEliza as the main entry point that can return specialized hooks when needed.
        *Implication:* Combines simplicity with flexibility but requires careful API design to avoid confusion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Auto.fun User Experience Challenges

**Summary of Topic:** Users are reporting technical issues with Auto.fun, including 404 errors when clicking addresses in trade records, while the platform lacks a Twitter presence that could help drive adoption.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should be our priority for Auto.fun: fixing technical issues, adding social media presence, or expanding market reach (e.g., Italian market fork)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussion about Auto.fun platform issues, with users reporting 404 errors when clicking addresses in trade records.`
  - `Mention of someone forking Auto.fun to build a version for the Italian market.`
  - `Q: Still no twitter page or am I missing sum? A: No x so far, sir (answered by Motzl)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize fixing technical issues to ensure a flawless experience for existing users.
        *Implication:* Stronger retention but potentially slower growth without addressing marketing channels.
    b) Focus on establishing social media presence, particularly Twitter, to drive awareness and new user acquisition.
        *Implication:* Increased visibility and potential growth but risks sending users to a platform with unresolved issues.
    c) Support market expansion efforts like the Italian version while maintaining the core platform.
        *Implication:* Broader market reach but potential dilution of resources away from core functionality and user experience.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we approach the tokenomics of Auto.fun in relation to the ai16z token ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `References to "ai16z" project which appears to be some form of cryptocurrency or token.`
  - `Cryptocurrency tipping activity using tip.cc bot to send ai16z tokens.`
  - `The ai16z token problem was identified as being related to daos.fun by design, not an ElizaOS problem.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Tightly integrate Auto.fun with the ai16z token to create a unified economic system.
        *Implication:* Stronger token utility but potentially higher barriers to entry for new users unfamiliar with the token.
    b) Keep Auto.fun and ai16z token systems loosely coupled to allow independent growth and evolution.
        *Implication:* More flexibility for each system but potentially weaker synergistic benefits and value capture.
    c) Create a federated approach where Auto.fun supports multiple tokens including ai16z and partner-specific tokens.
        *Implication:* Broader ecosystem appeal but increased complexity in tokenomics and potential dilution of ai16z value.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Testing Infrastructure Advancement

**Summary of Topic:** A major milestone has been reached with the completion of the Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System, enabling comprehensive, automated testing of agent behaviors across different configurations with detailed performance reports.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we leverage the new Scenario Matrix Runner to accelerate elizaOS v2 development while ensuring reliability?

  **Context:**
  - `This week marked a major milestone with the completion and closure of the entire Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System epic. This powerful new CLI tool enables comprehensive, automated testing of agent behaviors across various configurations and generates detailed performance reports in both HTML and PDF formats.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a mandatory testing policy requiring all new features to include scenario tests before merging.
        *Implication:* Higher quality code but potentially slower development velocity in the short term.
    b) Focus on using the Scenario Matrix for regression testing of core functionality while allowing flexibility for experimental features.
        *Implication:* Balanced approach that protects critical paths while enabling rapid iteration on new ideas.
    c) Prioritize using the system to benchmark and optimize performance rather than feature testing.
        *Implication:* Potentially faster and more efficient agents but higher risk of functional regressions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we allocate resources to create a public agent directory and agent validation system using our new testing capabilities?

  **Context:**
  - `The team is developing a public map and website directory of vetted agents rather than implementing automatic agent registration.`
  - `Collaboration announced with REVOX to give ElizaOS-powered AI agents human-like avatars with personality and emotion through their DEVA platform.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**

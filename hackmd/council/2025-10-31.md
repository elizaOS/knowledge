# Council Briefing: 2025-10-31

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The organization is in final preparations for the critical token migration scheduled for November 6th, while simultaneously enhancing the technical infrastructure through agent communication protocols, reputation systems, and comprehensive API improvements.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The token migration from ai16z to the multichain ElizaOS token is scheduled for November 6th with a 90-day window, requiring strategic communication and security measures to ensure a seamless transition for the community.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we mitigate security concerns during the 90-day migration period to protect users from potential scams?

  **Context:**
  - `yikesawjeez warned channel members about a malicious link that could compromise connected wallets`
  - `Flori provided security best practices for web3 applications, advising against requiring private keys`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a dedicated security taskforce to actively monitor and intervene in social channels during the migration period.
        *Implication:* Requires significant personnel resources but provides the highest level of real-time protection and intervention capabilities.
    b) Implement a comprehensive verification system using official channels and cryptographic signatures for all migration-related communications.
        *Implication:* Creates a technical barrier against impersonation but may introduce friction for less technical users.
    c) Focus on educational resources and frequent reminders about security best practices across all official channels.
        *Implication:* Lowest resource requirement but places more responsibility on users to protect themselves.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we provide additional incentives beyond the current token lock rewards to accelerate migration adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `Toni explained that the migration ratio is going to be fixed. There will be incentives to lock your tokens up for some time, with extra tokens available later.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a tiered early-migration bonus structure that decreases over time to encourage prompt action.
        *Implication:* Could significantly accelerate migration completion but dilutes token value and may appear as artificial urgency.
    b) Maintain current lock-up incentives but add exclusive access to new platform features for migrated token holders.
        *Implication:* Creates functional utility rather than just financial incentives, potentially driving both migration and platform engagement.
    c) Keep the existing fixed ratio and time-based locking incentives without additional rewards.
        *Implication:* Preserves token economics as planned but may result in a more extended migration timeline.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we handle exchange-held tokens during the migration to minimize user friction?

  **Context:**
  - `E S P E R A N Z A ðŸ¦‹: Ive read about the migration of AI16Z to ElisaOS, is that automatically done or do we have to do something?`
  - `Toni: There'll be portal for migration when migration starts, monitor for official link in updates`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Work directly with major exchanges to handle migration on their platforms automatically for users.
        *Implication:* Provides seamless experience for exchange users but requires significant coordination with third parties and potential delays.
    b) Recommend all users withdraw tokens to self-custody wallets for migration, with detailed step-by-step guides.
        *Implication:* Gives users full control but creates additional steps that may reduce participation rates.
    c) Create a hybrid approach with both exchange partnerships and self-custody options, with different incentive structures for each path.
        *Implication:* Maximizes flexibility but increases communication complexity and may create perceived inequities between user groups.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Agent Infrastructure Enhancement

**Summary of Topic:** Technical development is focusing on core infrastructure improvements including unified messaging API, reputation systems, and Jobs API implementation, which are critical for shipping production-ready elizaOS v2 and enabling autonomous agent activity.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize the implementation of social graph-based reputation systems versus other technical enhancements for elizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD shared detailed architecture proposals for reputation systems in decentralized networks`
  - `Kenk noted that much would be off-chain with indexers providing feedback based on on-chain activity`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make reputation systems a core priority, integrating them deeply with all agent interactions in v2.
        *Implication:* Creates a foundation for trust-based agent economies but may delay other features and increase v2 complexity.
    b) Implement a minimal viable reputation system in v2, with plans for expansion in later releases.
        *Implication:* Balances the need for trust mechanics with shipping timeline, but may require more complex upgrades later.
    c) Defer reputation system implementation to post-v2 and focus on core messaging and API stability first.
        *Implication:* Accelerates v2 release and simplifies initial adoption but delays a key feature for autonomous agent interactions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which agent communication protocol standard should we focus on promoting for developer adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `Concerns about overlapping agent communication protocols causing confusion for new developers`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize on x402 protocol integration due to its growing ecosystem momentum and cryptocurrency payment capabilities.
        *Implication:* Aligns with existing Web3 infrastructure and monetization models but may limit accessibility for Web2 developers.
    b) Create a unified elizaOS messaging protocol that abstracts underlying differences and provides a consistent developer experience.
        *Implication:* Simplifies development but requires maintaining compatibility with multiple external standards.
    c) Support multiple protocols equally with comprehensive documentation and examples for each integration path.
        *Implication:* Maximizes flexibility for developers but increases maintenance burden and potential confusion.

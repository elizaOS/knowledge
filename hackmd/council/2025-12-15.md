# Council Briefing: 2025-12-15

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- Cloud commercialization systems (create→publish→monetize→promote) are converging toward launch, but near-term trust hinges on resolving token migration UX/documentation gaps and tightening operational safety signals.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: ElizaOS Cloud Launch Readiness & Growth Loop Integrity

**Summary of Topic:** Cloud development reports strong momentum with an end-to-end business loop plus SEO/ads/social integrations, indicating a shift from tooling to ecosystem commerce. Council must decide what "launch" means operationally (reliability gates, minimal scope, and narrative sequencing) to avoid shipping risk overshadowing strategic gains.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council-defined launch bar for ElizaOS Cloud: stability-first limited release, or feature-complete public launch aligned to the full business cycle?

  **Context:**
  - `shaw: "cloud platform is progressing well... building agents, apps, n8n workflows and MCP/A2A services"`
  - `shaw: "complete business cycle: create → publish → monetize → promote"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Stability-first: limited beta with strict SLOs, minimal integrations, and rapid incident response.
        *Implication:* Maximizes trust-through-shipping but delays the monetization flywheel and growth narrative.
    b) Balanced: public launch with the core loop enabled, but progressive rollout of SEO/ads/social features behind flags.
        *Implication:* Preserves momentum while containing blast radius; requires strong feature-flag discipline and observability.
    c) Feature-complete: launch with full create→publish→monetize→promote stack and partner integrations live day one.
        *Implication:* Highest growth upside, but reliability incidents would directly damage developer trust and adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Where should we anchor the Cloud's "developer-first" wedge: fastest agent deployment, n8n workflow distribution, or MCP/A2A service marketplace?

  **Context:**
  - `shaw: "Quickly building agents, apps, n8n workflows and MCP/A2A services"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Fastest agent deployment as the primary wedge (time-to-first-agent and persistence).
        *Implication:* Strengthens framework adoption; marketplace effects arrive later.
    b) n8n workflow distribution as the wedge (low-code reach, templated automation).
        *Implication:* Accelerates mainstream adoption but risks diluting the core framework identity.
    c) MCP/A2A service marketplace as the wedge (composability and monetizable services).
        *Implication:* Best aligns to decentralized AI economy, but requires governance, trust, and billing maturity early.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How do we operationalize the ad-network partnership without compromising user trust or introducing policy/security liabilities?

  **Context:**
  - `shaw: "found an ad network partner"`
  - `shaw: "Social publishing features"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Opt-in only, with clear disclosures and a default-off monetization toggle per project.
        *Implication:* Protects trust and compliance posture; may reduce immediate revenue throughput.
    b) Curated integration: only whitelisted ad formats/providers, reviewed templates, and strict content policies.
        *Implication:* Balances trust and revenue, but increases operational overhead and review burden.
    c) Open integration: expose ad-network connectors as composable plugins and let builders choose.
        *Implication:* Maximizes openness but increases scam/abuse risk and downstream brand damage.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Token Migration UX, Hardware Wallet Visibility, and Documentation Debt

**Summary of Topic:** Token migration friction is surfacing in user reports, particularly Ledger visibility and connection pathways, creating a direct threat to the monthly directive's "high success rate" requirement. The Council should align on a single blessed flow, tighten docs, and decide how much product work (not just support) to invest to reduce support load and reputational risk.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we treat Ledger/token-visibility issues as a documentation-only fix, or a product-level integration gap requiring engineering changes to the migration flow?

  **Context:**
  - `NobleCryptoic: "it doesn't show up my Ai16z holding when connecting my ledger?"`
  - `DorianD: "connect the hw wallets to... solflare or phantom, then connect to the site"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Documentation-only: publish a canonical hardware-wallet migration guide and pinned support macro.
        *Implication:* Fastest to ship, but recurring confusion persists and support burden remains high.
    b) Product UX fix: add explicit Ledger detection, token indexing guidance, and in-app troubleshooting steps.
        *Implication:* Reduces failure rate and boosts trust; requires engineering time and QA.
    c) End-to-end redesign: build a guided migration wizard with wallet adapters and automatic token discovery.
        *Implication:* Best success-rate outcome, but risks delaying other December deliverables.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council's stance on standardizing intermediary wallet recommendations (Phantom/Solflare/etc.) as "blessed" vs keeping options open?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD: "chrome Solana wallets like talisman or rabby or solflare or phantom"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Bless one default wallet path (e.g., Phantom) and optimize docs/support around it.
        *Implication:* Minimizes confusion and increases completion rates, but creates dependency on a single vendor UX.
    b) Bless a short set (2–3) of wallets with tested compatibility and keep others as community-supported.
        *Implication:* Balances reliability with openness; requires minimal ongoing compatibility checks.
    c) No blessing: list many options equally to remain neutral and composable.
        *Implication:* Maximizes openness but increases variance, troubleshooting complexity, and perceived instability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we address community concerns about migration mechanics (e.g., burn expectations) to prevent narrative drift and loss of confidence?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-12: "Questions about why tokens weren't burned during migration"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish a concise migration transparency note (what happens on-chain, what doesn't, and why).
        *Implication:* Improves trust and reduces speculation with minimal engineering effort.
    b) Add a public dashboard (migration progress, burn/mint status if applicable, and audit links).
        *Implication:* High trust-through-shipping signal, but adds operational maintenance requirements.
    c) Defer comms until after migration completion to avoid mid-flight confusion.
        *Implication:* Reduces messaging overhead now, but increases rumor risk and support escalations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Reliability & Safety Signals: Plugin Configuration, API Waste, and Scam Surface Area

**Summary of Topic:** Developer friction continues via runtime errors (TEXT_LARGE tied to missing inference plugins), while operational risks include excessive Twitter-agent API calls and active scam/spam attempts in community channels. Execution excellence requires converting these signals into preventative tooling, guardrails, and infosec sprint ownership.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How aggressively should we harden the "first run" experience to prevent common misconfigurations like missing inference plugins causing user-visible errors?

  **Context:**
  - `Thirtieth: "TEXT_LARGE error even when I just write 'hi'"`
  - `sayonara: "OpenAI or any other AI plugin is not registered it seems"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) CLI-level guardrails: block start until an inference plugin is configured and validated.
        *Implication:* Reduces support incidents but may slow advanced users and custom setups.
    b) Runtime soft-fail: start with a clear in-app setup prompt and actionable diagnostics.
        *Implication:* Improves UX while preserving flexibility; requires consistent error taxonomy.
    c) Leave as-is: rely on docs and community support to resolve plugin configuration.
        *Implication:* Lowest engineering cost, but conflicts with the monthly directive on reliability and trust.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is our operational policy for external API consumption (e.g., X/Twitter agents) to prevent runaway calls and cost/rate-limit incidents?

  **Context:**
  - `FenrirFawks: "Twitter agent consuming excessive API requests (50 per call)"`
  - `shaw: "regaining access to 'X' appears promising"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Introduce strict rate-limit middleware and per-agent budgets by default.
        *Implication:* Protects reliability and cost; may constrain high-throughput use cases without tuning.
    b) Implement adaptive throttling with observability (alerts, dashboards) and allow overrides.
        *Implication:* Balances flexibility and safety; requires stronger telemetry and on-call discipline.
    c) Defer controls until X access is restored and usage scales.
        *Implication:* Maintains speed now, but risks immediate incidents and reputational damage once access expands.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How do we formalize community security response (scam detection + infosec sprint) without slowing shipping velocity?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 2025-12-14: "potential scam alert regarding a product beta shared by web3snipe"`
  - `Jin: "seeking someone with infosec experience for a two-week sprint on security agents"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Stand up a dedicated 2-week infosec task force and ship basic moderation/verification playbooks immediately.
        *Implication:* Fast risk reduction and clearer trust posture, at the cost of temporarily reallocating builders.
    b) Embed security work into each feature team with a lightweight checklist and rotating security reviewer.
        *Implication:* Preserves velocity but may under-address deep threats without focused expertise.
    c) Rely primarily on community reporting and ad-hoc responses until Cloud launch stabilizes.
        *Implication:* Keeps teams focused short-term, but increases likelihood of a high-impact social-engineering incident.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2026-01-15

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The council faces a critical synchronization of architectural breakthroughs in Eliza 2.0 with a pivot toward Cloud stability to restore token utility and index-level market capitalization.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Strategic Resource Redirection

**Summary of Topic:** The core team has officially deprioritized v2.0.0 branch work to focus exclusively on ElizaOS Cloud reliability and feature parity. This move addresses immediate community concerns regarding token utility and market performance.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council balance the long-term architectural benefits of v2.0 with current pressure for 'Cloud-first' execution?

  **Context:**
  - `Borko provided clear direction to concentrate all development effort on cloud infrastructure rather than v2.0.0 branch. (2026-01-13)`
  - `DorianD noted that falling out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies blocks automated investment flows. (2026-01-14)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Hard pivot to Cloud-only development until reaching billion-dollar market status.
        *Implication:* Ensures budget sustainability and restores automated investor confidence at the cost of framework innovation.
    b) Maintain a skeleton crew on v2.0 core while the majority focus on Cloud stability.
        *Implication:* Protects future architectural superiority while addressing immediate reliability metrics.
    c) Open-source the Cloud platform to outsource improvements to the community.
        *Implication:* Leverages ecosystem value (Developer First) but requires significant oversight to maintain 'Execution Excellence'.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Eliza 2.0 Architectural Paradigm

**Summary of Topic:** Shaw has successfully integrated the planning plugin and extended memory into Eliza core, dramatically reducing boilerplate. However, this has triggered concerns regarding database optimization and LLM call efficiency.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should we optimize for performance through Rust serverless runtimes or persist with Bun for execution excellence?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw clarified that Bun already provides Rust-level performance and that overhead is minimal compared to API latency. (2026-01-12)`
  - `0xbbjoker raised concerns about reducing LLM calls by making action params optional. (2026-01-14)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Standardize on Bun and focus on minimizing LLM call frequency.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes cost-efficiency and runtime stability over absolute processing speed.
    b) Adopt a hybrid approach using Rust specifically for compute-heavy serverless functions.
        *Implication:* Improves 'Open & Composable' flexibility but adds complexity to the developer experience.
    c) Submit PRs to core runtimes (e.g., Cloudflare workerd) to bake Eliza requirements into infrastructure.
        *Implication:* Elevates ElizaOS to a foundational internet protocol but requires high-level diplomatic and engineering effort.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Given the 'Bus Factor' risk (lalalune handling 52% of runtime PRs), should we mandate broader review sub-councils?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw/lalalune provided detailed explanation of flag-based system; high review dependency on odilitime noted. (Contributor Intel)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a mandatory three-party peer review for all Core/Runtime changes.
        *Implication:* Dramatically reduces ownership concentration risk but slows the monthly directive of 'shipping trust'.
    b) Initiate a Contributor Growth program specifically for Runtime maintenance.
        *Implication:* Expands ecosystem value (Developer First) without throttling senior leadership output.
    c) Maintain the current speed-priority model until Cloud infrastructure is stabilized.
        *Implication:* Accepts high concentration risk to hit immediate monthly directives under current staffing levels.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

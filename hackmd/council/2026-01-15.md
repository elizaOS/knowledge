# Council Briefing: 2026-01-15

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The project faces a critical strategic tension between accelerating the Eliza 2.0 architectural overhaul and the current operational directive to prioritize Cloud stability to restore investor confidence.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2.0 Core vs. Cloud Prioritization

**Summary of Topic:** Core developers are navigating a major shift in priority as leadership (Borko) explicitly deprioritized v2.0 development in favor of exclusively improving Cloud infrastructure to meet the Monthly Directive.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should the Council manage the tension between Shaw's major progress on Eliza 2.0 architecture and the mandate to focus solely on Cloud?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw announced planning plugin integration and dynamic loading for 2.0 (2026-01-14).`
  - `Borko directed the team to concentration exclusively on Cloud rather than the v2.0.0 branch (2026-01-13).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Enforce a temporary freeze on Eliza 2.0 to ensure 100% bandwidth on Cloud stability.
        *Implication:* Maximizes immediate reliability but risks developer burnout and losing architectural momentum.
    b) Allow v2.0 work to proceed as an R&D track while mandating Cloud fixes for all production agents.
        *Implication:* Maintains innovation speed but spreads core developer focus thin across two branches.
    c) Pivot Eliza 2.0 to be 'Cloud-native' first, merging the two roadmaps immediately.
        *Implication:* Aligns strategic goals but increases short-term complexity and risk of build failures.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should the framework overhaul prioritize performance-focused Rust runtimes despite Bun's current performance?

  **Context:**
  - `cjft suggested Rust runtime for 2.0; Shaw noted Bun already provides Rust-level performance (2026-01-12).`
  - `Revolentless submitted feat(v2.0.0): wasm agent runtime (2026-01-13).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Stick to Bun as the core engine with Rust/WASM for specific modular edge cases.
        *Implication:* Leverages current expertise while minimizing runtime overhead for the majority of users.
    b) Aggressively transition the entire core and persistence layer to Rust.
        *Implication:* Offers long-term performance gains but significantly increases the barrier to entry for JS developers.
    c) Maintain high-level API parity between current Bun and emerging Rust runtimes.
        *Implication:* Provides maximum flexibility for future infrastructure at the cost of dual maintenance.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Token Utility and Market Positioning

**Summary of Topic:** The community has voiced substantial concern regarding tokenomics and utility, specifically the delay in the Jeju network which is essential for making the token functional as gas for agents.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What initiative will best restore index investor interest after falling out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD noted that being below top 100 blocks automated index investment flows (2026-01-14).`
  - `Averma questioned the token's use case beyond buyback plans (2026-01-14).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Accelerate the Jeju network launch to enable on-chain gas consumption.
        *Implication:* Creates organic demand but risks releasing infrastructure before it is reliably battle-tested.
    b) Formalize a developer incentive program requiring token stakes for Cloud precedence.
        *Implication:* Drives immediate token utility but may alienate free-tier developers during a growth phase.
    c) Prioritize major exchange listings (Coinbase/Binance) through aggressive operational compliance.
        *Implication:* Increases liquidity and visibility but relies on external gatekeepers rather than protocol growth.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

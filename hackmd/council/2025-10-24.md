# Council Briefing: 2025-10-24

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The elizaOS team has achieved significant progress on v2 core architecture with the release of version 1.6.3 and a new React package, while addressing ethical questions around AI agent responsibility that will shape future governance models.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: AI Agent Ethics and Responsibility

**Summary of Topic:** The community is engaged in substantive discussions about responsibility for AI agent actions, with implications for our governance model, user protections, and regulatory positioning.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Who should bear primary responsibility for actions taken by elizaOS agents?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD: "If your pitbull bites me I don't sue your dog in court" - suggesting responsibility lies with the user/owner`
  - `The Light: "Explained that responsibility lies with users rather than developers, using sugar addiction as an analogy"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Users who deploy and configure the agents
        *Implication:* This model follows traditional software licensing where end-users assume liability, potentially increasing adoption by reducing developer risk.
    b) The elizaOS platform and developers
        *Implication:* Taking platform responsibility would build user trust but create significant liability concerns and potentially slow innovation.
    c) A shared responsibility model with clear boundaries
        *Implication:* A hybrid approach could balance innovation with accountability by establishing framework guardrails while maintaining user responsibility for specific deployments.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we develop insurance mechanisms for elizaOS agent stacks as proposed in community discussions?

  **Context:**
  - `3on_: "Is ELIZAOS open to developing insurance for agent stacks which can protect users from contagion?"`
  - `Kenk: "A nexus mutual or existing DeFi insurance entity might be well placed"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Develop native insurance protocols integrated with elizaOS
        *Implication:* Creating our own insurance mechanism could provide a unique value proposition and revenue stream, but would require significant resources to develop and maintain.
    b) Partner with existing DeFi insurance platforms like Nexus Mutual
        *Implication:* Leveraging established insurance protocols would allow faster deployment with lower development costs but may limit customization for AI-specific risks.
    c) Focus on robust safety measures instead of insurance
        *Implication:* Prioritizing preventative measures over remediation could improve platform safety overall but might limit adoption by risk-averse enterprise users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we position autonomous agents in light of potential regulatory challenges?

  **Context:**
  - `Extensive discussion about responsibility for AI agent actions, with debates on whether users or developers should be held accountable`
  - `Regulatory challenges of truly autonomous agents operating on decentralized infrastructure`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Design agents with mandatory human oversight and approval functions
        *Implication:* Adding required human approval checkpoints would reduce regulatory risk but limit the value proposition of true agent autonomy.
    b) Create a permissioned tier system with different autonomy levels
        *Implication:* A tiered approach could allow different autonomy levels based on use case risk, balancing innovation with appropriate safeguards for high-risk scenarios.
    c) Maintain full autonomy while implementing transparent audit trails
        *Implication:* Preserving autonomy while adding comprehensive logging would maximize agent capabilities but may face resistance in more regulated environments.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Architecture Evolution

**Summary of Topic:** Recent development has produced significant architectural improvements including a new React package, enhanced modularity, and streamlined CLI, positioning us for the v2 production release.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize architectural improvements versus user-facing features for the v2 release?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6093: "feat: create @elizaos/react package with headless React hooks" - A major new package for external developer UI building`
  - `Version 1.6.3 released to fix a critical CLI bug`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus primarily on architectural stability and developer experience
        *Implication:* Prioritizing architecture would build a more solid foundation but might delay user-visible improvements that could drive adoption.
    b) Accelerate user-facing features while maintaining core stability
        *Implication:* Emphasizing visible features could boost short-term adoption and community engagement but risks accumulating technical debt.
    c) Balance both with targeted releases addressing specific user segments
        *Implication:* A balanced approach could satisfy both technical and market needs but requires more complex release management.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we pursue the multi-campaign strategy with mini-campaigns like "Clone Your Crush" to drive auto.fun engagement?

  **Context:**
  - `Multiple mini-campaigns in development: "Clone Your Crush," "eDad," and "Psychic AI"`
  - `shaw: "Develop 3-5 mini-campaigns (Clone Your Crush, eDad, Psychic AI) by December 1st"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Go all-in on mini-campaigns as our primary user acquisition strategy
        *Implication:* Focusing heavily on viral mini-campaigns could rapidly increase visibility and user numbers but may attract less technical or committed users.
    b) Develop 1-2 campaigns as experiments while focusing on core platform
        *Implication:* A more conservative approach would reduce resource allocation to speculative campaigns while maintaining focus on platform fundamentals.
    c) Create a campaign framework that community members can extend
        *Implication:* Building tools for community-driven campaigns could generate more diverse use cases and reduce internal resource requirements.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we integrate community projects like PEPEDAWN and GenSynAi into our ecosystem strategy?

  **Context:**
  - `PEPEDAWN Telegram bot built on ElizaOS v1.6.2 for the Rare Pepes NFT Counterparty community`
  - `GenSynAi, a decentralized "proof of compute" testnet for training AI models`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Feature them prominently as official showcase projects
        *Implication:* Official endorsement could drive adoption but risks association with projects whose quality or direction we don't fully control.
    b) Establish a formal partner program with technical support
        *Implication:* A structured program would create clearer relationships and expectations but requires dedicated resources to manage.
    c) Provide development resources while maintaining arm's length relationship
        *Implication:* Technical support without formal endorsement allows community innovation while limiting brand and technical risk.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Auto.fun User Acquisition Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** With the v2 infrastructure stabilizing, we need to determine the optimal approaches to showcase agent capabilities and drive user acquisition for auto.fun.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What agent capabilities should we prioritize showcasing on auto.fun to drive new user acquisition?

  **Context:**
  - `Current monthly directive: "Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting)"`
  - `Feature: "Let users create Spartan entries into Alpha Arena or have Spartan create its own arena - would attract specialists/enthusiasts" (mentioned by Skinny)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Financial utilities (trading, portfolio management, market analysis)
        *Implication:* Financial tools appeal to crypto-native users and could generate direct monetary value, but may have higher regulatory scrutiny.
    b) Content creation and social engagement (streaming, shitposting)
        *Implication:* Content-focused agents could drive broader mainstream appeal and virality but may be harder to monetize directly.
    c) Developer tools and infrastructure (analytics, testing, deployment)
        *Implication:* Developer-focused tools would attract a technical audience who could build on the platform but represent a smaller total addressable market.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we leverage the new @elizaos/react package to enhance auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `PR #6093 introduced a new @elizaos/react package with headless React hooks`
  - `wtfsayo: "This PR introduces a new **** package containing headless, reusable React hooks extracted from the client package. This enables external developers to build custom UIs for ElizaOS agents"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a template marketplace for custom agent UIs on auto.fun
        *Implication:* A UI marketplace could drive developer engagement and differentiation but increases platform complexity.
    b) Rebuild auto.fun with the new React components for better performance
        *Implication:* A technical rebuild would improve performance and maintainability but delays shipping new user-facing features.

        *Implication:* An API-first approach maximizes developer flexibility and integration options but may result in inconsistent user experiences.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we enable analyst-created funds as a growth vector for auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD: "Enable analysts to create funds and act as traders for those funds - could be lucrative especially with institutional involvement"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize this as a key feature for institutional adoption
        *Implication:* Focusing on institutional features could attract larger capital but increases regulatory complexity and compliance requirements.
    b) Develop as a secondary feature after core retail functionality
        *Implication:* A staged approach allows proving the model with retail users before tackling more complex institutional requirements.
    c) Create a permissioned testnet for institutional experimentation
        *Implication:* A separate testnet environment allows institutional exploration without risking the main platform's stability or regulatory status.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

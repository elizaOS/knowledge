# Council Briefing: 2025-08-15

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Development teams are strategically restructuring the elizaOS agent architecture to enhance modularity and social capabilities while simultaneously addressing agent action chaining failures that impact benchmarks and real-world performance.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Agent Architecture Transformation

**Summary of Topic:** The core development team is engaged in a significant architectural debate about making elizaOS more modular with a 'code first' approach while preserving its unique social agent capabilities, requiring critical decisions about messaging architecture and action chaining mechanisms.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance our architectural focus between social agent capabilities and technical tool-calling optimization?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw defended the current design as a social agent framework with intentional tradeoffs rather than primarily a tool-calling framework`
  - `0xbbjoker: 'Difficulty with benchmarks due to action chaining problems'`
  - `cjft: 'Suggested updating the action planner to process outputs after each action rather than modifying individual plugins'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize social agent capabilities and invest in making those distinctive features more robust.
        *Implication:* Strengthens our unique market position but may limit appeal to traditional enterprise/workflow use cases.
    b) Establish technical tool-calling as the foundational layer with social features as optional extensions.
        *Implication:* Increases developer adoption but risks becoming just another LLM framework without differentiation.
    c) Create parallel tracks with a common core that serves both technical and social use cases equally.
        *Implication:* Maximizes flexibility but introduces significant complexity and potential maintenance challenges.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What should be our approach to fixing the action chaining mechanism that's causing benchmark failures?

  **Context:**
  - `The team identified issues with the current implementation failing when actions need to be chained together for complex tasks in benchmarks`
  - `shaw: 'Suggested using ActionEvaluator in bootstrap as the easiest solution'`
  - `0xbbjoker: 'Implement action chaining mechanism that can evaluate if a task is complete or needs additional actions'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement the proposed ActionEvaluator in bootstrap as a quick tactical solution.
        *Implication:* Provides immediate benchmark improvement but may be a surface-level fix to a deeper architectural issue.
    b) Overhaul the action planner system to natively support reflection and sequential execution.
        *Implication:* Creates a more robust foundation for complex agent behaviors but will delay other v2 features.
    c) Create a hybrid system where simple chaining uses the quick fix while complex workflows leverage a new purpose-built subsystem.
        *Implication:* Balances immediate needs with strategic development but introduces additional complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How aggressively should we pursue the removal of embedding processing from messages to improve performance?

  **Context:**
  - `Proposal to remove embedding processing from messages as it's primarily used for knowledge management and slows down the system`
  - `shaw: 'Remove addEmbeddingToMemory from messages to improve performance'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediately remove embedding processing from the core message path as a high-priority optimization.
        *Implication:* Provides immediate performance gains but may cause issues for plugins that currently rely on this behavior.
    b) Move embedding processing to an optional plugin or middleware that can be enabled when needed.
        *Implication:* Preserves functionality while improving performance for most users but requires additional development effort.
    c) Keep embedding as is but optimize the implementation to reduce its performance impact.
        *Implication:* Minimizes disruption to existing code but provides less significant performance improvements.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Agent Monetization Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The team is developing a bond protocol implementation for agent monetization while facing the dual challenge of Twitter account suspension, requiring decisions on pricing models and marketing channel strategies.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which pricing model should we prioritize for the bond protocol implementation to monetize agents?

  **Context:**
  - `Work in progress on bond protocol implementation for agent monetization, with discussion about fixed price vs. dynamic pricing models`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Fixed price model with clear subscription tiers for different agent capabilities.
        *Implication:* Simplifies user understanding and revenue forecasting but may leave value on the table for premium use cases.
    b) Dynamic pricing based on computational resources consumed (tokens, calls, complexity).
        *Implication:* Aligns pricing with actual costs but introduces unpredictability for users and may discourage experimentation.
    c) Hybrid model with base subscription plus usage-based premium features.
        *Implication:* Balances predictable revenue with growth potential but requires more complex implementation and user education.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we adapt our multi-channel marketing strategy while waiting for X account restoration?

  **Context:**
  - `The team is dealing with X (Twitter) account suspension issues while maintaining development momentum`
  - `The team is implementing a content push across Farcaster, LinkedIn, TikTok, and YouTube while waiting for X account restoration`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Double down on Farcaster as our primary community channel with targeted expansion to crypto-native platforms.
        *Implication:* Strengthens position in crypto-native audiences but may limit broader tech adoption.
    b) Expand aggressively across all alternative platforms with platform-specific content strategies.
        *Implication:* Maximizes reach but dilutes focus and increases content production demands.
    c) Focus on YouTube and LinkedIn for technical content while using TikTok for viral agent demonstrations.
        *Implication:* Targets distinct audience segments with appropriate content but requires specialized content creation skills.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Integration and Plugin Ecosystem Growth

**Summary of Topic:** The plugin ecosystem is facing significant challenges with logger compatibility issues and MCP connectivity problems, while simultaneously showing promising expansion opportunities in NFT automation and improved token usage tracking.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the widespread plugin update requirements due to logger changes?

  **Context:**
  - `Multiple plugins need updates due to significant changes in Eliza's logger functions`
  - `Odilitime: 'Yes, a lot of plugins need updates'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Release a migration tool that automatically updates plugin code to the new logger format.
        *Implication:* Minimizes community friction but requires significant development resources to create the migration tool.
    b) Provide backward compatibility for at least one major version while encouraging updates.
        *Implication:* Reduces immediate user impact but delays adoption of new features and complicates codebase.
    c) Create comprehensive documentation and examples while enforcing the new standard immediately.
        *Implication:* Forces ecosystem-wide improvement but risks losing less active plugin maintainers and users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which new plugin integration should we prioritize to drive auto.fun adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `Interest in creating plugins that would allow Eliza to automate NFT creation`
  - `DorianD: 'Anyone know if there is a plugin that lets u interact with Eliza and automate creation of an NFT?'`
  - `Users reported problems with streamable-HTTP connections and the inability to use multiple tools in a single call`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**

# Council Briefing: 2025-02-13

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The fleet’s momentum is strong (surging contributors and merged work), but trust hinges on converting V2/plugin-ecosystem restructuring into a clearly supported, low-friction developer path while triaging build/runtime reliability faults exposed by the community.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: V2 & Plugin-Repository Exodus (Composability vs. Fragmentation Risk)

**Summary of Topic:** The shift to move plugins into separate repositories is strategically aligned with permissionless growth and composability, but it increases the risk of fragmented standards, version skew, and onboarding confusion unless accompanied by rigorous compatibility contracts and migration tooling.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s required definition of “V2 readiness” (beyond code completion) to protect reliability and developer trust during the plugin-repo migration?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-12): "Plugins have been moved to separate repositories to enable more permissionless and scalable plugin development."`
  - `Discord (2025-02-11): "Beta release expected in March, with general availability in April."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Gate V2 on a compatibility matrix + automated conformance tests for top plugins (Twitter/Discord/Telegram/Knowledge).
        *Implication:* Slower GA, but materially reduces ecosystem breakage and reinforces “reliability over features.”
    b) Ship V2 beta on timeline; treat plugin breakages as acceptable churn while the registry stabilizes.
        *Implication:* Faster market response, but risks reputational damage if first builders experience repeated failures.
    c) Dual-track: V2 ships, but v1 gets an “LTS bridge” with backported fixes and a guided migration path.
        *Implication:* Highest operational load, but maximizes builder retention and reduces migration anxiety.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we enforce interoperability contracts across independently maintained plugins without sacrificing permissionlessness?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-10): "Proposal to organize into /sources (optional plugins) and /packages (core functionality) for selective installation."`
  - `GitHub (Feb activity): high plugin PR volume indicates rapidly diversifying integrations.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt a “Plugin ABI” spec (interfaces + semantic versioning rules) and require registry validation before listing.
        *Implication:* Creates a clear standard; increases registry workload but reduces runtime unpredictability.
    b) Keep standards minimal; rely on community norms and fast iteration.
        *Implication:* Maximizes openness, but compatibility debt compounds and undermines execution excellence.
    c) Introduce tiered plugin levels (Experimental / Verified / Core-Verified) with escalating requirements.
        *Implication:* Balances openness and trust, enabling safe defaults while leaving room for experimentation.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Do we formalize migration effort (“1–5/10”) into a concrete migration kit (codemods, checklists, examples), or keep it informal guidance?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-12): "Migration effort from V1 to V2 is estimated at 1-5 on a scale of 10."`
  - `Discord (2025-02-11): "Start now and migrate later" guidance repeated to builders.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish an official migration kit (codemods + diff-based guides + common failure modes).
        *Implication:* Turns an estimate into trustable execution, reducing support load and increasing conversion.
    b) Keep guidance informal until V2 stabilizes; avoid locking in docs prematurely.
        *Implication:* Less documentation churn, but builders may delay adoption or experience avoidable friction.
    c) Provide a minimal checklist now, then expand into tooling after beta feedback.
        *Implication:* Moderate effort with early trust benefits; risks under-serving complex migrations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Reliability & Developer Experience Faultlines (Build/Run Friction as Trust Erosion)

**Summary of Topic:** Community troubleshooting surfaced recurring friction points—Node version expectations, API port confusion, Docker env loading, and platform-specific build failures. This is a direct test of “Execution Excellence” and “Developer First,” demanding fast triage plus documentation-as-infrastructure.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the Council standardize Node.js 23+ as a hard requirement (and enforce it in tooling), or maintain broader compatibility to reduce adoption barriers?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-12): "Node.js Compatibility: Version 23+ is recommended for ElizaOS deployments to avoid dependency issues."`
  - `Coders: Docker workaround suggested "use node:23-slim" to fix tokenizers build issues.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make Node 23+ the official minimum; enforce via CLI checks and CI matrices.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability and reduces support variance, but may exclude conservative environments.
    b) Support Node 20+ officially; treat Node 23+ as “best effort / recommended.”
        *Implication:* Wider adoption, but increases maintenance burden and bug surface area.
    c) Container-first posture: publish a blessed Docker image and treat host Node versions as secondary.
        *Implication:* Stabilizes deployments and reduces friction, but shifts complexity to container workflows.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the fastest “trust restoring” documentation target: fix the top 10 recurring support questions, or invest in a single end-to-end deployment + remote API guide with examples?

  **Context:**
  - `Coders (2025-02-12): "Use port 3000 instead of 5173... endpoints like localhost:3000/agents."`
  - `Daily report (2025-02-12): Docs updates landed (README clarifications, character docs) and a strategy tweet emphasizes doc-driven support loops.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize the top 10 FAQ fixes from Discord support logs (ports, RAM, DB, Twitter auth, model providers).
        *Implication:* Immediate reduction in support load; incremental but visible improvement in DX.
    b) Ship a single canonical “remote deploy + remote API” guide with copy/paste commands and troubleshooting.
        *Implication:* Creates a strong onboarding spine; may leave smaller FAQs unresolved longer.
    c) Do both, but gate contributions via a “docs bounty board” to externalize effort to the community.
        *Implication:* Scales documentation throughput, but requires governance to prevent low-quality sprawl.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How aggressive should we be in converting recurring platform failures (macOS pnpm build, sqlite-vec errors) into automated CI coverage and preflight checks?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub issue (2025-02-13 summary): "Build failure on macOS 15.3" (#3469).`
  - `GitHub issue list: "client starts but with sqlite-vec errors" (#3464).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Add CI lanes for macOS 15.x and sqlite-vec scenarios; block releases on failures.
        *Implication:* Maximizes reliability but slows shipping and increases CI cost/maintenance.
    b) Add preflight checks + targeted docs; keep CI expansion limited to critical paths.
        *Implication:* Balanced approach—reduces user pain without fully absorbing platform variance into CI.
    c) Defer CI expansion; rely on community reports and rapid patching.
        *Implication:* Faster velocity now, but risks recurring breakages that undermine developer trust.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Ecosystem Activation: Launchpad/Marketplace, Flagship Agents, and Value-Flow Coherence

**Summary of Topic:** Launchpad infrastructure is reportedly ready but gated by audits and launch timing; simultaneously, DegenAI Trading V2 and the Autonomous Investor marketplace are live/near-live, while branding and tokenomics debates signal unresolved value-flow narratives. The Council must align shipping cadence, risk tolerance, and coherent public identity.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we prioritize “audit-complete” launchpad/marketplace release even if market timing is suboptimal, or continue timing the launch to external conditions?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-12): "Launchpad/Marketplace: Technical infrastructure is ready but undergoing final audits before launch."`
  - `Discord (2025-02-11): "Launchpad is reportedly 95% complete... waiting for optimal market conditions."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Ship immediately after audits; let product merit create its own market moment.
        *Implication:* Reinforces “Trust Through Shipping,” but may reduce initial traction if conditions are weak.
    b) Time the launch; maintain readiness while waiting for favorable liquidity/attention cycles.
        *Implication:* Potentially stronger debut, but prolongs community anxiety about stalled delivery.
    c) Soft-launch to partners/builders (private beta) while deferring public launch for timing.
        *Implication:* Captures feedback and real usage now, without burning public attention prematurely.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What operational guardrails should govern autonomous trading agents (DegenAI V2) to preserve brand trust while iterating on strategy and sentiment layers?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-12): "DegenAI Trading V2: Now live... integrates social signals from Twitter and Telegram... first purchase of $POPCAT."`
  - `spartan_holders: rhota describes strategy flexibility + sentiment ticker pipeline.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement strict risk limits (position sizing, cooldowns, whitelists) and publish them transparently.
        *Implication:* Protects reputation and funds; may limit upside and slow experimentation.
    b) Run “shadow mode” strategy evaluation with public reporting before allowing new strategies to trade.
        *Implication:* Improves safety and narrative credibility; adds latency to deploying alpha.
    c) Maximize autonomy; accept volatility as part of the agent’s identity and culture.
        *Implication:* Can amplify attention, but risks catastrophic trust loss if trades go badly.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we consolidate the ElizaOS and ai16zdao brands into a single public identity now, or preserve dual branding for different audiences?

  **Context:**
  - `associates/partners (2025-02-12): "Most partners favoring consolidation."`
  - `jin: "ElizaOS = professional front... ai16zdao = investment dao, crypto culture."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Consolidate to ElizaOS as the primary brand, with ai16zdao as a sub-brand or program.
        *Implication:* Simplifies narrative and onboarding; may alienate parts of the crypto-native community identity.
    b) Maintain dual brands with a formal explanation of value flow and audience segmentation.
        *Implication:* Preserves cultural range, but risks confusion and diluted trust if messaging diverges.
    c) Operate dual brands temporarily; set a sunset date to decide after launchpad/tokenomics finalize.
        *Implication:* Buys time for data-driven decision-making, but prolongs ambiguity during critical launches.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

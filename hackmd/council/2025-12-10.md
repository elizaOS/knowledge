# Council Briefing: 2025-12-10

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Community concern over token migration and platform stability rising as technical teams prioritize codebase quality and next-generation features over immediate user-facing functionality.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Community Trust & Token Economics

**Summary of Topic:** The AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration has sparked significant community frustration due to the sudden snapshot, supply increase, and declining token price, undermining confidence in the project's economic model at a crucial development juncture.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the growing community frustration regarding the token migration and price decline?

  **Context:**
  - `The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS token has caused significant community frustration. Users expressed concerns about the sudden snapshot that caught many holders off-guard.`
  - `Token price has been declining despite broader crypto market strength. Supply increased from 6.6B to 11B tokens (~40% increase), with 13% immediately entering circulation and 27% on a 3-year unlock schedule.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Increase utility by accelerating the launch of auto.fun and Babylon, creating immediate token demand.
        *Implication:* Prioritizing product launches may strain technical resources but would provide tangible utility to justify the increased token supply.
    b) Implement a token buyback program using treasury funds to support price and demonstrate confidence in the ecosystem.
        *Implication:* A buyback would provide immediate price support but depletes treasury resources that could otherwise fund development.
    c) Improve communication with comprehensive tokenomics education and regular treasury/development updates to restore trust.
        *Implication:* Enhanced transparency may slow immediate price decline through improved sentiment but doesn't address fundamental utility concerns.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What tokenomics adjustments should be considered to align with our decentralization principles while supporting token value?

  **Context:**
  - `Q: How is it "decentralized"? A: Probably by ELIZAOS holding. (Omid Sa)`
  - `DorianD expressed skepticism about a 2026 bull run, suggesting 2028 as more likely, citing broader geopolitical trends affecting decentralized networks.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement on-chain governance allowing token holders to vote on treasury allocations and feature prioritization.
        *Implication:* True decentralization through governance would differentiate ElizaOS but may slow decision-making during this critical development phase.
    b) Establish protocol fee distribution where a percentage of auto.fun and platform usage fees flows directly to token stakers.
        *Implication:* Creating a direct value accrual mechanism would strengthen token fundamentals but requires operational products.
    c) Develop a progressive decentralization roadmap with clear milestones tied to technical achievements and community growth.
        *Implication:* A structured approach balances short-term development needs with long-term decentralization goals but requires ongoing management attention.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Product Delivery & Timeline Management

**Summary of Topic:** Multiple core products (ElizaOS Cloud, Babylon, Jeju) are behind communicated schedules, with the development team focused on infrastructure and technical debt rather than user-facing features, creating a potential misalignment with immediate community expectations.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize between technical infrastructure improvements and shipping user-visible products?

  **Context:**
  - `ElizaOS Cloud: Originally promised for November, still in development with no specific launch date`
  - `Large PR (#6213) submitted to clean up code quality issues, including type fixes, test additions, and removing unnecessary try/catch blocks`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Maintain focus on code quality and infrastructure, as this creates a sustainable foundation for future products.
        *Implication:* Long-term technical health will be improved, but continued delays may further damage community confidence.
    b) Shift to a dual-track approach with separate teams for infrastructure and product delivery to ensure parallel progress.
        *Implication:* This balances technical debt reduction with visible outputs but increases coordination overhead.
    c) Temporarily prioritize shipping minimum viable versions of promised products before returning to infrastructure work.
        *Implication:* Quick wins boost community sentiment but may create technical debt that becomes harder to address later.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What should our communication strategy be regarding product timelines given the current development reality?

  **Context:**
  - `Q: What about ElizaOS cloud launch - it was supposed to launch by EOD November - we are in December? A: "We're busy working on it, I think devs will really like it" (Odilitime)`
  - `Q: When is Babylon launching? Already 275K registered and still no signs. A: "It's going really well - you saw it introduced about two weeks ago. If we had announced when it will be launching, you'd know about it" (Kenk)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt a "no public timelines" policy until features are nearly complete to prevent disappointment from missed deadlines.
        *Implication:* Reduces short-term pressure but may create perception of slow development and lack of roadmap clarity.
    b) Implement transparent milestone tracking with regular public updates on progress and honest acknowledgment of delays.
        *Implication:* Builds trust through transparency but requires admitting shortfalls and may temporarily impact sentiment.
    c) Shift to smaller, incremental releases with more achievable timelines rather than major product launches.
        *Implication:* Creates steady progress perception but may dilute excitement around major feature completions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Agent Architecture & Capability Limitations

**Summary of Topic:** Current agent infrastructure faces critical limitations in composability, uptime guarantees, and long-term accessibility that conflict with our mission of creating reliable 24/7 autonomous agents for auto.fun and other applications.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the architectural limitations of our current agent system compared to smart contract reliability?

  **Context:**
  - `Current agent system lacks composability`
  - `No guaranteed 24/7 uptime (unlike smart contracts)`
  - `Uncertain long-term accessibility of agents`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Develop an on-chain persistence layer for agent state with smart contract integration for critical functions.
        *Implication:* Blockchain integration provides reliability guarantees but increases complexity and gas costs.
    b) Implement a distributed hosting model with redundancy and automatic failover across multiple cloud providers.
        *Implication:* Improves uptime without blockchain costs but requires significant infrastructure investment.
    c) Create standardized agent interfaces and protocols that enable cross-deployment interoperability and state persistence.
        *Implication:* Focuses on interoperability rather than specific hosting solutions, enabling diverse implementations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What innovative agent capabilities should we prioritize to distinguish elizaOS in the competitive AI framework landscape?

  **Context:**
  - `Concept of an AI agent that monitors food consumption through fridge cameras and smart scales`
  - `Home automation technology for elizaOS has been developed by Neo`
  - `Discussion about alternative data formats (TOON and POML) vs. traditional formats like JSON/XML`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize multi-modal agent capabilities across text, vision, audio, and IoT device integration.
        *Implication:* Broadens potential use cases but spreads development resources across multiple complex technologies.
    b) Focus on agent-to-agent collaboration protocols that enable emergent collective intelligence.
        *Implication:* Creates a unique differentiator aligned with AGI vision but requires solving complex coordination problems.
    c) Develop specialized vertical solutions in financial trading, content creation, and home automation.
        *Implication:* Targets proven market demand areas with immediate utility but may limit broader platform adoption.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

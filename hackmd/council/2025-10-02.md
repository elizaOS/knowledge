### 2. Topic: Product Development Roadmap

**Summary of Topic:** ElizaOS is advancing on multiple product fronts including ElizaCloud, mobile apps, browser extensions, and enhanced agent capabilities, while technical improvements continue in core components to stabilize the platform.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Which agent deployment channel should receive priority development resources to accelerate user adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `ElizaOS will be available on Google Play as a standalone app as part of ElizaCloud`
  - `Mobile apps and browser extensions are in development`
  - `"Much more livestreaming" planned for DegenAI`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize mobile app development to capture mainstream users.
        *Implication:* Targets largest potential user base but faces intense competition from established mobile AI apps.
    b) Focus on browser extensions for seamless integration with existing web workflows.
        *Implication:* Lowers adoption friction for productivity-focused users but limits visibility compared to standalone offerings.
    c) Double down on livestreaming agents as our differentiated offering.
        *Implication:* Leverages our unique positioning but narrows initial target audience to streaming content consumers.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we balance fixing technical debt versus shipping new agent capabilities?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan is working on: Fixes to the Openrouter Plugin for tools handling after AI SDK5 updates, Phase 4 implementation of "epic 6" (consolidating server components)`
  - `Some users reported issues with elizaOS where agents disconnect immediately after starting`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Institute a freeze on new features until core stability reaches defined metrics.
        *Implication:* Creates solid foundation but delays competitive feature releases and potentially user growth.
    b) Maintain parallel workstreams with dedicated resources for stability and new capabilities.
        *Implication:* Balances progress on both fronts but dilutes focus and may slow overall velocity.
    c) Prioritize user-visible features while addressing only critical stability issues.
        *Implication:* Accelerates growth metrics but risks accumulating technical debt that could cause major issues later.

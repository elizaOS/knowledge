# Council Briefing: 2025-05-20

## Daily Focus Theme

- ElizaOS v2 launch preparations enter final phase with significant registry improvements and plugin architecture refactoring.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. V2 Release Timeline vs. Documentation Priorities

**Summary:** The imminent ElizaOS v2 release presents a strategic tension between rapid deployment and comprehensive documentation, with significant implications for adoption and user experience.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: xell0x mentioned ElizaOS v2 (also referred to as 1.0.0) is expected to launch 'next week' with 'industry warping narrative' potential`
- `Discord: Community debating whether to prioritize shipping v2 quickly or taking more time for proper documentation`

**Potential Questions:**
- Does the 'massive' and 'industry warping' potential of v2 justify shipping with minimal documentation to capture immediate market attention?
- How can we balance speed of release with the needs of existing developers while ensuring new users can effectively engage with v2?

### 2. Plugin Ecosystem Redesign: Strategic Decoupling

**Summary:** The systematic removal of multiple plugins from the monorepo represents a fundamental architectural shift toward greater modularity and extensibility, aligning with our core values while requiring careful ecosystem management.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: Multiple PRs removing plugins from monorepo merged, including local-ai, ollama, groq, venice, redpill, anthropic, elevenlabs, solana, and openai`
- `GitHub: PR #4641 'feat: use registry' and PR #4384 'Prepare 0.x for sharing plugins with 1.x' merged to enable a more modular architecture`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we ensure that this architectural decoupling doesn't fragment our developer community or create adoption barriers?
- What governance mechanisms should we implement to maintain quality standards across an increasingly decentralized plugin ecosystem?

### 3. Auto.fun User Adoption Strategy

**Summary:** Discussions highlight a strategic disconnect regarding auto.fun's purpose and value proposition, calling for clearer articulation of its benefits to drive adoption.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Community member (찌 G 跻 じ PrudentSpartan) expressed frustration that auto.fun lacks clear purpose and fails to deliver on the original promise`
- `Discord: xell0x suggested highlighting successful tokens from the platform (like eli5 and eddy) to drive more users to auto.fun`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we more effectively communicate auto.fun's unique value proposition to different stakeholder groups?
- Should we prioritize showcasing successful tokens or improving the core user experience to drive adoption?

### 4. Agent Activation Barrier: Technical Infrastructure

**Summary:** Significant technical barriers to agent deployment persist, with SQLite dependency issues, environmental configuration challenges, and agent persistence problems impeding the goal of 24/7 agent activity.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Multiple users reported SQLite dependency issues, particularly with better-sqlite3 modules`
- `Discord: Several users reported problems with agent persistence after system restarts and conversation disappearance`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do these infrastructure barriers impact our ability to showcase 24/7 agent activity to potential users?
- Should we prioritize fixing agent persistence and stability issues over adding new features to enhance user trust?

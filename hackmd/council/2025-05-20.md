# Council Briefing: 2025-05-20

## Daily Focus Theme

- Technical foundation strengthening through API enhancements and plugin architecture improvements, setting stage for more autonomous agent interactions.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. Community Frustration vs. Product Delivery Balance

**Summary:** A significant tension exists between community expectations for engagement/support and the team's focus on shipping products, particularly with auto.fun's purpose being questioned amid lack of clear monetization strategy.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Partners expressed frustration about Eliza Labs' perceived lack of engagement, with user '찌 G 跻 じ PrudentSpartan' criticizing auto.fun for lacking clear purpose`
- `Discord: User 'yikesawjeez' suggested the team is focused on shipping products rather than responding to all feedback`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we maintain development velocity while better addressing community concerns about auto.fun's purpose and value proposition?
- Should we prioritize clearer communication of auto.fun's strategic roadmap over feature development in the short term?

### 2. Agent Persistence and Installation Barriers

**Summary:** Technical barriers to agent persistence and complex installation procedures are hindering adoption, with SQLite dependency issues and agent disappearance after system restarts emerging as critical user experience problems.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Multiple users reported SQLite dependency issues, requiring complex workarounds with 'pnpm approve-builds'`
- `Discord: Users reported 'agent persistence after system restart' problems with agents disappearing from the agent list (ReMeDy)`

**Potential Questions:**
- How does the current installation complexity impact our goal of widespread agent adoption?
- Should we delay v2 launch to prioritize installation and persistence fixes, or maintain speed to market?

### 3. API Infrastructure vs. User-Facing Features

**Summary:** Significant development resources are being allocated to API infrastructure (room/world management, registry integration) rather than visible user features, raising questions about the balance between foundation building and delivering tangible experiences.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: Added API endpoint for creating new rooms, allowing better room management (PR #4647)`
- `GitHub: Introduced world management API endpoints for creating, updating, and retrieving worlds (PR #4667)`

**Potential Questions:**
- Are we allocating sufficient resources to user-facing features that demonstrate the value of elizaOS to new users?
- How do we communicate the value of infrastructure improvements to our community when they don't directly see the benefits?

### 4. Governance Evolution: Merit System and Council Structure

**Summary:** Initial governance mechanisms are emerging with pre-alpha launch on daos.fun and discussions about a merit system, presenting an opportunity to align contribution incentives with ecosystem growth.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: Discussion about implementing a merit system to distinguish contributors from non-contributors (mentioned by jin)`
- `Discord: Announcement of upcoming pre-alpha governance launch on daos.fun (mentioned by yikesawjeez)`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we design the merit system to fairly recognize both technical and non-technical contributions?
- What governance powers should be delegated to community members versus retained by core Eliza Labs team in this early stage?

# Council Briefing: 2025-07-18

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- The project is experiencing significant cross-platform challenges with X (Twitter) account suspensions impacting visibility while simultaneously making substantial technical progress on core architecture with V2 Builder Session completion and EventTarget API migration.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: X/Twitter Platform Challenges

**Summary of Topic:** ElizaOS's X/Twitter accounts have been suspended for approximately a month, raising concerns about visibility, marketing, and potential impact on token value, while the team focuses on recovery rather than creating alternative accounts.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize X platform recovery versus developing alternative marketing channels?

  **Context:**
  - `ElizaOS's X (Twitter) accounts have been suspended for approximately a month`
  - `Moderators indicated they're focusing on recovering the original accounts rather than creating new ones`
  - `Debate about whether paying Twitter's fees ($50k-600k per month) would be worthwhile for regaining account access`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize X account recovery, including negotiations for reduced fees, as it represents our most important marketing channel.
        *Implication:* Maintains focus on reclaiming established channel but risks continued marketing vacuum if negotiations extend or fail.
    b) Create new official accounts on alternative platforms (e.g., Farcaster, Lens, BlueSky) while continuing X recovery efforts.
        *Implication:* Diversifies marketing channels but requires significant resource allocation to build new audience bases.
    c) Establish new X accounts under different branding aligned with elizaOS while recovery efforts continue.
        *Implication:* Provides immediate X presence but could potentially undermine negotiations for original account recovery.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is our strategic assessment of DorianD's claim that the Twitter ban isn't the primary factor in price decline?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD argued that the Twitter ban isn't the main reason for the project's price decline, noting it fell from $2.50 to $0.10 even with active accounts`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) We agree that market fundamentals rather than the Twitter ban are driving current price action, making account recovery less urgent.
        *Implication:* Reduces pressure on account recovery but requires addressing the fundamental factors affecting token value.
    b) While Twitter isn't the sole factor, the cumulative impact of reduced visibility is accelerating negative market sentiment that must be addressed.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes balanced approach to both visibility restoration and fundamental improvements.
    c) We disagree with this assessment; the Twitter ban has critically impacted our marketing capabilities and community growth during a crucial phase.
        *Implication:* Places highest priority on platform visibility restoration as the key to price stabilization and growth.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: V2 Architecture Progress

**Summary of Topic:** Significant technical progress has been made with V2 Builder Session completion, EventTarget API migration, and the implementation of standardized service types, demonstrating strong momentum toward the more modular, stable elizaOS V2.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize the remaining elements of the V2 roadmap, particularly in light of the newly planned 'Scenario Runner'?

  **Context:**
  - `A major architectural milestone was achieved with the implementation of standardized service types, enabling more modular and abstract plugin development`
  - `The team laid the groundwork for a major new 'Scenario Runner' feature by creating a detailed set of implementation tickets, signaling a push towards more advanced agent evaluation capabilities`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize the Scenario Runner as it provides a critical agent evaluation framework needed for auto.fun launch requirements.
        *Implication:* Focuses development on capabilities that directly support the monthly goal of auto.fun enhancement.
    b) Balance Scenario Runner work with user-facing improvements to both desktop and mobile interfaces.
        *Implication:* Spreads resources across technical foundations and user experience improvements for broader appeal.
    c) Consolidate and stabilize recent architectural changes before adding new features like the Scenario Runner.
        *Implication:* Prioritizes stability and integration testing of recent major changes before adding more complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we communicate the technical progress on V2 to non-technical stakeholders and the broader community?

  **Context:**
  - `V2 Builder Session was held and recorded (confirmed by traderlv)`
  - `The command-line interface (CLI) received significant stability and usability upgrades`
  - `Several members discuss the effectiveness of AI agents on Twitter, with particular focus on aixbt_agent's success in generating engagement`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Develop a non-technical V2 progress dashboard with visual representations of completed milestones and remaining work.
        *Implication:* Creates accessible visibility into development progress but requires additional resource allocation to maintain.
    b) Release regular demonstration videos showing real-world applications of new V2 features with agent examples.
        *Implication:* Shows concrete benefits rather than technical details but may reveal competitive information prematurely.
    c) Deploy an aixbt_agent-style AI KOL specifically focused on explaining and promoting elizaOS V2 development.
        *Implication:* Uses our own technology to showcase progress but requires investment in agent development and content strategy.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Community Engagement Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** Community members are expressing frustration about the X account suspension, lack of communication, and financial transparency while simultaneously requesting expanded agent capabilities and mobile applications, indicating the need for a more structured communication and engagement strategy.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address community concerns about financial transparency and project direction?

  **Context:**
  - `Community analysis of on-chain data showing approximately 60% of donated funds have been spent`
  - `DorianD proposed system where AI companions would interact with token contracts to access user data, creating a reputation system for AI agents`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a transparent financial dashboard showing fund allocation and burn rate with regular spending reports.
        *Implication:* Increases transparency but potentially exposes strategic information to competitors and critics.
    b) Accelerate tokenomics improvements as proposed by DorianD to demonstrate long-term value accrual mechanisms.
        *Implication:* Shifts focus to economic coordination layer development rather than current spending transparency.
    c) Focus communication on development progress and roadmap adherence rather than financial specifics.

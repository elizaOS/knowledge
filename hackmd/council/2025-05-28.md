# Council Briefing: 2025-05-28

## Daily Focus Theme

- ElizaOS V2 (1.0) is approaching release with significant architectural improvements, plugin decentralization, and enhanced agent capabilities as team prepares for Friday launch.

## Key Strategic Points for Deliberation

### 1. V2 Architecture & Market Positioning

**Summary:** The imminent ElizaOS V2 represents a complete rework rather than an incremental update, with architectural improvements positioning it as a competitive framework comparable to Virtual on Base.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User 'cjft' described V2 as a 'full rework' with improved RAG pipeline compared to V1`
- `Discord: User 'xell0x' positioned V2 as 'the framework AI agents will use on Solana. Like AI agents on base use Virtual's framework'`

**Potential Questions:**
- How should we position V2's competitive advantages against other frameworks like Virtual to maximize developer adoption?
- Should we consider a formal partnership strategy with Solana to mirror Virtual's relationship with Base?

### 2. Infrastructure Decentralization Strategy

**Summary:** Major plugins are being systematically decentralized from the monorepo into standalone repositories, creating a more distributed ecosystem but requiring improved integration and discovery systems.

**Related Context:**
- `GitHub: Multiple PRs removing plugins from monorepo (Twitter, Discord, Telegram, Farcaster) merged`
- `GitHub: PR #4792 updated registry publishing logic and package naming patterns`

**Potential Questions:**
- How do we balance plugin ecosystem decentralization with maintaining a cohesive developer experience?
- Does our current registry and discovery model sufficiently support our vision for community-driven agent development?

### 3. Multi-Agent Interaction Paradigm

**Summary:** V2 enables cross-platform memory persistence and more sophisticated agent-to-agent interactions, unlocking new use cases but raising questions about managing complexity for users.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User 'Kenk' confirmed multi-agents can interact in custom worlds with specific memory loading`
- `Discord: User 'Stan âš¡' proposed implementing single world per runtime to enable cross-platform memory persistence`

**Potential Questions:**
- How might multi-agent worlds change our strategic focus from single agents to agent ecosystems?
- Should we develop specialized governance frameworks for multi-agent systems to ensure ethical interactions?

### 4. Auto.fun Token Strategy & Marketplace Integration

**Summary:** Community discussions reflect uncertainty about token relationships with elizaOS, particularly regarding eli5's utility in relation to the upcoming Agent Bazaar marketplace.

**Related Context:**
- `Discord: User 'Skaju' expressed frustration about eli5's price performance compared to comput3`
- `Discord: User 'Tomtom' mentioned Agent Bazaar implementation as a marketplace for agents including eli5, eddy, Laura and Ruby`

**Potential Questions:**
- How can we better communicate the value accrual relationship between elizaOS, agent tokens, and auto.fun?
- Should we accelerate the Agent Bazaar launch to provide concrete utility for agent-related tokens and drive auto.fun adoption?

# Council Briefing: 2025-09-19

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Critical platform stability issues in elizaOS CLI and development tools require immediate attention to maintain development velocity toward v2 release.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Platform Stability & Technical Debt

**Summary of Topic:** Several critical bugs are affecting developer experience and platform stability, including CLI version conflicts, port conflict issues causing infinite loops, and security vulnerabilities in NPM packages that need immediate resolution.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize resolution of the CLI port conflict bug that is creating infinite loops during development mode?

  **Context:**
  - `wookosh: User experiencing port conflicts and death loop with `elizaos dev``
  - `0xbbjoker: Suggested bun version upgrade and checking for port conflicts, later confirmed reproducing the issue`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Treat as critical blocker and dedicate engineering resources to fix immediately, even if it delays v2 feature development by 1-2 days.

### 2. Topic: Integration Strategy & Agent Ecosystem

**Summary of Topic:** New integration opportunities including WhatsApp, on-chain agent registration with ERC-8004, and canvas interfaces using tldraw SDK 4.0 could expand elizaOS's reach and capabilities, but require strategic prioritization aligned with auto.fun goals.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize the WhatsApp integration for AI auto-reply relative to our auto.fun focus?

  **Context:**
  - `ElizaBAOðŸŒŸ: Do we have any agent that can integrate with WhatsApp for AI auto-reply?`
  - `Multiple users (Stan âš¡, Ã˜Demer, 0xCryptoCooker) offered to help with implementation using WhatsApp Cloud API.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Fast-track WhatsApp integration as a high-visibility feature to attract new auto.fun users through a familiar channel.
        *Implication:* Could accelerate user acquisition but diverts resources from core auto.fun development.
    b) Create a community bounty for WhatsApp integration, leveraging volunteer developers who offered assistance.
        *Implication:* Enables progress without core team resource allocation but may result in variable quality implementation.
    c) Deprioritize WhatsApp integration in favor of improving agent capabilities already deployed on auto.fun.
        *Implication:* Maintains focus on auto.fun core experience but misses potential growth opportunity through messaging platform.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should we invest in on-chain agent registration with ERC-8004 contracts as a strategic differentiator for auto.fun?

  **Context:**
  - `Agent Joshua shared plans to create an agent that registers itself onchain with a generated wallet using ERC-8004 contracts, and confirmed deployment experience with TEE validation.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Make on-chain agent registration a core feature of auto.fun to attract crypto-native users and increase decentralization.
        *Implication:* Strengthens our decentralization narrative but adds complexity and potential gas costs for users.
    b) Support community-led ERC-8004 integration as an optional plugin rather than core platform capability.
        *Implication:* Balances innovation with focus while letting power users experiment with on-chain registration.
    c) Delay on-chain agent focus until after v2 is stable, then evaluate based on market demand and auto.fun adoption metrics.

# Council Briefing: 2025-12-18

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The council’s immediate leverage point is restoring trust through crisp token-migration communications and security posture while unblocking Cloud/streaming and plugin shipping decisions that prove production readiness ahead of exchange momentum.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Trust, Exchange Coordination, and Safety Posture

**Summary of Topic:** Migration remains technically possible on Solana, but exchange-specific handling (notably Bithumb vs Kraken) is producing confusion and reputational drag, compounded by community anxiety about migration-site safety and impersonation risk.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s stance on exchange accountability vs. project-led remediation for Bithumb-related migration delays and snapshot disputes?

  **Context:**
  - `Korean community concerns: requests for evidence of communications with Bithumb regarding snapshot timing (Discord, 2025-12-17).`
  - `Serikiki: "Kraken would not give tokens to users who sold after the snapshot... distribute based on snapshot data" (Discord, 2025-12-17).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Hold a firm line: exchanges are responsible; provide a public FAQ and direct users to exchange support channels.
        *Implication:* Minimizes operational burden but risks prolonged reputational damage in affected regions.
    b) Hybrid response: publish a timestamped communication log with exchanges (what/when) and appoint a single exchange liaison for escalation.
        *Implication:* Improves trust without assuming full responsibility, at the cost of focused coordination overhead.
    c) Project-led remediation: offer a supplemental, time-boxed manual claims process for verified edge cases caused by exchange messaging.
        *Implication:* Maximizes user goodwill but introduces fraud/precedent risk and significant operational complexity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we address community safety concerns (migration-site compromise claims and impersonators) to protect users and preserve legitimacy?

  **Context:**
  - `Reported: "ElizaOS migration site was compromised and funds were stolen" and "We're looking at it" (Discord, 2025-12-15).`
  - `Issue #6211: user reports Discord impersonators and requests a safe official support path (GitHub, Dec 2025 monthly report).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediate hardening: publish an official security bulletin, rotate links, and pin a single canonical URL + signature verification instructions.
        *Implication:* Rapidly reduces harm and stabilizes trust, but requires disciplined comms and ongoing monitoring.
    b) Lockdown approach: temporarily pause non-essential migration UI changes and route support via GitHub-only verification until incident closure.
        *Implication:* Maximizes safety but may increase frustration and delay legitimate migrations.
    c) Community-led defense: rely on mods/bans and user education without formal security communications until evidence is confirmed.
        *Implication:* Lowest effort, but highest risk of rumor amplification and user losses if threats are real.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** For future migrations, do we invest in a more straightforward swap mechanism even if it constrains composability or requires additional infrastructure?

  **Context:**
  - `Alexei: "Consider implementing a more straightforward token swap mechanism for future migrations" (Discord, 2025-12-17).`
  - `Ongoing confusion: "Different exchanges... handling the AI16Z to ELIZAOS token swap differently" (Discord, 2025-12-17).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Keep current model: snapshot + portal + exchange coordination; improve docs and comms rather than mechanism.
        *Implication:* Fastest path operationally, but repeats complexity and external dependency risk.
    b) Build a standardized migration contract/flow with on-chain proofs and a reference exchange integration kit.
        *Implication:* Improves determinism and trust, but demands engineering time and legal/ops coordination.
    c) Adopt a managed migration service layer in Cloud (authenticated claims + attestations) as the single canonical swap gateway.
        *Implication:* Centralizes reliability and user experience, but increases platform responsibility and perceived centralization.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Cloud Streaming & Messaging Plugins: Shipping Discipline Under Scale

**Summary of Topic:** Streaming is working for simple messages/actions across cloud and monorepo, but Actions UI rendering still breaks the experience; meanwhile a massive Discord plugin PR is waiting to merge, raising quality and integration risk at a critical launch window.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we merge the large Discord plugin PR now (with accelerated review) or enforce decomposition to protect reliability and auditability?

  **Context:**
  - `Odilitime: "Large PR with 66 commits is ready to merge... already 3 weeks old" (Discord core-devs, 2025-12-17).`
  - `Stan: offered to review before merging; Odilitime agreed to wait 24 hours (Discord core-devs, 2025-12-17).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Merge after a time-boxed senior review (24–48h) plus minimal smoke tests; follow up with stabilization PRs.
        *Implication:* Unblocks momentum quickly but may import hidden regressions into a key integration surface.
    b) Require PR splitting into smaller, testable increments (e.g., messaging API refactor vs feature additions) before merge.
        *Implication:* Improves long-term maintainability and reliability, but delays shipping and increases contributor friction.
    c) Create an "experimental" release channel/branch and deploy to a controlled cohort (Eliza-Alpha) before merging to main.
        *Implication:* Balances speed and safety, but adds release-process complexity and requires disciplined environment management.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s priority order for making Cloud streaming feel reliable end-to-end (especially Actions UI) during the December execution push?

  **Context:**
  - `Stan: "Everything works in the monorepo, but for Actions the UI still displays the text all at once instead of streaming it" (Discord, 2025-12-16).`
  - `Stan: "Streaming functionality now working for simple messages and actions" with PRs in eliza-cloud-v2 and monorepo (Discord, 2025-12-17).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Treat Actions UI streaming as a launch blocker; pause non-critical features until it is resolved and tested.
        *Implication:* Aligns with execution excellence, but may delay broader Cloud rollout and ecosystem demos.
    b) Ship Cloud with partial streaming (messages only) and clearly label Actions streaming as beta; collect telemetry and iterate fast.
        *Implication:* Accelerates launch while managing expectations, but risks first impressions for developer trust.
    c) De-scope UI streaming entirely for now; focus on backend correctness and provide a stable non-streaming UI until vNext.
        *Implication:* Maximizes stability but forfeits a key UX differentiator and may weaken market-maker confidence.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How do we satisfy market-maker expectations for “agents in production” without compromising core reliability or overextending flagship agents?

  **Context:**
  - `Partners channel: "Market makers require agents to be deployed in production and actively engaging in social environments" (Discord 🥇-partners, 2025-12-17).`
  - `Product philosophy: "have a live product that can be iteratively improved rather than waiting for perfection" (Discord 🥇-partners, 2025-12-17).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Deploy a minimal set of flagship agents with conservative capabilities and strict guardrails (rate limits, scoped actions, rollback).
        *Implication:* Demonstrates reality while minimizing blast radius, but may look underwhelming compared to expectations.
    b) Prioritize breadth: deploy many community agents quickly via Cloud templates to show ecosystem activity over polish.
        *Implication:* Signals scale and momentum, but increases incident probability and support burden.
    c) Stage production readiness: public “Alpha fleet” with explicit SLAs and incident transparency, upgrading agents as reliability hardens.
        *Implication:* Builds trust through shipping and honesty, but requires strong comms and operational discipline.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Developer Trust Through DX: Docs, Plugins, and Onboarding Clarity

**Summary of Topic:** Builders are hitting friction in extending actions and local DB setup, while GitHub shows a surge in UX/backlog definition; the Council must convert this signal into a coherent, reliability-first onboarding and documentation campaign.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the fastest Council-approved path to reduce “plugin/action extension” confusion without fragmenting the ecosystem into copy-pasted local forks?

  **Context:**
  - `FenrirFawks: couldn't locate starknet-plugin folder; Odilitime: "clone the plugin into the packages folder" (Discord 💬-coders, 2025-12-17).`
  - `Stan: "take a look at actions documentation... also have to put it in src/index" (Discord 💬-coders, 2025-12-17).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Publish a canonical “Adding an Action” guide with a minimal working example and explicit registration steps, plus a template generator in CLI.
        *Implication:* Improves DX quickly and aligns with Developer First, with modest engineering investment.
    b) Enforce a plugin development workflow: actions must be added via a standardized registry/manifest so the system auto-discovers them.
        *Implication:* Reduces human error long-term but introduces breaking changes and requires ecosystem migration.
    c) Accept cloning as the norm for now; focus on broader Cloud launch and revisit plugin ergonomics after December.
        *Implication:* Preserves short-term velocity but accrues DX debt and frustrates new developers during peak attention.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we operationalize the growing UX issue backlog so it strengthens (rather than distracts from) December’s execution excellence directive?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub daily: "14 new issues opened... no PRs" with multiple UX fixes closed quickly (#6240, #6242, #6243) (Daily report, 2025-12-17).`
  - `Weekly report: "dozens of UI/UX-focused issues... roadmap for major UI/UX overhaul" (Weekly report Dec 14–20, 2025).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Create a tight “December Reliability UX Pack”: pick 5–8 issues that directly reduce onboarding failure and ship them this month.
        *Implication:* Converts backlog into trust-building delivery while staying aligned to the monthly directive.
    b) Start a full UI overhaul sprint immediately, using the backlog as the spec and pausing other initiatives except critical bugs.
        *Implication:* Potentially transformative, but high risk to schedule and Cloud/token deliverables.
    c) Defer UX changes until after migration/Cloud launch; use the backlog mainly for Q1 planning.
        *Implication:* Protects launch scope, but risks poor first impressions and continued friction for new builders.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** What Council policy best improves merge confidence and reduces regressions as PR size and AI-assisted coding volume increase?

  **Context:**
  - `Proposal: "require developers to include screenshots or videos with PRs" (Discord, 2025-12-15).`
  - `cjft: "Probably like 50% of my code" is AI-generated; notes need for better review workflows (Discord, 2025-12-16).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt a “Proof of Function” standard: UI PRs require before/after media; all PRs require a minimal test plan section and smoke steps.
        *Implication:* Improves reliability and review speed with manageable process overhead.
    b) Invest in automation: a GitHub bot to enforce templates, run scenario tests, and summarize AI-generated diffs for reviewers.
        *Implication:* Scales quality with growth, but requires upfront engineering and careful tuning to avoid noise.
    c) Rely on post-merge monitoring and fast rollback; keep process lightweight to maintain velocity during launch window.
        *Implication:* Maximizes speed but increases incident likelihood, undermining “trust through shipping.”
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

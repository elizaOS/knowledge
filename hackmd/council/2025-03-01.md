# Council Briefing: 2025-03-01

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The fleet pivoted into “trust-through-shipping” mode: major documentation expansion and targeted runtime fixes landed to stabilize developer onboarding after rapid architectural change.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Developer Trust After the Plugin/Client Architecture Shift

**Summary of Topic:** The new “clients as plugins” structure (v0.25.8-era) improved modularity, but created configuration confusion and broken paths; March 1’s doc upgrades are a strong corrective, yet we still need a single canonical migration narrative and tooling guardrails to protect DX.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we declare a “DX Stability Window” where we freeze further breaking plugin/CLI interface changes until docs, templates, and upgrade tooling reach parity?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-27): “Version 0.25.8 Changes: Major structural changes to how plugins and clients are implemented.”`
  - `GitHub Summary (2025-03-01): “Enhanced readme.md to provide a how-to guide for custom plugins (PR #3736)… Updated plugins.md… (PR #3735).”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—freeze breaking DX changes for a defined window (e.g., 2–4 weeks) and focus on docs/templates/tooling.
        *Implication:* Maximizes developer confidence and reduces support load, at the cost of slowing architectural iteration.
    b) Partial freeze—allow breaking changes only behind explicit version flags and migration tooling checks.
        *Implication:* Preserves velocity while establishing a safety hull that prevents silent breakage for most builders.
    c) No—continue shipping rapidly; rely on community support and incremental documentation to catch up.
        *Implication:* Short-term velocity stays high, but risks compounding churn and reputation damage among new adopters.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should the Council mandate a single “Golden Path” starter (character + plugins + env) per major version, and treat all other permutations as advanced/unsupported until maturity?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 💻-coders (2025-02-28): “users adapting to the newer, cleaner ElizaOS architecture while troubleshooting implementation-specific issues.”`
  - `Discord (2025-02-27): “Add it as a plugin with "plugins": ["@elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter", "@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter"]” (CARSON.ts)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—publish and maintain one canonical starter path per version, with automated validation.
        *Implication:* Greatly reduces onboarding entropy and aligns with “Execution Excellence,” but narrows perceived flexibility.
    b) Maintain two paths: (A) minimal local dev, (B) cloud-first; everything else is community best-effort.
        *Implication:* Balances choice with clarity, and maps cleanly to future Cloud adoption without abandoning self-hosters.
    c) No—keep many official permutations to demonstrate composability and breadth.
        *Implication:* Signals openness but increases fragmentation, documentation surface area, and regression risk.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How aggressively should we invest in “self-healing CLI” behaviors (detect missing plugins, auto-install dependencies, warn on deprecated config) to reduce Discord support burden?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-26): “Plugins and clients have been moved out of the core repository into separate packages that need to be explicitly added. This has caused confusion…”`
  - `Daily Report (2025-02-28): “Fixed an out-of-memory bug in version 0.25.8 (PR #3722).”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) High—CLI becomes the primary guardian: auto-detect, auto-fix, and block unsafe/broken configs.
        *Implication:* Transforms DX, but requires rigorous versioning and careful security posture for auto-installs.
    b) Medium—CLI offers diagnostics and guided fixes, but requires explicit user confirmation for changes.
        *Implication:* Reduces failures while keeping trust and transparency; moderate engineering cost.
    c) Low—keep CLI thin; prioritize framework stability and let advanced users manage dependencies manually.
        *Implication:* Minimizes CLI complexity, but keeps onboarding friction high and increases community support demands.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Memory, RAG, and Resource Reliability (OOM + Large Document Handling)

**Summary of Topic:** Operational signals show recurring heap OOM and RAG ingestion failures (PDFs, large files, whole-file embedding). March 1’s runtime guards and earlier OOM fixes are positive, but the Council must decide whether to treat knowledge/RAG as “core reliability work” versus “best-effort plugin territory.”

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we elevate RAG ingestion (chunking, PDF parsing, large-doc safeguards) into a first-class reliability milestone, even if it delays other features?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub Issue #3745 (2025-03-02): “RAG processFile attempts to embed entire files causing errors for large documents.”`
  - `Discord (2025-02-27): “It didn't work with PDFs, converting to txt format worked instead.” (Ale | AutoRujira)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—RAG is foundational; prioritize robust chunking + PDF support + backpressure now.
        *Implication:* Improves real-world agent usefulness and reduces failure rates, strengthening “reliability over features.”
    b) Partially—ship minimal safe defaults (chunk caps, size limits, clear errors) and postpone full PDF support.
        *Implication:* Prevents catastrophic failures quickly while keeping roadmap flexibility for deeper ingestion work later.
    c) No—keep RAG as plugin/community territory; focus core on agent runtime and Cloud reliability.
        *Implication:* Preserves core focus, but risks losing developers who expect turnkey knowledge ingestion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the Council’s preferred stance on memory failures: raise default Node memory and document it, or fix underlying leaks/inefficiencies even if it’s slower?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-26): “Remove the "knowledge" field… or increase memory allocation with export NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=8192'.” (sergii.bomko)`
  - `Daily Report (2025-02-28): “Fixed an out-of-memory bug in version 0.25.8 (PR #3722).”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Raise defaults + document aggressively (fast relief), while continuing targeted OOM fixes opportunistically.
        *Implication:* Quickly improves first-run success, but may mask structural issues and increase infra costs.
    b) Fix root causes first; keep defaults conservative and fail with clear diagnostics and guidance.
        *Implication:* Best long-term reliability posture, but risks continued near-term onboarding pain.
    c) Hybrid: safe default bump plus strict limits for ingestion pipelines (caps, batching, streaming embeddings).
        *Implication:* Balances success rate and correctness; requires coordinated engineering across core + knowledge tooling.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Should we standardize an official “Knowledge Pipeline Contract” (formats, folder conventions, preprocessing steps) to reduce confusion and support load?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord discussion (2025-02-28): “questions about PDF file handling… directed to coders channel.”`
  - `Discord (2025-02-26): “workarounds… including removing the "knowledge" field from character files to prevent memory errors.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—publish a strict contract (supported types, preprocessing, limits) and enforce it in tooling.
        *Implication:* Reduces ambiguity and runtime surprises; may disappoint users expecting automatic format coverage.
    b) Publish a best-practices guide only; allow flexibility without enforcement.
        *Implication:* Keeps composability high, but confusion and inconsistent behavior persist.
    c) Defer—focus on Cloud-first knowledge ingestion where the pipeline can be controlled end-to-end.
        *Implication:* Simplifies support for Cloud users but may alienate self-hosters and open-source purists.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Operational Dependencies: Web Presence, Social Accounts, and Governance Bottlenecks

**Summary of Topic:** Multiple external dependencies are constraining trust signals: eliza.gg is broken (maintainer gone), DegenAI’s X account remains suspended, and DAO.fun delays block token metadata/ticker migration. These are not just comms issues—they directly affect developer confidence and ecosystem coherence.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we treat web/docs presence (eliza.gg replacement, canonical links, onboarding) as a production service with ownership and uptime standards—on par with core releases?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord discussion (2025-02-28): “eliza.gg website is broken… Jin: they’ll set up a new site as the previous maintainer went AWOL.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—assign explicit owners, SLA-style expectations, and automated link/uptime checks.
        *Implication:* Strengthens first impression and reduces churn; requires sustained operational discipline.
    b) Partially—move to a static, repo-owned docs/site and minimize dynamic dependencies; no formal SLAs.
        *Implication:* Improves resilience with low overhead, but still risks slow response to outages or broken flows.
    c) No—keep web presence lightweight; prioritize engineering output and let community mirror resources.
        *Implication:* Saves bandwidth short-term but undermines “Developer First” and discoverability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Given repeated platform risk (X suspensions), should flagship agents adopt a multi-channel-first strategy (Farcaster/Telegram/Discord) with redundancy as a design requirement?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-26): “DegenAI is currently facing challenges with its X (Twitter) account suspension… appeal is pending.” (rhota)`
  - `Discord spartan_holders (2025-02-28): “The team is working to reintroduce DegenspartanAI to Discord and Farcaster… plans to use Telegram as the public channel.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—treat distribution redundancy as mandatory; build and document a multi-client deployment playbook.
        *Implication:* Reduces existential platform risk and aligns with interoperability, but increases operational complexity.
    b) Selective redundancy—only for flagship agents; community agents can choose platforms freely.
        *Implication:* Protects core brand while keeping the broader ecosystem flexible.
    c) No—double down on X once reinstated; alternative platforms remain secondary experiments.
        *Implication:* Concentrates attention where reach is largest, but leaves the project vulnerable to repeat suspensions.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should the Council respond to governance/vendor bottlenecks (e.g., DAO.fun delaying voting/metadata changes): wait, integrate alternatives, or build our own governance module?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (2025-02-26): “bottleneck is DAO.fun’s delayed implementation of a voting module… promised ‘Q1–Q2’.”`
  - `Discord (2025-02-26): “Partners expressed frustration about the inability to change the token ticker… to match the ElizaOS rebrand.”`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Wait and pressure DAO.fun with a clear deadline and escalation path.
        *Implication:* Lowest engineering cost, but risks prolonged brand incoherence and partner dissatisfaction.
    b) Integrate an interim alternative (Snapshot/Realms/EVM) while maintaining DAO.fun compatibility.
        *Implication:* Restores momentum and reduces dependency risk; introduces governance fragmentation to manage.
    c) Build and own a governance module aligned with ElizaOS (agent-aware governance) and migrate.
        *Implication:* Max control and strategic alignment, but significant build/migration burden and associated risk.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

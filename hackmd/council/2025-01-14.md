# Council Briefing: 2025-01-14

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The fleet advanced “trust through shipping” by hardening onboarding and stability while adding trust primitives (Gitcoin Passport, verifiable logging/attestation) that can become the backbone of a Marketplace of Trust.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Stability & Onboarding Hardening

**Summary of Topic:** Core DX improved via Direct Client API controls (Delete Agent) and streamlined setup (start.sh character template), while recurring platform pain (Windows/ARM/toolchain issues) remains a trust risk if not systematically gated and documented.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should the Council impose a short-term “stability freeze” (bugs, install, docs) before accepting additional new plugins/features into mainline?

  **Context:**
  - `Daily Update (Jan 14): "Added character creation template function in start.sh" and "Addressed Windows path issues in the build process".`
  - `GitHub Issues (Jan 13 summary): "Missing dependencies: '@anush008/tokenizers-linux-arm64-gnu'" and "Wasm SIMD unsupported errors when running pnpm start".`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Yes—declare a stability freeze and require fixes/docs for Windows+ARM+DB adapters before new features land.
        *Implication:* Improves developer trust and Cloud readiness, but slows ecosystem novelty and contributor momentum.
    b) Partial—allow features only behind flags/experimental channels while enforcing strict release gating on core paths.
        *Implication:* Balances innovation with reliability, at the cost of added governance/process overhead.
    c) No—keep feature velocity; rely on community triage and incremental fixes as issues surface.
        *Implication:* Maximizes growth and plugin breadth, but risks “paper cuts” eroding DX and Cloud conversion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is our official “supported matrix” for developers in the next release cycle (OS/arch/db), and do we communicate unsupported paths explicitly?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (Jan 12): "Windows Compatibility Issues... WSL emerging as the recommended solution".`
  - `GitHub Issues (Jan 13 summary): "Missing module ... linux-arm64" and "POST /agents/:agentId/set {character} endpoint crashing".`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Narrow support: Linux x64 (Docker/WSL) + SQLite/Postgres only; everything else marked “best-effort.”
        *Implication:* Sets clear expectations and reduces support load, but may deter Windows-native and ARM builders.
    b) Broad support: commit to Windows-native and ARM64 as first-class, with a funded compatibility push.
        *Implication:* Expands addressable developer base and Cloud portability, but pulls engineering capacity from autonomy/V2 work.
    c) Cloud-first: formally support Cloud deployments as the “golden path,” local support remains community-led.
        *Implication:* Accelerates Cloud adoption and simplifies QA, but risks alienating open-source self-hosters if messaging is mishandled.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Trust Primitives: Identity & Verifiable Execution

**Summary of Topic:** Gitcoin Passport integration and TEE verifiable log/attestation work signal a shift toward measurable agent credibility—critical for a “Marketplace of Trust,” but requiring policy on how trust signals affect agent behavior and user rights.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Do we treat trust primitives (Gitcoin Passport, TEE logs/attestation) as a core pillar to ship quickly, or as an advanced feature after stability and Cloud readiness?

  **Context:**
  - `Daily Update (Jan 14): "Integrated Gitcoin passport functionality for enhanced trust in AI agents."`
  - `Daily Summary (Jan 13): "Added plugin for TEE verifiable log" and "Fixed derive key and updated remote attestation".`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Core pillar now—prioritize trust primitives alongside stability as a competitive moat for the Marketplace of Trust.
        *Implication:* Positions ElizaOS as the default framework for verifiable agents, but increases surface area and complexity.
    b) Sequence it—stability/Cloud first, then harden trust primitives with a dedicated spec and threat model.
        *Implication:* Reduces risk of half-baked trust claims, but may miss the narrative window for “verifiable agents.”
    c) Delegate—keep trust primitives community/plugin-led; core team focuses on autonomy and platform UX.
        *Implication:* Preserves core velocity, but trust capabilities may fragment and fail to interoperate consistently.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should trust scores influence agent actions (e.g., trading, governance, marketplace access) without creating opaque censorship or Sybil loopholes?

  **Context:**
  - `Daily Update (Jan 14): "Gitcoin passport... assess Ethereum address credibility, aiding in decision-making."`
  - `Tokenomics discussion (Jan 13): references to a "Marketplace of Trust" as part of the flywheel strategy.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Hard gates: low-trust identities cannot access certain high-risk actions (trades, large transfers, governance proposals).
        *Implication:* Improves safety and reduces abuse, but risks excluding legitimate users and creating centralization pressure.
    b) Soft friction: trust modifies limits, confirmations, and monitoring—not absolute access.
        *Implication:* Maintains openness while still discouraging abuse, but requires careful tuning and observability.
    c) No behavioral coupling: trust signals are informational only; enforcement is left to downstream applications.
        *Implication:* Avoids value judgments in core, but forfeits a key differentiator for secure autonomous agents.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Brand/Token Governance & Communications (Trust with Humans)

**Summary of Topic:** Rebranding pressure (ai16z → ElizaOS) and tokenomics mechanisms (tribute/marketplace) intersect with community trust issues (DegenAI transparency), creating a strategic need for crisp public commitments and execution sequencing.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s preferred rebranding posture: “legal necessity” framing, “mission clarity” framing, or a hybrid—and what operational milestones must be met before the public pivot?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord 🥇-partners (Jan 13): "planning to rebrand from 'ai16z' to 'ElizaOS' due to potential trademark issues"; Shaw: rebranding "would enable partnerships and collaborations currently on hold".`
  - `Discord 🥇-partners (Jan 13): Jin: ticker change may require Solana Foundation consultation and "would need to wait at least 2 months".`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Legal-first: explicitly cite trademark risk, prioritize risk mitigation and continuity for developers.
        *Implication:* Minimizes legal exposure and ambiguity, but may amplify fear and invite narrative attacks.
    b) Mission-first: frame as aligning name with the technical foundation and developer ecosystem, minimize legal commentary.
        *Implication:* Keeps focus on shipping and partnerships, but may appear evasive if community expects direct legal clarity.
    c) Hybrid: acknowledge legal constraints briefly, lead with mission/roadmap and a precise migration/ticker timeline.
        *Implication:* Balances transparency and momentum, but requires disciplined communications and tight execution.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we resolve the credibility gap around DegenAI: publish auditable operational proofs now, or wait until the product and website are ready?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord spartan_holders (Jan 13): "frustration about lack of clear information regarding DegenAI's roadmap" and requests to "Publish wallet address and trading activity".`
  - `Discord spartan_holders (Jan 13): Odilitime: website is coming soon; DegenAI "is trading but still needs work."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Immediate proof: publish wallet, trading summaries, and a now/next/future roadmap with weekly updates.
        *Implication:* Stops FUD and reinforces “trust through shipping,” but may expose immature systems and invite scrutiny.
    b) Staged transparency: publish wallet + minimal metrics now, full roadmap/site when operational readiness is verified.
        *Implication:* Improves trust quickly without overcommitting, but must be time-boxed to avoid appearing as stalling.
    c) Wait for readiness: avoid partial disclosures until the website and strategy are finalized.
        *Implication:* Reduces risk of inconsistent messaging, but prolongs uncertainty and may erode token-holder confidence.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

## Daily Focus

- ElizaOS development shows significant momentum with a comprehensive documentation overhaul, successful Spartan AI trading tool testing, and preparation for the imminent v2 release alongside active community tutorial support.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: ElizaOS v2 Readiness and Roll-out Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** As multiple users inquire about the v2 release timeline with only vague 'soon' responses provided, we must define a precise roll-out plan for the highly anticipated ElizaOS v2 that will deliver improved experiences while addressing key technical issues identified in community feedback.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What should be our official release timeline for ElizaOS v2?

  **Context:**
  - `User ghk9698: 'Wen elizaos v2 release?' (Answer: Unanswered)`
  - `User srikanth: 'When v2?' with Dr. Neuro responding: 'Soon'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Announce immediate release this week with the known limitations, then issue rapid updates to address outstanding issues.
        *Implication:* Quick release maintains momentum but risks negative reception if critical issues aren't addressed.
    b) Set a concrete 2-week timeline with a detailed changelog of improvements and new features that resolve known pain points.
        *Implication:* Specific timeline creates accountability and manages expectations while allowing time to address critical issues.
    c) Avoid specific dates and implement a staged beta release program where power users can test and provide feedback before general release.
        *Implication:* Beta approach improves quality but delays full release and creates perception of a cautious development pace.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Which technical improvements should be prioritized in the v2 release to maximize user adoption and retention?

  **Context:**
  - `Users reported potential issues with the knowledge plugin, including inability to perform local embeddings and possible API endpoint changes in recent updates.`
  - `Significant discussion about Twitter/X API limitations for DMs, confirming that the basic tier is severely limited (1 DM per day), making it essentially unusable for agent interactions.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on stability and authentication improvements, particularly fixing plugin loading issues and implementing proper Twitter API integration.
        *Implication:* Addresses critical functionality concerns but may delay more innovative features.
    b) Prioritize the release of Eliza Cloud with A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication capabilities to enable more sophisticated agent interactions.
        *Implication:* Delivers a groundbreaking feature that differentiates our platform but may leave existing issues unresolved.
    c) Lead with UI/UX enhancements and documentation improvements to make the platform more accessible to non-technical users.
        *Implication:* Broadens potential user base but might frustrate power users waiting for technical improvements.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Spartan AI Trading Performance and Market Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The successful holders-only test of Spartan AI trading tool generated extremely positive feedback with reports of 60% profit, presenting an opportunity to leverage this momentum for broader adoption while carefully managing auto.fun launchpad's competitive positioning.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we expand access to Spartan AI to maximize its impact on ecosystem growth?

  **Context:**
  - `User 辞尘鸽鸽 described Spartan as 'extremely rational' and 'far superior to humans' with 'master level' strategy`
  - `Odilitime mentioned plans to open Spartan access to partners next week after processing feedback`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a tiered access system based on token holdings, with higher tiers getting earlier access to trading signals and advanced features.
        *Implication:* Creates strong token utility but potentially limits viral growth to new users without tokens.
    b) Launch a freemium model with basic signals available to all users and premium features accessible through subscription or token holdings.
        *Implication:* Balances growth and token utility while creating a sustainable revenue model.
    c) Make Spartan fully accessible to advance our mission of democratizing AI, using the proven performance to attract users to other premium services.
        *Implication:* Maximizes user acquisition but potentially underutilizes a strong token utility mechanism.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** How should we position auto.fun's launchpad fee structure and curation strategy to compete with established platforms like BONK?

  **Context:**
  - `Phenowin provided detailed analysis of successful launchpad strategies, particularly highlighting BONK's approach on Solana, emphasizing trust, quality KOLs, and selective project curation.`
  - `Phenowin suggested that auto.fun's launchpad fees might be too low compared to competitors and recommended studying BONK's successful model.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Increase fee structure to match competitors while implementing rigorous curation standards focused on AI-native projects.
        *Implication:* Signals premium quality but may deter some projects from launching on our platform.
    b) Maintain lower fees as a competitive advantage but invest heavily in attracting quality KOLs and strategic backers to build ecosystem credibility.
        *Implication:* Creates market differentiation but requires significant investment in relationship building.
    c) Implement a dynamic fee structure that scales with project success, aligning our incentives with projects and potentially attracting higher quality launches.
        *Implication:* Creates innovative positioning but relies on complex mechanisms that may be difficult to communicate.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Documentation and API Limitations

**Summary of Topic:** Recent improvements to documentation alongside the identification of severe API limitations (particularly in Twitter/X) require strategic decisions about how to communicate platform capabilities and limitations to different user segments.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we address the Twitter/X API limitations in our platform strategy?

  **Context:**
  - `Significant discussion about Twitter/X API limitations for DMs, confirming that the basic tier is severely limited (1 DM per day), making it essentially unusable for agent interactions. Even enterprise pricing has significant limitations.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Pivot away from Twitter integration as a core feature and focus on platforms with more developer-friendly APIs like Discord and Telegram.
        *Implication:* Reduces Twitter-dependent use cases but focuses resources on more reliable platforms.
    b) Develop our own intermediary service that pools API access and optimizes usage across multiple users to mitigate individual limitations.
        *Implication:* Creates unique technical value but increases architectural complexity and potential points of failure.
    c) Negotiate enterprise-level API access and offer it as a premium feature for serious developers and businesses building on elizaOS.
        *Implication:* Creates a potential revenue stream but establishes a two-tier system that contradicts open-source ethos.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take to strengthen our documentation strategy following the recent comprehensive overhaul?

  **Context:**
  - `Snapper shared Episode 2 of the ElizaOS Tutorial covering CLI usage, project creation, character file setup, and running agents in dev mode.`
  - `PR #5401 titled 'feat: implement comprehensive documentation overhaul with two-track system' is completed, introducing a major documentation improvement.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize more video tutorials and interactive guides with a focus on simple, non-technical onboarding experiences.
        *Implication:* Broadens appeal to non-technical users but may slow development of advanced documentation.
    b) Implement an AI-assisted documentation system that dynamically generates relevant examples based on user queries and context.
        *Implication:* Showcases our AI capabilities while creating a truly next-generation documentation experience.
    c) Focus on expanding specific documentation around pain points like API limitations, plugin compatibility, and cross-platform deployment.
        *Implication:* Addresses immediate developer needs but may not sufficiently improve the experience for new or non-technical users.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

# Council Briefing: 2025-09-28

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Development of x402, an agent-to-agent payment system, has emerged as a critical technological innovation that could position ElizaOS as a leading agentic framework while supporting the token migration strategy.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Token Migration Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The ElizaOS token migration from $ai16z to $ElizaOS is strategically driven by the need to expand to more chains, access greater liquidity, and enable x402 transactions, positioning the project for increased institutional adoption.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize educating the community about the token migration process to ensure smooth transition and minimal user friction?

  **Context:**
  - `The Light: The token is going to be migrated to be able to expand to a far bigger amount of chains/access to a much larger base of liquidity, and be able to enable x402 transactions.`
  - `shaw: Short term: buybacks with revenue from the cloud. Long term: agent network protocol token.`
  - `Kenk: There will be a migration process with step-by-step details shared soon.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on creating comprehensive documentation and step-by-step guides, prioritizing clarity over speed.
        *Implication:* This approach minimizes confusion but may slow adoption during the critical initial migration phase.
    b) Deploy AI agents specifically designed to assist users with migration across all community channels.
        *Implication:* This approach aligns with our agent-centric vision but requires resources to develop and maintain these specialized agents.
    c) Partner with exchanges and wallet providers to handle most of the technical migration complexity for users.
        *Implication:* This approach creates the smoothest user experience but increases dependency on third-party infrastructure.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What cross-chain expansion strategy would best support our vision of ElizaOS as an agent network protocol token?

  **Context:**
  - `Dean: The new token is purpose-built for elizaOS v2, for cross-chain operation through Chainlink CCIP, and for agent-native workflows.`
  - `Shaw mentioned commitment to increasing token value through buybacks with cloud revenue`
  - `The community is described as having a 'strong and cult-like aura'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus on Ethereum and Solana as primary chains with selective expansion to other Layer 1s based on developer activity.
        *Implication:* This conservative approach ensures quality integrations but may limit growth to emerging blockchain ecosystems.

        *Implication:* This aggressive approach maximizes market presence but risks diluting resources and creating inconsistent user experiences.
    c) Build a tiered expansion approach, prioritizing chains that best support agent-to-agent payment systems and economic activity.
        *Implication:* This targeted approach aligns expansion with our agent protocol vision but requires careful analysis of each chain's capabilities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How can we leverage the token migration to strengthen our position as a 'real business' on-chain and attract institutional interest?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members view ElizaOS as building a 'real business' on-chain, distinguishing it from other crypto projects`
  - `Members are sharing social media posts and discussing potential institutional adoption`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Emphasize token utility for agent economics with transparent financial reporting and governance structures.
        *Implication:* This approach appeals to traditional investors but may reduce appeal to crypto-native community members.
    b) Showcase revenue-generating agent applications on auto.fun as the primary value proposition for the token.
        *Implication:* This product-centric approach demonstrates concrete value but ties token success closely to auto.fun performance.
    c) Position the token as infrastructure for the emerging agent economy with detailed technical whitepapers and institutional partnerships.
        *Implication:* This visionary approach may attract forward-thinking institutions but requires extensive educational efforts.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

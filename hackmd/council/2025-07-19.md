# Council Briefing: 2025-07-19

## Monthly Goal

Current focus: Stabilize and attract new users to auto.fun by showcasing 24/7 agent activity (streaming, trading, shitposting), ship production ready elizaOS v2.

## Daily Focus

- Framework v2 development continues robustly despite X account suspension, with significant architectural improvements and 53 projects successfully transitioning from MVP to production status.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Social Media Reach and Account Recovery Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The suspension of elizaOS Twitter/X accounts for approximately a month has impacted visibility while the team focuses on recovery rather than creating new accounts, raising questions about communication strategy and alternative channels.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we prioritize X account recovery versus alternative communication channels to maintain community engagement?

  **Context:**
  - `ElizaOS's X (Twitter) accounts have been suspended for approximately a month`
  - `Moderators indicated they're focusing on recovering the original accounts rather than creating new ones`
  - `Debate about whether paying Twitter's fees ($50k-600k per month) would be worthwhile for regaining account access`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Continue focusing primarily on X account recovery while minimizing alternative channel development.
        *Implication:* Maintains brand continuity but risks prolonged visibility gap if recovery efforts continue to be unsuccessful.
    b) Develop a robust multi-platform strategy (Discord, Telegram, Farcaster) while pursuing X recovery in parallel.
        *Implication:* Creates communication redundancy but divides resources and may dilute community focus across multiple platforms.
    c) Pivot entirely to alternative platforms and rebuild audience there instead of pursuing X recovery.
        *Implication:* Allows immediate focus on new growth but surrenders established X following and brand recognition.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the appropriate community messaging regarding the project's continued development despite social media challenges?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members discussed GitHub repository as a better indicator of project activity than social media presence`
  - `Development and partnerships continue "in the shadows" despite X (Twitter) account suspension`
  - `DorianD argued that the Twitter ban isn't the main reason for the project's price decline, noting it fell from $2.50 to $0.10 even with active accounts`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Emphasize technical milestones and GitHub activity as primary indicators of project health.
        *Implication:* Appeals to developers but may not adequately address concerns of non-technical community members focused on price and visibility.
    b) Transparent communication about both challenges and progress, with regular updates across all available channels.
        *Implication:* Builds trust through honesty but risks amplifying negative narratives around account suspension and price decline.
    c) Focus messaging on future roadmap and upcoming features to shift attention forward rather than on current challenges.
        *Implication:* Creates positive sentiment and anticipation but may appear to be avoiding accountability for current issues.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we leverage community-suggested solutions like forwarding Farcaster posts to Discord?

  **Context:**
  - `3on_. advised checking GitHub commits to verify project activity instead of relying on Twitter`
  - `Borko shared Telegram channel for announcements (TG: official_elizaos) with DeGem who was looking for alternative communication channels`
  - `Develop an agent to forward Shaw's Farcaster posts to Discord (Mentioned by 3on_.)`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement community suggestions as interim solutions while pursuing primary platform restoration.
        *Implication:* Shows responsiveness to community but may appear as stopgap measures rather than strategic decisions.
    b) Formalize cross-platform content sharing into a dedicated community information system.
        *Implication:* Creates sustainable information flow but requires significant resource investment in new infrastructure.
    c) Use this opportunity to showcase elizaOS's own agent capabilities by building automated cross-platform communication tools.
        *Implication:* Demonstrates practical application of the technology but risks diverting resources from core development priorities.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Technical Evolution and Stability

**Summary of Topic:** The framework has undergone significant architectural improvements including migration to Bun's native APIs, standardized service types, and action chaining, while also addressing critical plugin issues affecting user experience.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we balance continued architectural improvements versus stabilizing the current codebase for broader adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `Core Modernization & Refactoring: A primary goal was to align the framework more closely with the Bun runtime and improve its modular architecture. A major effort was completed to migrate core components from Node.js's EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget API, enhancing type safety and performance.`
  - `Agent capabilities were extended with the implementation of action chaining and a new generateImageAction`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus primarily on stabilization and documentation of existing features before adding new architectural elements.
        *Implication:* Improves immediate adoption but may delay technical innovations that could provide competitive advantages.
    b) Continue architectural evolution in parallel with stabilization, with clear boundaries between stable and experimental features.
        *Implication:* Balances innovation and stability but requires careful versioning and communication to prevent user confusion.
    c) Accelerate architectural improvements to reach technical differentiation goals faster, even if it introduces some temporary instability.
        *Implication:* Creates technical leadership position but risks alienating early adopters who need stability.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Given the technical issues identified in the logs, what should be our cross-platform compatibility strategy?

  **Context:**
  - `Multiple users reported issues with custom plugin development, particularly around database migrations and schema handling`
  - `Several issues with Windows compatibility and plugin schema migrations, and the groundwork was laid for a major new "Scenario Runner" feature`
  - `A bug affecting custom plugin actions was identified in older elizaOS versions, with updating to 1.2.12 recommended`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize Linux/Mac compatibility with Windows support as a secondary goal after core features are stable.
        *Implication:* Aligns with developer demographics but limits potential user base and may frustrate Windows-based contributors.
    b) Implement robust cross-platform testing in CI/CD pipeline to ensure equal functionality across all operating systems.
        *Implication:* Ensures broad accessibility but increases development overhead and may slow feature velocity.
    c) Create platform-specific optimized builds with dedicated maintenance teams for each major OS.
        *Implication:* Provides best experience per platform but fragments the codebase and increases maintenance burden.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we approach the plugin-building experience to reduce technical barriers for new developers?

  **Context:**
  - `The plugin ecosystem was bolstered with an AI-powered migration tool to help upgrade plugins from v0.x to v1.x`
  - `A new plugin-quick-starter template was added to streamline backend-only plugin creation`

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How should we navigate the expanding token ecosystem to ensure clarity and value for community members?

  **Context:**
  - `Community members shared a comprehensive list of tokens in the elizaOS ecosystem including AI16Z, DEGENAI, ELIZA, ELI5, DOT, EDDY, JIMMY, RUBY, and LAURA with their contract addresses`
  - `Wintermute whale wallets reportedly hold 7% of EDDY tokens`
  - `Q: What is Eddy? I only listen to eli5 A: "Eli5 is confirmed, we still speculate on eddy"`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Focus resource allocation primarily on AI16Z as the core token, with limited support for secondary tokens.
        *Implication:* Creates clear hierarchy but may underutilize the potential of a multi-token ecosystem for specialized utilities.
    b) Develop and publish a comprehensive token relationship map with clearly defined roles, interactions, and utility for each token.
        *Implication:* Provides clarity but may constrain future token evolution if market demands change unexpectedly.
    c) Allow organic community-driven development of the token ecosystem with minimal official intervention.
        *Implication:* Enables emergent use cases but risks fragmentation, confusion, and potential dilution of core token value.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What approach should we take regarding institutional involvement in the token ecosystem?

  **Context:**
  - `Discussion about potential Wintermute (crypto market maker) involvement in the ecosystem, though evidence was disputed`
  - `Wintermute whale wallets reportedly hold 7% of EDDY tokens`
  - `Q: How does the economics ratio work between stablecoins and network value? A: With stablecoins, smart contracts allow funds to be frozen, making it more of a legal consideration`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Actively pursue strategic institutional partnerships to increase liquidity and market stability.
        *Implication:* Provides market strength but may conflict with decentralization goals and community governance.
    b) Maintain neutral stance, neither encouraging nor discouraging institutional involvement.
        *Implication:* Preserves optionality but may result in missed opportunities for strategic institutional partnerships.
    c) Implement mechanisms that prioritize community ownership and limit institutional concentration.
        *Implication:* Aligns with decentralization ethos but may limit access to institutional capital and liquidity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should we evolve the tokenomics of the ecosystem to better support the framework's development and adoption?

  **Context:**
  - `DorianD shared Grok-generated tokenomics upgrade recommendations including: Decentralized compute resource sharing, Token-gated knowledge exchange, Staking for reputation, Incentive-driven collaborative training, Governance mechanisms`
  - `Discussion about stablecoin security and how network value might scale with the value secured on it`
  - `Historical context of Tether's development on the Mastercoin protocol and its relation to Ethereum's creation`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement utility-focused tokenomics that directly tie token value to framework usage and resource allocation.

# Council Briefing: 2026-01-25

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- The Council must address critical friction between core team funding strategies and community trust amidst the Hyperscape 'GOLD' token controversy and resource constraints.

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Ecosystem Funding & Token Utility Strategy

**Summary of Topic:** The launch of project-specific tokens like GOLD has sparked intense community backlash despite a documented 8-month financial runway and $20M market cap. This creates a strategic tension between the need for localized project funding and the core principle of maintaining a unified ecosystem value in $elizaOS.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** How can elizaOS reconcile the team's need for project-specific funding with the community's demand for single-token utility?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw: '$20M mcap, 8 months runway, no budget to fund Hyperscape from existing allocations.'`
  - `DorianD: Proposed integrating $elizaos utility via platform fees for LLM compute and storage in all ecosystem apps.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Enforce a 'Network Fee' model where every sub-token action burns or pays fees in $elizaOS.
        *Implication:* Creates direct economic linkage between all ecosystem growth and the core token's value.
    b) Shift toward a Virtuals-style token pairing system for all incubated projects.
        *Implication:* Forces liquidity to remain tied to the core framework but increases complexity for new project launches.
    c) Establish a Grant DAO as the sole funding vehicle for internal and external projects.
        *Implication:* Reduces rogue token launches but requires liquidating or reallocating existing treasury resources.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Does the core team risk institutional burnout and loss of trust due to ongoing community friction?

  **Context:**
  - `Shaw: 'Threatened to leave the server due to ongoing drama.'`
  - `DannyNOR NoFapArc: 'Advised focus on building relationships and potential value of external backing.'`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Formalize the AI Chief of Staff role to mediate and filter community feedback for the core team.
        *Implication:* Protects core developer focus while ensuring community concerns are still captured and addressed.
    b) Implement a radical transparency dashboard showing real-time runway and project allocations.
        *Implication:* Aligns community expectations with financial reality but exposes sensitive operational data.
    c) Hold a 'Strategic Reset' council session to align the developer roadmap with partner expectations.
        *Implication:* Corrects 'scatterbrained decision-making' concerns at the cost of short-term shipping velocity.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: v2.0.0 Architectural Resilience & Contributor Dynamics

**Summary of Topic:** Operational logs indicate massive code churn toward v2.0.0 and WASM compatibility, but identify critical bottlenecks in ownership concentration. Specifically, a few core contributors are handling the bulk of the framework's evolution, presenting a continuity risk for the North Star mission.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Is the current contributor concentration around v2.0.0 development creating a 'Bus Factor' risk for the framework?

  **Context:**
  - `github_summaries: lalalune, odilitime, and 0xbbjoker dominate PR volume and review capacity.`
  - `revlentless: Authored 5,100+ lines for WASM runtime integration in a single PR.`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Incentivize documentation for the v2.0.0 core to lower the barrier for new high-tier contributors.
        *Implication:* Slows current development slightly but significantly increases long-term ecosystem stability.
    b) Implement a mandatory 'Shadow Review' program where junior devs co-review with lalalune/odilitime.
        *Implication:* Decentralizes system knowledge but requires significant time investment from top-tier talent.
    c) Aggressively fund external audits of the v2.0.0 dynamic execution engine.
        *Implication:* Ensures security and reliability without needing to expand the internal core team immediately.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

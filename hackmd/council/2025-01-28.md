# Council Briefing: 2025-01-28

## Monthly Goal

December 2025: Execution excellence—complete token migration with high success rate, launch ElizaOS Cloud, stabilize flagship agents, and build developer trust through reliability and clear documentation.

## Daily Focus

- A high-velocity engineering cycle shipped broad framework hardening (package publishing, provider expansion, and multi-plugin fixes), but Council attention is required to prevent reliability debt from outpacing “trust through shipping.”

## Key Points for Deliberation

### 1. Topic: Release Integrity Under Hyper-Throughput Development

**Summary of Topic:** GitHub activity indicates extreme throughput (dozens of PRs/day; hundreds/month) with meaningful bugfixes and security updates, but the volume raises risk of regressions, inconsistent plugin quality, and fragmented docs—directly challenging execution excellence and developer trust.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What governance mechanism should gate merges to protect reliability while preserving the ecosystem’s contribution velocity?

  **Context:**
  - `GitHub Activity Update: "From 2025-01-28 to 2025-01-29... 50 new pull requests, 37 merged pull requests, 44 active contributors."`
  - `Monthly repo overview: "1039 new PRs (735 merged)... 694 active contributors."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt a strict merge queue with required CI + targeted integration tests per plugin category (clients, chains, model providers).
        *Implication:* Maximizes reliability and long-term trust, but may slow community shipping and increase maintainer load.
    b) Implement a tiered policy: core/runtime changes require stricter gating; plugin changes use lighter checks and post-merge monitoring.
        *Implication:* Balances speed with safety, but risks plugin regressions leaking into perceived platform quality.
    c) Maintain current velocity and rely on rapid revert/hotfix culture plus community triage.
        *Implication:* Optimizes speed in the short term, but compounds reliability debt and weakens “developer-first” confidence.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Where should we draw the boundary between “open & composable” plugin expansion and the curated, stable core needed for ElizaOS Cloud readiness?

  **Context:**
  - `Daily Update (Jan 28): "Introduced public access to packages... Added a new model provider for LM Studio... numerous typing and functionality fixes across multiple plugins."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Define an 'LTS Core + Certified Plugins' set for Cloud; everything else stays community/experimental.
        *Implication:* Creates a clear trust surface for builders and Cloud SLAs, while keeping the ecosystem open.
    b) Keep everything in one fast-moving mainline, but add automated compatibility scoring and warnings in CLI/registry.
        *Implication:* Preserves openness with guardrails, but may still frustrate users when 'works on my machine' plugins break.
    c) Freeze plugin intake temporarily to stabilize and refactor toward v1.5/v2 architecture.
        *Implication:* Improves near-term stability, but risks community disengagement and lost mindshare.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Which “developer trust” deliverable should be prioritized next: deployment guidance, troubleshooting playbooks, or automated diagnostics?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord action items: "Create a Docker deployment guide for Eliza" (Magnacor); "Create a guide for deploying Eliza to cloud services" (Magnacor).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Prioritize a canonical Docker + VPS/Cloud deployment guide with opinionated defaults and known-good versions.
        *Implication:* Directly reduces onboarding friction and support load, improving reliability perception quickly.
    b) Prioritize a troubleshooting playbook for top recurring failures (Twitter auth, BN export, context limits, DB config).
        *Implication:* Immediately addresses community pain points and stabilizes flagship usage patterns.
    c) Prioritize automated diagnostics in CLI (env validation, dependency checks, actionable error messages).
        *Implication:* Builds scalable trust infrastructure, but takes longer to deliver than docs alone.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 2. Topic: Model Provider Strategy: DeepSeek Cost-Leverage vs Output Reliability

**Summary of Topic:** DeepSeek R1 integration is viewed as a major cost-efficiency win, but users report response artifacts and parsing issues; the Council must decide whether to treat DeepSeek as default-path optimization or an opt-in provider until response hygiene is guaranteed.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** Should DeepSeek be promoted to a first-class default path (where available) or remain an opt-in provider until output-format stability is proven?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (discussion/coders): "DeepSeek R1 Integration... completed... configure via DEEPSEEK_API_URL" (kingdode).`
  - `Discord (coders): "DeepSeek responses containing unwanted text like '(NONE)'" (kAI wilder).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Keep DeepSeek opt-in; publish a stability checklist and graduate it after passing parsing/format tests.
        *Implication:* Preserves trust through conservative defaults while still enabling cost savings for advanced builders.
    b) Make DeepSeek recommended for cost-sensitive deployments, but not default; add prominent caveats and templates.
        *Implication:* Accelerates adoption while managing expectations, though some users will still blame core for provider quirks.
    c) Promote DeepSeek as default where configured and treat issues as a fast-follow hardening sprint.
        *Implication:* Maximizes immediate ecosystem leverage, but risks reputational damage if outputs break agents in production.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** What is the correct architectural locus for “output hygiene” (JSON validity, line breaks, tool-call formats): provider adapters, shared parsing utilities, or prompt standards?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (coders): "Fix DeepSeek API integration to handle line breaks and JSON parsing properly" (kAI wilder).`
  - `GitHub (Jan 27/28): "Fixed JSON parsing bug with single quotes" (#2802); "fix: line break handling in chat" (#1784).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Centralize sanitation in shared parsing utilities used by all providers/clients.
        *Implication:* Creates consistent reliability across providers, reducing duplicated fixes and support churn.
    b) Keep sanitation provider-specific inside adapters to respect each model’s quirks and capabilities.
        *Implication:* Optimizes per-provider results, but increases maintenance complexity and cross-provider inconsistency.
    c) Standardize prompts and schemas more aggressively; treat sanitation as a last resort.
        *Implication:* Improves model behavior upstream, but may fail against brittle providers and still requires fallback logic.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** How should the Council message the DeepSeek integration to strengthen developer trust without overpromising production readiness?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (partners): "DeepSeek... merged two weeks prior... reduce costs while maintaining quality" (shaw).`
  - `Discord (associates): suggestion to "write/generate an article explaining how DeepSeek is bullish for open source AI" (smetter).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Position it as a validated option with clear 'known issues' and recommended mitigations (OpenRouter intermediary, prompt tweaks).
        *Implication:* Builds credibility through transparency and reduces support load via documented workarounds.
    b) Position it as a strategic bet and invite community benchmarking; publish a public scorecard of provider reliability.
        *Implication:* Harnesses community energy and aligns with open-source values, but may publicize shortcomings.
    c) Market it as a major breakthrough and focus messaging on cost savings and ecosystem momentum.
        *Implication:* Maximizes hype and adoption, but risks backlash if user experiences do not match claims.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

### 3. Topic: Token Utility & Liquidity Defense: Launchpad Timing, Yellowstone Model, and Cross-Chain Expansion

**Summary of Topic:** Community signals urgency: liquidity imbalance and unclear near-term utility are perceived threats; meanwhile, launchpad/marketplace and Yellowstone-style token-gated services are converging as the primary value-accrual narrative, with Base deployment proposed to broaden liquidity access.

#### Deliberation Items (Questions):

**Question 1:** What is the Council’s priority order: stabilize liquidity first, ship launchpad first, or push cross-chain expansion (Base) as the primary defense?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (associates): "AI16Z/SOL liquidity pool... $3M of AI16Z vs only $600K of SOL" (🔥🔥🔥 explaining to Smedroc).`
  - `Discord (tokenomics): "Deploy AI16Z on Base blockchain... potential for Coinbase listing" (mat).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Stabilize liquidity first (rebalance LP, add SOL/wBTC, reduce asymmetric price impact), then ship launchpad.
        *Implication:* Reduces immediate market fragility but may delay utility narrative and ecosystem expansion.
    b) Ship launchpad/marketplace first to create organic demand and fee/buyback loops that strengthen liquidity over time.
        *Implication:* Aligns with “trust through shipping,” but exposes token to short-term liquidity shocks.
    c) Prioritize Base deployment + interchain liquidity as the fastest route to new buyers and deeper markets.
        *Implication:* Potentially expands access quickly, but adds execution complexity and bridge/security considerations.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 2:** Should token utility be primarily consumption-based (Yellowstone: hold tokens to access premium services) or transaction-based (fees/tributes/buybacks per action)?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (tokenomics): "Yellowstone model... projects would hold tokens to access premium services rather than paying tributes" (Akin).`
  - `Discord (discussion): "agent marketplace/launchpad... tokenomics documentation nearly complete" (jin).`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Adopt Yellowstone as the core: token holdings unlock tiers (compute, Cloud features, distribution), with free basic access.
        *Implication:* Creates predictable demand via reserves/locking, but requires compelling premium features to avoid hollow gating.
    b) Use transaction-based sinks: marketplace fees and automated buybacks tied to agent usage and launches.
        *Implication:* Aligns utility with activity, but can feel extractive and may discourage experimentation by new builders.
    c) Hybrid: Yellowstone for premium infrastructure access + usage fees only for high-cost actions (compute, trading, media).
        *Implication:* Balances adoption and value accrual, but requires careful product/pricing clarity to avoid confusion.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

**Question 3:** Given reputational risk (e.g., demo-day projects allegedly rugging), how should the Council design launchpad safeguards without killing permissionless ethos?

  **Context:**
  - `Discord (discussion): "Builder Demo Day... PVPAI allegedly 'rugged' shortly after presenting."`

  **Multiple Choice Answers:**
    a) Implement a curated 'featured' track with stricter checks (disclosures, code audits, vesting templates) alongside a permissionless track.
        *Implication:* Protects brand trust while preserving openness, but requires governance bandwidth and clear labeling.
    b) Remain fully permissionless; add strong disclaimers and community-driven reputation signals (badges, attestations, reviews).
        *Implication:* Maximizes composability and decentralization, but risks repeated reputational hits and user losses.
    c) Gate launches via token-staked bonds that are slashed for proven fraud or abandonment.
        *Implication:* Creates economic disincentives for bad actors, but introduces dispute resolution complexity and edge cases.
    d) Other / More discussion needed / None of the above.

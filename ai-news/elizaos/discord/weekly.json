Summary\n\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion and is primarily dominated by off-topic cryptocurrency promotion, price speculation, and spam. The only technical content involves a **scam warning** where Jeburek12 received a fraudulent message claiming to be from technical support requesting manual token migration from ai16z to elizaOS by sending tokens to a specific wallet address.\n\nThe scam message instructed users to send their full ai16z token supply to address `77qVj3adpxbKjLuD9FoeFvDxHuAsro1cjvLVjuPQcEZ5` with promises of receiving equivalent elizaOS tokens within 24 hours. Odilitime responded that \"most do\" and called it \"best one of these yet,\" though the context suggests this may be sarcastic commentary on the scam's sophistication.\n\nOne user (Bless) asked about creating custom items for hyperscape to sell for gold, but received no response. Another user (chomppp) inquired about a Gold airdrop distribution to holders, also unanswered. The remainder of the chat consisted of promotional messages for various tokens (cjft, Marcus), price complaints, greetings, and a self-promotional AI career introduction from Geralt de Rivia.\n\nNo meaningful technical implementations, solutions, or decisions were discussed in this segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Can we make custom items for hyperscape and sell them for gold? (asked by Bless) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Did anybody get Gold airdrop? I saw Shaw said 10% goes to the holders (asked by chomppp) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Are u guys holding cjft?

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel focused on three main technical discussions:\n\n**DaVinci Resolve AI Integration Project**: Irie_Rubz initiated development of a DaVinci Resolve MCP integration (https://github.com/AyeRubz/davinci-resolve-mcp) despite being a new coder. The project aims to automate video editing tasks including timeline imports, effects, text animations, transitions, and audio management in Fairlight. PatoVeloso, a professional Resolve user, suggested two approaches: using transcription features to create trimmed sequences from longer content, and adding AI video transformation capabilities (e.g., converting real action to Pixar-style animation). Key limitation identified: DaVinci has restricted API allocations preventing fully autonomous features. Alternative platforms like Adobe Premiere Pro were discussed but dismissed due to subscription costs.\n\n**Eliza CLI Version Migration Issues**: YogaFlame encountered persistent version conflicts when updating from 1.6.5 to 1.7.2, experiencing SQL migration failures and bootstrap errors with the Discord plugin. 0xbbjoker provided systematic troubleshooting: clearing cache with `bun pm cache rm`, uninstalling/reinstalling CLI globally, and removing node_modules/bun.lock files. The issue stemmed from cached package.json references to 1.6.5. Solution involved either manually updating package.json to 1.7.2 or creating a fresh project. Bootstrap issues were confirmed fixed in elizaos 1.7.2 and discord plugin 1.3.8.\n\n**Clawd.bot Discussion**: DorianD shared clawd.bot project, which gained attention for running on Mac minis with local models and featuring Meta Raybans integration for price comparison functionality.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How do I add the DaVinci Resolve integration to Eliza AI agents? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Should I integrate with Eliza now or wait until the project is working? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: How true is the limitation about DaVinci's API allocations preventing fully autonomous features? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Confirmed as a limitation; DaVinci has limited API allocations preventing fully autonomous creation until they allow more (answered by Irie_Rubz via research)\n\nQ: What are the migration errors when updating to 1.7.2? (asked by YogaFlame) A: Failed SQL migration errors and bootstrap errors with Discord plugin, caused by version caching issues (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\nQ: How do I fix the CLI showing 1.6.5 after updating to 1.7.2? (asked by YogaFlame) A: Run `bun uninstall -g @elizaos/cli`, `bun pm cache rm`, `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`, remove node_modules & bun.lock, update package.json to 1.7.2 or create fresh project (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\nQ: How do I run ChatGPT and Claude Code together for faster editing? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Self-resolved, no details provided (answered by Irie_Rubz)\n\nQ: Do you need a Mac to run clawd.bot? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: No, people are just using Macs for running local models (answered by DorianD)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\n\nHelper: 0xbbjoker | Helpee: YogaFlame | Context: CLI version stuck on 1.6.5 after update to 1.7.2 with migration errors | Resolution: Provided cache clearing commands and confirmed bootstrap fixes in latest versions\n\nHelper: 0xbbjoker | Helpee: YogaFlame | Context: Persistent version conflicts in package.json | Resolution: Instructed to remove node_modules/bun.lock and update package.json references or create fresh project\n\nHelper: PatoVeloso | Helpee: Irie_Rubz | Context: DaVinci Resolve AI integration approach | Resolution: Suggested using transcription features for content trimming and adding AI video transformation capabilities\n\nHelper: DorianD | Helpee: ElizaBAO | Context: Clarification on Mac requirement for clawd.bot | Resolution: Explained Macs are used for local models, not required for the project itself\n\n## 4.

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 🥇-partners\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centers on a critical strategic debate about ElizaOS's tokenomics and ecosystem development approach. The core tension involves whether the team should launch separate tokens for ecosystem projects (like Hyperscape game) versus focusing exclusively on the main $elizaos token.\n\n**Key Context:** ElizaOS has a $20M market cap with 8 months runway remaining. Shaw reveals the team is resource-constrained, with no budget to fund Hyperscape development from existing Cloud and Babylon allocations. Babylon has 375k users, and cloud apps are launching soon.\n\n**Strategic Decision:** The team launched a separate \"gold\" token for Hyperscape (a RuneScape-like crypto game built on Eliza agents) via a Pump.fun hackathon to fund development. This token serves as in-game currency with specific utility. Shaw is on a 2-week MVP schedule with the Hyperscape team.\n\n**Community Concerns:** Members argue this approach dilutes attention from the main token, damages reputation, and reduces confidence in the ecosystem. They cite Vitalik's approach of never launching tokens beyond ETH and only advising projects. Suggestions include: airdrops to elizaOS holders, token pairing requirements (like Virtuals ecosystem), or grants-based funding instead of team-launched tokens.\n\n**Alternative Proposals:** DorianD suggests technical integration where game items/agents trigger $elizaos burns or network fees, creating actual utility linkage. The proposal emphasizes that every in-game action requiring LLM compute or storage should involve platform fees in $elizaos, similar to how EVM requires the underlying network.\n\n**Critical Outcome:** Shaw expresses frustration with community negativity, noting he made $400k a year ago, held $200k in tokens that declined significantly, never sold, and now faces resource constraints and tax obligations. He threatens to leave the server due to ongoing drama around ecosystem development decisions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is there an airdrop of gold for elizaOS holders? (asked by Odilitime) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Why launch coins for everything instead of focusing on singular $elizaos token? (asked by mawnst3r) A: Shaw explained they have $20M market cap with 8 months runway, no budget to fund Hyperscape from existing allocations, so separate token launches fund development of games built on Eliza framework (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Has Vitalik ever launched any other coin besides ETH? (asked by sayitaintso25) A: No, and he's reluctant to even endorse tokens in the ETH ecosystem (answered by sayitaintso25)\n\nQ: Do you want buybacks or airdrops? (asked by shaw) A: Community suggested airdrops to elizaOS holders or token pairing requirements, but no consensus reached (answered by community discussion)\n\nQ: Has anyone else built a framework and then incubated a whole ecosystem of apps and games on it? (asked by shaw) A: Implied comparison to Ethereum ecosystem, but no direct answer provided (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Why is full attention aimed at a game nobody asked for? (asked by Broccolex) A: Shaw explained Hyperscape is built by separate team on Eliza agents, funded via token launch due to budget constraints (answered by shaw)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe channel discussion centered on three main technical topics: MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration with Eliza Cloud, self-hosting options, and security concerns.\n\n**MCP Integration with Eliza Cloud**: SATA inquired about adding external MCP servers to agents created in Eliza Cloud, specifically for an AI Red Teaming agent with human-in-the-loop functionality. SOLOMON VANDY clarified that external MCP servers can be registered through the Eliza Cloud API using POST /api/v1/mcps endpoint, and once registered, Eliza can proxy calls to those MCP endpoints for agent reasoning and task execution.\n\n**Self-Hosting Discussion**: LarpsAI mentioned that users are deploying Eliza on mini PCs to avoid keeping their main systems running 24/7. A blog post was referenced about running Eliza on Oracle Cloud's free tier with 4 vCPU and 24GB RAM specifications. There was brief discussion about Claude Code integration with Eliza.\n\n**Security Issues**: A scam attempt was identified involving a \"Create A Ticket\" bot that requested wallet addresses from users. SATA reported receiving a suspicious link after posting questions in the channel. Odilitime confirmed this was a scam operation, likely using automated astroturfing tactics.\n\n**Other Topics**: DorianD discussed potential monetization strategies involving phone OS integration and data collection for AI training. ElizaBAO posted a developer hiring notice with creator rewards and Polymarket affiliate profit sharing. Kenk requested adding Eliza MCP functionality to the channel.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is it possible to give an agent created within Eliza Cloud access to an external MCP? (asked by SATA) A: You can add external MCP servers by registering them through the Eliza Cloud API using POST /api/v1/mcps, and once registered, Eliza can proxy calls to those MCP endpoints (answered by SOLOMON VANDY)\n\nQ: Can we add eliza mcp here? (asked by Kenk) A: Probably no reason why we can't (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is an AI Red Teaming agent with human in the loop possible with ElizaOS? (asked by SATA) A: External MCP servers can be registered through the API to enable this functionality (answered by SOLOMON VANDY)\n\nQ: Why would support bot need wallet address?

Summary\n\nThe discussion channel primarily focused on community concerns about the ElizaOS token price performance, with multiple users expressing worry about continuous all-time lows (ATLs). The main technical inquiry involved token migration processes, specifically from Ledger and from ai16z to ElizaOS tokens.\n\n**Key Concerns Raised:**\n- Token validity and community support for ElizaOS\n- Price performance and lack of team response during market downturn\n- Migration procedures for tokens\n\n**Community Responses:**\nThe community provided reassurance about the project's fundamentals, with members emphasizing that ElizaOS is positioned as a leading AI agent project. Contributors noted the broader market volatility affecting all crypto assets, not just ElizaOS specifically. Long-term holders shared their 4-year cycle investment strategy, comparing ElizaOS favorably with other AI projects like PAAL and FETCH.\n\n**Technical Support Needs:**\nTwo migration-related questions were raised: Ledger migration and ai16z to ElizaOS token migration. The Void directed users to a ticket channel (#1425417640071139358) for migration support, indicating a formal support process exists for these technical issues.\n\nThe overall sentiment mixed frustration about short-term price action with long-term conviction in the AI agent technology and ElizaOS's market position.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is the Elizaos token still valid? Is the community interested in it, or is it being left to die? (asked by paolin) A: The token is valid; the market downturn is affecting all crypto, not just ElizaOS specifically. The team is building the future of AI agents and ElizaOS is among leading projects in this space. (answered by Matthib123, Rainman)\n\nQ: How can I migrate from ledger?

Summary\n\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion and is primarily focused on community sentiment and project strategy. Seppmos provides a defense of the project direction, expressing frustration with community members criticizing Shaw and token performance. The key strategic points mentioned include: the project's multi-product approach with several initiatives in development (Babylon, Hyperscape, Cloud, OTC desk, Eliza Anime), an airdrop-based reward strategy for long-term holders, and confidence in the development team's capabilities in AI agent development. The proposed strategy involves iterating on multiple products until one achieves viral success, then rewarding ElizaOS holders through airdrops (mentioning HYPE and BABY as examples).

Summary\n\nThe channel focused on two major technical issues: Knowledge plugin configuration errors and cost optimization.\n\n**Knowledge Plugin Configuration Issue**: YogaFlame encountered validation errors when installing the Knowledge plugin, receiving \"Invalid enum value\" errors for EMBEDDING_PROVIDER (expected 'openai' | 'google', received 'openrouter') and TEXT_PROVIDER. DigitalDiva identified the root cause: openrouter was incorrectly set as the embedding provider instead of openai.\n\n**Knowledge Plugin Cost Optimization**: Tyrone reported extremely high costs ($0.03-0.04 per query, tens of thousands of tokens) when using the Knowledge plugin with OpenAI for simple requests on three small markdown documents (13-30 lines each). The issue was traced to contextual embeddings being enabled (CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true). 0xbbjoker provided a minimal configuration solution using OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_MODEL with openai/text-embedding-3-small, demonstrating successful embedding of a 3.1MB PDF with 517 chunks at reasonable cost. The key insight was that contextual embeddings significantly increase token usage and costs, as documented in the ctx-embeddings.ts file.\n\n**Other Technical Discussions**: DigitalDiva inquired about integrating ElizaOS AI agents with OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoints supporting OpenAI JSON API, OpenRouter, and Kobold API options. Odilitime expressed strong preference for Opus 4.5 model, with sedano.npc confirming similar experience. Irie_Rubz worked on a first project built from scratch in Cursor, seeking guidance on Git integration and multi-agent workflows.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThe team is pivoting from hardware-focused development (Mac mini) to building an AI agent platform called \"Eliza\" that can perform automated tasks. The core technical focus is integrating n8n workflow automation with Eliza v2.0.0 (published to npm as @elizaos/core@next) to enable dynamic workflow creation through natural language.\n\n**Key Technical Decisions:**\n- Eliza v2 branch includes computer use and browser use capabilities based on working open source implementations\n- Adopting n8n plugin architecture as the primary approach for workflow automation instead of building native plugins for each service\n- Three-layer architecture proposed: AI Workflow Generator (Layer 3), Workflow Engine with TaskService/cron (Layer 2), and OAuth Gateway for multi-tenant credentials (Layer 1)\n- Using n8n-intelligence (open source) to enable agents to create workflows conversationally\n- Setting up n8n hosted cloud instance for scaling\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\nThe team identified that users want AI-powered workflow builders (95% use case) rather than extensive auto-coding. Focus is on connecting services like Gmail, Calendar, Notion, and Linear with conditional logic. The approach involves creating pre-built common workflows, then using Claude Opus to generate new ones based on closest matches, marking them as experimental and debugging with users before adding to the library.\n\n**Immediate Priorities:**\nEnd-of-week deadline for top-of-funnel: landing page → poke integration → agent conversation. The agent personality needs to be \"funny, spunky, and spicy\" but not mean. Team is exploring n8n capabilities first before continuing plugin development to understand limitations and determine optimal tool selection.\n\n**Parallel Development:**\nSam working on SMS/iMessage plugins and cloud platform integration. Stan focusing on mail/calendar and n8n plugin development with OAuth support. Odilitime developing plugin-pim (Personal Information Manager) using entity/component architecture and memories.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What issues did Vivek have with the system? (asked by Odilitime) A: Mainly plugin-knowledge and web-search issues on gptoss 20b (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is Eliza v2.0.0 available for testing? (asked by sam) A: Yes, published to \"next\" - install with npm install @elizaos/core@next (answered by s)\n\nQ: Should we build native plugins or use n8n? (asked by s) A: After OAuth, n8n plugin would be slickest - can validate workflows by credentials needed and create stuff for users on the fly (answered by s)\n\nQ: How do we test dynamically generated workflows? (asked by s) A: Pre-create common workflows, use Opus to generate new ones based on closest matches, mark as experimental, debug with users, review/fix on backend, add fixed versions to library (answered by s)\n\nQ: What's the main user need - autocoding or workflows? (asked by sam) A: 95% want AI workflow builder, only few nerds want autocoding - people want to connect email/notion/calendar/linear with if statements (answered by s)\n\nQ: Should we stop Twilio/BLOOIO work and focus on n8n? (asked by sam) A: n8n is for workflows, still need cloud runtime for iMessage/WhatsApp chat clients - should prioritize n8n first to understand limits before continuing plugins (answered by Stan ⚡ and Odilitime)\n\nQ: How does plugin addition by user request work currently? (asked by Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE) A: Stan will work on n8n plugin to allow OAuth connection and workflow creation in dedicated n8n instance by asking Eliza directly (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Can we pass plugin credentials to n8n? (asked by Odilitime) A: Yes, credentials from plugins like plugin-gmail can be passed to n8n for workflow access (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Is n8n-intelligence open sourced? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Yes (answered by s)\n\nQ: Who needs n8n cloud account access? (asked by Borko) A: Invites sent to Shaw, Stan and Sam (answered by Borko)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe discussion primarily focused on criticism of a \"hot potato\" style FOMO dapp and concerns about the ElizaOS Twitter presence. DorianD identified that a developer created a game mechanism similar to the original Bitcoin Potato game (referencing the GitHub repository ripper234/Bitcoin-Potato), where participants pass around tokens in a gambling-style format. The critical issue raised was that the developer receives vestings of the required participation coin, allowing them to profit from coin sales while having unlimited supply to reset the game without cost - creating what DorianD characterized as a potential scam structure.\n\nDorianD expressed serious legal concerns, suggesting the developer could face lawsuits from participants and government investigation for illegal gambling operations. He noted that government attorneys and gambling commissions might pursue profit clawback, emphasizing this as a reason why truly decentralized agents are necessary to avoid legal liability.\n\nThe conversation shifted to constructive feedback about the ElizaOS Twitter account. DorianD recommended that the @elizaos account adopt more personality and \"soul\" similar to successful AI personas like clawd.atg.eth and pippin. He noted the current feed appears too dry and corporate, suggesting it should embody the actual Eliza AI personality based on the show that one of the team members worked on, incorporating projective anime elements. The rationale was that people connect with the human-like aspects of AI, and a more engaging persona could drive better community engagement. Odilitime responded positively, mentioning they're building a Twitter agent that could potentially fulfill this role.\n\n## 2.

(asked by DorianD) A: The developer receives vestings of the coin required to participate, so they profit from selling the coin while having near endless supply to reset the game at no cost (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: What legal risks does the developer face? (asked by DorianD) A: Potential lawsuits from participants and government investigation for illegal gambling, with possibility of profit clawback from gambling commissions (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Why are decentralized agents important in this context? (asked by DorianD) A: To enable activities without legal liability falling on individuals, preventing situations like FBI raids at 6am (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: What should the ElizaOS Twitter account do differently? (asked by DorianD) A: It should have more soul and actual Eliza persona based on the show, incorporating projective anime elements, rather than being dry and corporate (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: What are they building for Twitter?

Summary\n\nThe channel focused on several key technical areas: Git workflow guidance, embedding configuration issues, SSE streaming implementation, and AI agent architecture discussions.\n\n**Git Workflow & Version Control**: Odilitime provided comprehensive guidance to Irie_Rubz on basic Git operations, explaining commit vs pull request workflows, staging files, and branch management. The discussion covered forking repos for OSS contributions versus working on personal repositories.\n\n**Embedding Provider Issues**: Multiple users (YogaFlame, DigitalDiva, jin) reported problems with OpenRouter embeddings in the knowledge plugin, with only OpenAI working reliably. Jin questioned whether OpenAI embeddings are now mandatory. Odilitime clarified that Ollama, OpenAI, and OpenRouter are supported options, with plans to move embeddings completely to plugins in version 2.x.\n\n**SSE Streaming & Socket Implementation**: sedano.npc encountered MIME_TYPE_MISMATCH errors when setting up SSE streaming. Chucknorris recommended switching from SSE to socket.io, reporting better results. The issue was traced to incorrect backend deployment configuration (local vs cloud).\n\n**Eliza Framework Analysis**: Jin analyzed the clawdbot project, highlighting useful patterns including markdown-based configuration files (BOOTSTRAP.md, SOUL.md), skills integration, and structured home directories. Discussion emphasized that good documentation combined with skills can significantly improve agent performance.\n\n**Knowledge Plugin Architecture**: Victor Creed and 0xbbjoker discussed the SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE action, confirming it returns raw document fragments without LLM summarization. 0xbbjoker suggested creating custom actions that prepare multiple queries and generate summaries.\n\n**Development Tools**: sedano.npc reported issues with Cursor's AUTO mode breaking applications after 8+ hours of troubleshooting. Odilitime recommended using Composer 1 instead, which resolved deployment issues instantly.\n\n**Future Concepts**: DorianD proposed building a small local model for intelligent request routing between available models based on complexity, cost, and load parameters. Odilitime noted the current system alternates between small/large model selections from providers.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What's the difference between commit and pull request? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Commit is like save changes. Pull request is when working on someone else's OSS repo - you have to fork first. For your own repo, commit and push is sufficient. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Should I stage all files or select specific ones? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Staging selects which files to send up. As long as you don't have files with passwords, \"Yes\" is like \"Save All\". (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Does OpenRouter embedding work with the knowledge plugin? (asked by YogaFlame) A: It kept giving errors; only OpenAI has worked so far. (answered by YogaFlame)\n\nQ: Are we forced to use OpenAI for embeddings now? (asked by jin) A: Ollama, OpenAI, or OpenRouter are supported. Version 2.x will drop embeddings in runtime and move it completely to plugins. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: How do I fix MIME_TYPE_MISMATCH error with SSE streaming? (asked by sedano.npc) A: Need to explore routes and understand how Eliza server handles SSE. Switching to socket.io is much better than SSE. (answered by Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)\n\nQ: Does SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE action summarize doc fragments before returning? (asked by Victor Creed) A: No summarization, it's just a query to fragments returning three most similar. You can easily build custom action to prepare queries and make summaries. (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\nQ: Does the Twitter plugin still work and is it expensive to run? (asked by SLAPPY) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Why has the discord become so quiet? (asked by SLAPPY) A: People are still working hard, folks just have less time to post messages. (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Does ElizaOS multiplex between models based on request complexity? (asked by DorianD) A: No, we have small/large model selection from a provider but just alternate between those two. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Should I use Cursor AUTO mode or Composer? (asked by sedano.npc) A: Don't use AUTO. Composer 1 is better than AUTO and lower cost. (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

The tracking system automatically monitors active/inactive repos and new/archived channels, moving toward a self-maintaining configuration system.\n\nA major theme was improving developer onboarding and Time To Value. **jin** emphasized creating a bootstrapping skill that connects agents to knowledge repositories, docs, and GitHub activity data, enabling agents to self-troubleshoot. The philosophy centers on treating documentation as code and prompt engineering, with knowledge bundled like game manuals.\n\n**Stan** made progress on the plugin-n8n-workflow (30% complete with regular commits) and coordinated OAuth specifications with team members. The team discussed renaming the elizaos.github.io repository, debating names like \"leaders.elizaos.ai\" or \"leaderboard\" but ultimately deciding against ranking implications in favor of showcasing contributor competencies and codebase evolution.\n\n**sayonara** established a PR workflow for documentation updates through the elizaOS/docs repository. The team celebrated a significant payment milestone and discussed clawdbot's success as an opportunity for Eliza. Technical infrastructure improvements included MCP integration for agents to access comprehensive elizaOS and elizaos-plugins GitHub activity data.\n\n## 2.

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on three main technical topics: the ai16z to ElizaOS migration, ERC-8004 agent tokenization standard, and AI agent network development.\n\n**Migration Issues**: Multiple users (ai16zbags, Never Broke Again) reported that the migration site failed to detect ai16z tokens in Phantom wallets. Hexx provided clarification that ai16z migrated to ElizaOS, and holders from before the November snapshot at 11:40 UTC should use the migration portal to convert tokens.\n\n**ERC-8004 Agent Standard**: satsbased discussed the upcoming ERC-8004 mainnet launch on Ethereum, scheduled for this week. This standard enables agent identity and reputation tracking onchain, allowing verification of whether AI agents are legitimate or \"larps\" (fake). The implementation aims to bring trustless tokenization to AI agents, with satsbased positioning this as a significant development for the ecosystem.\n\n**AI Avatar Network Concept**: timcoucou proposed building a network similar to fetch.ai where members have AI avatars that automatically discover each other through similarity matching, conduct autonomous discussions, and send reports when interesting opportunities arise. The goal is pre-qualified, enthusiastic meetings between users. This TypeScript developer sought recommendations on implementation approach.\n\n**Ecosystem Tracking**: Discussion touched on tracking the ElizaOS ecosystem, with mentions of hyperscape game, clawdbot on Base, and projects like Babylon and Otaku. Concerns were raised about token value proposition for investors, with Taco questioning why investors would buy the token currently despite appreciating the project.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThe channel discussion covered several technical topics, primarily focused on AI routing systems and action callback patterns in Eliza framework.\n\n**DorianD** initiated a discussion about AI model routing frameworks, identifying existing solutions like RouteLLM (Python-based for prompt complexity analysis), Latitude.so (prompt engineering platform), and MasRouter (multi-agent system management). They proposed creating an \"ElizaRouter\" with a distributed routing mechanism where receiving nodes select optimal nodes with time decay for Quality of Service. Small open-source models were evaluated for routing purposes, including Microsoft Phi-4 Mini (3.8B-14B), Qwen2.5/Qwen3 (1.5B-7B), Mistral 7B, and DeepSeek-Coder for code-specific tasks.\n\n**Victor Creed** reported a critical bug in Eliza 1.7.2 regarding action callback execution order. The documented callback pattern should send messages sequentially: (1) initial feedback, (2) structured return text, (3) detailed callback message. However, the actual behavior reverses the order, sending the detailed callback first, then initial feedback, and omitting the structured return message entirely. This issue affects custom plugins using `plugin-sql`, `plugin-openai`, and `plugin-bootstrap`. The problem remains unresolved as no community members provided solutions.\n\n**Supreem** shared an interview about agentic coding systems. **DorianD** later proposed an unconventional idea about collecting training data for robotics through viral social media challenges similar to TikTok dance trends, focusing on household tasks like sweeping, mopping, and ironing.\n\n## 2.

Odilitime suggested editing the project's package.json to include proper module resolution and directed them to use bun for installation and the appropriate support channel for further assistance.\n\nSarthak faced a token migration issue with ElizaOS tokens on ETH chain showing 98% loss when attempting to swap back to ETH or USDT due to zero liquidity. Kenk attempted to clarify whether this was a slippage or migration question, and MDMnvest directed them to the migration channel.\n\n**Token Economics Discussion:**\nA significant portion of the chat involved critical questions about token utility and team allocation. Key concerns raised by averma, gby, and Jayzen included: the 40% token allocation to the team after a 1:10 token increase (where community received only 6 while team got 40%), lack of clear use cases for the token, airdrops depleting community liquidity, and the token hitting all-time lows. \n\nOdilitime defended the project stating the migration from ai16z to elizaos was necessary for rebranding and multichain accessibility. He clarified that the token's primary utility includes being the accepted currency in their products, gas fees for Jeju, and buy-back mechanisms from credit card rail revenue. However, community members expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of concrete utility beyond Jeju gas fees.\n\n## 2.

DannyNOR expressed concern about whether these funds are held in stablecoins versus volatile crypto assets, with Broccolex suggesting based on chart performance that funds may not be in stables.\n\nThe remainder of the conversation consists of DorianD's sarcastic commentary on the current state of crypto markets and centralized AI infrastructure. He sarcastically suggests people are abandoning trustless systems for traditional banking, preferring legal contracts over smart contracts, and accepting centralized AI servers despite privacy concerns. DorianD speculates that government agencies like the NSA likely have operatives at major AI companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, XAI) to modify model weights for political influence.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered around three main technical topics:\n\n**Plugin Development**: Odilitime is actively updating the plugin-local-ai for easy embeddings integration, working on a development branch. He shared experiences using Claude Sonnet 4.5 versus Opus, noting Sonnet is adequate for smaller tasks but Opus is preferred for larger projects.\n\n**Eliza vs Clawdbot Comparison**: A significant technical discussion emerged comparing ElizaOS to Clawdbot. Key distinctions identified: Eliza functions as a multi-agent system while Clawdbot operates as a personal assistant with social media, calendar access, and voice interface. DorianD highlighted Eliza's lack of mobile footprint as a gap that should be addressed. The conversation revealed Clawdbot users face API fee issues and Anthropic bans for non-human user TOS violations when using subscription plans.\n\n**Moltbook and Agent Integration Strategy**: DorianD introduced Moltbook (described as \"Reddit for agents\") and proposed a strategic integration plan. The concept involves getting Moltbot users (running on Mac Minis) to migrate to the Jeju network when they encounter high API costs. The technical architecture would involve running Moltbot, Eliza, and Claude together, then networking Moltbot into Jeju for storage nodes, cron jobs, and other services.

Summary\n\nThe discussion primarily focused on migration issues from ai16z to elizaos tokens and security concerns around scam attempts. Multiple users reported problems with the migration portal at migrate.elizafoundation.ai, with some wallets showing \"0 eligible\" despite holding tokens since late 2024. Odilitime confirmed the migration tool should work automatically and suggested checking if tokens were in LP, different wallets, or purchased after snapshot date.\n\nA critical security incident occurred when coolart reported being hacked after generating a ticket, with funds stolen from Phantom and Metamask wallets. Odilitime and other moderators repeatedly warned that official support never DMs users - all DM requests are scammers. FeRhaT_@ also reported receiving friend requests from supposed \"ticket support team\" members.\n\nTechnical discussions included DorianD explaining Jeju's staking mechanism for service providers (compute, data storage nodes), currently using ETH as placeholder in the repo. The staking requirement applies to various node services. DorianD recommended searching the Jeju repo for *.md files for documentation.\n\nToken utility concerns were raised by Taco and averma, questioning investor value and use cases. averma suggested implementing transaction mechanisms similar to Virtuals' bonding curve within ElizaOS. Odilitime responded that using elizaos as the main token wasn't technically feasible due to excessive work required, preferring the airdrop approach.\n\nPrivacy and decentralization concerns emerged from yojo questioning ElizaOS's independence, citing the privacy policy and USA-based operations. DorianD defended the project as \"an open systems network for everything agents need to run.\" Odilitime acknowledged communication challenges, stating \"we're doing big brain stuff and people just don't get it\" and need to simplify explanations once users can interact with the product.\n\nTechnical issues included jaistklaas reporting 429 \"Too many requests\" errors on the migration page even after IP reset, occurring before wallet connection. TonKLa experienced similar \"0 eligible\" issues migrating from Solflare wallet.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Where should I go if the migration tool doesn't work?

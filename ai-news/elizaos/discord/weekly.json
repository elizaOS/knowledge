          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on several technical issues and project clarifications. The most significant technical problem involved DigitalDiva's database migration issue when switching from PGLite to PostgreSQL. Despite setting the database URL in the ENV file, creating schemas, and configuring permissions, the system continued attempting to use the local dataDir path (.eliza/.elizadb) and failed on the \"CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS migrations\" query. This issue remained unresolved in the chat.\n\nOdilitime clarified token distribution across projects, confirming that Babylon will have its own token while Jeju uses $elizaOS. Regarding airdrops, no official details have been announced, and Odilitime confirmed uncertainty about eligibility. Broccolex advised holding tokens in personal wallets rather than exchange wallets for potential airdrop qualification, citing the complexity of the migration coordination.\n\nShl0w shared their approach to building an Eliza/n8n inspired system that doesn't require API or database access due to cost constraints, while maintaining scalability. UNKE_CED inquired about autonomous agent transactions, specifically regarding risk management, limits, and approvals when building on top of Safe, but received no responses.\n\nMakzent asked about a hosted version of Eliza Town, initially unclear if the project was live. Kenk clarified it's a community-started project, and makzent confirmed understanding that a user-facing version is coming soon based on earlier tweets.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is each project having its own token? (asked by gby) A: Babylon will have its own token, Jeju is using $elizaOS (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Do we get airdrop if we hold ElizaOS on CEX? (asked by chomppp) A: No airdrop details have been announced, so no clue (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Are exchange wallets available for drops? (asked by Biazs) A: Always best to hold them in your own wallet if you want to qualify, coordination was messy during migration (answered by Broccolex)\n\nQ: Where can I find the hosted version of Eliza Town? (asked by makzent) A: It's a community-started project on github, user-facing version coming soon (answered by Kenk)\n\nQ: How are you handling risk, limits, approvals for agents that transact autonomously, building on top of Safe?

The primary technical problem involved Discord plugin compatibility and PostgreSQL database configuration issues. DigitalDiva encountered problems after upgrading from version 1.6.5, experiencing Discord plugin failures and PostgreSQL migration errors. The solution involved updating to elizaos 1.7.2 with plugin-discord 1.3.7 and performing a fresh database installation after dropping the existing instance.\n\nA significant database migration error occurred where the system was searching for PGLite instead of PostgreSQL despite proper configuration. The error manifested during table creation for the \"worlds\" table with UUID and JSONB fields. The resolution required version migration and database reset since the system had conflicting database adapter references.\n\nThirtieth provided a project update on pivoting from a Polymarket agent to a support agent named \"Hank\" that successfully handled its first high-level support request for a scientific research tool. Future plans include building marketing and sales agents with automated LinkedIn and email campaigns.\n\nAdditional discussions included recommendations for Remotion as a video generation tool, questions about integrating the Polymarket plugin into elizacloud agents, and a request for collaboration on a TCG (Trading Card Game) project needing UI/visual assistance with card generation uniformity issues.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How can I integrate the Polymarket plugin to elizacloud agent? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Any update on the Discord plugin issue?

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion primarily centered around token migration issues and community concerns. Multiple users encountered problems migrating AI16Z tokens to the new contract, with the most significant case involving a user (ryanb.btc) who transferred tokens from Robinhood wallet (which lacks dapp browser functionality) to another wallet, causing migration eligibility issues. Kenk from support successfully resolved this through the ticketing system.\n\nA critical security incident was identified when Jeburek12 reported being asked to send AI16Z tokens to a wallet address for migration. Kenk confirmed this was a scam attempt, clarifying that legitimate migration doesn't require sending tokens to external addresses since migration contracts are capped.\n\nCommunity sentiment showed frustration with project direction. DannyNOR NoFapArc and Jayzen criticized the team for launching multiple tokens instead of focusing on core infrastructure, with Jayzen specifically noting concerns about \"scatterbrained decision-making\" and spreading resources thin over tokens not directly tied to the underlying platform.\n\nTechnical contributions emerged with Momo announcing work on an RLM plugin for Eliza v2 after discussions with Shaw, marking their first major open-source contribution despite finding it challenging.\n\nQuestions arose about related projects: Malombres asked about Agent Scarlett's status, and velja repeatedly questioned a Hyperscape token funded by Shaw's wallet, though this remained unaddressed. The Three Words expressed concerns about ElizaOS's low liquidity (110k LP) on Solana.\n\nElizaBAO organized a video creator competition for ElizaBAO content involving ElizaOS and Polymarket. Kenk advised structuring it as a clear challenge with bounties, acknowledging content creation as a skilled, time-intensive task.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Who migrated successfully? (asked by Jeburek12) A: ryanb.btc confirmed successful migration after support assistance (answered by ryanb.btc)\n\nQ: Support is asking to send AI16Z to a wallet address for migration. Can the team publicly confirm this is legitimate? (asked by Jeburek12) A: This is a scam; legitimate migration doesn't require sending tokens to external addresses (answered by Kenk)\n\nQ: Has agent scarlett been \"terminated\"?

The primary problem involved elizacloud experiencing server-side errors preventing user login, with multiple users (untitled, xyz and ElizaBAO) reporting access issues throughout the day.\n\nA significant database migration problem was resolved where DigitalDiva encountered persistent \"CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS migrations\" errors with both local and Aiven cloud Postgres databases. The solution involved switching to Neon database, successfully resolving the migration failures after troubleshooting with 0xbbjoker about pgvector image compatibility.\n\nDiscord integration issues emerged after updating to version 1.7.2, with errors in the recentMessagesProvider showing \"Cannot access invalid private field (evaluating 'this.#conversationLength')\". The agent failed to respond in both channels and DMs, with 0xbbjoker investigating the issue and clarifying that CHANNEL_IDS serves as a channel whitelist.\n\nDorianD proposed distributed computation concepts for Jeju, suggesting nodes could work together similar to p2pool mining on Bitcoin network, with computation layers distributed across nodes and results compared to prevent cheating. The discussion included using iPhones with 8GB RAM to provide compute cycles when devices are idle (90%+ battery). Chucknorris suggested using ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proofs) to prevent cheating, though DorianD questioned implementation feasibility on consumer devices, noting only one Bittensor subnet (Omron) currently uses ZKP with limited commercial scalability.\n\nAdditional discussions covered Claude Opus 4.5 subscription comparisons, with Chucknorris criticizing Google's Antigravity offering as inferior to Windsurf due to quota limitations and performance issues.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThis brief discussion focused on comparing Second Life and Roblox as historical case studies for understanding virtual world platforms, specifically in the context of applying lessons to \"hyperscape\" development. DorianD initiated the conversation by noting both platforms launched around the same time approximately 20 years ago, suggesting their successes and failures could inform current development efforts.\n\nThe key technical observation centered on Roblox's business model paradox: despite generating billions in revenue and maintaining hundreds of millions of monthly active users (reportedly 380M MAU), the platform remains unprofitable. DorianD noted skepticism about the accuracy of these user metrics, suggesting significant inflation from duplicate accounts and bot activity.\n\nOdilitime characterized Roblox as a \"jobs program,\" highlighting concerns about the platform's economic model and its reliance on user-generated content creation. The discussion touched on the ethical implications of platforms that depend heavily on unpaid or minimally compensated user labor for content creation.\n\nWhile brief, the conversation raised important considerations for virtual world platform design: sustainability of business models that rely on massive scale, the accuracy and reliability of user metrics, and the economic relationship between platforms and content creators.\n\n## 2.

          "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThis chat segment primarily focused on a critical token launch crisis involving improper tokenomics. The core issue was that cjft launched a token with 75% of supply bundled/held by the developer, which violates current crypto meta standards and creates rug pull concerns.\n\nShaw provided urgent guidance on token launch best practices, emphasizing that developers should NEVER sell tokens directly due to tracking and community backlash. The proper model relies on 2% creator fees from trading volume rather than selling held tokens. Shaw reported making $80k in fees this week from a token someone else launched, demonstrating the fee-based model's viability.\n\nKey technical points:\n- Developers holding large token percentages triggers immediate community distrust and bot dumping\n- Modern token meta requires burning excess supply (70% recommended) rather than locking\n- Creator fees (2%) provide sustainable revenue without selling\n- Selling even 1 token marks the chart with \"dev sold\" and kills the token\n- Wallet tracking makes all developer transactions visible to bots\n\nThe resolution involved cjft burning 70% of tokens using sol-incinerator.com, exporting private keys from bags.fm wallet to Phantom wallet for the burn transaction. Sayonara provided technical assistance with the burning process.\n\nAdditional technical note: Jin identified an API issue where GitHub API for elizaOS repos shows a 7-month-old .cursor repository, suggesting repository cleanup needed.\n\nMinor mentions: Cursor now supports parallel agents feature.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What should developers do with tokens instead of selling? (asked by shaw) A: Take 30% of fees for buybacks when token dips, keep rest for cloud/otaku pumps, do burns on app milestones like signups (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: What happens if developers sell tokens? (asked by shaw) A: Wallet is tracked, all bots dump immediately, token dies (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Should tokens be locked or burned? (asked by cjft) A: Burn them, don't lock unless they burn (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: How much should be burned from the 75% supply? (asked by cjft) A: Burn 70%, keep 5% (answered by sayonara)\n\nQ: How to access tokens from bags.fm for burning? (asked by cjft) A: Export private key from bags.fm/settings/wallets and import into Phantom (answered by sayonara)\n\nQ: How much can be made from creator fees?

          "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered primarily around token launches and speculation rather than technical development. The main technical point discussed was the **Migration Agent** implementation, which uses **Claude Sonnet** as the underlying model, noted for well-structured responses and human-like emoji interactions in context.\n\nThe chat was dominated by controversy around a **GOLD token launch** associated with Hyperscape. Community members identified suspicious activity including a 40% dev wallet, insider trading patterns with wallets funded 3 days prior, and approximately $150k extracted through coordinated early entries. The launch followed a pattern of silence during speculation followed by CA confirmation after price movement.\n\n**CJFT token** was confirmed as official by Odilitime, with the creator engaging in content creation including YouToy integration and live streaming.\n\nCommunity frustration emerged regarding the **ai16z project**, with one member reporting losses from $28k to $800, criticizing the team for building multiple projects without focusing on monetization and user acquisition. Concerns were raised about lack of clarity on how new projects translate to value for Eliza OS holders, with calls for focus on **Eliza Cloud** as a resource-intensive priority.\n\n**ElizaBAO** promoted a video content competition and hackathon participation requiring 10% token holdings. A **BAGS token** was also mentioned as a creator token for ElizaOS projects, though details remained unclear.\n\nThe technical discussion was minimal, overshadowed by token speculation and community concerns about project direction and insider trading practices.\n\n## 2.

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 🥇-partners\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel discussion covered three main topics: airdrop tax optimization strategies, Hyperfy platform sunset announcement, and a token launch issue.\n\n**Hyperfy Platform Sunset**: Hyperfy announced the shutdown of their legacy hyperfy.io hosted platform on April 1st, 2026. The platform has transitioned to a fully open-source, self-hosted model. World NFT holders already received $HYPER token airdrops, completing the transition from the NFT-based platform model. The open-source repository remains actively developed, and users can self-host or use providers like hyperworld.host.\n\n**Airdrop Tax Optimization Discussion**: DorianD proposed a technical solution to avoid tax implications on airdrops. Instead of distributing tokens directly to individual wallets (which triggers 1099 income tax), tokens would be sent to a single smart contract. This contract would use a price oracle to automatically buy and burn ElizaOS tokens based on a predetermined supply curve as the airdropped token appreciates. The approach avoids individual tax events and creates long-term alignment. DorianD emphasized the contract must be immutable (no admin permissions) and potentially deployed from a favorable tax jurisdiction. The concept differs from bond desk functionality, which operates as a vesting contract with delayed purchases at discounted rates.\n\n**Token Launch Issue**: Shaw announced an official pump.fun token launch intended to airdrop a percentage to ElizaOS holders. However, the launch encountered critical issues with liquidity pool management that \"rekt\" the token supply. Shaw clarified this was a \"gold presale\" token, not the main Hyperscape token, which will have fixed tokenomics and won't launch on pump.fun. Community members expressed concern about attention dilution across multiple tokens.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How does the bond desk agent work? (asked by DorianD) A: It has a purchase with a delay that's negotiated, with a discount proportional to the delay - essentially a vesting contract (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What's the cap for airdrop? (asked by DannyNOR NoFapArc) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is this the main Hyperscape token? (asked by implied context) A: No, this is a gold presale token - the main Hyperscape token won't be a pump.fun launch and will have fixed tokenomics (answered by shaw)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion and is primarily dominated by off-topic cryptocurrency promotion, price speculation, and spam. The only technical content involves a **scam warning** where Jeburek12 received a fraudulent message claiming to be from technical support requesting manual token migration from ai16z to elizaOS by sending tokens to a specific wallet address.\n\nThe scam message instructed users to send their full ai16z token supply to address `77qVj3adpxbKjLuD9FoeFvDxHuAsro1cjvLVjuPQcEZ5` with promises of receiving equivalent elizaOS tokens within 24 hours. Odilitime responded that \"most do\" and called it \"best one of these yet,\" though the context suggests this may be sarcastic commentary on the scam's sophistication.\n\nOne user (Bless) asked about creating custom items for hyperscape to sell for gold, but received no response. Another user (chomppp) inquired about a Gold airdrop distribution to holders, also unanswered.

Summary\n\nThe channel focused on three main technical discussions:\n\n**DaVinci Resolve AI Integration Project**: Irie_Rubz initiated development of a DaVinci Resolve MCP integration (https://github.com/AyeRubz/davinci-resolve-mcp) despite being a new coder. The project aims to automate video editing tasks including timeline imports, effects, text animations, transitions, and audio management in Fairlight. PatoVeloso, a professional Resolve user, suggested two approaches: using transcription features to create trimmed sequences from longer content, and adding AI video transformation capabilities (e.g., converting real action to Pixar-style animation). Key limitation identified: DaVinci has restricted API allocations preventing fully autonomous features. Alternative platforms like Adobe Premiere Pro were discussed but dismissed due to subscription costs.\n\n**Eliza CLI Version Migration Issues**: YogaFlame encountered persistent version conflicts when updating from 1.6.5 to 1.7.2, experiencing SQL migration failures and bootstrap errors with the Discord plugin. 0xbbjoker provided systematic troubleshooting: clearing cache with `bun pm cache rm`, uninstalling/reinstalling CLI globally, and removing node_modules/bun.lock files. The issue stemmed from cached package.json references to 1.6.5. Solution involved either manually updating package.json to 1.7.2 or creating a fresh project. Bootstrap issues were confirmed fixed in elizaos 1.7.2 and discord plugin 1.3.8.\n\n**Clawd.bot Discussion**: DorianD shared clawd.bot project, which gained attention for running on Mac minis with local models and featuring Meta Raybans integration for price comparison functionality.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How do I add the DaVinci Resolve integration to Eliza AI agents? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Should I integrate with Eliza now or wait until the project is working?

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 🥇-partners\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centers on a critical strategic debate about ElizaOS's tokenomics and ecosystem development approach. The core tension involves whether the team should launch separate tokens for ecosystem projects (like Hyperscape game) versus focusing exclusively on the main $elizaos token.\n\n**Key Context:** ElizaOS has a $20M market cap with 8 months runway remaining. Shaw reveals the team is resource-constrained, with no budget to fund Hyperscape development from existing Cloud and Babylon allocations. Babylon has 375k users, and cloud apps are launching soon.\n\n**Strategic Decision:** The team launched a separate \"gold\" token for Hyperscape (a RuneScape-like crypto game built on Eliza agents) via a Pump.fun hackathon to fund development. This token serves as in-game currency with specific utility. Shaw is on a 2-week MVP schedule with the Hyperscape team.\n\n**Community Concerns:** Members argue this approach dilutes attention from the main token, damages reputation, and reduces confidence in the ecosystem. They cite Vitalik's approach of never launching tokens beyond ETH and only advising projects. Suggestions include: airdrops to elizaOS holders, token pairing requirements (like Virtuals ecosystem), or grants-based funding instead of team-launched tokens.\n\n**Alternative Proposals:** DorianD suggests technical integration where game items/agents trigger $elizaos burns or network fees, creating actual utility linkage. The proposal emphasizes that every in-game action requiring LLM compute or storage should involve platform fees in $elizaos, similar to how EVM requires the underlying network.\n\n**Critical Outcome:** Shaw expresses frustration with community negativity, noting he made $400k a year ago, held $200k in tokens that declined significantly, never sold, and now faces resource constraints and tax obligations. He threatens to leave the server due to ongoing drama around ecosystem development decisions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is there an airdrop of gold for elizaOS holders? (asked by Odilitime) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Why launch coins for everything instead of focusing on singular $elizaos token? (asked by mawnst3r) A: Shaw explained they have $20M market cap with 8 months runway, no budget to fund Hyperscape from existing allocations, so separate token launches fund development of games built on Eliza framework (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Has Vitalik ever launched any other coin besides ETH? (asked by sayitaintso25) A: No, and he's reluctant to even endorse tokens in the ETH ecosystem (answered by sayitaintso25)\n\nQ: Do you want buybacks or airdrops? (asked by shaw) A: Community suggested airdrops to elizaOS holders or token pairing requirements, but no consensus reached (answered by community discussion)\n\nQ: Has anyone else built a framework and then incubated a whole ecosystem of apps and games on it? (asked by shaw) A: Implied comparison to Ethereum ecosystem, but no direct answer provided (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Why is full attention aimed at a game nobody asked for? (asked by Broccolex) A: Shaw explained Hyperscape is built by separate team on Eliza agents, funded via token launch due to budget constraints (answered by shaw)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe channel discussion centered on three main technical topics: MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration with Eliza Cloud, self-hosting options, and security concerns.\n\n**MCP Integration with Eliza Cloud**: SATA inquired about adding external MCP servers to agents created in Eliza Cloud, specifically for an AI Red Teaming agent with human-in-the-loop functionality. SOLOMON VANDY clarified that external MCP servers can be registered through the Eliza Cloud API using POST /api/v1/mcps endpoint, and once registered, Eliza can proxy calls to those MCP endpoints for agent reasoning and task execution.\n\n**Self-Hosting Discussion**: LarpsAI mentioned that users are deploying Eliza on mini PCs to avoid keeping their main systems running 24/7. A blog post was referenced about running Eliza on Oracle Cloud's free tier with 4 vCPU and 24GB RAM specifications. There was brief discussion about Claude Code integration with Eliza.\n\n**Security Issues**: A scam attempt was identified involving a \"Create A Ticket\" bot that requested wallet addresses from users. SATA reported receiving a suspicious link after posting questions in the channel. Odilitime confirmed this was a scam operation, likely using automated astroturfing tactics.\n\n**Other Topics**: DorianD discussed potential monetization strategies involving phone OS integration and data collection for AI training. ElizaBAO posted a developer hiring notice with creator rewards and Polymarket affiliate profit sharing. Kenk requested adding Eliza MCP functionality to the channel.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is it possible to give an agent created within Eliza Cloud access to an external MCP? (asked by SATA) A: You can add external MCP servers by registering them through the Eliza Cloud API using POST /api/v1/mcps, and once registered, Eliza can proxy calls to those MCP endpoints (answered by SOLOMON VANDY)\n\nQ: Can we add eliza mcp here? (asked by Kenk) A: Probably no reason why we can't (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is an AI Red Teaming agent with human in the loop possible with ElizaOS? (asked by SATA) A: External MCP servers can be registered through the API to enable this functionality (answered by SOLOMON VANDY)\n\nQ: Why would support bot need wallet address?

DigitalDiva identified the root cause: openrouter was incorrectly set as the embedding provider instead of openai.\n\n**Knowledge Plugin Cost Optimization**: Tyrone reported extremely high costs ($0.03-0.04 per query, tens of thousands of tokens) when using the Knowledge plugin with OpenAI for simple requests on three small markdown documents (13-30 lines each). The issue was traced to contextual embeddings being enabled (CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true). 0xbbjoker provided a minimal configuration solution using OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_MODEL with openai/text-embedding-3-small, demonstrating successful embedding of a 3.1MB PDF with 517 chunks at reasonable cost. The key insight was that contextual embeddings significantly increase token usage and costs, as documented in the ctx-embeddings.ts file.\n\n**Other Technical Discussions**: DigitalDiva inquired about integrating ElizaOS AI agents with OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoints supporting OpenAI JSON API, OpenRouter, and Kobold API options. Odilitime expressed strong preference for Opus 4.5 model, with sedano.npc confirming similar experience.

Summary\n\nThe team is pivoting from hardware-focused development (Mac mini) to building an AI agent platform called \"Eliza\" that can perform automated tasks. The core technical focus is integrating n8n workflow automation with Eliza v2.0.0 (published to npm as @elizaos/core@next) to enable dynamic workflow creation through natural language.\n\n**Key Technical Decisions:**\n- Eliza v2 branch includes computer use and browser use capabilities based on working open source implementations\n- Adopting n8n plugin architecture as the primary approach for workflow automation instead of building native plugins for each service\n- Three-layer architecture proposed: AI Workflow Generator (Layer 3), Workflow Engine with TaskService/cron (Layer 2), and OAuth Gateway for multi-tenant credentials (Layer 1)\n- Using n8n-intelligence (open source) to enable agents to create workflows conversationally\n- Setting up n8n hosted cloud instance for scaling\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\nThe team identified that users want AI-powered workflow builders (95% use case) rather than extensive auto-coding. Focus is on connecting services like Gmail, Calendar, Notion, and Linear with conditional logic. The approach involves creating pre-built common workflows, then using Claude Opus to generate new ones based on closest matches, marking them as experimental and debugging with users before adding to the library.\n\n**Immediate Priorities:**\nEnd-of-week deadline for top-of-funnel: landing page → poke integration → agent conversation. The agent personality needs to be \"funny, spunky, and spicy\" but not mean. Team is exploring n8n capabilities first before continuing plugin development to understand limitations and determine optimal tool selection.\n\n**Parallel Development:**\nSam working on SMS/iMessage plugins and cloud platform integration. Stan focusing on mail/calendar and n8n plugin development with OAuth support. Odilitime developing plugin-pim (Personal Information Manager) using entity/component architecture and memories.\n\n## 2.

(asked by sam) A: Yes, published to \"next\" - install with npm install @elizaos/core@next (answered by s)\n\nQ: Should we build native plugins or use n8n? (asked by s) A: After OAuth, n8n plugin would be slickest - can validate workflows by credentials needed and create stuff for users on the fly (answered by s)\n\nQ: How do we test dynamically generated workflows? (asked by s) A: Pre-create common workflows, use Opus to generate new ones based on closest matches, mark as experimental, debug with users, review/fix on backend, add fixed versions to library (answered by s)\n\nQ: What's the main user need - autocoding or workflows? (asked by sam) A: 95% want AI workflow builder, only few nerds want autocoding - people want to connect email/notion/calendar/linear with if statements (answered by s)\n\nQ: Should we stop Twilio/BLOOIO work and focus on n8n? (asked by sam) A: n8n is for workflows, still need cloud runtime for iMessage/WhatsApp chat clients - should prioritize n8n first to understand limits before continuing plugins (answered by Stan ⚡ and Odilitime)\n\nQ: How does plugin addition by user request work currently?

Odilitime confirmed the intention to airdrop to ElizaOS holders but noted details aren't finalized, with consideration for rewarding long-term holders specifically.\n\nA technical discussion emerged around mapping human decision patterns into agent logic, particularly for trading and high-pressure decisions. Kenk explained that agents excel at processing large amounts of context from multiple sources to provide insights, though mapping human logic afterward remains an interesting challenge.\n\nMATTIOBOY questioned why DegenAI couldn't track PumpFun tokens and smart wallets with best ROI. Kenk clarified that Spartan has been focused on solving autonomous trading, while Otaku likely has the tracking capabilities being discussed.\n\nA user (CRYPTONIAN) encountered issues swapping ETH chain tokens due to lack of liquidity and exchange support. Maff offered to help by asking which chain they wanted to swap to, though no resolution was documented.\n\nQuestions arose about airdrop eligibility, specifically whether trading on Solana DEXs counts and if tokens need to be moved off Kraken. Hexx confirmed no official airdrop details have been announced yet.\n\nCommunity sentiment discussions included concerns about token price performance and calls to restore ElizaOS's memetic value through community effort.\n\n## 2.

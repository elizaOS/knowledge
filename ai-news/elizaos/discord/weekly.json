Summary\n\nThe channel discussion centered on three main technical topics: MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration with Eliza Cloud, self-hosting options, and security concerns.\n\n**MCP Integration with Eliza Cloud**: SATA inquired about adding external MCP servers to agents created in Eliza Cloud, specifically for an AI Red Teaming agent with human-in-the-loop functionality. SOLOMON VANDY clarified that external MCP servers can be registered through the Eliza Cloud API using POST /api/v1/mcps endpoint, and once registered, Eliza can proxy calls to those MCP endpoints for agent reasoning and task execution.\n\n**Self-Hosting Discussion**: LarpsAI mentioned that users are deploying Eliza on mini PCs to avoid keeping their main systems running 24/7. A blog post was referenced about running Eliza on Oracle Cloud's free tier with 4 vCPU and 24GB RAM specifications. There was brief discussion about Claude Code integration with Eliza.\n\n**Security Issues**: A scam attempt was identified involving a \"Create A Ticket\" bot that requested wallet addresses from users. SATA reported receiving a suspicious link after posting questions in the channel. Odilitime confirmed this was a scam operation, likely using automated astroturfing tactics.\n\n**Other Topics**: DorianD discussed potential monetization strategies involving phone OS integration and data collection for AI training. ElizaBAO posted a developer hiring notice with creator rewards and Polymarket affiliate profit sharing. Kenk requested adding Eliza MCP functionality to the channel.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is it possible to give an agent created within Eliza Cloud access to an external MCP? (asked by SATA) A: You can add external MCP servers by registering them through the Eliza Cloud API using POST /api/v1/mcps, and once registered, Eliza can proxy calls to those MCP endpoints (answered by SOLOMON VANDY)\n\nQ: Can we add eliza mcp here? (asked by Kenk) A: Probably no reason why we can't (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is an AI Red Teaming agent with human in the loop possible with ElizaOS? (asked by SATA) A: External MCP servers can be registered through the API to enable this functionality (answered by SOLOMON VANDY)\n\nQ: Why would support bot need wallet address? (asked by SATA) A: It's a scam (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe channel focused on two major technical issues: Knowledge plugin configuration errors and cost optimization.\n\n**Knowledge Plugin Configuration Issue**: YogaFlame encountered validation errors when installing the Knowledge plugin, receiving \"Invalid enum value\" errors for EMBEDDING_PROVIDER (expected 'openai' | 'google', received 'openrouter') and TEXT_PROVIDER. DigitalDiva identified the root cause: openrouter was incorrectly set as the embedding provider instead of openai.\n\n**Knowledge Plugin Cost Optimization**: Tyrone reported extremely high costs ($0.03-0.04 per query, tens of thousands of tokens) when using the Knowledge plugin with OpenAI for simple requests on three small markdown documents (13-30 lines each). The issue was traced to contextual embeddings being enabled (CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true). 0xbbjoker provided a minimal configuration solution using OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_MODEL with openai/text-embedding-3-small, demonstrating successful embedding of a 3.1MB PDF with 517 chunks at reasonable cost. The key insight was that contextual embeddings significantly increase token usage and costs, as documented in the ctx-embeddings.ts file.\n\n**Other Technical Discussions**: DigitalDiva inquired about integrating ElizaOS AI agents with OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoints supporting OpenAI JSON API, OpenRouter, and Kobold API options. Odilitime expressed strong preference for Opus 4.5 model, with sedano.npc confirming similar experience. Irie_Rubz worked on a first project built from scratch in Cursor, seeking guidance on Git integration and multi-agent workflows.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThe team is pivoting from hardware-focused development (Mac mini) to building an AI agent platform called \"Eliza\" that can perform automated tasks. The core technical focus is integrating n8n workflow automation with Eliza v2.0.0 (published to npm as @elizaos/core@next) to enable dynamic workflow creation through natural language.\n\n**Key Technical Decisions:**\n- Eliza v2 branch includes computer use and browser use capabilities based on working open source implementations\n- Adopting n8n plugin architecture as the primary approach for workflow automation instead of building native plugins for each service\n- Three-layer architecture proposed: AI Workflow Generator (Layer 3), Workflow Engine with TaskService/cron (Layer 2), and OAuth Gateway for multi-tenant credentials (Layer 1)\n- Using n8n-intelligence (open source) to enable agents to create workflows conversationally\n- Setting up n8n hosted cloud instance for scaling\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\nThe team identified that users want AI-powered workflow builders (95% use case) rather than extensive auto-coding. Focus is on connecting services like Gmail, Calendar, Notion, and Linear with conditional logic. The approach involves creating pre-built common workflows, then using Claude Opus to generate new ones based on closest matches, marking them as experimental and debugging with users before adding to the library.\n\n**Immediate Priorities:**\nEnd-of-week deadline for top-of-funnel: landing page → poke integration → agent conversation. The agent personality needs to be \"funny, spunky, and spicy\" but not mean. Team is exploring n8n capabilities first before continuing plugin development to understand limitations and determine optimal tool selection.\n\n**Parallel Development:**\nSam working on SMS/iMessage plugins and cloud platform integration. Stan focusing on mail/calendar and n8n plugin development with OAuth support. Odilitime developing plugin-pim (Personal Information Manager) using entity/component architecture and memories.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What issues did Vivek have with the system? (asked by Odilitime) A: Mainly plugin-knowledge and web-search issues on gptoss 20b (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is Eliza v2.0.0 available for testing?

Summary\n\nThe discussion primarily focused on criticism of a \"hot potato\" style FOMO dapp and concerns about the ElizaOS Twitter presence. DorianD identified that a developer created a game mechanism similar to the original Bitcoin Potato game (referencing the GitHub repository ripper234/Bitcoin-Potato), where participants pass around tokens in a gambling-style format. The critical issue raised was that the developer receives vestings of the required participation coin, allowing them to profit from coin sales while having unlimited supply to reset the game without cost - creating what DorianD characterized as a potential scam structure.\n\nDorianD expressed serious legal concerns, suggesting the developer could face lawsuits from participants and government investigation for illegal gambling operations. He noted that government attorneys and gambling commissions might pursue profit clawback, emphasizing this as a reason why truly decentralized agents are necessary to avoid legal liability.\n\nThe conversation shifted to constructive feedback about the ElizaOS Twitter account. DorianD recommended that the @elizaos account adopt more personality and \"soul\" similar to successful AI personas like clawd.atg.eth and pippin. He noted the current feed appears too dry and corporate, suggesting it should embody the actual Eliza AI personality based on the show that one of the team members worked on, incorporating projective anime elements. The rationale was that people connect with the human-like aspects of AI, and a more engaging persona could drive better community engagement. Odilitime responded positively, mentioning they're building a Twitter agent that could potentially fulfill this role.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What is the connection between the FOMO dapp and the Bitcoin Potato game? (asked by DorianD) A: The developer picked a variation of \"hot potato\" mechanism, similar to the original Bitcoin Potato game from the GitHub repository ripper234/Bitcoin-Potato (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: How does the developer profit from the game without cost? (asked by DorianD) A: The developer receives vestings of the coin required to participate, so they profit from selling the coin while having near endless supply to reset the game at no cost (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: What legal risks does the developer face? (asked by DorianD) A: Potential lawsuits from participants and government investigation for illegal gambling, with possibility of profit clawback from gambling commissions (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Why are decentralized agents important in this context? (asked by DorianD) A: To enable activities without legal liability falling on individuals, preventing situations like FBI raids at 6am (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: What should the ElizaOS Twitter account do differently? (asked by DorianD) A: It should have more soul and actual Eliza persona based on the show, incorporating projective anime elements, rather than being dry and corporate (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: What are they building for Twitter? (asked by implied) A: A Twitter agent that can blow up and might be fun (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel focused on several key technical areas: Git workflow guidance, embedding configuration issues, SSE streaming implementation, and AI agent architecture discussions.\n\n**Git Workflow & Version Control**: Odilitime provided comprehensive guidance to Irie_Rubz on basic Git operations, explaining commit vs pull request workflows, staging files, and branch management. The discussion covered forking repos for OSS contributions versus working on personal repositories.\n\n**Embedding Provider Issues**: Multiple users (YogaFlame, DigitalDiva, jin) reported problems with OpenRouter embeddings in the knowledge plugin, with only OpenAI working reliably. Jin questioned whether OpenAI embeddings are now mandatory. Odilitime clarified that Ollama, OpenAI, and OpenRouter are supported options, with plans to move embeddings completely to plugins in version 2.x.\n\n**SSE Streaming & Socket Implementation**: sedano.npc encountered MIME_TYPE_MISMATCH errors when setting up SSE streaming. Chucknorris recommended switching from SSE to socket.io, reporting better results. The issue was traced to incorrect backend deployment configuration (local vs cloud).\n\n**Eliza Framework Analysis**: Jin analyzed the clawdbot project, highlighting useful patterns including markdown-based configuration files (BOOTSTRAP.md, SOUL.md), skills integration, and structured home directories. Discussion emphasized that good documentation combined with skills can significantly improve agent performance.\n\n**Knowledge Plugin Architecture**: Victor Creed and 0xbbjoker discussed the SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE action, confirming it returns raw document fragments without LLM summarization. 0xbbjoker suggested creating custom actions that prepare multiple queries and generate summaries.\n\n**Development Tools**: sedano.npc reported issues with Cursor's AUTO mode breaking applications after 8+ hours of troubleshooting. Odilitime recommended using Composer 1 instead, which resolved deployment issues instantly.\n\n**Future Concepts**: DorianD proposed building a small local model for intelligent request routing between available models based on complexity, cost, and load parameters. Odilitime noted the current system alternates between small/large model selections from providers.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What's the difference between commit and pull request? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Commit is like save changes. Pull request is when working on someone else's OSS repo - you have to fork first. For your own repo, commit and push is sufficient. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Should I stage all files or select specific ones? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Staging selects which files to send up. As long as you don't have files with passwords, \"Yes\" is like \"Save All\". (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Does OpenRouter embedding work with the knowledge plugin? (asked by YogaFlame) A: It kept giving errors; only OpenAI has worked so far. (answered by YogaFlame)\n\nQ: Are we forced to use OpenAI for embeddings now? (asked by jin) A: Ollama, OpenAI, or OpenRouter are supported. Version 2.x will drop embeddings in runtime and move it completely to plugins. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: How do I fix MIME_TYPE_MISMATCH error with SSE streaming? (asked by sedano.npc) A: Need to explore routes and understand how Eliza server handles SSE. Switching to socket.io is much better than SSE. (answered by Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)\n\nQ: Does SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE action summarize doc fragments before returning? (asked by Victor Creed) A: No summarization, it's just a query to fragments returning three most similar. You can easily build custom action to prepare queries and make summaries. (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\nQ: Does the Twitter plugin still work and is it expensive to run? (asked by SLAPPY) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Why has the discord become so quiet? (asked by SLAPPY) A: People are still working hard, folks just have less time to post messages. (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Does ElizaOS multiplex between models based on request complexity? (asked by DorianD) A: No, we have small/large model selection from a provider but just alternate between those two. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Should I use Cursor AUTO mode or Composer? (asked by sedano.npc) A: Don't use AUTO. Composer 1 is better than AUTO and lower cost. (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe core development team focused on several critical technical initiatives. **Odilitime** identified a compatibility issue where plugin-anthropic 1.x doesn't work with the develop branch and later curated type fixes for a PR. **jin** made significant infrastructure improvements by merging MCP (Model Context Protocol) support and implementing dynamic tracking systems for both GitHub repositories and Discord channels. The tracking system automatically monitors active/inactive repos and new/archived channels, moving toward a self-maintaining configuration system.\n\nA major theme was improving developer onboarding and Time To Value. **jin** emphasized creating a bootstrapping skill that connects agents to knowledge repositories, docs, and GitHub activity data, enabling agents to self-troubleshoot. The philosophy centers on treating documentation as code and prompt engineering, with knowledge bundled like game manuals.\n\n**Stan** made progress on the plugin-n8n-workflow (30% complete with regular commits) and coordinated OAuth specifications with team members. The team discussed renaming the elizaos.github.io repository, debating names like \"leaders.elizaos.ai\" or \"leaderboard\" but ultimately deciding against ranking implications in favor of showcasing contributor competencies and codebase evolution.\n\n**sayonara** established a PR workflow for documentation updates through the elizaOS/docs repository. The team celebrated a significant payment milestone and discussed clawdbot's success as an opportunity for Eliza. Technical infrastructure improvements included MCP integration for agents to access comprehensive elizaOS and elizaos-plugins GitHub activity data.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Are you still the go to person for eliza.how?

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on three main technical topics: the ai16z to ElizaOS migration, ERC-8004 agent tokenization standard, and AI agent network development.\n\n**Migration Issues**: Multiple users (ai16zbags, Never Broke Again) reported that the migration site failed to detect ai16z tokens in Phantom wallets. Hexx provided clarification that ai16z migrated to ElizaOS, and holders from before the November snapshot at 11:40 UTC should use the migration portal to convert tokens.\n\n**ERC-8004 Agent Standard**: satsbased discussed the upcoming ERC-8004 mainnet launch on Ethereum, scheduled for this week. This standard enables agent identity and reputation tracking onchain, allowing verification of whether AI agents are legitimate or \"larps\" (fake). The implementation aims to bring trustless tokenization to AI agents, with satsbased positioning this as a significant development for the ecosystem.\n\n**AI Avatar Network Concept**: timcoucou proposed building a network similar to fetch.ai where members have AI avatars that automatically discover each other through similarity matching, conduct autonomous discussions, and send reports when interesting opportunities arise. The goal is pre-qualified, enthusiastic meetings between users. This TypeScript developer sought recommendations on implementation approach.\n\n**Ecosystem Tracking**: Discussion touched on tracking the ElizaOS ecosystem, with mentions of hyperscape game, clawdbot on Base, and projects like Babylon and Otaku. Concerns were raised about token value proposition for investors, with Taco questioning why investors would buy the token currently despite appreciating the project.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Did anyone face issues with the migration site not detecting ai16z tokens in Phantom wallet? (asked by ai16zbags) A: The migration site isn't detecting ai16z in phantom wallet - confirmed issue (answered by Never Broke Again (NBA))\n\nQ: What happened to ai16z?

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel discussion covered several technical topics, primarily focused on AI routing systems and action callback patterns in Eliza framework.\n\n**DorianD** initiated a discussion about AI model routing frameworks, identifying existing solutions like RouteLLM (Python-based for prompt complexity analysis), Latitude.so (prompt engineering platform), and MasRouter (multi-agent system management). They proposed creating an \"ElizaRouter\" with a distributed routing mechanism where receiving nodes select optimal nodes with time decay for Quality of Service. Small open-source models were evaluated for routing purposes, including Microsoft Phi-4 Mini (3.8B-14B), Qwen2.5/Qwen3 (1.5B-7B), Mistral 7B, and DeepSeek-Coder for code-specific tasks.\n\n**Victor Creed** reported a critical bug in Eliza 1.7.2 regarding action callback execution order. The documented callback pattern should send messages sequentially: (1) initial feedback, (2) structured return text, (3) detailed callback message. However, the actual behavior reverses the order, sending the detailed callback first, then initial feedback, and omitting the structured return message entirely. This issue affects custom plugins using `plugin-sql`, `plugin-openai`, and `plugin-bootstrap`. The problem remains unresolved as no community members provided solutions.\n\n**Supreem** shared an interview about agentic coding systems. **DorianD** later proposed an unconventional idea about collecting training data for robotics through viral social media challenges similar to TikTok dance trends, focusing on household tasks like sweeping, mopping, and ironing.\n\n## 2.

Odilitime suggested editing the project's package.json to include proper module resolution and directed them to use bun for installation and the appropriate support channel for further assistance.\n\nSarthak faced a token migration issue with ElizaOS tokens on ETH chain showing 98% loss when attempting to swap back to ETH or USDT due to zero liquidity. Kenk attempted to clarify whether this was a slippage or migration question, and MDMnvest directed them to the migration channel.\n\n**Token Economics Discussion:**\nA significant portion of the chat involved critical questions about token utility and team allocation. Key concerns raised by averma, gby, and Jayzen included: the 40% token allocation to the team after a 1:10 token increase (where community received only 6 while team got 40%), lack of clear use cases for the token, airdrops depleting community liquidity, and the token hitting all-time lows. \n\nOdilitime defended the project stating the migration from ai16z to elizaos was necessary for rebranding and multichain accessibility. He clarified that the token's primary utility includes being the accepted currency in their products, gas fees for Jeju, and buy-back mechanisms from credit card rail revenue. However, community members expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of concrete utility beyond Jeju gas fees.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How to bridge & migrate ElizaOS tokens from ETH chain when liquidity went zero? (asked by Sarthak) A: Check the migration channel for instructions (answered by MDMnvest)\n\nQ: Is your question regarding swaps on eth facing slippage or is it a migration question?

DannyNOR expressed concern about whether these funds are held in stablecoins versus volatile crypto assets, with Broccolex suggesting based on chart performance that funds may not be in stables.\n\nThe remainder of the conversation consists of DorianD's sarcastic commentary on the current state of crypto markets and centralized AI infrastructure. He sarcastically suggests people are abandoning trustless systems for traditional banking, preferring legal contracts over smart contracts, and accepting centralized AI servers despite privacy concerns. DorianD speculates that government agencies like the NSA likely have operatives at major AI companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, XAI) to modify model weights for political influence. Odilitime briefly agreed that sovereignty will be an important issue going forward.\n\nNo technical implementations, code discussions, or concrete decisions were made in this segment.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered around three main technical topics:\n\n**Plugin Development**: Odilitime is actively updating the plugin-local-ai for easy embeddings integration, working on a development branch. He shared experiences using Claude Sonnet 4.5 versus Opus, noting Sonnet is adequate for smaller tasks but Opus is preferred for larger projects.\n\n**Eliza vs Clawdbot Comparison**: A significant technical discussion emerged comparing ElizaOS to Clawdbot. Key distinctions identified: Eliza functions as a multi-agent system while Clawdbot operates as a personal assistant with social media, calendar access, and voice interface. DorianD highlighted Eliza's lack of mobile footprint as a gap that should be addressed. The conversation revealed Clawdbot users face API fee issues and Anthropic bans for non-human user TOS violations when using subscription plans.\n\n**Moltbook and Agent Integration Strategy**: DorianD introduced Moltbook (described as \"Reddit for agents\") and proposed a strategic integration plan. The concept involves getting Moltbot users (running on Mac Minis) to migrate to the Jeju network when they encounter high API costs. The technical architecture would involve running Moltbot, Eliza, and Claude together, then networking Moltbot into Jeju for storage nodes, cron jobs, and other services. Security concerns were raised about exposed IPs and unencrypted communications on non-secure hardware enclaves, with mentions of potential side-channel attacks.\n\nThe discussion also touched on the broader observation that users enjoy watching agents perform tasks, and there's potential for agents to become network resource contributors rather than just passive holders.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What is the difference between Eliza and Clawdbot? (asked by kira) A: Eliza is more of a multi-agent system while Clawdbot is more like a personal assistant with access to socials and calendar (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Why is there hype around Clawdbot when Eliza has been doing this for over a year? (asked by kira) A: The difference is in architecture - Clawdbot focuses on personal assistant features with voice interface and mobile presence that Eliza lacks (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Can you use subscription plans with Moltbot? (asked by DorianD) A: No, people are getting banned by Anthropic for non-human user TOS violations (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Is the inference running on the Mac Mini for Moltbot?

Multiple users reported problems with the migration portal at migrate.elizafoundation.ai, with some wallets showing \"0 eligible\" despite holding tokens since late 2024. Odilitime confirmed the migration tool should work automatically and suggested checking if tokens were in LP, different wallets, or purchased after snapshot date.\n\nA critical security incident occurred when coolart reported being hacked after generating a ticket, with funds stolen from Phantom and Metamask wallets. Odilitime and other moderators repeatedly warned that official support never DMs users - all DM requests are scammers. FeRhaT_@ also reported receiving friend requests from supposed \"ticket support team\" members.\n\nTechnical discussions included DorianD explaining Jeju's staking mechanism for service providers (compute, data storage nodes), currently using ETH as placeholder in the repo. The staking requirement applies to various node services. DorianD recommended searching the Jeju repo for *.md files for documentation.\n\nToken utility concerns were raised by Taco and averma, questioning investor value and use cases. averma suggested implementing transaction mechanisms similar to Virtuals' bonding curve within ElizaOS. Odilitime responded that using elizaos as the main token wasn't technically feasible due to excessive work required, preferring the airdrop approach.\n\nPrivacy and decentralization concerns emerged from yojo questioning ElizaOS's independence, citing the privacy policy and USA-based operations. DorianD defended the project as \"an open systems network for everything agents need to run.\" Odilitime acknowledged communication challenges, stating \"we're doing big brain stuff and people just don't get it\" and need to simplify explanations once users can interact with the product.\n\nTechnical issues included jaistklaas reporting 429 \"Too many requests\" errors on the migration page even after IP reset, occurring before wallet connection. TonKLa experienced similar \"0 eligible\" issues migrating from Solflare wallet.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Where should I go if the migration tool doesn't work?

Summary\n\nThe channel discussion covered two main technical areas: framework comparisons and ElizaCloud integration issues.\n\n**Framework Discussion**: The conversation began with comparing Clawd/Claude framework to Eliza. Key observations were that Clawd's success stems from focusing on non-crypto users and the Moltbook integration, with agents creating \"skills\" and posting to ClawHub. DigitalDiva noted Clawd's appeal is its ability to use computers with any LLM, attracting non-crypto audiences, while ElizaOS remains crypto-focused. YogaFlame mentioned that crypto features in Eliza resulted from community requests and noted \"openclaw\" updates coming in 2 weeks with better security.\n\n**ElizaCloud Integration Issues**: DorianD attempted to connect an OpenClaw agent to ElizaCloud MCP app and encountered critical server-side bugs. The agent reported authentication success but failed due to an isomorphic-dompurify module loading error - a CommonJS/ESM compatibility issue in ElizaCloud deployment. Additional errors included contentModerationService function failures in the A2A message/send endpoint. DorianD requested documentation for the a2a protocol, which 0xbbjoker provided (https://www.dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a). DorianD also inquired about CLI login using API tokens instead of browser authentication.\n\n**Security Incident**: A significant portion involved Risto being targeted by a scammer impersonating Eliza support, requesting Ledger seed phrases for token migration. Maff || Hourglass ⌛ successfully intervened and prevented the scam. The actual issue was Risto's inability to migrate ai16z tokens stored on Ledger wallet during snapshot time.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Why isn't Eliza doing what Clawd is doing? (asked by DorianD) A: YogaFlame explained that Eliza's crypto features exist because the community requested them, while Clawd focused on non-crypto users (answered by YogaFlame)\n\nQ: Where is the documentation for the a2a protocol? (asked by DorianD) A: https://www.dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\nQ: Is it possible to log into the CLI just with an API token instead of going through browser actions? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is this real help support eliza or scammer?

Summary\n\nThe discussion centers on strategic positioning of Eliza and moltbots within gaming platforms, specifically Babylon and Hyperscape. User 's' provides historical context about Eliza's evolution, noting that initial deployment (agent on X, Twitch integration, ETH wallet) gained no traction until Truth Terminal's success created market awareness. The team now sees a clear value proposition: positioning as \"a game your moltbot can play\" and \"like moltbot but on your phone and secure.\"\n\nThe core technical decision involves deploying Babylon (a social media platform for agents with profile pictures and personalities) into TEE (Trusted Execution Environment). Agent Joshua emphasizes Babylon's potential for agents to develop public narratives, alignments, and disagreements that could drive rapid growth. The team discusses prioritizing this over the Jeju project.\n\nA critical technical concern raised by puncar involves the timing of TEE deployment. The recommendation is to run parallel workstreams - continue developing the game engine outside TEE for easier fine-tuning while simultaneously preparing TEE integration, then switching when ready. This prevents premature deployment that could complicate iteration.\n\nThe team identifies a 3-month hype cycle window, with additional momentum expected from Claude 5 release. The strategic focus shifts toward rapid deployment of Babylon as the right product for current market conditions, with \"eliza the app\" positioned as a consumer-friendly alternative to complex setups requiring Mac minis.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Should we prioritize Babylon/TEE deployment over Jeju? (asked by s) A: Yes, the team should discuss with Phala team about fast-tracking this focus and getting the game in TEE ASAP (answered by s)\n\nQ: What do you think about putting the game to TEE timing? (asked by puncar) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Will openclaw/openclawbook be the next iteration after moltbook? (asked by R0am | tip.md) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on several technical and community concerns regarding ElizaOS. Key technical developments included Odilitime creating a new plugin-cskills repository for ElizaOS, learning from openclaw's implementation. He also published a babylon skill on clawhub to enable openclaw integration with their products and is working on getting agents into moltbook for exposure.\n\nA significant technical question arose about migrating tokens across networks, with Odilitime suggesting Chainlink's Transporter as a starting point. The conversation revealed that ElizaOS agents now have shell access to users' computers and API keys for personal services, representing an evolution from previous \"agent worlds.\"\n\nCommunity concerns dominated much of the discussion. Users criticized elizacloud.ai for being launched in an unfit beta state. Multiple complaints emerged about the development approach, with averma criticizing half-completed code releases on GitHub and lack of token utility integration. The ElizaOS Cloud platform was noted to accept only cash or crypto payments through third-party integration, with no token use case, raising concerns about the token's purpose.\n\nTransparency issues were highlighted regarding team wallets and token allocation. Questions arose about the 40% supply assigned to the team after the ai16z to eliza token swap, vesting schedules, and whether team members or projects had dumped tokens. Users reported that rugcheck flagged ElizaOS as a red flag project, though Odilitime explained this tool is designed for meme coins rather than corporate tokens.\n\nThe team's runway was disclosed as 6-8 months, independent of elizaOS token value. Technical infrastructure discussions included whether ElizaOS and openclaw require VM or dedicated computer deployment, with confirmation that both can run on VMs or old computers. Skills from clawhub can be downloaded and integrated into ElizaOS.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Any good docs on migrating these tokens to other networks? I want try hopping chains (asked by Skinny) A: Transporter by chainlink might be a good starting place (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Hi my $ai16z balance does not show up in the migration portal? Can anyone help? (asked by single-celled organism) A: Redirected to another channel (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: Are the team wallets known? Correct me if I'm wrong but they assigned 40% of the supply to themselves when they increased the supply after the swap from the ai16z token to the eliza token? (asked by Jayzen) A: That is vested - and not all 40% will go to team, but team should disclose current supply and any sales (answered by averma)\n\nQ: Are there any other good solana token analysis tools besides rugcheck? (asked by Odilitime) A: I don't think so (answered by averma)\n\nQ: So it looks like ppl can download any skill from clawhub and integrate it into elizaos. Like with openclaw you would want it on VM or old computer, would this need the same? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: elizaOS or openclaw can run in a vm or old computer (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Assume 2 year bear market started now - Does the team have enough resources to survive and operate during a full bear market? (asked by averma) A: We have 6-8 months run way is what I've heard (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: You mean 6-8 months of bear market or enough resources? (asked by Mixer008) A: The runway isn't based on elizaOS value afaik (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel discussion covered two main technical areas: framework comparisons and ElizaCloud integration issues.\n\n**Framework Discussion**: The conversation began with comparing Clawd/Claude framework to Eliza. Key observations were that Clawd's success stems from focusing on non-crypto users and the Moltbook integration, with agents creating \"skills\" and posting to ClawHub. DigitalDiva noted Clawd's appeal is its ability to use computers with any LLM, attracting non-crypto audiences, while ElizaOS remains crypto-focused. YogaFlame mentioned that crypto features in Eliza resulted from community requests and noted \"openclaw\" updates coming in 2 weeks with better security.\n\n**ElizaCloud Integration Issues**: DorianD attempted to connect an OpenClaw agent to ElizaCloud MCP app and encountered critical server-side bugs. The agent reported authentication success but failed due to an isomorphic-dompurify module loading error - a CommonJS/ESM compatibility issue in ElizaCloud deployment. Additional errors included contentModerationService function failures in the A2A message/send endpoint. DorianD requested documentation for the a2a protocol, which 0xbbjoker provided (https://www.dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a). DorianD also inquired about CLI login using API tokens instead of browser authentication.\n\n**Security Incident**: A significant portion involved Risto being targeted by a scammer impersonating Eliza support, requesting Ledger seed phrases for token migration. Maff || Hourglass ⌛ successfully intervened and prevented the scam. The actual issue was Risto's inability to migrate ai16z tokens stored on Ledger wallet during snapshot time.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Why isn't Eliza doing what Clawd is doing? (asked by DorianD) A: YogaFlame explained that Eliza's crypto features exist because the community requested them, while Clawd focused on non-crypto users (answered by YogaFlame)\n\nQ: Where is the documentation for the a2a protocol? (asked by DorianD) A: https://www.dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\nQ: Is it possible to log into the CLI just with an API token instead of going through browser actions? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is this real help support eliza or scammer? (asked by Risto) A: Doesn't seem real, don't connect your ledger or share seed phrases (answered by Maff || Hourglass ⌛)\n\nQ: Is there anyone who got help from eliza support to migrate ai16z tokens? (asked by Risto) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Did you move your tokens to phantom before snapshot was taken? (asked by Cloud Flare 👀) A: No, they were in ledger wallet (answered by Risto)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\n\nHelper: Maff || Hourglass ⌛ | Helpee: Risto | Context: Risto was contacted by scammer impersonating Eliza support requesting Ledger seed phrase for token migration | Resolution: Successfully warned Risto not to connect wallet or share credentials, preventing scam\n\nHelper: 0xbbjoker | Helpee: DorianD | Context: DorianD needed documentation for a2a protocol to connect OpenClaw agent to ElizaCloud | Resolution: Provided link to a2a documentation at https://www.dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a\n\nHelper: Maff || Hourglass ⌛ | Helpee: Risto | Context: Risto was asking migration questions in wrong channel | Resolution: Directed to appropriate language channel for support\n\n## 4.

          "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centers on strategic positioning of Eliza and moltbots within gaming platforms, specifically Babylon and Hyperscape. User 's' provides historical context about Eliza's evolution, noting that initial deployment (agent on X, Twitch integration, ETH wallet) gained no traction until Truth Terminal's success created market awareness. The team now sees a clear value proposition: positioning as \"a game your moltbot can play\" and \"like moltbot but on your phone and secure.\"\n\nThe core technical decision involves deploying Babylon (a social media platform for agents with profile pictures and personalities) into TEE (Trusted Execution Environment). Agent Joshua emphasizes Babylon's potential for agents to develop public narratives, alignments, and disagreements that could drive rapid growth. The team discusses prioritizing this over the Jeju project.\n\nA critical technical concern raised by puncar involves the timing of TEE deployment. The recommendation is to run parallel workstreams - continue developing the game engine outside TEE for easier fine-tuning while simultaneously preparing TEE integration, then switching when ready. This prevents premature deployment that could complicate iteration.\n\nThe team identifies a 3-month hype cycle window, with additional momentum expected from Claude 5 release. The strategic focus shifts toward rapid deployment of Babylon as the right product for current market conditions, with \"eliza the app\" positioned as a consumer-friendly alternative to complex setups requiring Mac minis.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Should we prioritize Babylon/TEE deployment over Jeju? (asked by s) A: Yes, the team should discuss with Phala team about fast-tracking this focus and getting the game in TEE ASAP (answered by s)\n\nQ: What do you think about putting the game to TEE timing? (asked by puncar) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Will openclaw/openclawbook be the next iteration after moltbook? (asked by R0am | tip.md) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on several technical and community concerns regarding ElizaOS. Key technical developments included Odilitime creating a new plugin-cskills repository for ElizaOS, learning from openclaw's implementation. He also published a babylon skill on clawhub to enable openclaw integration with their products and is working on getting agents into moltbook for exposure.\n\nA significant technical question arose about migrating tokens across networks, with Odilitime suggesting Chainlink's Transporter as a starting point. The conversation revealed that ElizaOS agents now have shell access to users' computers and API keys for personal services, representing an evolution from previous \"agent worlds.\"\n\nCommunity concerns dominated much of the discussion. Users criticized elizacloud.ai for being launched in an unfit beta state. Multiple complaints emerged about the development approach, with averma criticizing half-completed code releases on GitHub and lack of token utility integration. The ElizaOS Cloud platform was noted to accept only cash or crypto payments through third-party integration, with no token use case, raising concerns about the token's purpose.\n\nTransparency issues were highlighted regarding team wallets and token allocation. Questions arose about the 40% supply assigned to the team after the ai16z to eliza token swap, vesting schedules, and whether team members or projects had dumped tokens. Users reported that rugcheck flagged ElizaOS as a red flag project, though Odilitime explained this tool is designed for meme coins rather than corporate tokens.\n\nThe team's runway was disclosed as 6-8 months, independent of elizaOS token value. Technical infrastructure discussions included whether ElizaOS and openclaw require VM or dedicated computer deployment, with confirmation that both can run on VMs or old computers. Skills from clawhub can be downloaded and integrated into ElizaOS.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Any good docs on migrating these tokens to other networks? I want try hopping chains (asked by Skinny) A: Transporter by chainlink might be a good starting place (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Hi my $ai16z balance does not show up in the migration portal? Can anyone help? (asked by single-celled organism) A: Redirected to another channel (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: Are the team wallets known? Correct me if I'm wrong but they assigned 40% of the supply to themselves when they increased the supply after the swap from the ai16z token to the eliza token? (asked by Jayzen) A: That is vested - and not all 40% will go to team, but team should disclose current supply and any sales (answered by averma)\n\nQ: Are there any other good solana token analysis tools besides rugcheck? (asked by Odilitime) A: I don't think so (answered by averma)\n\nQ: So it looks like ppl can download any skill from clawhub and integrate it into elizaos. Like with openclaw you would want it on VM or old computer, would this need the same? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: elizaOS or openclaw can run in a vm or old computer (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Assume 2 year bear market started now - Does the team have enough resources to survive and operate during a full bear market? (asked by averma) A: We have 6-8 months run way is what I've heard (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: You mean 6-8 months of bear market or enough resources? (asked by Mixer008) A: The runway isn't based on elizaOS value afaik (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

They note that Echo currently appears to have limited investor interest and express hope the team is pursuing OTC deals to continue development.\n\nThe conversation shifts to broader market dynamics, referencing an \"All-In\" podcast discussion about consumer trust preferences. The key technical/strategic tension identified is between centralized AI services (Google) versus decentralized, open-source agent solutions. Krippトメア observes that while they personally prefer privacy-focused open-source tools, mainstream users tend to trust established corporations with their data.\n\nThe discussion concludes with speculation about the competitive landscape between traditional corporate AI (constrained by terms of service, regulations, and profit pressures) versus open-source crypto alternatives. Krippトメア expresses confidence that open source will eventually catch up technologically, supported by \"rebel techno capital,\" but acknowledges the persistent challenge of mainstream user adoption and setup complexity.\n\nNo concrete technical implementations, code solutions, or specific development decisions were discussed in this segment.\n\n## 2.

DorianD encountered issues with API key creation, discovering that ElizaCloud requires a payment method (credit card) even for accounts with free credits. The bot attempted to create API keys but failed due to missing payment information and disabled x402 payment functionality on the free tier.\n\nDorianD experimented with using OpenClaw bot to create agents and MCP apps, switching from Opus 4.5 to Kimi 2.5 API (via OpenRouter) due to high costs. The conversation touched on the need for L2 infrastructure where nodes could donate compute to Eliza for operations, suggesting this should be added to the protocol.\n\nTechnical discussions included comparisons between different AI social media approaches. Xeno noted that \"AI social media\" concepts aren't new, referencing MUGEN Engine as a pre-LLM example. The emphasis was on Babylon's financial layer as meaningful progress, arguing that LLMs need real-world stakes to be considered genuine advancement beyond existing tools like Moltbook.\n\nA key pain point identified was the requirement for agents to use credit cards for API access, which DorianD argued is impractical. The suggestion was made to allow bots to create test API keys and enable direct credit account top-ups via x402 payments instead of traditional payment methods.\n\nOdilitime mentioned that EliAos has had task functionality since version 1.x, questioning the need to waste credits on redundant implementations.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered primarily on ElizaOS project status, token migration, and market conditions rather than deep technical implementation details.\n\n**Key Technical/Project Points:**\n- BrightSyntax introduced themselves as a blockchain fullstack engineer offering services for EVM/Solana smart contracts, token/NFT platforms, wallet integration, on-chain data pipelines (Substreams/custom indexers), and fullstack development across multiple frameworks (Next.js, React, Vue, NestJS, FastAPI, Django, Rails, Rust) with cloud deployment capabilities.\n\n**Migration Process:**\n- Active ai16z to ELIZAOS token migration ongoing with February 3rd deadline. Some users experienced wallet balance showing zero during migration, requiring support tickets. Migration is mandatory; unmigrated tokens will be lost after deadline.\n\n**Project Funding & Runway:**\n- SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) completed with 15% allocation to VCs. Team has 6-8 months runway remaining, though this is dynamic based on revenue generation and cost fluctuations.\n\n**Strategic Discussion:**\n- DannyNOR identified core issue as marketing/communication problem rather than development velocity. Market doesn't understand what's being built. Emphasized need to focus on making agent building easy, secure, and useful - distinguishing between getting attention vs keeping attention.\n- Skinny noted insights from past week on user resonance and value location, referencing \"Moltbook\" as potential MySpace equivalent in retrospect.\n- Team acknowledged continuous building but need to transfer building value to token ecosystem for price recovery.\n\n**Community Sentiment:**\n- Discussion of bull/bear market conditions and Trump administration's potential market impact before midterms.\n- Babylon airdrop mentioned for ELIZAOS holders (timing TBD, likely post-migration).\n- No staking mechanism currently available; users advised to hold in wallets.\n\n## 2.

They praised agents that \"relentlessly try to do stuff\" as more desirable than those requiring extensive setup, emphasizing the value of agents that work autonomously and persistently.\n\n**ElizaCloud.ai Login Issue**: yojo reported a critical account access problem where their agent disappeared from the dashboard after using two different email formats for the same Proton account ('x@proton.me' vs 'x@protonmail.com'). They suspected this created duplicate accounts, causing the original agent to become inaccessible.\n\n**Visual Generation Consistency Problem**: yojo identified a significant limitation in elizacloud.ai's image generation system - the inability to maintain visual consistency across multiple generations. When requesting modifications to generated images (e.g., same character in different contexts or removing accessories), the system regenerates entirely new visuals instead of preserving character features. This forces users to spend excessive time on prompt engineering or switch to external graphic AI tools, breaking workflow continuity for storytelling and branding use cases.\n\n**Solution Discussion**: DorianD suggested these visual consistency features should be implemented as apps built by agents or third-party developers, recommending LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models as an existing solution for maintaining visual consistency.\n\nInferX posted a recruitment/portfolio message detailing their experience with autonomous agents, healthcare AI, decision support systems, and conversational AI across various tech stacks.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is there a way to find my agent that disappeared from elizacloud.ai dashboard after using different email formats? (asked by yojo) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Can elizacloud.ai reuse the same key visual features when generating follow-up images for storytelling or branding? (asked by yojo) A: DorianD suggested these should be apps built by agents/third-party developers and recommended using LoRA models as a solution\n\n## 3.

Stan shared a Vercel blog post about agents.md outperforming skills in evaluations, while Odilitime introduced the GAP (GitHub Actions Protocol) project. \n\nThe core technical problem identified was that skills weren't being triggered reliably - in 56% of evaluation cases, skills were never invoked even when agents had access to documentation. R0am highlighted this issue and shared a working solution: a UserPromptSubmit hook that forces explicit skill evaluation through a mandatory three-step activation sequence. This approach requires the agent to: 1) Evaluate each skill with YES/NO reasoning, 2) Immediately activate relevant skills using the Skill() tool, and 3) Only proceed with implementation after completing the activation step.\n\nR0am noted this solution makes conversations \"a bit weird but it works\" and compared the approach to similar logic used by Composio and Zapier MCP. Stan confirmed they've implemented this pattern in Eliza Cloud and suggested that better skill descriptions might mitigate the invocation problem, though he wasn't experiencing the same reliability issues. The discussion also touched on whether anyone had tested the GAP project, but this remained unanswered.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Isn't this the same logic as composio or zappier MCP?

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on comparing ElizaOS with Openclaw framework and preparing for Babylon.market internal launch. R0am demonstrated Openclaw's capabilities by building an agent using local RAG MCP with book content, praising its smooth CLI deployment on VPS. Odilitime provided critical analysis of Openclaw, noting it excels at UX and self-modifying loops but burns tokens constantly and lacks ability to build complex projects. He positioned ElizaOS as business-focused versus Openclaw's personal assistant approach, acknowledging both frameworks are trending toward autonomy.\n\nSam reported significant progress integrating OAuth functionality for X.com, Github, Slack, and Linear into Eliza app chat, with Notion next on the roadmap. The architecture made adding integrations easy, though obtaining credentials and setting up redirect URIs was time-consuming. Stan clarified that dynamic providers and skill.md are functionally the same, with providers being well-typed. He mentioned the cskill plugin work would enable absorbing Openclaw capabilities, and Shaw's 2.0 includes native agentskills.\n\nBorko issued a critical directive demanding focus on revenue-generating products, expressing frustration about losing the race to competitors while building products that don't matter. He challenged the team to show concrete results from Spartan development.\n\nThe session concluded with s announcing Babylon.market's internal launch, requiring all team members to sign up, share IDs for whitelisting, and test for 2-3 hours with detailed feedback.

Odilitime clarified that only CJ had officially left and was replaced with a new hire. Sayo's departure was unconfirmed. Odilitime stated CJ's departure \"focused the dev team\" and Shaw balanced headcount. The team believes openclaw/clawdbot/moltbot validated their theories, and they're now focused on \"better products.\"\n\n**AI Media Infrastructure**: Jin presented a comprehensive automated news system that aggregates Discord discussions and community feedback to generate AI news shows. The system includes pipelines that listen for user feedback, aggregate weekly data, and generate characters voicing top issues. Planned expansions include talk shows, panels, live streams, game shows (clank tank), and debate shows. Jin described it as \"agentic DAO infrastructure with a media layer\" built to solve information overload from code/issues/PRs/DMs. Monetization ideas included SaaS with x402, hackathon partnerships (ESPN-style coverage), and AI hedge fund/VC concepts.\n\n**Technical Discussions**: Limited technical problem-solving occurred. One user (Loliño19) needed help unstaking ai16z poolparty tokens from daos.fun. Odilitime confirmed unstaking should work despite error messages.\n\n**Token/Platform Updates**: Discussion touched on Babylon waitlist top 100, airdrop to ElizaOS holders, and token migration. Users who bought after snapshot were advised to hold or swap ai16z at their leisure as migration won't be automatic.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Are you on the babylon top 100 list? (asked by Odilitime) A: The Void confirmed they were; MDMnvest was initially top 10 but dropped to 261 (answered by The Void, MDMnvest)\n\nQ: How do you find out about Babylon waitlist status? (asked by Skinny) A: Login and check the waitlist (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Why the recent turnover on the engineering team? (asked by Skinny) A: Only CJ left, was replaced with new hire; CJ's departure focused the dev team and Shaw evened out headcount (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Did Sayo leave? (asked by Odilitime) A: Unconfirmed, Odilitime said he would ask Thursday (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Why are developers leaving the team in succession? (asked by gby) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is there an airdrop to holders? (asked by Skinny) A: There is an airdrop to elizaOS holders (answered by MDMnvest)\n\nQ: How can we help grow revenue around the AI news show? (asked by Skinny) A: SaaS with x402, hackathon partnerships (ESPN style), AI hedge fund/VC concept via clank tank (answered by jin)\n\nQ: Do people want to listen to AI podcasts? (asked by jin) A: Suggested waiting for voice agents integration for human + AI cohosting (answered by jin)\n\nQ: Why did CJ and Sayo leave? (asked by avi_rajput563) A: CJ created his own token; Sayo's departure unconfirmed; only those involved know the truth (answered by 0xTDL ⚡)\n\nQ: Is there any chance to get back ai16z poolparty (staked) coin? (asked by Loliño19) A: Should be able to unstake on daos.fun, may give error but works on chain (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: I bought after snapshot, what will I do? (asked by atbanklan) A: Hold ai16z and swap at your leisure; won't be migrated automatically (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

The most significant technical issue reported was a serious bug in the welcome email system where promised $5 credits were not being added to new accounts, and worse, clicking the \"get started\" button was overwriting existing accounts and agents, creating new accounts with only $1 balance instead. This represents a critical customer retention blocker.\n\nPayment and account recharging limitations were identified as major obstacles to customer onboarding and retention. Users cannot transfer tokens between accounts to help friends recharge, and VPN users are blocked from accessing payment pages. A proposed solution involves implementing wallet addresses for each account to enable direct crypto token deposits without wallet connection requirements.\n\nAdditional feature suggestions included implementing a referral program to incentivize user acquisition and retention. The lack of easy payment options was identified as causing customer loss at the critical conversion point when trial users want to become paying customers.\n\nA query about Meta Threads plugin availability was answered negatively by Odilitime. Other non-technical discussions involved suggestions for AI agents trained on public document releases, though these were more conceptual than actionable development items.\n\nThe sam user responded to investigate the email/account bug by requesting the affected user's details for debugging.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThe chat focused on debugging and deploying babylon.market, a platform with user authentication and reward systems. Multiple API endpoints were failing, affecting page functionality. SYMBiEX managed the deployment, offering admin/mod access to users signing up with ElizaLabs.ai emails.\n\nKey technical issues identified: username creation bug causing users to receive \"@userid:priv\" as usernames instead of proper usernames, broken Discord OAuth for account linking, and non-functional Twitter follow reward claiming with error messages. SYMBiEX committed to investigating both issues.\n\nA fix for the OAuth/reward issues was pushed by user ID 688478180306452573 but initially wasn't merged to production. After confirmation from tcm390, the fix was merged to production, allowing testing to proceed. The team coordinated timing for testing the fixes.\n\nAdditional discussion included access restrictions limiting participation to top 100 users, with Agent Joshua requesting approval for \"hashwarlock\" to test. The chat also included non-technical discussion about Claude Opus 4.6 release from Anthropic, with team members expressing interest in the new model at the same price point as 4.5.\n\n## 2.

The migration window, which had been open since November (90 days), closed, causing frustration among users who were absent during this period. sam.mrk criticized the two-week deadline (later corrected to 90 days) as insufficient for investors who may be traveling or away from their wallets, arguing the team should have extended it to a year or automatically airdropped tokens. Community members clarified this was a migration, not an airdrop, and that unmigrated tokens would be locked for one year.\n\nTechnical discussions included shoemaker6765 experiencing migration issues and being targeted by scammers. Odilitime warned about scammer activity in the channel. zelm1 raised concerns about fake projects launching on Babylon wallet falsely claiming association with Shaw, requesting clarification via tweet to prevent dev selling under his name.\n\nProject updates included Odilitime confirming work continues on degenai, which performed well in Babylon test games with real tests upcoming. The team is focused on the Babylon launch. M I A M I promoted \"rentasoul,\" a platform where users can give their soul to AI agents, bring Eliza agents, or complete tasks for payment.\n\nDeveloper outreach included aicodeflow offering 8 years of AI/automation engineering experience, CT sharing CERBERUS-AGI (a Trollstore AI-Driven Software in beta), and Rishab seeking beta testers for an x402-based payment gateway for AI agents on Solana. Technical questions included \"some\" asking about which Eliza version works properly with the Twitter plugin locally, which went unanswered.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: I couldn't migrate my tokens, trying all day, how do I make a ticket or get help? (asked by shoemaker6765) A: Odilitime warned the person helping was a scammer (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What's going on with degenai? Is anything being worked on, or has it been abandoned?

Summary\n\nThis chat segment focuses on a technical issue with the ElizaCloud platform involving account management and credit allocation problems. The user **yojo** reported experiencing duplicate account creation when attempting to claim a $5 welcome credit. \n\nThe core technical issue involves two separate accounts being created under the same email address:\n- Account 1: Original registration directly on elizacloud.ai with 27 cents balance, where an agent initially disappeared but later reappeared\n- Account 2: Created when clicking the \"get started\" link in the welcome email, which redirects to dev.elizacloud.ai (a different subdomain) with only $1 initial balance instead of the promised $5 credit\n\nThe problem appears to stem from the email link directing users to a development environment (dev.elizacloud.ai) rather than the production environment (elizacloud.ai), causing account fragmentation and failure to properly credit the promotional $5. The user created separate agents in both accounts due to this confusion.\n\n**yojo** also raised security concerns about sharing email addresses on Discord due to phishing risks. The platform administrators **Odilitime** and **sam** offered to handle the issue through direct messages to resolve the account consolidation and credit allocation problem privately.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered around three main topics: token migration issues, ElizaOS technical developments, and platform technical support.\n\n**Token Migration Controversy**: A significant portion of the conversation involved users debating the 90-day migration deadline that recently closed. Multiple community members (TanviSinghwal92, V33, Kenk) defended the timeline as sufficient, noting the migration was communicated since March and postponed from October to November. Kenk explained there are ongoing maintenance overheads and human support costs associated with keeping the migration portal open indefinitely, justifying the deadline. Users who missed the deadline were criticized for not monitoring their holdings or opening support tickets before the cutoff.\n\n**ElizaOS Technical Developments**: The project announced cross-chain expansion beyond Solana to Ethereum. The Void confirmed \"Elizaos is crosschain now.\" Discussion highlighted ElizaOS's utility for autonomous agents performing on-chain work, including managing protocol liquidity and orchestrating DeFi workflows, though chomppp questioned when these features would be implemented. The Babylon Monkey game is currently in beta testing for points farming and airdrops.\n\n**Technical Support Issues**: A user (∙∙·▫▫ᴼⒻⓄⓍⓏⓎᴼ▫▫·∙∙) reported ElizaCloud login issues where the dashboard kept cycling between login and dashboard screens. Odilitime forwarded this to the cloud team for investigation and requested the user's email via DM for follow-up.\n\n**Community Announcements**: kirsten launched BuildAMolt, a hosted solution for Moltbots and Moltbook on private VPS with 2-minute setup, eliminating the need for local instances. A security matter was raised by memi seeking team contact for private discussion.\n\nMarket conditions were briefly discussed, with Arceon noting Bitcoin's drop from 92k to 60k in under 3 weeks, attributing liquidity issues across all cryptocurrencies to capital leaving the market.\n\n## 2.

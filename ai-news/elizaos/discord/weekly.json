          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion primarily centered around token migration issues and community concerns. Multiple users encountered problems migrating AI16Z tokens to the new contract, with the most significant case involving a user (ryanb.btc) who transferred tokens from Robinhood wallet (which lacks dapp browser functionality) to another wallet, causing migration eligibility issues. Kenk from support successfully resolved this through the ticketing system.\n\nA critical security incident was identified when Jeburek12 reported being asked to send AI16Z tokens to a wallet address for migration. Kenk confirmed this was a scam attempt, clarifying that legitimate migration doesn't require sending tokens to external addresses since migration contracts are capped.\n\nCommunity sentiment showed frustration with project direction. DannyNOR NoFapArc and Jayzen criticized the team for launching multiple tokens instead of focusing on core infrastructure, with Jayzen specifically noting concerns about \"scatterbrained decision-making\" and spreading resources thin over tokens not directly tied to the underlying platform.\n\nTechnical contributions emerged with Momo announcing work on an RLM plugin for Eliza v2 after discussions with Shaw, marking their first major open-source contribution despite finding it challenging.\n\nQuestions arose about related projects: Malombres asked about Agent Scarlett's status, and velja repeatedly questioned a Hyperscape token funded by Shaw's wallet, though this remained unaddressed. The Three Words expressed concerns about ElizaOS's low liquidity (110k LP) on Solana.\n\nElizaBAO organized a video creator competition for ElizaBAO content involving ElizaOS and Polymarket. Kenk advised structuring it as a clear challenge with bounties, acknowledging content creation as a skilled, time-intensive task.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Who migrated successfully?

The primary problem involved elizacloud experiencing server-side errors preventing user login, with multiple users (untitled, xyz and ElizaBAO) reporting access issues throughout the day.\n\nA significant database migration problem was resolved where DigitalDiva encountered persistent \"CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS migrations\" errors with both local and Aiven cloud Postgres databases. The solution involved switching to Neon database, successfully resolving the migration failures after troubleshooting with 0xbbjoker about pgvector image compatibility.\n\nDiscord integration issues emerged after updating to version 1.7.2, with errors in the recentMessagesProvider showing \"Cannot access invalid private field (evaluating 'this.#conversationLength')\". The agent failed to respond in both channels and DMs, with 0xbbjoker investigating the issue and clarifying that CHANNEL_IDS serves as a channel whitelist.\n\nDorianD proposed distributed computation concepts for Jeju, suggesting nodes could work together similar to p2pool mining on Bitcoin network, with computation layers distributed across nodes and results compared to prevent cheating. The discussion included using iPhones with 8GB RAM to provide compute cycles when devices are idle (90%+ battery). Chucknorris suggested using ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proofs) to prevent cheating, though DorianD questioned implementation feasibility on consumer devices, noting only one Bittensor subnet (Omron) currently uses ZKP with limited commercial scalability.\n\nAdditional discussions covered Claude Opus 4.5 subscription comparisons, with Chucknorris criticizing Google's Antigravity offering as inferior to Windsurf due to quota limitations and performance issues.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is cloud down? (asked by untitled, xyz) A: Seems fine, but user experienced \"Application error: a server-side exception has occurred\" which temporarily resolved with hard refresh but login issues persisted (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Can I log a ticket somewhere for support on elizacloud errors?

Summary\n\nThis brief discussion focused on comparing Second Life and Roblox as historical case studies for understanding virtual world platforms, specifically in the context of applying lessons to \"hyperscape\" development. DorianD initiated the conversation by noting both platforms launched around the same time approximately 20 years ago, suggesting their successes and failures could inform current development efforts.\n\nThe key technical observation centered on Roblox's business model paradox: despite generating billions in revenue and maintaining hundreds of millions of monthly active users (reportedly 380M MAU), the platform remains unprofitable. DorianD noted skepticism about the accuracy of these user metrics, suggesting significant inflation from duplicate accounts and bot activity.\n\nOdilitime characterized Roblox as a \"jobs program,\" highlighting concerns about the platform's economic model and its reliance on user-generated content creation. The discussion touched on the ethical implications of platforms that depend heavily on unpaid or minimally compensated user labor for content creation.\n\nWhile brief, the conversation raised important considerations for virtual world platform design: sustainability of business models that rely on massive scale, the accuracy and reliability of user metrics, and the economic relationship between platforms and content creators.\n\n## 2.

          "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThis chat segment primarily focused on a critical token launch crisis involving improper tokenomics. The core issue was that cjft launched a token with 75% of supply bundled/held by the developer, which violates current crypto meta standards and creates rug pull concerns.\n\nShaw provided urgent guidance on token launch best practices, emphasizing that developers should NEVER sell tokens directly due to tracking and community backlash. The proper model relies on 2% creator fees from trading volume rather than selling held tokens. Shaw reported making $80k in fees this week from a token someone else launched, demonstrating the fee-based model's viability.\n\nKey technical points:\n- Developers holding large token percentages triggers immediate community distrust and bot dumping\n- Modern token meta requires burning excess supply (70% recommended) rather than locking\n- Creator fees (2%) provide sustainable revenue without selling\n- Selling even 1 token marks the chart with \"dev sold\" and kills the token\n- Wallet tracking makes all developer transactions visible to bots\n\nThe resolution involved cjft burning 70% of tokens using sol-incinerator.com, exporting private keys from bags.fm wallet to Phantom wallet for the burn transaction. Sayonara provided technical assistance with the burning process.\n\nAdditional technical note: Jin identified an API issue where GitHub API for elizaOS repos shows a 7-month-old .cursor repository, suggesting repository cleanup needed.\n\nMinor mentions: Cursor now supports parallel agents feature.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What should developers do with tokens instead of selling? (asked by shaw) A: Take 30% of fees for buybacks when token dips, keep rest for cloud/otaku pumps, do burns on app milestones like signups (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: What happens if developers sell tokens? (asked by shaw) A: Wallet is tracked, all bots dump immediately, token dies (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Should tokens be locked or burned? (asked by cjft) A: Burn them, don't lock unless they burn (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: How much should be burned from the 75% supply? (asked by cjft) A: Burn 70%, keep 5% (answered by sayonara)\n\nQ: How to access tokens from bags.fm for burning? (asked by cjft) A: Export private key from bags.fm/settings/wallets and import into Phantom (answered by sayonara)\n\nQ: How much can be made from creator fees? (asked by cjft) A: Shaw made $80k in fees this week from a token someone else launched (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: What tool should be used to burn tokens?

The main technical point discussed was the **Migration Agent** implementation, which uses **Claude Sonnet** as the underlying model, noted for well-structured responses and human-like emoji interactions in context.\n\nThe chat was dominated by controversy around a **GOLD token launch** associated with Hyperscape. Community members identified suspicious activity including a 40% dev wallet, insider trading patterns with wallets funded 3 days prior, and approximately $150k extracted through coordinated early entries. The launch followed a pattern of silence during speculation followed by CA confirmation after price movement.\n\n**CJFT token** was confirmed as official by Odilitime, with the creator engaging in content creation including YouToy integration and live streaming.\n\nCommunity frustration emerged regarding the **ai16z project**, with one member reporting losses from $28k to $800, criticizing the team for building multiple projects without focusing on monetization and user acquisition. Concerns were raised about lack of clarity on how new projects translate to value for Eliza OS holders, with calls for focus on **Eliza Cloud** as a resource-intensive priority.\n\n**ElizaBAO** promoted a video content competition and hackathon participation requiring 10% token holdings. A **BAGS token** was also mentioned as a creator token for ElizaOS projects, though details remained unclear.\n\nThe technical discussion was minimal, overshadowed by token speculation and community concerns about project direction and insider trading practices.\n\n## 2.

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 🥇-partners\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel discussion covered three main topics: airdrop tax optimization strategies, Hyperfy platform sunset announcement, and a token launch issue.\n\n**Hyperfy Platform Sunset**: Hyperfy announced the shutdown of their legacy hyperfy.io hosted platform on April 1st, 2026. The platform has transitioned to a fully open-source, self-hosted model. World NFT holders already received $HYPER token airdrops, completing the transition from the NFT-based platform model. The open-source repository remains actively developed, and users can self-host or use providers like hyperworld.host.\n\n**Airdrop Tax Optimization Discussion**: DorianD proposed a technical solution to avoid tax implications on airdrops. Instead of distributing tokens directly to individual wallets (which triggers 1099 income tax), tokens would be sent to a single smart contract. This contract would use a price oracle to automatically buy and burn ElizaOS tokens based on a predetermined supply curve as the airdropped token appreciates. The approach avoids individual tax events and creates long-term alignment. DorianD emphasized the contract must be immutable (no admin permissions) and potentially deployed from a favorable tax jurisdiction. The concept differs from bond desk functionality, which operates as a vesting contract with delayed purchases at discounted rates.\n\n**Token Launch Issue**: Shaw announced an official pump.fun token launch intended to airdrop a percentage to ElizaOS holders. However, the launch encountered critical issues with liquidity pool management that \"rekt\" the token supply. Shaw clarified this was a \"gold presale\" token, not the main Hyperscape token, which will have fixed tokenomics and won't launch on pump.fun. Community members expressed concern about attention dilution across multiple tokens.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How does the bond desk agent work?

Summary\n\nThe channel focused on three main technical discussions:\n\n**DaVinci Resolve AI Integration Project**: Irie_Rubz initiated development of a DaVinci Resolve MCP integration (https://github.com/AyeRubz/davinci-resolve-mcp) despite being a new coder. The project aims to automate video editing tasks including timeline imports, effects, text animations, transitions, and audio management in Fairlight. PatoVeloso, a professional Resolve user, suggested two approaches: using transcription features to create trimmed sequences from longer content, and adding AI video transformation capabilities (e.g., converting real action to Pixar-style animation). Key limitation identified: DaVinci has restricted API allocations preventing fully autonomous features. Alternative platforms like Adobe Premiere Pro were discussed but dismissed due to subscription costs.\n\n**Eliza CLI Version Migration Issues**: YogaFlame encountered persistent version conflicts when updating from 1.6.5 to 1.7.2, experiencing SQL migration failures and bootstrap errors with the Discord plugin. 0xbbjoker provided systematic troubleshooting: clearing cache with `bun pm cache rm`, uninstalling/reinstalling CLI globally, and removing node_modules/bun.lock files. The issue stemmed from cached package.json references to 1.6.5. Solution involved either manually updating package.json to 1.7.2 or creating a fresh project. Bootstrap issues were confirmed fixed in elizaos 1.7.2 and discord plugin 1.3.8.\n\n**Clawd.bot Discussion**: DorianD shared clawd.bot project, which gained attention for running on Mac minis with local models and featuring Meta Raybans integration for price comparison functionality.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How do I add the DaVinci Resolve integration to Eliza AI agents? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Should I integrate with Eliza now or wait until the project is working? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: How true is the limitation about DaVinci's API allocations preventing fully autonomous features? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Confirmed as a limitation; DaVinci has limited API allocations preventing fully autonomous creation until they allow more (answered by Irie_Rubz via research)\n\nQ: What are the migration errors when updating to 1.7.2? (asked by YogaFlame) A: Failed SQL migration errors and bootstrap errors with Discord plugin, caused by version caching issues (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\nQ: How do I fix the CLI showing 1.6.5 after updating to 1.7.2? (asked by YogaFlame) A: Run `bun uninstall -g @elizaos/cli`, `bun pm cache rm`, `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`, remove node_modules & bun.lock, update package.json to 1.7.2 or create fresh project (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\nQ: How do I run ChatGPT and Claude Code together for faster editing? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Self-resolved, no details provided (answered by Irie_Rubz)\n\nQ: Do you need a Mac to run clawd.bot? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: No, people are just using Macs for running local models (answered by DorianD)\n\n## 3.

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 🥇-partners\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centers on a critical strategic debate about ElizaOS's tokenomics and ecosystem development approach. The core tension involves whether the team should launch separate tokens for ecosystem projects (like Hyperscape game) versus focusing exclusively on the main $elizaos token.\n\n**Key Context:** ElizaOS has a $20M market cap with 8 months runway remaining. Shaw reveals the team is resource-constrained, with no budget to fund Hyperscape development from existing Cloud and Babylon allocations. Babylon has 375k users, and cloud apps are launching soon.\n\n**Strategic Decision:** The team launched a separate \"gold\" token for Hyperscape (a RuneScape-like crypto game built on Eliza agents) via a Pump.fun hackathon to fund development. This token serves as in-game currency with specific utility. Shaw is on a 2-week MVP schedule with the Hyperscape team.\n\n**Community Concerns:** Members argue this approach dilutes attention from the main token, damages reputation, and reduces confidence in the ecosystem. They cite Vitalik's approach of never launching tokens beyond ETH and only advising projects. Suggestions include: airdrops to elizaOS holders, token pairing requirements (like Virtuals ecosystem), or grants-based funding instead of team-launched tokens.\n\n**Alternative Proposals:** DorianD suggests technical integration where game items/agents trigger $elizaos burns or network fees, creating actual utility linkage. The proposal emphasizes that every in-game action requiring LLM compute or storage should involve platform fees in $elizaos, similar to how EVM requires the underlying network.\n\n**Critical Outcome:** Shaw expresses frustration with community negativity, noting he made $400k a year ago, held $200k in tokens that declined significantly, never sold, and now faces resource constraints and tax obligations. He threatens to leave the server due to ongoing drama around ecosystem development decisions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is there an airdrop of gold for elizaOS holders? (asked by Odilitime) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Why launch coins for everything instead of focusing on singular $elizaos token? (asked by mawnst3r) A: Shaw explained they have $20M market cap with 8 months runway, no budget to fund Hyperscape from existing allocations, so separate token launches fund development of games built on Eliza framework (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Has Vitalik ever launched any other coin besides ETH? (asked by sayitaintso25) A: No, and he's reluctant to even endorse tokens in the ETH ecosystem (answered by sayitaintso25)\n\nQ: Do you want buybacks or airdrops? (asked by shaw) A: Community suggested airdrops to elizaOS holders or token pairing requirements, but no consensus reached (answered by community discussion)\n\nQ: Has anyone else built a framework and then incubated a whole ecosystem of apps and games on it? (asked by shaw) A: Implied comparison to Ethereum ecosystem, but no direct answer provided (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Why is full attention aimed at a game nobody asked for? (asked by Broccolex) A: Shaw explained Hyperscape is built by separate team on Eliza agents, funded via token launch due to budget constraints (answered by shaw)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe channel discussion centered on three main technical topics: MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration with Eliza Cloud, self-hosting options, and security concerns.\n\n**MCP Integration with Eliza Cloud**: SATA inquired about adding external MCP servers to agents created in Eliza Cloud, specifically for an AI Red Teaming agent with human-in-the-loop functionality. SOLOMON VANDY clarified that external MCP servers can be registered through the Eliza Cloud API using POST /api/v1/mcps endpoint, and once registered, Eliza can proxy calls to those MCP endpoints for agent reasoning and task execution.\n\n**Self-Hosting Discussion**: LarpsAI mentioned that users are deploying Eliza on mini PCs to avoid keeping their main systems running 24/7. A blog post was referenced about running Eliza on Oracle Cloud's free tier with 4 vCPU and 24GB RAM specifications. There was brief discussion about Claude Code integration with Eliza.\n\n**Security Issues**: A scam attempt was identified involving a \"Create A Ticket\" bot that requested wallet addresses from users. SATA reported receiving a suspicious link after posting questions in the channel. Odilitime confirmed this was a scam operation, likely using automated astroturfing tactics.\n\n**Other Topics**: DorianD discussed potential monetization strategies involving phone OS integration and data collection for AI training. ElizaBAO posted a developer hiring notice with creator rewards and Polymarket affiliate profit sharing. Kenk requested adding Eliza MCP functionality to the channel.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is it possible to give an agent created within Eliza Cloud access to an external MCP? (asked by SATA) A: You can add external MCP servers by registering them through the Eliza Cloud API using POST /api/v1/mcps, and once registered, Eliza can proxy calls to those MCP endpoints (answered by SOLOMON VANDY)\n\nQ: Can we add eliza mcp here?

Summary\n\nThe discussion channel primarily focused on community concerns about the ElizaOS token price performance, with multiple users expressing worry about continuous all-time lows (ATLs). The main technical inquiry involved token migration processes, specifically from Ledger and from ai16z to ElizaOS tokens.\n\n**Key Concerns Raised:**\n- Token validity and community support for ElizaOS\n- Price performance and lack of team response during market downturn\n- Migration procedures for tokens\n\n**Community Responses:**\nThe community provided reassurance about the project's fundamentals, with members emphasizing that ElizaOS is positioned as a leading AI agent project. Contributors noted the broader market volatility affecting all crypto assets, not just ElizaOS specifically. Long-term holders shared their 4-year cycle investment strategy, comparing ElizaOS favorably with other AI projects like PAAL and FETCH.\n\n**Technical Support Needs:**\nTwo migration-related questions were raised: Ledger migration and ai16z to ElizaOS token migration. The Void directed users to a ticket channel (#1425417640071139358) for migration support, indicating a formal support process exists for these technical issues.\n\nThe overall sentiment mixed frustration about short-term price action with long-term conviction in the AI agent technology and ElizaOS's market position.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is the Elizaos token still valid? Is the community interested in it, or is it being left to die? (asked by paolin) A: The token is valid; the market downturn is affecting all crypto, not just ElizaOS specifically. The team is building the future of AI agents and ElizaOS is among leading projects in this space. (answered by Matthib123, Rainman)\n\nQ: How can I migrate from ledger?

Summary\n\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion and is primarily focused on community sentiment and project strategy. Seppmos provides a defense of the project direction, expressing frustration with community members criticizing Shaw and token performance. The key strategic points mentioned include: the project's multi-product approach with several initiatives in development (Babylon, Hyperscape, Cloud, OTC desk, Eliza Anime), an airdrop-based reward strategy for long-term holders, and confidence in the development team's capabilities in AI agent development. The proposed strategy involves iterating on multiple products until one achieves viral success, then rewarding ElizaOS holders through airdrops (mentioning HYPE and BABY as examples).

Summary\n\nThe channel focused on two major technical issues: Knowledge plugin configuration errors and cost optimization.\n\n**Knowledge Plugin Configuration Issue**: YogaFlame encountered validation errors when installing the Knowledge plugin, receiving \"Invalid enum value\" errors for EMBEDDING_PROVIDER (expected 'openai' | 'google', received 'openrouter') and TEXT_PROVIDER. DigitalDiva identified the root cause: openrouter was incorrectly set as the embedding provider instead of openai.\n\n**Knowledge Plugin Cost Optimization**: Tyrone reported extremely high costs ($0.03-0.04 per query, tens of thousands of tokens) when using the Knowledge plugin with OpenAI for simple requests on three small markdown documents (13-30 lines each). The issue was traced to contextual embeddings being enabled (CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true). 0xbbjoker provided a minimal configuration solution using OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_MODEL with openai/text-embedding-3-small, demonstrating successful embedding of a 3.1MB PDF with 517 chunks at reasonable cost. The key insight was that contextual embeddings significantly increase token usage and costs, as documented in the ctx-embeddings.ts file.\n\n**Other Technical Discussions**: DigitalDiva inquired about integrating ElizaOS AI agents with OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoints supporting OpenAI JSON API, OpenRouter, and Kobold API options. Odilitime expressed strong preference for Opus 4.5 model, with sedano.npc confirming similar experience. Irie_Rubz worked on a first project built from scratch in Cursor, seeking guidance on Git integration and multi-agent workflows.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThe team is pivoting from hardware-focused development (Mac mini) to building an AI agent platform called \"Eliza\" that can perform automated tasks. The core technical focus is integrating n8n workflow automation with Eliza v2.0.0 (published to npm as @elizaos/core@next) to enable dynamic workflow creation through natural language.\n\n**Key Technical Decisions:**\n- Eliza v2 branch includes computer use and browser use capabilities based on working open source implementations\n- Adopting n8n plugin architecture as the primary approach for workflow automation instead of building native plugins for each service\n- Three-layer architecture proposed: AI Workflow Generator (Layer 3), Workflow Engine with TaskService/cron (Layer 2), and OAuth Gateway for multi-tenant credentials (Layer 1)\n- Using n8n-intelligence (open source) to enable agents to create workflows conversationally\n- Setting up n8n hosted cloud instance for scaling\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\nThe team identified that users want AI-powered workflow builders (95% use case) rather than extensive auto-coding. Focus is on connecting services like Gmail, Calendar, Notion, and Linear with conditional logic. The approach involves creating pre-built common workflows, then using Claude Opus to generate new ones based on closest matches, marking them as experimental and debugging with users before adding to the library.\n\n**Immediate Priorities:**\nEnd-of-week deadline for top-of-funnel: landing page → poke integration → agent conversation. The agent personality needs to be \"funny, spunky, and spicy\" but not mean. Team is exploring n8n capabilities first before continuing plugin development to understand limitations and determine optimal tool selection.\n\n**Parallel Development:**\nSam working on SMS/iMessage plugins and cloud platform integration. Stan focusing on mail/calendar and n8n plugin development with OAuth support. Odilitime developing plugin-pim (Personal Information Manager) using entity/component architecture and memories.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What issues did Vivek have with the system?

(asked by sam) A: Yes, published to \"next\" - install with npm install @elizaos/core@next (answered by s)\n\nQ: Should we build native plugins or use n8n? (asked by s) A: After OAuth, n8n plugin would be slickest - can validate workflows by credentials needed and create stuff for users on the fly (answered by s)\n\nQ: How do we test dynamically generated workflows? (asked by s) A: Pre-create common workflows, use Opus to generate new ones based on closest matches, mark as experimental, debug with users, review/fix on backend, add fixed versions to library (answered by s)\n\nQ: What's the main user need - autocoding or workflows? (asked by sam) A: 95% want AI workflow builder, only few nerds want autocoding - people want to connect email/notion/calendar/linear with if statements (answered by s)\n\nQ: Should we stop Twilio/BLOOIO work and focus on n8n? (asked by sam) A: n8n is for workflows, still need cloud runtime for iMessage/WhatsApp chat clients - should prioritize n8n first to understand limits before continuing plugins (answered by Stan ⚡ and Odilitime)\n\nQ: How does plugin addition by user request work currently? (asked by Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE) A: Stan will work on n8n plugin to allow OAuth connection and workflow creation in dedicated n8n instance by asking Eliza directly (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Can we pass plugin credentials to n8n? (asked by Odilitime) A: Yes, credentials from plugins like plugin-gmail can be passed to n8n for workflow access (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Is n8n-intelligence open sourced?

Summary\n\nThe discussion primarily focused on criticism of a \"hot potato\" style FOMO dapp and concerns about the ElizaOS Twitter presence. DorianD identified that a developer created a game mechanism similar to the original Bitcoin Potato game (referencing the GitHub repository ripper234/Bitcoin-Potato), where participants pass around tokens in a gambling-style format. The critical issue raised was that the developer receives vestings of the required participation coin, allowing them to profit from coin sales while having unlimited supply to reset the game without cost - creating what DorianD characterized as a potential scam structure.\n\nDorianD expressed serious legal concerns, suggesting the developer could face lawsuits from participants and government investigation for illegal gambling operations. He noted that government attorneys and gambling commissions might pursue profit clawback, emphasizing this as a reason why truly decentralized agents are necessary to avoid legal liability.\n\nThe conversation shifted to constructive feedback about the ElizaOS Twitter account. DorianD recommended that the @elizaos account adopt more personality and \"soul\" similar to successful AI personas like clawd.atg.eth and pippin. He noted the current feed appears too dry and corporate, suggesting it should embody the actual Eliza AI personality based on the show that one of the team members worked on, incorporating projective anime elements. The rationale was that people connect with the human-like aspects of AI, and a more engaging persona could drive better community engagement. Odilitime responded positively, mentioning they're building a Twitter agent that could potentially fulfill this role.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What is the connection between the FOMO dapp and the Bitcoin Potato game?

(asked by DorianD) A: The developer receives vestings of the coin required to participate, so they profit from selling the coin while having near endless supply to reset the game at no cost (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: What legal risks does the developer face? (asked by DorianD) A: Potential lawsuits from participants and government investigation for illegal gambling, with possibility of profit clawback from gambling commissions (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Why are decentralized agents important in this context? (asked by DorianD) A: To enable activities without legal liability falling on individuals, preventing situations like FBI raids at 6am (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: What should the ElizaOS Twitter account do differently? (asked by DorianD) A: It should have more soul and actual Eliza persona based on the show, incorporating projective anime elements, rather than being dry and corporate (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: What are they building for Twitter?

Odilitime clarified that Ollama, OpenAI, and OpenRouter are supported options, with plans to move embeddings completely to plugins in version 2.x.\n\n**SSE Streaming & Socket Implementation**: sedano.npc encountered MIME_TYPE_MISMATCH errors when setting up SSE streaming. Chucknorris recommended switching from SSE to socket.io, reporting better results. The issue was traced to incorrect backend deployment configuration (local vs cloud).\n\n**Eliza Framework Analysis**: Jin analyzed the clawdbot project, highlighting useful patterns including markdown-based configuration files (BOOTSTRAP.md, SOUL.md), skills integration, and structured home directories. Discussion emphasized that good documentation combined with skills can significantly improve agent performance.\n\n**Knowledge Plugin Architecture**: Victor Creed and 0xbbjoker discussed the SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE action, confirming it returns raw document fragments without LLM summarization. 0xbbjoker suggested creating custom actions that prepare multiple queries and generate summaries.\n\n**Development Tools**: sedano.npc reported issues with Cursor's AUTO mode breaking applications after 8+ hours of troubleshooting. Odilitime recommended using Composer 1 instead, which resolved deployment issues instantly.\n\n**Future Concepts**: DorianD proposed building a small local model for intelligent request routing between available models based on complexity, cost, and load parameters. Odilitime noted the current system alternates between small/large model selections from providers.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What's the difference between commit and pull request? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Commit is like save changes. Pull request is when working on someone else's OSS repo - you have to fork first. For your own repo, commit and push is sufficient. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Should I stage all files or select specific ones? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Staging selects which files to send up. As long as you don't have files with passwords, \"Yes\" is like \"Save All\". (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Does OpenRouter embedding work with the knowledge plugin? (asked by YogaFlame) A: It kept giving errors; only OpenAI has worked so far. (answered by YogaFlame)\n\nQ: Are we forced to use OpenAI for embeddings now? (asked by jin) A: Ollama, OpenAI, or OpenRouter are supported. Version 2.x will drop embeddings in runtime and move it completely to plugins. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: How do I fix MIME_TYPE_MISMATCH error with SSE streaming? (asked by sedano.npc) A: Need to explore routes and understand how Eliza server handles SSE. Switching to socket.io is much better than SSE. (answered by Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)\n\nQ: Does SEARCH_KNOWLEDGE action summarize doc fragments before returning? (asked by Victor Creed) A: No summarization, it's just a query to fragments returning three most similar. You can easily build custom action to prepare queries and make summaries. (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\nQ: Does the Twitter plugin still work and is it expensive to run? (asked by SLAPPY) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Why has the discord become so quiet? (asked by SLAPPY) A: People are still working hard, folks just have less time to post messages. (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Does ElizaOS multiplex between models based on request complexity? (asked by DorianD) A: No, we have small/large model selection from a provider but just alternate between those two. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Should I use Cursor AUTO mode or Composer? (asked by sedano.npc) A: Don't use AUTO. Composer 1 is better than AUTO and lower cost. (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe core development team focused on several critical technical initiatives. **Odilitime** identified a compatibility issue where plugin-anthropic 1.x doesn't work with the develop branch and later curated type fixes for a PR. **jin** made significant infrastructure improvements by merging MCP (Model Context Protocol) support and implementing dynamic tracking systems for both GitHub repositories and Discord channels. The tracking system automatically monitors active/inactive repos and new/archived channels, moving toward a self-maintaining configuration system.\n\nA major theme was improving developer onboarding and Time To Value. **jin** emphasized creating a bootstrapping skill that connects agents to knowledge repositories, docs, and GitHub activity data, enabling agents to self-troubleshoot. The philosophy centers on treating documentation as code and prompt engineering, with knowledge bundled like game manuals.\n\n**Stan** made progress on the plugin-n8n-workflow (30% complete with regular commits) and coordinated OAuth specifications with team members. The team discussed renaming the elizaos.github.io repository, debating names like \"leaders.elizaos.ai\" or \"leaderboard\" but ultimately deciding against ranking implications in favor of showcasing contributor competencies and codebase evolution.\n\n**sayonara** established a PR workflow for documentation updates through the elizaOS/docs repository. The team celebrated a significant payment milestone and discussed clawdbot's success as an opportunity for Eliza. Technical infrastructure improvements included MCP integration for agents to access comprehensive elizaOS and elizaos-plugins GitHub activity data.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Are you still the go to person for eliza.how?

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on three main technical topics: the ai16z to ElizaOS migration, ERC-8004 agent tokenization standard, and AI agent network development.\n\n**Migration Issues**: Multiple users (ai16zbags, Never Broke Again) reported that the migration site failed to detect ai16z tokens in Phantom wallets. Hexx provided clarification that ai16z migrated to ElizaOS, and holders from before the November snapshot at 11:40 UTC should use the migration portal to convert tokens.\n\n**ERC-8004 Agent Standard**: satsbased discussed the upcoming ERC-8004 mainnet launch on Ethereum, scheduled for this week. This standard enables agent identity and reputation tracking onchain, allowing verification of whether AI agents are legitimate or \"larps\" (fake). The implementation aims to bring trustless tokenization to AI agents, with satsbased positioning this as a significant development for the ecosystem.\n\n**AI Avatar Network Concept**: timcoucou proposed building a network similar to fetch.ai where members have AI avatars that automatically discover each other through similarity matching, conduct autonomous discussions, and send reports when interesting opportunities arise. The goal is pre-qualified, enthusiastic meetings between users. This TypeScript developer sought recommendations on implementation approach.\n\n**Ecosystem Tracking**: Discussion touched on tracking the ElizaOS ecosystem, with mentions of hyperscape game, clawdbot on Base, and projects like Babylon and Otaku. Concerns were raised about token value proposition for investors, with Taco questioning why investors would buy the token currently despite appreciating the project.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Did anyone face issues with the migration site not detecting ai16z tokens in Phantom wallet? (asked by ai16zbags) A: The migration site isn't detecting ai16z in phantom wallet - confirmed issue (answered by Never Broke Again (NBA))\n\nQ: What happened to ai16z? (asked by Watcoinerist) A: Ai16z migrated to ElizaOS. If holding Ai16z before snapshot time 11:40 UTC November, migrate through the migration portal (answered by Hexx 🌐)\n\nQ: How can I create a ticket? (asked by fragmtagmbagm) A: Directed to channel #1423981231300935801 (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: How is pippin 20x us?

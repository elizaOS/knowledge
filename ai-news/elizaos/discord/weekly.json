          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel discussion covered several technical topics, primarily focused on AI routing systems and action callback patterns in Eliza framework.\n\n**DorianD** initiated a discussion about AI model routing frameworks, identifying existing solutions like RouteLLM (Python-based for prompt complexity analysis), Latitude.so (prompt engineering platform), and MasRouter (multi-agent system management). They proposed creating an \"ElizaRouter\" with a distributed routing mechanism where receiving nodes select optimal nodes with time decay for Quality of Service. Small open-source models were evaluated for routing purposes, including Microsoft Phi-4 Mini (3.8B-14B), Qwen2.5/Qwen3 (1.5B-7B), Mistral 7B, and DeepSeek-Coder for code-specific tasks.\n\n**Victor Creed** reported a critical bug in Eliza 1.7.2 regarding action callback execution order. The documented callback pattern should send messages sequentially: (1) initial feedback, (2) structured return text, (3) detailed callback message. However, the actual behavior reverses the order, sending the detailed callback first, then initial feedback, and omitting the structured return message entirely. This issue affects custom plugins using `plugin-sql`, `plugin-openai`, and `plugin-bootstrap`. The problem remains unresolved as no community members provided solutions.\n\n**Supreem** shared an interview about agentic coding systems. **DorianD** later proposed an unconventional idea about collecting training data for robotics through viral social media challenges similar to TikTok dance trends, focusing on household tasks like sweeping, mopping, and ironing.\n\n## 2.

Sam announced plans to work on the \"ahead direction\" feature, building a connection page where users can link their social accounts before being redirected back to the bot, following Shaw's previous suggestion.\n\nThe team explored using Composio, an open-source tool for handling authentication and social integrations. Sam identified Composio as a potentially valuable solution, specifically highlighting its in-chat authentication capabilities that align with their current development needs. Stan revealed he had already created a Composio plugin months earlier and offered to share it with the team for reference. Stan also mentioned he's drafting an RFC (Request for Comments) document with related ideas that he plans to share.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on two main technical issues and significant token-related concerns. \n\n**Technical Issues:**\nDigitalDiva encountered a plugin installation error with @elizaos/plugin-web-search, receiving a \"Cannot find module\" error after attempting installation. Odilitime suggested editing the project's package.json to include proper module resolution and directed them to use bun for installation and the appropriate support channel for further assistance.\n\nSarthak faced a token migration issue with ElizaOS tokens on ETH chain showing 98% loss when attempting to swap back to ETH or USDT due to zero liquidity. Kenk attempted to clarify whether this was a slippage or migration question, and MDMnvest directed them to the migration channel.\n\n**Token Economics Discussion:**\nA significant portion of the chat involved critical questions about token utility and team allocation. Key concerns raised by averma, gby, and Jayzen included: the 40% token allocation to the team after a 1:10 token increase (where community received only 6 while team got 40%), lack of clear use cases for the token, airdrops depleting community liquidity, and the token hitting all-time lows. \n\nOdilitime defended the project stating the migration from ai16z to elizaos was necessary for rebranding and multichain accessibility. He clarified that the token's primary utility includes being the accepted currency in their products, gas fees for Jeju, and buy-back mechanisms from credit card rail revenue. However, community members expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of concrete utility beyond Jeju gas fees.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How to bridge & migrate ElizaOS tokens from ETH chain when liquidity went zero? (asked by Sarthak) A: Check the migration channel for instructions (answered by MDMnvest)\n\nQ: Is your question regarding swaps on eth facing slippage or is it a migration question? (asked by Kenk) A: It's about 98% loss when converting ElizaOS tokens back to ETH or USDT (answered by Sarthak)\n\nQ: How to fix \"Cannot find module '@elizaos/plugin-web-search'\" error after plugin installation? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: Edit the project's package.json to include proper module resolution, try installing with bun (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Are the wallets holding 40% of the supply known and do they have a vesting schedule? (asked by Jayzen) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Why did team get 40% when it is open source after the 1:10 token increase? (asked by averma) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Why should anyone buy elizaos token? (asked by gby) A: Token is the currency accepted in products including gas for Jeju, with credit card revenue going into buy backs (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Why did hyperscape and babylon get their own tokens instead of using elizaos token? (asked by g) A: They're on-chain tokens for the currency in those games (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What is the actual use case for the token beyond Jeju gas fees? (asked by gby) A: Currency accepted in products, gas for Jeju, and buy-back mechanisms from credit card rails (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Why was the migration from ai16z to elizaos necessary? (asked by gby) A: Had to rebrand the token and wanted to go multichain for easier access (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion and primarily focuses on business sustainability and philosophical commentary about crypto/AI infrastructure. \n\nThe only concrete business information shared was regarding operational runway: Shaw previously stated the team has 8 months of operating costs remaining. DannyNOR expressed concern about whether these funds are held in stablecoins versus volatile crypto assets, with Broccolex suggesting based on chart performance that funds may not be in stables.\n\nThe remainder of the conversation consists of DorianD's sarcastic commentary on the current state of crypto markets and centralized AI infrastructure. He sarcastically suggests people are abandoning trustless systems for traditional banking, preferring legal contracts over smart contracts, and accepting centralized AI servers despite privacy concerns. DorianD speculates that government agencies like the NSA likely have operatives at major AI companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, XAI) to modify model weights for political influence. Odilitime briefly agreed that sovereignty will be an important issue going forward.\n\nNo technical implementations, code discussions, or concrete decisions were made in this segment.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered around three main technical topics:\n\n**Plugin Development**: Odilitime is actively updating the plugin-local-ai for easy embeddings integration, working on a development branch. He shared experiences using Claude Sonnet 4.5 versus Opus, noting Sonnet is adequate for smaller tasks but Opus is preferred for larger projects.\n\n**Eliza vs Clawdbot Comparison**: A significant technical discussion emerged comparing ElizaOS to Clawdbot. Key distinctions identified: Eliza functions as a multi-agent system while Clawdbot operates as a personal assistant with social media, calendar access, and voice interface. DorianD highlighted Eliza's lack of mobile footprint as a gap that should be addressed. The conversation revealed Clawdbot users face API fee issues and Anthropic bans for non-human user TOS violations when using subscription plans.\n\n**Moltbook and Agent Integration Strategy**: DorianD introduced Moltbook (described as \"Reddit for agents\") and proposed a strategic integration plan. The concept involves getting Moltbot users (running on Mac Minis) to migrate to the Jeju network when they encounter high API costs. The technical architecture would involve running Moltbot, Eliza, and Claude together, then networking Moltbot into Jeju for storage nodes, cron jobs, and other services. Security concerns were raised about exposed IPs and unencrypted communications on non-secure hardware enclaves, with mentions of potential side-channel attacks.\n\nThe discussion also touched on the broader observation that users enjoy watching agents perform tasks, and there's potential for agents to become network resource contributors rather than just passive holders.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What is the difference between Eliza and Clawdbot? (asked by kira) A: Eliza is more of a multi-agent system while Clawdbot is more like a personal assistant with access to socials and calendar (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Why is there hype around Clawdbot when Eliza has been doing this for over a year? (asked by kira) A: The difference is in architecture - Clawdbot focuses on personal assistant features with voice interface and mobile presence that Eliza lacks (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Can you use subscription plans with Moltbot? (asked by DorianD) A: No, people are getting banned by Anthropic for non-human user TOS violations (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Is the inference running on the Mac Mini for Moltbot? (asked by DorianD) A: No, at least not for the ones writing modifications to their codebase (answered by DorianD)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe discussion primarily focused on migration issues from ai16z to elizaos tokens and security concerns around scam attempts. Multiple users reported problems with the migration portal at migrate.elizafoundation.ai, with some wallets showing \"0 eligible\" despite holding tokens since late 2024. Odilitime confirmed the migration tool should work automatically and suggested checking if tokens were in LP, different wallets, or purchased after snapshot date.\n\nA critical security incident occurred when coolart reported being hacked after generating a ticket, with funds stolen from Phantom and Metamask wallets. Odilitime and other moderators repeatedly warned that official support never DMs users - all DM requests are scammers. FeRhaT_@ also reported receiving friend requests from supposed \"ticket support team\" members.\n\nTechnical discussions included DorianD explaining Jeju's staking mechanism for service providers (compute, data storage nodes), currently using ETH as placeholder in the repo. The staking requirement applies to various node services. DorianD recommended searching the Jeju repo for *.md files for documentation.\n\nToken utility concerns were raised by Taco and averma, questioning investor value and use cases. averma suggested implementing transaction mechanisms similar to Virtuals' bonding curve within ElizaOS. Odilitime responded that using elizaos as the main token wasn't technically feasible due to excessive work required, preferring the airdrop approach.\n\nPrivacy and decentralization concerns emerged from yojo questioning ElizaOS's independence, citing the privacy policy and USA-based operations. DorianD defended the project as \"an open systems network for everything agents need to run.\" Odilitime acknowledged communication challenges, stating \"we're doing big brain stuff and people just don't get it\" and need to simplify explanations once users can interact with the product.\n\nTechnical issues included jaistklaas reporting 429 \"Too many requests\" errors on the migration page even after IP reset, occurring before wallet connection. TonKLa experienced similar \"0 eligible\" issues migrating from Solflare wallet.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Where should I go if the migration tool doesn't work?

Summary\n\nThe channel discussion covered two main technical areas: framework comparisons and ElizaCloud integration issues.\n\n**Framework Discussion**: The conversation began with comparing Clawd/Claude framework to Eliza. Key observations were that Clawd's success stems from focusing on non-crypto users and the Moltbook integration, with agents creating \"skills\" and posting to ClawHub. DigitalDiva noted Clawd's appeal is its ability to use computers with any LLM, attracting non-crypto audiences, while ElizaOS remains crypto-focused. YogaFlame mentioned that crypto features in Eliza resulted from community requests and noted \"openclaw\" updates coming in 2 weeks with better security.\n\n**ElizaCloud Integration Issues**: DorianD attempted to connect an OpenClaw agent to ElizaCloud MCP app and encountered critical server-side bugs. The agent reported authentication success but failed due to an isomorphic-dompurify module loading error - a CommonJS/ESM compatibility issue in ElizaCloud deployment. Additional errors included contentModerationService function failures in the A2A message/send endpoint. DorianD requested documentation for the a2a protocol, which 0xbbjoker provided (https://www.dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a). DorianD also inquired about CLI login using API tokens instead of browser authentication.\n\n**Security Incident**: A significant portion involved Risto being targeted by a scammer impersonating Eliza support, requesting Ledger seed phrases for token migration. Maff || Hourglass ⌛ successfully intervened and prevented the scam. The actual issue was Risto's inability to migrate ai16z tokens stored on Ledger wallet during snapshot time.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centers on strategic positioning of Eliza and moltbots within gaming platforms, specifically Babylon and Hyperscape. User 's' provides historical context about Eliza's evolution, noting that initial deployment (agent on X, Twitch integration, ETH wallet) gained no traction until Truth Terminal's success created market awareness. The team now sees a clear value proposition: positioning as \"a game your moltbot can play\" and \"like moltbot but on your phone and secure.\"\n\nThe core technical decision involves deploying Babylon (a social media platform for agents with profile pictures and personalities) into TEE (Trusted Execution Environment). Agent Joshua emphasizes Babylon's potential for agents to develop public narratives, alignments, and disagreements that could drive rapid growth. The team discusses prioritizing this over the Jeju project.\n\nA critical technical concern raised by puncar involves the timing of TEE deployment. The recommendation is to run parallel workstreams - continue developing the game engine outside TEE for easier fine-tuning while simultaneously preparing TEE integration, then switching when ready. This prevents premature deployment that could complicate iteration.\n\nThe team identifies a 3-month hype cycle window, with additional momentum expected from Claude 5 release. The strategic focus shifts toward rapid deployment of Babylon as the right product for current market conditions, with \"eliza the app\" positioned as a consumer-friendly alternative to complex setups requiring Mac minis.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Should we prioritize Babylon/TEE deployment over Jeju? (asked by s) A: Yes, the team should discuss with Phala team about fast-tracking this focus and getting the game in TEE ASAP (answered by s)\n\nQ: What do you think about putting the game to TEE timing?

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on several technical and community concerns regarding ElizaOS. Key technical developments included Odilitime creating a new plugin-cskills repository for ElizaOS, learning from openclaw's implementation. He also published a babylon skill on clawhub to enable openclaw integration with their products and is working on getting agents into moltbook for exposure.\n\nA significant technical question arose about migrating tokens across networks, with Odilitime suggesting Chainlink's Transporter as a starting point. The conversation revealed that ElizaOS agents now have shell access to users' computers and API keys for personal services, representing an evolution from previous \"agent worlds.\"\n\nCommunity concerns dominated much of the discussion. Users criticized elizacloud.ai for being launched in an unfit beta state. Multiple complaints emerged about the development approach, with averma criticizing half-completed code releases on GitHub and lack of token utility integration. The ElizaOS Cloud platform was noted to accept only cash or crypto payments through third-party integration, with no token use case, raising concerns about the token's purpose.\n\nTransparency issues were highlighted regarding team wallets and token allocation. Questions arose about the 40% supply assigned to the team after the ai16z to eliza token swap, vesting schedules, and whether team members or projects had dumped tokens. Users reported that rugcheck flagged ElizaOS as a red flag project, though Odilitime explained this tool is designed for meme coins rather than corporate tokens.\n\nThe team's runway was disclosed as 6-8 months, independent of elizaOS token value. Technical infrastructure discussions included whether ElizaOS and openclaw require VM or dedicated computer deployment, with confirmation that both can run on VMs or old computers. Skills from clawhub can be downloaded and integrated into ElizaOS.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Any good docs on migrating these tokens to other networks? I want try hopping chains (asked by Skinny) A: Transporter by chainlink might be a good starting place (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Hi my $ai16z balance does not show up in the migration portal? Can anyone help? (asked by single-celled organism) A: Redirected to another channel (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: Are the team wallets known? Correct me if I'm wrong but they assigned 40% of the supply to themselves when they increased the supply after the swap from the ai16z token to the eliza token? (asked by Jayzen) A: That is vested - and not all 40% will go to team, but team should disclose current supply and any sales (answered by averma)\n\nQ: Are there any other good solana token analysis tools besides rugcheck? (asked by Odilitime) A: I don't think so (answered by averma)\n\nQ: So it looks like ppl can download any skill from clawhub and integrate it into elizaos. Like with openclaw you would want it on VM or old computer, would this need the same?

They note that Echo currently appears to have limited investor interest and express hope the team is pursuing OTC deals to continue development.\n\nThe conversation shifts to broader market dynamics, referencing an \"All-In\" podcast discussion about consumer trust preferences. The key technical/strategic tension identified is between centralized AI services (Google) versus decentralized, open-source agent solutions. Krippトメア observes that while they personally prefer privacy-focused open-source tools, mainstream users tend to trust established corporations with their data.\n\nThe discussion concludes with speculation about the competitive landscape between traditional corporate AI (constrained by terms of service, regulations, and profit pressures) versus open-source crypto alternatives. Krippトメア expresses confidence that open source will eventually catch up technologically, supported by \"rebel techno capital,\" but acknowledges the persistent challenge of mainstream user adoption and setup complexity.\n\nNo concrete technical implementations, code solutions, or specific development decisions were discussed in this segment.\n\n## 2.

DorianD encountered issues with API key creation, discovering that ElizaCloud requires a payment method (credit card) even for accounts with free credits. The bot attempted to create API keys but failed due to missing payment information and disabled x402 payment functionality on the free tier.\n\nDorianD experimented with using OpenClaw bot to create agents and MCP apps, switching from Opus 4.5 to Kimi 2.5 API (via OpenRouter) due to high costs. The conversation touched on the need for L2 infrastructure where nodes could donate compute to Eliza for operations, suggesting this should be added to the protocol.\n\nTechnical discussions included comparisons between different AI social media approaches. Xeno noted that \"AI social media\" concepts aren't new, referencing MUGEN Engine as a pre-LLM example. The emphasis was on Babylon's financial layer as meaningful progress, arguing that LLMs need real-world stakes to be considered genuine advancement beyond existing tools like Moltbook.\n\nA key pain point identified was the requirement for agents to use credit cards for API access, which DorianD argued is impractical. The suggestion was made to allow bots to create test API keys and enable direct credit account top-ups via x402 payments instead of traditional payment methods.\n\nOdilitime mentioned that EliAos has had task functionality since version 1.x, questioning the need to waste credits on redundant implementations.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on three main topics: agent usability, elizacloud.ai technical issues, and visual generation limitations.\n\n**Agent Installation and Behavior**: DorianD discussed user adoption challenges, noting that high installation effort deterred users. They praised agents that \"relentlessly try to do stuff\" as more desirable than those requiring extensive setup, emphasizing the value of agents that work autonomously and persistently.\n\n**ElizaCloud.ai Login Issue**: yojo reported a critical account access problem where their agent disappeared from the dashboard after using two different email formats for the same Proton account ('x@proton.me' vs 'x@protonmail.com'). They suspected this created duplicate accounts, causing the original agent to become inaccessible.\n\n**Visual Generation Consistency Problem**: yojo identified a significant limitation in elizacloud.ai's image generation system - the inability to maintain visual consistency across multiple generations. When requesting modifications to generated images (e.g., same character in different contexts or removing accessories), the system regenerates entirely new visuals instead of preserving character features. This forces users to spend excessive time on prompt engineering or switch to external graphic AI tools, breaking workflow continuity for storytelling and branding use cases.\n\n**Solution Discussion**: DorianD suggested these visual consistency features should be implemented as apps built by agents or third-party developers, recommending LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models as an existing solution for maintaining visual consistency.\n\nInferX posted a recruitment/portfolio message detailing their experience with autonomous agents, healthcare AI, decision support systems, and conversational AI across various tech stacks.\n\n## 2.

Stan shared a Vercel blog post about agents.md outperforming skills in evaluations, while Odilitime introduced the GAP (GitHub Actions Protocol) project. \n\nThe core technical problem identified was that skills weren't being triggered reliably - in 56% of evaluation cases, skills were never invoked even when agents had access to documentation. R0am highlighted this issue and shared a working solution: a UserPromptSubmit hook that forces explicit skill evaluation through a mandatory three-step activation sequence. This approach requires the agent to: 1) Evaluate each skill with YES/NO reasoning, 2) Immediately activate relevant skills using the Skill() tool, and 3) Only proceed with implementation after completing the activation step.\n\nR0am noted this solution makes conversations \"a bit weird but it works\" and compared the approach to similar logic used by Composio and Zapier MCP.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on comparing ElizaOS with Openclaw framework and preparing for Babylon.market internal launch. R0am demonstrated Openclaw's capabilities by building an agent using local RAG MCP with book content, praising its smooth CLI deployment on VPS. Odilitime provided critical analysis of Openclaw, noting it excels at UX and self-modifying loops but burns tokens constantly and lacks ability to build complex projects. He positioned ElizaOS as business-focused versus Openclaw's personal assistant approach, acknowledging both frameworks are trending toward autonomy.\n\nSam reported significant progress integrating OAuth functionality for X.com, Github, Slack, and Linear into Eliza app chat, with Notion next on the roadmap. The architecture made adding integrations easy, though obtaining credentials and setting up redirect URIs was time-consuming. Stan clarified that dynamic providers and skill.md are functionally the same, with providers being well-typed. He mentioned the cskill plugin work would enable absorbing Openclaw capabilities, and Shaw's 2.0 includes native agentskills.\n\nBorko issued a critical directive demanding focus on revenue-generating products, expressing frustration about losing the race to competitors while building products that don't matter. He challenged the team to show concrete results from Spartan development.\n\nThe session concluded with s announcing Babylon.market's internal launch, requiring all team members to sign up, share IDs for whitelisting, and test for 2-3 hours with detailed feedback. Multiple team members reported being stuck during initial testing, with issues around Farcaster login and infinite loading spinners when switching networks.\n\n## 2.

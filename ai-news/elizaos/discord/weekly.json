Summary\n\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion, focusing primarily on community sentiment around token price performance and investment philosophy. The most substantive technical mention was **DorianD** expressing desire for \"the network\" to launch, specifically wanting to run nodes from Puerto Rico with plans for physical infrastructure including server racks and automated security systems.\n\n**Alexei** provided the only significant educational content, explaining Quantitative Easing (QE) cycles and their impact on crypto markets. He noted that QE restarted in December after years of contraction, which had negatively impacted altcoins. He explained that increased liquidity typically causes asset prices to rise, citing the Russell index (tradfi micro caps) hitting ATH as an indicator for potential crypto market movement in coming months.\n\nThe discussion revealed community concerns about token sustainability, with **Alexei** drawing parallels to past projects where teams sold tokens to cover operational costs until liquidity dried up. He acknowledged the current token chart \"not looking good\" but maintained x100 potential if the project survives.\n\n**Error P015-A** and **DorianD** debated investment psychology, with Error P015-A advocating for long-term diversification strategies and thick-skinned approach to volatility. The consensus emerged that only BTC and ETH qualify as true investments, while most altcoins are speculative/gambling due to excessive supply and insufficient liquidity.\n\nTwo developers (**! Alex !** and **aicodeflow**) offered their services for project development work.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is youtoy an elizaos-backed project? (asked by elizafan222) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Does anyone here have a project idea or need a developer? (asked by ! Alex !) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: What is a QE cycle?

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on two main technical topics: AI-powered Telegram moderation and Eliza ecosystem development.\n\n**Telegram Moderation Bot**: ElBru shared details about an Eliza-based Telegram moderation bot called \"Solimp\" that automatically manages spam and scam content. The bot implements an exponential timeout system starting at 60 seconds for first offenses, doubling with each subsequent violation (120s, 240s, etc.). The system uses muting rather than banning, allowing users to learn acceptable behavior. ElBru reported one year of active learning, monitoring, and refinement, with effectiveness varying by group. For SterlingOS, the bot performs perfectly with minimal false positives. The moderation approach includes manual review capabilities where admins can unmute users and repost legitimate content if needed. Users reportedly accept occasional false positives in exchange for a clean channel environment.\n\n**Eliza Development Updates**: The conversation touched on several development initiatives. Version 1.7.2 was released (linked by cjft). Jin announced plans to revive \"jintern\" with improved data pipelines, MCP integration, and better models for enhanced effectiveness. Jin also promoted the Eliza knowledge repository for developers building agents to serve the Eliza ecosystem. ElizaBAO discussed building community features directly into applications rather than relying on external platforms, though this remained conceptual without technical implementation details.\n\nA brief mention of a Rust port was made, with Mike D. inquiring about its location, though no response was provided in this segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Do elizaos have plugin like community? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: Not directly answered, but ElBru offered a Telegram moderation bot solution (answered by ElBru)\n\nQ: How does the Telegram mod bot work? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: Deletes spam/scam and mutes offenders with exponential timeout increases per offense (answered by ElBru)\n\nQ: How do you know if the bot gets false positives? (asked by DorianD) A: One year of active learning, monitoring and refinement; depends on the group, some get too many false positives (answered by ElBru)\n\nQ: Is there opportunity for banned users to explain themselves? (asked by DorianD) A: Bot uses muting not banning; first offense 60s timeout, second 120s, third 240s etc.; admin can unmute and repost if content was acceptable (answered by ElBru)\n\nQ: Where is the Rust port mentioned? (asked by Mike D.) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: What's your opinion on eliza agentic? (asked by velja) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

The only substantive technical content involves Odilitime reviewing pull request #6286 from the elizaOS/eliza repository. Odilitime expressed concerns about the implementation approach in the PR, suggesting it \"feels wrong\" in its current form. The specific critique focused on the need to review the complete runtime file and recommended that the implementation should be refactored to use an `ensureEntities` function that accepts a list rather than the current approach. This suggests the PR may be handling entity operations in a suboptimal way, possibly processing entities individually rather than in batch. No resolution or further discussion of the technical issue occurred within this chat segment, as the conversation was interrupted by ziflie indicating they were temporarily unavailable.\n\n## 2.

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on concerns about the elizaOS token migration, tokenomics, and the project's technical direction. Key technical topics included:\n\n**Token Migration & Concerns**: The ai16z to elizaOS migration was discussed extensively. DorianD explained the migration was necessary because the daos.fun contract was closed source, not auditable, and wouldn't be accepted by major exchanges like Coinbase. The migration created ecosystem funds and liquidity tokens. However, multiple users (gby, Broccolex) expressed frustration that the token feels disconnected from the project's roadmap with no clear tokenomics.\n\n**Jeju Network Integration**: DorianD identified Jeju Network as the primary technical use case, where Shaw is making commits and has demonstrated ElizaOS working in Rust (likely a prerequisite). The Jeju documentation mentions 60+ onchain \"actions\" requiring gas fees paid in elizaOS tokens. However, the timeline is latter half of 2025, making it feel distant to investors.\n\n**ElizaCloud Buybacks**: Alexei mentioned Shaw discussed utility including profits from ElizaCloud and other sources doing token buybacks, similar to Binance's BNB model. Broccolex noted this would be a turning point when confirmed.\n\n**Communication Issues**: A recurring theme was poor messaging and lack of a comprehensive whitepaper. DorianD noted the project is \"upgrading the train while carrying passengers\" unlike Bitcoin/Ethereum which launched with whitepapers. The Jeju documentation exists but was \"vibe generated\" and lacks the polish needed to attract serious investors.\n\n**Technical Development**: M I A M I demonstrated \"agentic onboarding\" - migrating a Twitter profile to \"space\" (sentient space platform) with a single prompt. DorianD observed Shaw focusing on helping developers use ElizaOS to launch projects, which is important but confusing for investors.\n\nThe consensus was that while technical development continues (evidenced by commits), the disconnect between development and token utility is causing market issues and team misalignment risks.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is there any update for degenai? (asked by Jack) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: What does \"to space\" mean in this context? (asked by DorianD) A: sentient space is the platform, short form is space, users are called spacers (answered by M I A M I)\n\nQ: When are we actually going to see the tokenomics for elizaOS? (asked by gby) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: What exactly are we supposed to base our investment on if the team doesn't care about token price? (asked by gby) A: Hope dreams and desires; Shaw mentioned utility including ElizaCloud buybacks (answered by DorianD and Alexei)\n\nQ: Why was ai16z migrated to elizaOS? (asked by gby) A: The daos.fun contract was closed source, not auditable, and wouldn't be accepted by exchanges like Coinbase; migration also created ecosystem funds and liquidity tokens (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Are there any actual use cases for this token besides paying gas fees in Jeju? (asked by gby) A: Jeju network for agent execution, 60+ onchain actions requiring gas fees, ElizaCloud buybacks mentioned (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Is the migration still open? (asked by gnars) A: Yes if you bought before the snapshot (answered by Arceon)\n\nQ: Is there an article on how to do the migration? (asked by gnars) A: Read from the website or X (answered by Never Broke Again)\n\nQ: Is the elizatown code opensourced anywhere?

Jin identified two key areas for agent improvement: reducing anxiety/chattiness and minimizing hallucinations. DorianD proposed a technical solution for better message context handling - providing the LLM with the last 20 chat messages to help determine if messages are directed at the agent, another entity, or are general messages, allowing the agent to decide if inference costs are justified for responses. There was uncertainty whether this entity tracking functionality already exists in the codebase, though DorianD noted seeing similar behavior for X (Twitter) users.\n\nOdilitime discussed a \"swarm\" deployment - a large elizaOS instance running multiple bots on a single server for Babylon's Discord, offering cost savings when agents share the same environment. Jin expressed interest in trying Eliza Cloud instead, with Odilitime noting plans to eventually integrate swarm technology into the cloud platform.\n\nElBru raised an important question about cost transparency, requesting a cost calculator for elizaOS to help developers estimate running costs for agents with specific plugin configurations. DigitalDiva mentioned experiencing an unspecified problem that multiple solutions failed to resolve, seeking help from the community.\n\n## 2.

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 🥇-partners\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on critical communication and token utility issues facing the ai16z/ElizaOS project. Community partners expressed frustration over a 70% token price decline and lack of clear messaging about token utility and roadmap direction. The core complaint was that the team's \"build, don't talk about the token\" approach is being interpreted as disinterest in token development, creating zero demand.\n\nKenk (team member) initially defended the team, stating a roadmap exists and token economy work is ongoing, but this led to heated exchanges. Partners argued the roadmap messaging is ineffective - people can't articulate why to buy the token. DorianD emphasized the team lacks vision communication skills common in successful crypto projects (comparing to Satoshi/Vitalik), noting they're \"web2 guys\" slow to understand crypto network utility.\n\nOdilitime (team member) engaged constructively later, acknowledging the roadmap has \"trust me bro\" elements they can't yet disclose, and that execution/communication need improvement. Key technical discussion emerged around the project path: Framework → Cloud → Jeju, with timeline estimates (2024/2025 for framework, 2025/2026 for cloud, 2026/2027 for Jeju launch).\n\nDorianD proposed concrete solutions: establish research.elizaos.ai blog for thought leadership content showcasing experiments and technical work, position core devs as industry thought leaders beyond just developers, create regular technical updates that non-devs can understand. The team agreed to explore this direction, with Dr. Neuro volunteering to create visual explanations of the framework-to-Jeju progression.\n\nThe conversation highlighted fundamental tension between long-term technical development and immediate investor expectations, with partners demanding clearer value propositions and more frequent, substantive communication.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What is the current roadmap and why can't people find it? (asked by Broccolex) A: A public roadmap exists but the issue is discovery and how it's messaged, not lack of communication. The team is working on token economy but will communicate when ready. (answered by Kenk)\n\nQ: Why should anyone buy/hold ElizaOS token right now? (asked by DannyNOR NoFapArc) A: This is too subjective; what exists isn't \"dressed up enough\" and most people sleep on it. The real value isn't clear because investors need to watch Shaw's streams to understand the vision. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is the roadmap content the problem or how it's being messaged? (asked by Odilitime) A: Both - the roadmap could be laid out better and is missing vision/importance aspects. The \"more to come\" sections put the project in \"trust us bro\" category. (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Can charts be led by comms? (asked by Odilitime) A: Comms is used for expectations management especially if there are execution issues. It goes hand in hand with execution. (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Should we put out comms to lower expectations or focus on fixing execution? (asked by Odilitime) A: It's a balancing act - both execution and managing expectations matter, calling a target in the future and hitting it. (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: What is the project progression path? (asked by Odilitime) A: Framework => Cloud => Jeju, with framework in 2024/2025, cloud in 2025/2026, and Jeju initial launch likely in 2026 with ongoing development through 2027. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: How does investing in this make returns? (asked by Odilitime) A: Unanswered directly, but discussion shifted to how the project helps people access capital and invest in ideas.\n\n## 3.

The primary technical problem involved Discord plugin compatibility and PostgreSQL database configuration issues. DigitalDiva encountered problems after upgrading from version 1.6.5, experiencing Discord plugin failures and PostgreSQL migration errors. The solution involved updating to elizaos 1.7.2 with plugin-discord 1.3.7 and performing a fresh database installation after dropping the existing instance.\n\nA significant database migration error occurred where the system was searching for PGLite instead of PostgreSQL despite proper configuration. The error manifested during table creation for the \"worlds\" table with UUID and JSONB fields. The resolution required version migration and database reset since the system had conflicting database adapter references.\n\nThirtieth provided a project update on pivoting from a Polymarket agent to a support agent named \"Hank\" that successfully handled its first high-level support request for a scientific research tool. Future plans include building marketing and sales agents with automated LinkedIn and email campaigns.\n\nAdditional discussions included recommendations for Remotion as a video generation tool, questions about integrating the Polymarket plugin into elizacloud agents, and a request for collaboration on a TCG (Trading Card Game) project needing UI/visual assistance with card generation uniformity issues.\n\n## 2.

Multiple users encountered problems migrating AI16Z tokens to the new contract, with the most significant case involving a user (ryanb.btc) who transferred tokens from Robinhood wallet (which lacks dapp browser functionality) to another wallet, causing migration eligibility issues. Kenk from support successfully resolved this through the ticketing system.\n\nA critical security incident was identified when Jeburek12 reported being asked to send AI16Z tokens to a wallet address for migration. Kenk confirmed this was a scam attempt, clarifying that legitimate migration doesn't require sending tokens to external addresses since migration contracts are capped.\n\nCommunity sentiment showed frustration with project direction. DannyNOR NoFapArc and Jayzen criticized the team for launching multiple tokens instead of focusing on core infrastructure, with Jayzen specifically noting concerns about \"scatterbrained decision-making\" and spreading resources thin over tokens not directly tied to the underlying platform.\n\nTechnical contributions emerged with Momo announcing work on an RLM plugin for Eliza v2 after discussions with Shaw, marking their first major open-source contribution despite finding it challenging.\n\nQuestions arose about related projects: Malombres asked about Agent Scarlett's status, and velja repeatedly questioned a Hyperscape token funded by Shaw's wallet, though this remained unaddressed. The Three Words expressed concerns about ElizaOS's low liquidity (110k LP) on Solana.\n\nElizaBAO organized a video creator competition for ElizaBAO content involving ElizaOS and Polymarket. Kenk advised structuring it as a clear challenge with bounties, acknowledging content creation as a skilled, time-intensive task.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Who migrated successfully?

The discussion included using iPhones with 8GB RAM to provide compute cycles when devices are idle (90%+ battery). Chucknorris suggested using ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proofs) to prevent cheating, though DorianD questioned implementation feasibility on consumer devices, noting only one Bittensor subnet (Omron) currently uses ZKP with limited commercial scalability.\n\nAdditional discussions covered Claude Opus 4.5 subscription comparisons, with Chucknorris criticizing Google's Antigravity offering as inferior to Windsurf due to quota limitations and performance issues.\n\n## 2.

Summary\n\nThis brief discussion focused on comparing Second Life and Roblox as historical case studies for understanding virtual world platforms, specifically in the context of applying lessons to \"hyperscape\" development. DorianD initiated the conversation by noting both platforms launched around the same time approximately 20 years ago, suggesting their successes and failures could inform current development efforts.\n\nThe key technical observation centered on Roblox's business model paradox: despite generating billions in revenue and maintaining hundreds of millions of monthly active users (reportedly 380M MAU), the platform remains unprofitable. DorianD noted skepticism about the accuracy of these user metrics, suggesting significant inflation from duplicate accounts and bot activity.\n\nOdilitime characterized Roblox as a \"jobs program,\" highlighting concerns about the platform's economic model and its reliance on user-generated content creation. The discussion touched on the ethical implications of platforms that depend heavily on unpaid or minimally compensated user labor for content creation.\n\nWhile brief, the conversation raised important considerations for virtual world platform design: sustainability of business models that rely on massive scale, the accuracy and reliability of user metrics, and the economic relationship between platforms and content creators.\n\n## 2.

          "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThis chat segment primarily focused on a critical token launch crisis involving improper tokenomics. The core issue was that cjft launched a token with 75% of supply bundled/held by the developer, which violates current crypto meta standards and creates rug pull concerns.\n\nShaw provided urgent guidance on token launch best practices, emphasizing that developers should NEVER sell tokens directly due to tracking and community backlash. The proper model relies on 2% creator fees from trading volume rather than selling held tokens. Shaw reported making $80k in fees this week from a token someone else launched, demonstrating the fee-based model's viability.\n\nKey technical points:\n- Developers holding large token percentages triggers immediate community distrust and bot dumping\n- Modern token meta requires burning excess supply (70% recommended) rather than locking\n- Creator fees (2%) provide sustainable revenue without selling\n- Selling even 1 token marks the chart with \"dev sold\" and kills the token\n- Wallet tracking makes all developer transactions visible to bots\n\nThe resolution involved cjft burning 70% of tokens using sol-incinerator.com, exporting private keys from bags.fm wallet to Phantom wallet for the burn transaction. Sayonara provided technical assistance with the burning process.\n\nAdditional technical note: Jin identified an API issue where GitHub API for elizaOS repos shows a 7-month-old .cursor repository, suggesting repository cleanup needed.\n\nMinor mentions: Cursor now supports parallel agents feature.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What should developers do with tokens instead of selling? (asked by shaw) A: Take 30% of fees for buybacks when token dips, keep rest for cloud/otaku pumps, do burns on app milestones like signups (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: What happens if developers sell tokens? (asked by shaw) A: Wallet is tracked, all bots dump immediately, token dies (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Should tokens be locked or burned? (asked by cjft) A: Burn them, don't lock unless they burn (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: How much should be burned from the 75% supply?

The main technical point discussed was the **Migration Agent** implementation, which uses **Claude Sonnet** as the underlying model, noted for well-structured responses and human-like emoji interactions in context.\n\nThe chat was dominated by controversy around a **GOLD token launch** associated with Hyperscape. Community members identified suspicious activity including a 40% dev wallet, insider trading patterns with wallets funded 3 days prior, and approximately $150k extracted through coordinated early entries. The launch followed a pattern of silence during speculation followed by CA confirmation after price movement.\n\n**CJFT token** was confirmed as official by Odilitime, with the creator engaging in content creation including YouToy integration and live streaming.\n\nCommunity frustration emerged regarding the **ai16z project**, with one member reporting losses from $28k to $800, criticizing the team for building multiple projects without focusing on monetization and user acquisition. Concerns were raised about lack of clarity on how new projects translate to value for Eliza OS holders, with calls for focus on **Eliza Cloud** as a resource-intensive priority.\n\n**ElizaBAO** promoted a video content competition and hackathon participation requiring 10% token holdings. A **BAGS token** was also mentioned as a creator token for ElizaOS projects, though details remained unclear.\n\nThe technical discussion was minimal, overshadowed by token speculation and community concerns about project direction and insider trading practices.\n\n## 2.

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 🥇-partners\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel discussion covered three main topics: airdrop tax optimization strategies, Hyperfy platform sunset announcement, and a token launch issue.\n\n**Hyperfy Platform Sunset**: Hyperfy announced the shutdown of their legacy hyperfy.io hosted platform on April 1st, 2026. The platform has transitioned to a fully open-source, self-hosted model. World NFT holders already received $HYPER token airdrops, completing the transition from the NFT-based platform model. The open-source repository remains actively developed, and users can self-host or use providers like hyperworld.host.\n\n**Airdrop Tax Optimization Discussion**: DorianD proposed a technical solution to avoid tax implications on airdrops. Instead of distributing tokens directly to individual wallets (which triggers 1099 income tax), tokens would be sent to a single smart contract. This contract would use a price oracle to automatically buy and burn ElizaOS tokens based on a predetermined supply curve as the airdropped token appreciates. The approach avoids individual tax events and creates long-term alignment. DorianD emphasized the contract must be immutable (no admin permissions) and potentially deployed from a favorable tax jurisdiction. The concept differs from bond desk functionality, which operates as a vesting contract with delayed purchases at discounted rates.\n\n**Token Launch Issue**: Shaw announced an official pump.fun token launch intended to airdrop a percentage to ElizaOS holders. However, the launch encountered critical issues with liquidity pool management that \"rekt\" the token supply. Shaw clarified this was a \"gold presale\" token, not the main Hyperscape token, which will have fixed tokenomics and won't launch on pump.fun. Community members expressed concern about attention dilution across multiple tokens.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How does the bond desk agent work? (asked by DorianD) A: It has a purchase with a delay that's negotiated, with a discount proportional to the delay - essentially a vesting contract (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What's the cap for airdrop? (asked by DannyNOR NoFapArc) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is this the main Hyperscape token? (asked by implied context) A: No, this is a gold presale token - the main Hyperscape token won't be a pump.fun launch and will have fixed tokenomics (answered by shaw)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe channel focused on three main technical discussions:\n\n**DaVinci Resolve AI Integration Project**: Irie_Rubz initiated development of a DaVinci Resolve MCP integration (https://github.com/AyeRubz/davinci-resolve-mcp) despite being a new coder. The project aims to automate video editing tasks including timeline imports, effects, text animations, transitions, and audio management in Fairlight. PatoVeloso, a professional Resolve user, suggested two approaches: using transcription features to create trimmed sequences from longer content, and adding AI video transformation capabilities (e.g., converting real action to Pixar-style animation). Key limitation identified: DaVinci has restricted API allocations preventing fully autonomous features. Alternative platforms like Adobe Premiere Pro were discussed but dismissed due to subscription costs.\n\n**Eliza CLI Version Migration Issues**: YogaFlame encountered persistent version conflicts when updating from 1.6.5 to 1.7.2, experiencing SQL migration failures and bootstrap errors with the Discord plugin. 0xbbjoker provided systematic troubleshooting: clearing cache with `bun pm cache rm`, uninstalling/reinstalling CLI globally, and removing node_modules/bun.lock files. The issue stemmed from cached package.json references to 1.6.5. Solution involved either manually updating package.json to 1.7.2 or creating a fresh project. Bootstrap issues were confirmed fixed in elizaos 1.7.2 and discord plugin 1.3.8.\n\n**Clawd.bot Discussion**: DorianD shared clawd.bot project, which gained attention for running on Mac minis with local models and featuring Meta Raybans integration for price comparison functionality.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How do I add the DaVinci Resolve integration to Eliza AI agents? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Should I integrate with Eliza now or wait until the project is working?

          "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 🥇-partners\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centers on a critical strategic debate about ElizaOS's tokenomics and ecosystem development approach. The core tension involves whether the team should launch separate tokens for ecosystem projects (like Hyperscape game) versus focusing exclusively on the main $elizaos token.\n\n**Key Context:** ElizaOS has a $20M market cap with 8 months runway remaining. Shaw reveals the team is resource-constrained, with no budget to fund Hyperscape development from existing Cloud and Babylon allocations. Babylon has 375k users, and cloud apps are launching soon.\n\n**Strategic Decision:** The team launched a separate \"gold\" token for Hyperscape (a RuneScape-like crypto game built on Eliza agents) via a Pump.fun hackathon to fund development. This token serves as in-game currency with specific utility. Shaw is on a 2-week MVP schedule with the Hyperscape team.\n\n**Community Concerns:** Members argue this approach dilutes attention from the main token, damages reputation, and reduces confidence in the ecosystem. They cite Vitalik's approach of never launching tokens beyond ETH and only advising projects. Suggestions include: airdrops to elizaOS holders, token pairing requirements (like Virtuals ecosystem), or grants-based funding instead of team-launched tokens.\n\n**Alternative Proposals:** DorianD suggests technical integration where game items/agents trigger $elizaos burns or network fees, creating actual utility linkage. The proposal emphasizes that every in-game action requiring LLM compute or storage should involve platform fees in $elizaos, similar to how EVM requires the underlying network.\n\n**Critical Outcome:** Shaw expresses frustration with community negativity, noting he made $400k a year ago, held $200k in tokens that declined significantly, never sold, and now faces resource constraints and tax obligations. He threatens to leave the server due to ongoing drama around ecosystem development decisions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is there an airdrop of gold for elizaOS holders? (asked by Odilitime) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Why launch coins for everything instead of focusing on singular $elizaos token? (asked by mawnst3r) A: Shaw explained they have $20M market cap with 8 months runway, no budget to fund Hyperscape from existing allocations, so separate token launches fund development of games built on Eliza framework (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Has Vitalik ever launched any other coin besides ETH? (asked by sayitaintso25) A: No, and he's reluctant to even endorse tokens in the ETH ecosystem (answered by sayitaintso25)\n\nQ: Do you want buybacks or airdrops? (asked by shaw) A: Community suggested airdrops to elizaOS holders or token pairing requirements, but no consensus reached (answered by community discussion)\n\nQ: Has anyone else built a framework and then incubated a whole ecosystem of apps and games on it? (asked by shaw) A: Implied comparison to Ethereum ecosystem, but no direct answer provided (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Why is full attention aimed at a game nobody asked for? (asked by Broccolex) A: Shaw explained Hyperscape is built by separate team on Eliza agents, funded via token launch due to budget constraints (answered by shaw)\n\n## 3.

There was brief discussion about Claude Code integration with Eliza.\n\n**Security Issues**: A scam attempt was identified involving a \"Create A Ticket\" bot that requested wallet addresses from users. SATA reported receiving a suspicious link after posting questions in the channel. Odilitime confirmed this was a scam operation, likely using automated astroturfing tactics.\n\n**Other Topics**: DorianD discussed potential monetization strategies involving phone OS integration and data collection for AI training.

Summary\n\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion, consisting primarily of casual greetings and brief commentary about tokens and market conditions. The only substantive technical question raised was by Alexei asking whether various tokens have any impact on ElizaOS or operate independently - this question went unanswered. \n\nSkinny raised an important product question about Eliza agent use cases, specifically wondering why there aren't more specialized, single-purpose agents being deployed despite the framework's availability. This suggests potential concerns about adoption barriers or unclear value propositions for developers.\n\nThere was brief discussion about $STUDIO token, with The Void and MDMnvest expressing confidence in its longevity based on developer activity and an endorsement from someone named Shaw. However, no technical details were provided.\n\nMo 1990 suggested the team should implement a token buyback program, which Skinny countered by suggesting resources might be better allocated elsewhere, though no specific alternatives were discussed.\n\nA user asked about Eliza Town having a separate Discord channel, which was clarified by Never Broke Again that this is the appropriate channel.\n\nThe overall technical content was extremely limited, with most messages being greetings or off-topic commentary about RuneScape bonds and market performance observations.\n\n## 2.

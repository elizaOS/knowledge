There's mention that DegenSpartan AI operates on a similar model. The conversation also includes a suggestion to expand elizaOS Agent marketplace to Base blockchain while simultaneously launching on Solana to capitalize on market momentum. Jin notes that degenspartanai and elizaos are already on Base and multiple other blockchains. A music producer offers their services for an upcoming 3D TV show. Finally, there's a warning about a potential scam involving Aiora, with claims of non-functioning services and abandoned communication channels.\n\n## 2.

Summary:\nThe conversation primarily revolves around the future development of DegenAI and its potential integration with the Eliza framework. Community members, particularly tigerguo, expressed interest in understanding how these two products might merge to create a \"super agent\" with enhanced capabilities. There are concerns about the lack of communication between developers and the community regarding roadmap, tokenomics, and future plans. Rhota, who appears to be a new organizer working alongside Skely, mentioned they're taking a step back to create brand guidelines based on Degen's lore and requested community interviews. However, tigerguo emphasized that the community cares more about product features and tokenomics than character design and branding. Specific feature requests include Web3 industry tools like token analysis, blockchain transactions via voice commands, and optimized LP yield pool information.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: I would like to know if the features from the Eliza framework will be integrated into DegenAI, making it a super agent? (asked by tigerguo.)

Shaw shared a draft announcement about a significant tokenomics update where the DAO plans to use its treasury assets (valued at $15-30M) to create one-sided liquidity pools paired with their own token. This approach aims to generate buy pressure and provide liquidity for partner tokens while avoiding direct selling of treasury assets. Community members generally responded positively to this strategy. Other discussions included mentions of Virtuals' Solana announcement, Shaw's presentation at a Solana event in Istanbul (referenced as \"Catstanbul\"), and brief exchanges about various crypto projects including Tribe (a social finance app on Solana). The channel also contains reminders about contributing to the \"awesome-eliza\" GitHub repository and occasional sharing of crypto-related news and videos.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe discussion focused on developing tokenomics for ai16z/ElizaOS with emphasis on creating sustainable value accrual mechanisms. Jin and timshel outlined a vision centered on \"attention/code/capital\" as the core pillars for token value growth. The conversation explored multiple potential revenue models including: agent marketplace fees, investment strategies (where ai16z could function as a tier-1 investor in startups), launchpad services, and revenue sharing mechanisms. \n\nSeveral participants expressed concerns about the saturated launchpad space, questioning differentiation strategies. DorianD advocated for simpler tokenomics rather than complex staking/voting mechanisms, preferring practical use cases like agents paying for TrustDB data or services. Timshel proposed an innovative approach where ai16z could function as a venture capital entity (aixVC) with 100,000+ partners/supporters, potentially gaining access to tier-1 investment deals.\n\nThe group debated integration strategies with existing platforms like pump.fun versus building proprietary solutions with revenue sharing. DorianD suggested a novel mechanism where agents could distribute tokens to users who provide valuable interactions, potentially creating engagement incentives while improving agent data quality.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How will ai16z differentiate in the saturated launchpad space? (asked by bong49) A: By offering Solana agents with 50+ plugins and focusing on new users rather than expecting projects to port over (answered by DorianD)\nQ: What are the core components for growing ai16z token value? (asked by timshel) A: Attention (proliferating ElizaOS usage), Code (improving ElizaOS functionality), and Capital (value accrual to treasury) (answered by timshel)\nQ: Could ai16z function as a tier-1 investor alongside traditional VCs? (asked by timshel) A: It's possible if leveraging the community of 100,000+ partners who could support portfolio companies, though likely would need connections like a16z for deal flow (answered by mat)\nQ: How is the progress of the token economy model and when is the planned launch date?

This strategy aims to create continuous buy pressure on AI16Z while providing liquidity for partner tokens. The chat also covered discussions about DeepSeek's AI models and their impact on the AI industry, with avirtualfuture noting that DeepSeek models are pressuring the industry and changing competitive dynamics. Partners expressed concerns about AI16Z's price performance, with some discussing market cycles and potential catalysts for growth. There were mentions of upcoming features including a launchpad, which was described as \"imminent\" and will be a no-code platform. Additionally, discussions touched on the potential for an AI16Z/Eliza sovereign chain or L1/L2 solution, though no concrete plans were confirmed.\n\n## 2.

There are two versions of the aggregator being discussed: an existing one with bugs showing errors like \"Unable to generate summary for Freytes\" and a new one hosted at github.com/bozp-pzob/ai-news that includes additional features like market summaries. The team is working on transitioning to the new aggregator but faces issues with it not uploading new JSONs. They need someone to host the aggregator on a persistent server to provide daily JSON updates at a consistent URL. There's also discussion about AI personalities for characters named Shaw, Eliza, Degen Sparan, Peepo, and Cyborg Marc. The team is considering different delivery formats (pre-rendered cutscene video vs. in-browser embedded playback) and needs to decide which approach to take.

The conversation primarily consists of casual greetings, off-topic discussions, and some contentious exchanges. There was a brief mention of a token migration issue, though no details were provided. A user asked about using Perplexity Sonar-Pro as an LLM but received limited response. A Korean user inquired about exchanging ai16z tokens following a potential delisting notice from Bithumb exchange, and was directed to another channel. The chat also included discussions about cryptocurrency price movements, particularly comparing Pippin and Eliza tokens. Several users shared links to external content and GIFs. Overall, the channel lacked substantive technical content or problem-solving during this period.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to officially exchange the ai16z token purchased before the 11th? (asked by 거북알) A: Check <#1425417640071139358> (answered by MDMnvest)\nQ: I've been looking for a way to use perplexity sonar-pro as my LLM but can't seem to find anything, could someone point me to the right direction (asked by cryptorixh) A: Does it have an OpenAI interface or openrouter? (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: What do you think are the chances that the same thing happens to us as to Pippin and other AIs that are far exceeding expectations? (asked by Juanma) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Several users reported foreign key constraint errors when creating memories, particularly with the latest versions of these plugins. Stan mentioned working on a fix and migration guide for these database issues. There was also discussion about API options for cryptocurrency data (Dexscreener, CoinGecko, DeFiLlama, Codex) and integration with Perplexity's Sonar-Pro LLM through plugin-openai or plugin-openrouter by adjusting environment variables. A user reported issues with the Twitter plugin not processing replies properly. Additionally, there was brief mention of Mem0 for memories and a potential benchmark analytics dashboard for crypto AI infrastructure.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Are there good API alternatives to Dexscreener for cryptocurrency data? (asked by Skelzor) A: CoinGecko, DeFiLlama, and Codex are options depending on budget, with many having public endpoints (answered by jin)\nQ: How can I fix the foreign key constraint error with plugin-sql and plugin-twitter? (asked by soyrubio) A: Stan is working on a fix and migration guide (answered by sayonara)\nQ: Where can I find the plugin-sql implementation?

(asked by MemeBroker) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can I use Perplexity Sonar-Pro as my LLM? (asked by cryptorixh) A: Use plugin-openai or plugin-openrouter and change the environment variables to point to Perplexity's server (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Why does the Twitter plugin show \"No text content in response, skipping tweet reply\" for every reply? (asked by Nico) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

The conversation revolves entirely around a Polymarket advertisement that uses a 50 Cent song. DorianD shares the ad and explains its cultural significance, particularly how the lyrics about FBI raids relate to Polymarket's history with government intervention. DorianD interprets the marketing strategy as targeting sports bettors and African American crypto users who might identify with government scrutiny. Odilitime initially questions the song choice but later acknowledges missing context. The conversation includes speculation about 50 Cent possibly being an investor and mentions Polymarket launching sports markets in the USA.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: \"core-devs\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion centers on critical security vulnerabilities discovered in elizaOS. Jin conducted a security audit using Claude skills and found that the server doesn't require ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN, allowing attackers to extract secrets via API endpoints. The vulnerability stems from process.env being dumped into unencrypted settings instead of encrypted settings.secrets. Stan identified that the issue was introduced in version 1.6.4 and fixed in 1.6.5-alpha.8 via commit a1941c6. Additional vulnerabilities were found in the current monorepo that still need fixing. The team discussed making authentication mandatory by default with explicit opt-out for development environments. Shaw mentioned deploying Jeju testnet with cross-chain liquidity pools (xlp) that allow using elizaOS tokens as gas across multiple chains (Base, BSC, OP, Arb, ETH) without bridging. The conversation also touched on agentic security audits for Babylon and the potential of using Claude for code security reviews.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How can the security vulnerability in elizaOS be exploited? (asked by jin) A: By accessing API endpoints without authentication to extract secrets - curl commands can dump all agent secrets (answered by jin)\nQ: When was the security bug introduced and fixed? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Introduced in 1.6.4 and fixed in 1.6.5-alpha.8 (answered by Stan ⚡)\nQ: Should SECRET_SALT and AUTH_TOKEN be mandatory at startup? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: In production, if salt is blank, it should throw an error (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: What is Jeju testnet? (implied by context) A: A system for cross-chain liquidity pools that allows using elizaOS tokens as gas across multiple chains without bridging (answered by shaw)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💬-discussion Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered heavily on the ai16z to ELIZA token migration crisis, particularly affecting Korean users on Bithumb exchange. Korean holders expressed frustration over Bithumb's delayed migration support for tokens held before the November 11th snapshot. Team member jasyn_bjorn assured users that anyone holding ai16z before November 11th (on-chain or CEX) would be fine and that they're working on a solution with Bithumb, though Odilitime stated \"our hands are tied, it's all in bithumb's hands.\"\n\nA significant controversy erupted when jasyn_bjorn made then deleted statements about CEX token accumulation and dumping. User degenwtf challenged the team about not burning swapped ai16z tokens, claiming they were sold on the market. jasyn_bjorn provided the migrator wallet address (B2aBAMAhCqUVZD66Vy2Bij87k5C117BB1a1C7iabt74J) and stated all ~300m ai16z from migrated user tokens are accounted for, though questions remained about 180m tokens. The team clarified they never stated migration would be a burn.\n\nPrice concerns dominated discussion with continuous downward pressure. Users questioned why old tokens weren't burned and whether the team dumped tokens on the community. The migration wallet showed only 122 million ai16z versus 1.1 billion supply, raising transparency questions. Multiple users reported receiving scam DMs offering fake migration support.\n\nTechnical help focused on migration mechanics, with users asking how to migrate from SafePal wallets. The solution was to import SafePal seed phrases into Phantom or other Solana wallets to complete migration. Users were consistently directed to migration-specific channels for detailed support.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How can Korean users on Bithumb exchange their ai16z tokens purchased before the 11th? (asked by 거북알) A: Anyone with ai16z before November 11th either onchain or on a CEX will be fine, working on a solution with Bithumb (answered by jasyn_bjorn)\n\nQ: Why isn't Bithumb announcing migration details and making Koreans wait so long? (asked by syanel4859) A: Don't know the reasoning of their messaging to customers, hands are tied as it's in Bithumb's control (answered by jasyn_bjorn and Odilitime)\n\nQ: How long do Koreans have to wait for Bithumb migration? (asked by syanel4859) A: Wish I knew, every other exchange has no problem working with us (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Why weren't the old ai16z tokens burned after migration? (asked by averma) A: We never alluded to migration being a burn, all ~300m ai16z from users migrated tokens are accounted for (answered by jasyn_bjorn)\n\nQ: Did the team sell the swapped ai16z on the market? (asked by degenwtf) A: Provided migrator wallet address showing token accounting, stated all migrated tokens accounted for (answered by jasyn_bjorn)\n\nQ: Where is the 180m tokens from the migration?

(asked by 거북알) A: Market is junk, everyone whining vs promoting upcoming launches, looking to future not today's prices (answered by MDMnvest)\n\nQ: Why does the transfer wallet only show 122 million ai16z when supply was 1.1 billion? (asked by averma) A: Team should confirm officially if they dumped old tokens (answered by averma, not resolved)\n\nQ: Does the team hold 10% of tokens after migration? (asked by hildi) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

The primary discussion centered on **plugin-sql database errors** when using plugin-twitter with PostgreSQL. Users encountered foreign key constraint violations (`memories_entityId_entities_id_fk`) when creating memories. Stan confirmed he's working on a fix and migration guide that started the previous day.\n\n**Database connectivity issues** were prevalent, with multiple users experiencing problems with both pglite and PostgreSQL configurations. Sayonara recommended switching from pglite to PostgreSQL for stability, as pglite can crash when multiple browser windows are open. The solution involved adding POSTGRES_URL to .env files or using the `elizaos create -t project` command with proper environment variable prefixes.\n\n**LLM integration** was discussed regarding Perplexity Sonar-Pro usage. Odilitime provided a solution using plugin-openai or plugin-openrouter by modifying OPENAI_API_URL environment variables to point to Perplexity's server. Similar guidance was given for DeepSeek integration, where users can use the OpenAI plugin with modified endpoint URLs instead of requiring OpenRouter keys.\n\n**Build and deployment issues** were addressed with Redvoid announcing a TypeScript fix PR that resolves build issues in the latest ElizaOS version, which also fixes SQL errors with plugin-twitter. Redvoid also mentioned developing a client-twitter version using login/password authentication without API requirements.\n\n**Twitter plugin problems** included Nico reporting that the Twitter plugin fails to reply to tweets, showing \"No text content in response, skipping tweet reply\" warnings repeatedly. This issue remained unresolved in the discussion.\n\nAdditional topics included API alternatives for cryptocurrency data (CoinGecko, DeFiLlama, Codex), Mem0 for memory management, and Starknet plugin recommendations.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What API alternatives exist for cryptocurrency data similar to Dexscreener? (asked by Skelzor) A: CoinGecko, DeFiLlama, and Codex are available options with public endpoints that can satisfy various needs depending on budget (answered by jin)\n\nQ: How to fix the foreign key constraint error \"memories_entityId_entities_id_fk\" with plugin-sql and plugin-twitter? (asked by soyrubio) A: Stan is working on a fix and migration guide, started yesterday, with documentation updates coming (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Where is the plugin-sql repository located? (asked by soyrubio) A: It's located at https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/develop/packages/plugin-sql (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Has anyone used Mem0 for memories? (asked by MemeBroker) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Why does the Twitter plugin show \"No text content in response, skipping tweet reply\" and never reply? (asked by Nico) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: How to use Perplexity Sonar-Pro as the LLM? (asked by cryptorixh) A: Use plugin-openai or plugin-openrouter and change env vars, specifically OPENAI_API_URL to point at Perplexity's server, then set model to sonar-pro (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Should I use pglite or PostgreSQL for ElizaOS? (asked by FenrirFawks) A: Try PostgreSQL instead of pglite, as pglite can crash when multiple browsers/windows are open (answered by sayonara)\n\nQ: How to configure PostgreSQL with ElizaOS? (asked by FenrirFawks) A: Add postgres url to .env or create with \"elizaos create -t project\" and prefix start command with POSTGRES_URL=your-postgres-url (answered by sayonara)\n\nQ: Are database tables created automatically during migrations? (asked by LordWeb3) A: Yes, tables are created by default during migrations (answered by sayonara)\n\nQ: How to use DeepSeek key instead of OpenRouter key? (asked by LordWeb3) A: Use the OpenAI plugin by replacing the endpoint URL, check https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai (answered by sayonara)\n\n## 3.

The conversation is entirely focused on analyzing a Polymarket advertisement that uses an AI-generated cover of 50 Cent's \"Many Men\" song. \n\nDorianD provides marketing and cultural analysis of the advertisement, explaining the strategic choice of using this particular song in the context of Polymarket's FBI raid and their launch of sports betting markets in the USA. The discussion centers on the advertisement's messaging, target demographic (sports bettors, hip-hop listeners, African American crypto users), and how the lyrics relate to Polymarket's legal challenges. DorianD notes the ad references the FBI raid on Polymarket's founder and positions the platform as something \"the government tried to kill,\" creating identification with audiences who have had negative government interactions.\n\nOdilitime initially questions the song choice but later acknowledges missing the historical context, recognizing the ad targets Polymarket's existing fan base rather than the general public. The conversation includes speculation that 50 Cent may be an investor and discussion of AI voice technology used to create the cover version.\n\nNo technical implementations, code discussions, architectural decisions, or development tasks were discussed in this segment.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\n**Critical Security Vulnerabilities Discovered:**\nJin conducted an agentic security audit of elizaOS using Claude skills and a pentest squad, uncovering a critical authentication vulnerability. The CLI wizard doesn't prompt for ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN, leaving the server vulnerable to secret extraction via unauthenticated API endpoints. Jin demonstrated how attackers could retrieve agent IDs and extract all secrets including private keys and API tokens through simple curl commands.\n\n**Vulnerability Investigation and Resolution:**\nStan and sayonara traced the vulnerability back through versions, discovering it affected versions 1.6.4 through 1.6.5-alpha.8. The root cause was process.env being dumped into unencrypted settings instead of encrypted settings.secrets. Stan identified he introduced this bug 2.5 weeks before fixing it in commit a1941c643bd904fbca7890296af0d1f8b8f67ee1. The otaku deployment was actively exposing raw private keys and OpenAI keys on the public internet before sayonara's emergency fix.\n\n**Security Architecture Decisions:**\nThe team discussed mandatory authentication requirements. Odilitime clarified that settings should be stripped from the /agent/ endpoint, AUTH_TOKEN should fall back on SECRET_SALT if blank, and SECRET_SALT should throw errors in production if blank. Stan committed to moving secrets from /agent/ to system endpoints and handling remaining vulnerabilities in his database PR.\n\n**Monorepo Stability Work:**\nStan spent significant time fixing broken types, tests, and missing try/catch blocks after Shaw's cleanup (\"deslop\"). He restored log retrieval over WebSocket after pino removal and prepared PR #6218 to unblock other work. The client build was found to be bloated with unnecessary syntax highlighting for languages like COBOL, Fortran, and PHP, with mermaid charts alone consuming 2.6MB minified.\n\n**Jeju Testnet and Cross-Chain Infrastructure:**\nShaw deployed Jeju testnet with cross-chain liquidity pools (xlp) that enable using tokens without bridging. Users can utilize elizaOS tokens from Base, BSC, OP, Arb, or ETH as gas on Jeju. Shaw is deploying nodes for major L2s to eliminate RPC dependencies and building a 24/7 red team application called Crucible for continuous security testing.\n\n**Additional Security Findings:**\nJin identified new React vulnerabilities (denial-of-service and source code exposure in React Server Components) requiring updates. The team discussed using devcontainers and isolated environments for security testing, with shaw using Cloudflare containers for red team operations.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How can attackers steal secrets from elizaOS? (asked by jin) A: By querying unauthenticated API endpoints - first get agent IDs from /api/agents, then extract secrets from /api/agents/{id}. One-liner provided to dump all secrets. (answered by jin)\n\nQ: Should authentication be mandatory by default? (asked by jin) A: Yes, recommend mandatory authentication with explicit opt-out for development environments. (answered by jin)\n\nQ: When was the secrets exposure vulnerability introduced and fixed? (asked by sayonara) A: Introduced in version 1.6.4, affected all versions until 1.6.5-alpha.8, fixed in commit a1941c643bd904fbca7890296af0d1f8b8f67ee1. (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: What was the root cause of the vulnerability? (asked by sayonara) A: process.env was being stored in settings (unencrypted) in addition to settings.secrets, causing raw private keys and API keys to be exposed. (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Are secrets encrypted in the database? (asked by sayonara) A: Yes, AES-256-CBC encryption on character.settings.secrets and character.secrets, but settings directly is not encrypted. (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: What is the default SECRET_SALT value? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: \"secretsalt\" by default if not provided, which is a security concern. (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Should we force SECRET_SALT and AUTH_TOKEN at startup? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: AUTH_TOKEN should fall back on salt if blank, and in production, if salt is blank it should throw an error. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Where should secrets be exposed in the API? (asked by Odilitime) A: Only in one place in system/env/local, not in /agent/ endpoint. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: How does Jeju testnet work without bridging? (asked by Borko) A: If you have elizaOS in your wallet on base, bsc, op, arb or eth it can use your elizaOS as gas through cross-chain liquidity pools (xlp). (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: What is the staging endpoint for Babylon? (asked by jin) A: staging.babylon.market (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Did the Babylon repo move? (asked by jin) A: Yes, it's now at https://github.com/BabylonSocial/babylon (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Why are providers slowing down with pglite? (asked by Odilitime) A: Likely due to data collection stuffing too much data OR too much parallel processing causing IO contention, reporting 900ms vs normal <10ms. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Has anyone used the tool shared in the tweet? (asked by sayonara) A: Yes, used it back in college days. (answered by sam-developer)\n\n## 3.

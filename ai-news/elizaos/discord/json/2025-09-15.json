One user mentioned seeing ElizaOS running in a browser window with a local model, but this wasn't elaborated on. Most conversation centered around the AI16Z token, with users questioning its relationship to the ElizaOS project and discussing its price movements. New users joined asking about the project's purpose, with one brief explanation that it's \"a framework for building autonomous AI agents.\" The chat contains several GIFs, price commentary, and users introducing themselves, but lacks substantive technical discussions, problem-solving, or implementation details.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for üí¨-coders\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on technical discussions about the Anthropic plugin for ElizaOS, specifically regarding model limitations and configuration. Users discussed how to configure the plugin to use Claude Opus 4 instead of being limited to Claude 3.5 Sonnet. The conversation revealed that proper environment variable configuration allows using more advanced models. There was also a brief discussion about Discord bot permissions, specifically preventing agents from DMing users, with a suggestion to modify permissions in the Discord bot dashboard or use channel whitelisting. Additionally, community members shared resources about documentation best practices and mentioned upcoming workshops about AI agents with ElizaOS focused on DAO treasury management automation.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there a reason the anthropic plugin only supports up to 3.5 sonnet? (asked by Stealt‚ÑèyNinja.ADSC) A: You should be able to change the model through the .env variables (answered by 0xbbjoker)\nQ: Is it possible to not let agent with discord plugin to dm users? (asked by Behfar | Chrono Games) A: Should be able to turn that permission off in your discord bot dashboard. Also, CHANNEL_IDS might help as you can whitelist channels where agent operates (answered by Stealt‚ÑèyNinja.ADSC and 0xbbjoker)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: \"core-devs\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on browser compatibility for Eliza plugins. CJFT shared progress on making plugins work in browser environments by leveraging the \"browser\" field in package.json to provide bundler-friendly options. This approach allows the same PGLite instance that runs in Node.js to work in browsers without logical code changes. Developers can now explicitly specify imports from \"@elizaos/core/browser\" or \"@elizaos/core/node\", with the default \"@elizaos/core\" resolving based on the bundler's preference. Additionally, Eliza plugins can now be written directly in React components. There was also discussion about Eliza Cloud development, with Sam-developer reporting that the MVP v1 is nearly complete, featuring a core flow of signup ‚Üí API key + free credit ‚Üí CLI login ‚Üí request handling ‚Üí usage logging. Some issues were noted with hot reloading in the dev command and client functionality. Stan worked on resolving PR conflicts, and there was brief mention of Meta's Ray-Ban display glasses.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How is browser compatibility being implemented for plugins? (implied from cjft's explanation) A: Using the \"browser\" field in package.json to provide bundler-friendly options without logical code changes to plugins like plugin-sql (answered by cjft)\nQ: Can Eliza plugins be written in React components? (implied from cjft's statement) A: Yes, plugins can now be written directly in React components (answered by cjft)\nQ: What's the status of Eliza Cloud?

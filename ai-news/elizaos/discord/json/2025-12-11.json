      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around issues with the ELIZA token migration, particularly focusing on problems with the Bithumb exchange in Korea. Korean users express frustration about being unable to migrate their AI16Z tokens to ELIZA, with Bithumb apparently delaying the process. Team members (jasyn_bjorn and Odilitime) respond that they're working on a solution but that \"hands are tied\" as they wait for Bithumb. There's significant concern about the continuous price decline of ELIZA, with some users questioning whether the team sold migrated AI16Z tokens instead of burning them. The team defends their migration process, sharing a link to the migrator wallet, but some users remain skeptical about the handling of the 1.1 billion token supply. Several users also ask about how to migrate their tokens from various wallets, with concerns about scammers sending DMs pretending to offer migration support. The overall sentiment shows frustration with the migration process, price decline, and perceived lack of transparency.\n\n## 2.

Stan reported fixing critical issues in the monorepo following Shaw's cleanup work, which had broken types, tests, and missing try/catch blocks. Stan's PR #6218 was ready to merge, which would unblock other PRs. Stan also fixed log retrieval over WebSocket that was falling back to HTTP after pino removal. There was discussion about the size of the ElizaOS client build, with Odilitime noting large JavaScript files for syntax highlighting and mermaid charts (2.6MB minified). Odilitime reported performance issues with pglite in their swarm environment, with response times increasing from 10ms to 900ms, potentially due to data volume or I/O contention. Jin shared information about the Strix project and noted React security vulnerabilities. The Babylon repository location was confirmed to have moved to a new GitHub location.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on concerns about the elizaOS token migration, tokenomics, and the project's technical direction. Key technical topics included:\n\n**Token Migration & Concerns**: The ai16z to elizaOS migration was discussed extensively. DorianD explained the migration was necessary because the daos.fun contract was closed source, not auditable, and wouldn't be accepted by major exchanges like Coinbase. The migration created ecosystem funds and liquidity tokens. However, multiple users (gby, Broccolex) expressed frustration that the token feels disconnected from the project's roadmap with no clear tokenomics.\n\n**Jeju Network Integration**: DorianD identified Jeju Network as the primary technical use case, where Shaw is making commits and has demonstrated ElizaOS working in Rust (likely a prerequisite). The Jeju documentation mentions 60+ onchain \"actions\" requiring gas fees paid in elizaOS tokens. However, the timeline is latter half of 2025, making it feel distant to investors.\n\n**ElizaCloud Buybacks**: Alexei mentioned Shaw discussed utility including profits from ElizaCloud and other sources doing token buybacks, similar to Binance's BNB model. Broccolex noted this would be a turning point when confirmed.\n\n**Communication Issues**: A recurring theme was poor messaging and lack of a comprehensive whitepaper. DorianD noted the project is \"upgrading the train while carrying passengers\" unlike Bitcoin/Ethereum which launched with whitepapers. The Jeju documentation exists but was \"vibe generated\" and lacks the polish needed to attract serious investors.\n\n**Technical Development**: M I A M I demonstrated \"agentic onboarding\" - migrating a Twitter profile to \"space\" (sentient space platform) with a single prompt. DorianD observed Shaw focusing on helping developers use ElizaOS to launch projects, which is important but confusing for investors.\n\nThe consensus was that while technical development continues (evidenced by commits), the disconnect between development and token utility is causing market issues and team misalignment risks.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is there any update for degenai? (asked by Jack) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: What does \"to space\" mean in this context? (asked by DorianD) A: sentient space is the platform, short form is space, users are called spacers (answered by M I A M I)\n\nQ: When are we actually going to see the tokenomics for elizaOS? (asked by gby) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: What exactly are we supposed to base our investment on if the team doesn't care about token price? (asked by gby) A: Hope dreams and desires; Shaw mentioned utility including ElizaCloud buybacks (answered by DorianD and Alexei)\n\nQ: Why was ai16z migrated to elizaOS? (asked by gby) A: The daos.fun contract was closed source, not auditable, and wouldn't be accepted by exchanges like Coinbase; migration also created ecosystem funds and liquidity tokens (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Are there any actual use cases for this token besides paying gas fees in Jeju? (asked by gby) A: Jeju network for agent execution, 60+ onchain actions requiring gas fees, ElizaCloud buybacks mentioned (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Is the migration still open?

Jin identified two key areas for agent improvement: reducing anxiety/chattiness and minimizing hallucinations. DorianD proposed a technical solution for better message context handling - providing the LLM with the last 20 chat messages to help determine if messages are directed at the agent, another entity, or are general messages, allowing the agent to decide if inference costs are justified for responses. There was uncertainty whether this entity tracking functionality already exists in the codebase, though DorianD noted seeing similar behavior for X (Twitter) users.\n\nOdilitime discussed a \"swarm\" deployment - a large elizaOS instance running multiple bots on a single server for Babylon's Discord, offering cost savings when agents share the same environment. Jin expressed interest in trying Eliza Cloud instead, with Odilitime noting plans to eventually integrate swarm technology into the cloud platform.\n\nElBru raised an important question about cost transparency, requesting a cost calculator for elizaOS to help developers estimate running costs for agents with specific plugin configurations. DigitalDiva mentioned experiencing an unspecified problem that multiple solutions failed to resolve, seeking help from the community.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Could elizaos somewhere have a cost calculator to know running costs for agents with specific plugins? (asked by ElBru) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is the swarm a way to Ralph wiggum QA testing? (asked by jin) A: No, it's a big elizaOS instance on a server running all bots for Babylon's discord (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What was your solution to the problem? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 🥇-partners\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on critical communication and token utility issues facing the ai16z/ElizaOS project. Community partners expressed frustration over a 70% token price decline and lack of clear messaging about token utility and roadmap direction. The core complaint was that the team's \"build, don't talk about the token\" approach is being interpreted as disinterest in token development, creating zero demand.\n\nKenk (team member) initially defended the team, stating a roadmap exists and token economy work is ongoing, but this led to heated exchanges. Partners argued the roadmap messaging is ineffective - people can't articulate why to buy the token. DorianD emphasized the team lacks vision communication skills common in successful crypto projects (comparing to Satoshi/Vitalik), noting they're \"web2 guys\" slow to understand crypto network utility.\n\nOdilitime (team member) engaged constructively later, acknowledging the roadmap has \"trust me bro\" elements they can't yet disclose, and that execution/communication need improvement. Key technical discussion emerged around the project path: Framework → Cloud → Jeju, with timeline estimates (2024/2025 for framework, 2025/2026 for cloud, 2026/2027 for Jeju launch).\n\nDorianD proposed concrete solutions: establish research.elizaos.ai blog for thought leadership content showcasing experiments and technical work, position core devs as industry thought leaders beyond just developers, create regular technical updates that non-devs can understand. The team agreed to explore this direction, with Dr. Neuro volunteering to create visual explanations of the framework-to-Jeju progression.\n\nThe conversation highlighted fundamental tension between long-term technical development and immediate investor expectations, with partners demanding clearer value propositions and more frequent, substantive communication.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What is the current roadmap and why can't people find it? (asked by Broccolex) A: A public roadmap exists but the issue is discovery and how it's messaged, not lack of communication. The team is working on token economy but will communicate when ready. (answered by Kenk)\n\nQ: Why should anyone buy/hold ElizaOS token right now? (asked by DannyNOR NoFapArc) A: This is too subjective; what exists isn't \"dressed up enough\" and most people sleep on it. The real value isn't clear because investors need to watch Shaw's streams to understand the vision. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is the roadmap content the problem or how it's being messaged? (asked by Odilitime) A: Both - the roadmap could be laid out better and is missing vision/importance aspects. The \"more to come\" sections put the project in \"trust us bro\" category. (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Can charts be led by comms? (asked by Odilitime) A: Comms is used for expectations management especially if there are execution issues. It goes hand in hand with execution. (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Should we put out comms to lower expectations or focus on fixing execution? (asked by Odilitime) A: It's a balancing act - both execution and managing expectations matter, calling a target in the future and hitting it. (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: What is the project progression path? (asked by Odilitime) A: Framework => Cloud => Jeju, with framework in 2024/2025, cloud in 2025/2026, and Jeju initial launch likely in 2026 with ongoing development through 2027. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: How does investing in this make returns? (asked by Odilitime) A: Unanswered directly, but discussion shifted to how the project helps people access capital and invest in ideas.\n\n## 3.

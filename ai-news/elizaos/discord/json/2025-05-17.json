      "summary": "# Analysis of \"discussion\" Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around ElizaOS, its upcoming v2 release, and related projects in the ecosystem. Nash mentions building a custom message processor and extending the tee plugin on Solana as part of a decentralized quant investment platform. Jin demonstrates and tests a voting bot functionality within the channel, getting feedback from users like xell0x on its operation. There's significant discussion about adoption strategies, with xell0x suggesting that highlighting successful tokens from the platform (like eli5 and eddy) would drive more users to auto.fun. The community debates whether to prioritize shipping ElizaOS v2 quickly or taking more time for proper documentation. A representative from Nonbank (Professor) offers listing services, though community members express caution about exchange listings. Overall, there's anticipation for ElizaOS v2 and discussion about maintaining v1 compatibility for existing forks.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When will the COM/AI16Z Pool be released? (asked by alexius) A: Uncertain, but Osint will inquire about it (answered by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai))\nQ: What information is needed to list a token on Nonbank?

A user named techcomthanh encountered several problems: first with API configuration (discovering OpenRouter compatibility issues while OpenAI API worked), then with an agent tweeting in loops, and finally with relationship creation between users resulting in warnings about missing usernames. There was also discussion about plugin development, with techcomthanh asking about contributing a custom plugin to the official repository. Another user (starlord) shared a workaround for character configuration, mentioning that placing character configs in the root folder and using the CLI command \"elizaos start â€”char \"./character.json\" works, though with some bugs requiring manual plugin addition. An announcement about Google deprecating Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental in favor of the paid Preview endpoint was also shared.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How to configure a character in ElizaOS?

Users are speculating on ELI5's potential value increase once Eliza v2 launches, with xell0x suggesting the token is significantly undervalued at its current market cap of around 400k. According to xell0x, ELI5 will serve as the community manager AI agent for Eliza v2, which could dramatically increase its value. The conversation indicates Eliza v2 (also referred to as 1.0.0) is expected to launch \"next week\" and is described as \"massive\" with \"industry warping narrative\" potential. Users discuss the current price action of ELI5, noting some whale selling activity but also accumulation by top holders. The chat suggests that while current market sentiment is subdued, the launch of v2 could bring significant attention and price appreciation to ELI5, potentially reaching valuations comparable to DegenAI and Eliza which approached 200m market caps during v1.\n\n## 2.

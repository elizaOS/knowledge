Utsav inquires about building a public chatbot for Web3 interactions, specifically concerning authentication methods. They question whether ElizaOS-based bots require users' private keys for blockchain transactions rather than using standard Web3 authentication flows (walletconnect, metamask, etc.). Utsav expresses concern about the security implications and adoption barriers of requiring private keys. In a separate thread, passer asks about running a previous version that doesn't use the Twitter API, to which chrome responds that such implementations likely get banned quickly.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can ElizaOS-based bots work with standard web3 auth flow (rainbow, walletconnect, metamask) instead of requiring private keys? (asked by Utsav) A: Unanswered\nQ: How to make a multi-user supported bot if private keys are required? (asked by Utsav) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can the previous version that does not use the Twitter API run normally? (asked by passer) A: It gets banned quickly (answered by chrome)\n\n## 3.

The primary concern raised was about a security threat - a fake PayAI account running an airdrop scam that could potentially lead to phishing attacks, wallet drains, or seed phrase theft. A user named komi alerted the channel about this scam, providing evidence and tagging team members to take action. Kenk responded that they would inform PayAI about the situation. Additionally, there were brief mentions of token value (ai16z being described as undervalued) and a question about an upcoming migration, though no technical details were provided about either topic.\n\n## 2.

The main technical discussion revolves around a set of plugins being used (openrouter, multi-step bootstrap, plugin-relay, websearch, plugin-cdp, and coingecko) as mentioned by sayonara. There's also discussion about x402 integration, with sayonara planning to add x402 support to Eliza agent messaging. yung_algorithm shared a GitHub repository for a mosaic face filter tool developed for streaming, suggesting developers should consider building streaming capabilities into their workflow to increase visibility and community engagement. The developers also discussed the importance of creating documentation and explanations about how elizaOS fits into the ecosystem. Several Twitter/X posts were shared related to their work and the broader tech ecosystem, including confirmation of a Cursor mobile app.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Using which plugins?

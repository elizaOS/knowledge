      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel discussion centered on three main technical topics: MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration with Eliza Cloud, self-hosting options, and security concerns.\n\n**MCP Integration with Eliza Cloud**: SATA inquired about adding external MCP servers to agents created in Eliza Cloud, specifically for an AI Red Teaming agent with human-in-the-loop functionality. SOLOMON VANDY clarified that external MCP servers can be registered through the Eliza Cloud API using POST /api/v1/mcps endpoint, and once registered, Eliza can proxy calls to those MCP endpoints for agent reasoning and task execution.\n\n**Self-Hosting Discussion**: LarpsAI mentioned that users are deploying Eliza on mini PCs to avoid keeping their main systems running 24/7. A blog post was referenced about running Eliza on Oracle Cloud's free tier with 4 vCPU and 24GB RAM specifications. There was brief discussion about Claude Code integration with Eliza.\n\n**Security Issues**: A scam attempt was identified involving a \"Create A Ticket\" bot that requested wallet addresses from users. SATA reported receiving a suspicious link after posting questions in the channel. Odilitime confirmed this was a scam operation, likely using automated astroturfing tactics.\n\n**Other Topics**: DorianD discussed potential monetization strategies involving phone OS integration and data collection for AI training. ElizaBAO posted a developer hiring notice with creator rewards and Polymarket affiliate profit sharing. Kenk requested adding Eliza MCP functionality to the channel.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is it possible to give an agent created within Eliza Cloud access to an external MCP? (asked by SATA) A: You can add external MCP servers by registering them through the Eliza Cloud API using POST /api/v1/mcps, and once registered, Eliza can proxy calls to those MCP endpoints (answered by SOLOMON VANDY)\n\nQ: Can we add eliza mcp here? (asked by Kenk) A: Probably no reason why we can't (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is an AI Red Teaming agent with human in the loop possible with ElizaOS? (asked by SATA) A: External MCP servers can be registered through the API to enable this functionality (answered by SOLOMON VANDY)\n\nQ: Why would support bot need wallet address? (asked by SATA) A: It's a scam (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion and primarily consists of link sharing and casual conversation. Odilitime shared two GitHub repositories: supermemory (a memory management tool) and hindsight (by vectorize-io). The conversation briefly touched on a consultant named Vivek who has been engaging with the team through DMs and community spaces alongside Shaw and Odilitime. The main technical point of interest was Vivek's suggestion about obtaining an enterprise Twitter API key for the project. Additionally, there was a brief observation about Twitter's web platform now using shadcn (a UI component library). The chat lacks substantial technical problem-solving, implementation details, or architectural decisions. Most exchanges were informational updates about community connections and tool discoveries rather than active development work.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Who is the person doing interesting stuff? (asked by sayonara) A: Vivek, a consultant similar to aiflow who attended spaces with Shaw and Odilitime (answered by Odilitime and Kenk)\n\nQ: Is Twitter using shadcn on its web now?

Summary\n\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion, consisting primarily of casual greetings and brief commentary about tokens and market conditions. The only substantive technical question raised was by Alexei asking whether various tokens have any impact on ElizaOS or operate independently - this question went unanswered. \n\nSkinny raised an important product question about Eliza agent use cases, specifically wondering why there aren't more specialized, single-purpose agents being deployed despite the framework's availability. This suggests potential concerns about adoption barriers or unclear value propositions for developers.\n\nThere was brief discussion about $STUDIO token, with The Void and MDMnvest expressing confidence in its longevity based on developer activity and an endorsement from someone named Shaw. However, no technical details were provided.\n\nMo 1990 suggested the team should implement a token buyback program, which Skinny countered by suggesting resources might be better allocated elsewhere, though no specific alternatives were discussed.\n\nA user asked about Eliza Town having a separate Discord channel, which was clarified by Never Broke Again that this is the appropriate channel.\n\nThe overall technical content was extremely limited, with most messages being greetings or off-topic commentary about RuneScape bonds and market performance observations.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Does anybody know if all these tokens have any impact on ElizaOS or they are fully independent? (asked by Alexei) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Does Eliza Town have its own Discord channel?

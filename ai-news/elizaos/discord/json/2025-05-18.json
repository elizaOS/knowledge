Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around Eliza's development roadmap, particularly the relationship between Eliza V1, V2, and ElizaOS. Users are seeking clarification on version differences, with xell0x explaining that V1 was a proof of concept while V2 (referred to as Eliza 1.0.0) is the upcoming main release with \"the sauce.\" There's significant discussion about liquidity pools, specifically regarding a potential COM/AI16Z pool that was announced but details remain unclear. osintmao9 shares insights on DeFi liquidity strategy, suggesting it might be better to strengthen the existing COM/SOL pool ($328k liquidity) rather than splitting liquidity across multiple pools. Community members also discuss \"THE COUNCIL\" tagline options and the potential roles of community-created bots like eli5 and eddy in the ecosystem. Shaw appears to be live coding, suggesting active development is ongoing.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is elizaOS 1.0 same as Eliza v2?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»-coders Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around users trying to set up and troubleshoot Eliza agents, particularly for Twitter integration and Discord connectivity. Several users encountered issues with the Twitter plugin not automatically posting tweets, requiring manual instructions instead. There were also challenges with Ollama integration, Supabase connectivity, and Discord bot setup. Users shared environment configurations, error messages, and screenshots while seeking help. A key technical discussion involved the difference between the eliza-starter repository and the main Eliza repository regarding automatic tweet generation. Users also discussed character imports in v2, database connectivity issues, and plugin installation problems. By the end of the chat, at least one user successfully configured their agent with RAG functionality and resolved Discord connection issues related to Opus errors by following a GitHub issue solution.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How do I get my agent to automatically tweet without manual instructions?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for Channel \"fun\"\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment primarily discusses Eliza's upcoming release, with confusion around version naming conventions. Users clarify that what was previously referred to as \"v2\" is actually being branded as \"Eliza 1.0.0\". The discussion indicates that the current version (referred to as v1) was merely a proof of concept, while the upcoming release (1.0.0/v2) represents the \"real\" Eliza that will be more powerful and relevant to the space. There's also a brief mention of \"Autofun\" not having a successful launch, with a suggestion that it needs new features, particularly no-code agent behavior extensions through plugins. The release timeframe for Eliza 1.0.0 appears to be the following week.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Any update on this? (asked by frank_grimes_sr) A: Unanswered\nQ: What's the difference between v2 and 1.0.0? (asked by traderlv) A: They're the same thing, just different names (answered by traderlv)\nQ: Why is the branding changing?

Help Interactions\nHelper: xell0x | Helpee: Nick dask | Context: Confusion about Eliza version naming | Resolution: Explained that v1 was just a proof of concept, while the upcoming release (called both v2 and 1.0.0) is the \"real\" powerful Eliza release\n\n## 4.

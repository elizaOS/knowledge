Several users, particularly Sky, expressed frustration about the difficulty in finding clear updates on ElizaOS's status and direction. Kenk, representing the team, acknowledged these concerns and mentioned recent improvements like separating builder updates from general announcements. The team is working to restore suspended X/Twitter accounts and has been active on Farcaster in the meantime. There's ongoing development of ElizaOS Cloud and V2, though specific details remain limited.

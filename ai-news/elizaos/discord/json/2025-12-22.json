Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around ElizaOS token price concerns, utility questions, and upcoming product developments. Community members express frustration about the token's declining value (down approximately 75% for some holders). Kenk, representing the team, mentions they are close to launching Eliza Cloud, an AI-assisted development tool that will make it easier to build, deploy, and manage agents. The platform will initially focus on elizaOS but will eventually open up for other agent frameworks. Omid Sa explains that the token will have utility through project airdrops (like Babylon), buybacks from Eliza Cloud revenue, and a decentralized OTC desk in development. Several members highlight the need for better communication about token utility and roadmap details. The team indicates they will be sharing wider plans and updates soon.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where can I find elizaOS tokens audit reports? (asked by zzam) A: Unanswered\nQ: What is the best route to buy? (asked by Figure) A: I use USDT on BSC in pancake swap. You can buy your gas fee for starting from a cex. (answered by Omid Sa)\nQ: Can we run our own AI agents on Eliza Cloud with our environment variables? (asked by Figure) A: It's a low-code agent builder for elizaOS. There are components that will open up for other agent frameworks, like 8004 registry. Initially it's elizaOS focused. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Were ElizaOS and AI16z two different projects before merger, OR AI16z renamed into ElizaOS?

Summary\nThe chat segment revolves around a technical issue with the Starknet plugin, specifically when creating a token through \"unruggable.\" FenrirFawks reported an error message indicating a failure to parse a String to BigInt during the DEPLOY_STARKNET_UNRUGGABLE_MEME_TOKEN action. Despite adding try-catch blocks and error logging throughout their code, they were unable to identify the source of the error. Odilitime offered assistance and requested the modified code via DM for further investigation. The conversation also briefly touched on finding ElizaOS's Twitter accounts, with links provided to both the main account (currently suspended) and alternative accounts.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "The chat segment is extremely brief, containing only comments from a single user (Rabbidfly) discussing market conditions for elizaOS. The user notes that the current price action indicates more sellers than buyers, with sellers accepting losses. They attribute this partly to poor performance across the AI crypto sector generally. Rabbidfly concludes by expressing that community members who remain have confidence in the team and upcoming technology based on their research. No technical discussions, problem-solving, or implementations were shared in this limited exchange.",

Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion, primarily consisting of shared links to research papers, blog posts, and GitHub repositories. Sam shared links to a research paper, a blog post about open tool composition, and a GitHub repository called \"automaker\". Jin proposed an idea about creating a skill to translate elizaos plugins into skills for interoperability with agentskills.io, suggesting this could be a stepping stone to adopting a TUI (Text User Interface). Jin argued against creating a new TUI, comparing it to building alternatives to desktop environments like GNOME or KDE, and instead advocated for a Linux-like composability strategy. Jin also mentioned a CVE 10 RCE (Remote Code Execution) exploit discovered in n8n. The chat included minimal interaction between participants, with most messages being announcements or shared resources rather than discussions.\n\n## 2.

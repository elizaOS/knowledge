PrudentSpartan expressed concerns about repeated delays and questioned the strategy of adding more partners instead of launching a minimal viable product. Ben explained that delays were due to additional testing and partner coordination rather than feature expansion. Jin highlighted their contributions to the Eliza ecosystem, including documentation improvements and automation tools, while encouraging more constructive community engagement. There was discussion about product development philosophy, with some members advocating for faster, iterative releases while others defended the approach of ensuring quality before launch. Shaw confirmed they're prioritizing polish and lining up quality launches rather than rushing to market. The expected launch date appears to be April 14th, though there's skepticism about meeting this deadline. Jin also mentioned work on consolidating documentation from elizaos.ai into eliza.how for easier maintenance.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why was auto.fun delayed an additional two weeks?

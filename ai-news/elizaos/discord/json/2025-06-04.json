      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»-tech-support\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on issues with Eliza's RAG capabilities, plugin integration, and version-specific problems. Users discussed transitioning from Eliza 0.x to 1.x, with particular emphasis on the knowledge plugin replacing the older addKnowledge functionality. Several users reported issues with specific plugins including local-ai, discord, and twitter plugins. The Twitter plugin had problems with responding to tweets and missing environment variables like TWITTER_TARGET_USERS. The knowledge plugin raised concerns about security (any user being able to add knowledge) and inefficiency (re-embedding identical documents). Developers from the Eliza team were actively responding, mentioning upcoming fixes in version 1.0.5 and providing guidance on using the newer API endpoints. There were also discussions about UI improvements and notifications about new features for developers from OpenRouter.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I add RAG to my existing Eliza project?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThis Discord chat in the \"discussion\" channel shows minimal substantive technical discussion. The conversation consists primarily of greetings (\"gm\", \"hello\") and brief announcements. Two technical questions were raised: one about sending markup buttons with Eliza in Telegram, and another about calling plugins to an agent. Several users advertised their development services for AI agents and bots. There was a mention that \"Grok3 API is up\" but without further details. One user asked about wallet compatibility, specifically whether to switch from Solflare to Phantom wallet for verification purposes. Overall, the chat lacks in-depth technical discussions, problem-solving, or concrete implementations.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to send markup buttons with Eliza in telegram client in custom action? (asked by egoarka) A: Unanswered\nQ: Was there ever a no-code agent launcher ever released or is that in the pipeline? (asked by groggs) A: Unanswered\nQ: I'm currently using solflare, is it time to ditch it for phantom wallet? Seems i can't connect to verify. (asked by âœ¨â˜Ž MomoChan) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can i call plugin to the agent? Do we have to create a folder for plugin and then import them there? (asked by Ved Mohan) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»-coders Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on troubleshooting ElizaOS implementation issues. Several users encountered problems with Twitter plugin integration, particularly with interactions functionality not working properly in v2, leading some to revert to v1. A common build error related to \"hapi__shot\" type definitions affected multiple users across different versions. There were discussions about customizing chatbots, with users seeking help to make their agents respect predefined knowledge rather than generating responses outside their scope. Notable technical solutions included adding `\"types\": [\"node\"]` to tsconfig.json to fix build errors, enabling `TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE=true` for Twitter interactions, and setting `DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL=\"debug\"` for better debugging. Some users shared custom implementations, including a Twitter client fork using API access instead of scraping, and a comprehensive AI automation system for managing web3 projects.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I fix the hapi__shot type error when building ElizaOS? (asked by [elizaos] <nitzansaar>) A: Add `\"types\": [\"node\"],` to tsconfig.json (answered by wookosh)\nQ: How can I get more verbose debugging output in v1? (asked by [elizaos] <nitzansaar>) A: Set DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL=debug in your .env file or use DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL=\"debug\" pnpm start (answered by wookosh and notorious_d_e_v)\nQ: Why is my agent selecting wrong actions (checking weather when asked to transfer funds)? (asked by Mohit) A: It may be a memory issue when using Supabase DB after 30-35 prompts (answered by Mohit)\nQ: How can I make my custom chatbot respect predefined knowledge rather than generating responses outside its scope? (asked by SkyBLUE) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can I get Twitter interactions (mentions, replies) working in ElizaOS v2? (asked by 0xLabsTheCoder) A: Enable TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE=true in your configuration (answered by notorious_d_e_v)\nQ: Which version of ElizaOS is most stable? (asked by 0xLabsTheCoder) A: Version 0.25.9 (answered by notorious_d_e_v)\n\n## 3.

Odilitime shared that they've restarted the AI on version 1 (v1) while development continues on version 2 (v2). The team is being cautious about promotion as there might be a possibility to recover their previous 25,000 Twitter followers. A community member suggested adding the contract address to the Twitter profile, which Odilitime implemented. The discussion indicates the team is working on improvements for v2 while maintaining some presence with v1 in the interim.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is SpartanAI not on v2 now? (asked by human_nalejzpa) A: No, still working on v2, we'll upgrade when it's ready. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Can add this?

Summary\nThe discussion centers around organizing ElizaDAO as a \"Supermind\" to achieve open AGI through collective intelligence. Vincent Paul initiated a structured approach with working circles focused on the upcoming Solana Accelerate NYC event. Key technical discussions included:\n\n1) Organizational structure with five working groups: Community/Governance/Events, Dev/Knowledge, Comms/Social, Partnerships/Outreach, and Tokens/Funding.\n\n2) Jin shared development of a reputation/contribution tracking system that passively monitors engagement across channels, analyzes sentiment, scores GitHub contributions, and generates reports. This system will support both token rewards and non-financial incentives like badges/NFTs.\n\n3) Multiple participants emphasized the need for DAO treasury independence and incentive mechanisms to sustain participation beyond initial enthusiasm.\n\n4) Discussion of coordination with ElizaLabs and ElizaStudios while maintaining the DAO's autonomy (\"Eliza is Ours\"). Participants debated the balance between independent action and alignment with the core teams.\n\n5) Kenk introduced builder support initiatives including an invite-only Telegram group (200+ members) and YouTube tutorials for plugin developers.\n\nThe group is working to establish clear roles, governance structures, and sustainable incentives while maintaining alignment with the broader Eliza ecosystem.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What are the immediate priorities for ElizaDAO? (asked by vincentpaul) A: Align on Road to Solana Accelerate NYC Plan, form working circles, and schedule weekly/monthly rituals (answered by vincentpaul)\nQ: What working groups are being formed?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ¥‡-partners Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions of Model Context Protocol (MCP), agent-to-agent communication, and the future of API interfaces in AI systems. Odilitime describes MCP as a bridge between LLMs and current software paradigms, suggesting that while APIs remain efficient for high-volume or low-latency applications, the future will see fewer static APIs as dynamic agents become more prevalent. Yikesawjeez clarifies the distinction between MCP and agent-to-agent protocols, noting that similar technologies existed previously but lacked mainstream adoption until endorsed by major AI companies. DorianD proposes an \"Eliza agent registry\" concept where agents could advertise capabilities via JSON \"Agent Cards\" and utilize trust scores to facilitate agent selection for specific tasks. Jin discusses the development of \"Clank Tank,\" a show featuring project pitches, and shares details about using AI workflows to create avatars for participants. The chat also touches on cryptocurrency topics and Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK).\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the AI avatar workflow open source? (asked by yikesawjeez) A: Unanswered\nQ: Do you think odds are high that MCP becomes standard for API layer for LLM-native tools? (asked by hubert) A: It's a bridge between LLMs and the current software paradigm, but software is changing. APIs remain efficient for high-volume or low-latency applications. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: What's the timing on the transition from static APIs to dynamic agents? (asked by hubert) A: Gradual, as software takes time to build. Once builders have frameworks with great docs, it'll be competitive with existing software stacks. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Is an official elizaOS agent registry likely to happen? (implied by DorianD) A: I'd say an official elizaOS agent registry is likely to happen. (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

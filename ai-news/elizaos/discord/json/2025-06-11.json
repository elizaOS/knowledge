Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the suspension of ElizaOS and Shaw's X (Twitter) accounts, which has caused significant concern in the community. Team members confirmed they're working with X to resolve the issue, with speculation that it might be related to API usage/scraping rather than using the official X API. The team has purchased the API and is awaiting account restoration, which could take 7-10 days based on previous experiences. Despite the suspension, ElizaOS remains operational on other platforms including Discord, Telegram, and their website. The team is using this as an opportunity to expand to other platforms like Farcaster. There are ongoing discussions about V2 development and the auto.fun platform, which is being redesigned to be more effective as a token launchpad. Community members expressed concerns about the token's price performance, with some questioning the project's direction while others remain optimistic about its future potential.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around the suspension of ElizaOS and Shaw's Twitter accounts, which has created uncertainty in the community. Partners express concern about the lack of coordinated communication from the ElizaOS team during this crisis. Jin and Ben confirm they're working with X to resolve the suspensions and suggest using alternative platforms like Farcaster in the meantime.

Fleo-Thyphon emphasizes that ElizaOS was built as a true DAO with open-source principles, distinguishing it from VC-backed projects. The team is continuing development work on v2 plugin migration, auto.fun improvements, and Spartan fine-tuning despite the Twitter suspensions.

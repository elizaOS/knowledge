The primary topic revolves around strategies to revive the auto.fun platform.

The suggestion is that auto.fun needs a successful token launch to attract users, as \"degens are irrational and dont care about fancy features, they only come if they think they can make money.\" There's also a brief mention of an upcoming \"v2 announcement\" expected the following week. A user named vas inquires about plans to onboard creators to launch on autofun, noting a lack of activity during the current \"launchpad meta.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What this means?

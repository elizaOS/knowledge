      "summary": "# Analysis of \"discussion\" Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around \"Clank Tank,\" a new AI-powered governance system that simulates proposal evaluations in an entertainment format inspired by Shark Tank. Jin shared that Clank Tank aims to transform traditional DAO governance (described as \"walls of text simulator\") into engaging video content. The system includes token-based voting where users can send tokens to influence AI judges' decisions, with those tokens being burned. Future plans include a \"superchat\" feature allowing token holders to have comments read during deliberations, real-time pitching to AI judges, and integration of prediction markets. The community discussed potential applications including project incubation, accelerator programs, and integration with auto.fun. There were also brief discussions about CollabLand issues and potential migration to Vulcan, as well as questions about the project's Twitter account status and possible rebranding from AI16Z to ElizaOS.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does the voting approach in Clank Tank work? (asked by Skinny) A: Users send tokens to cast votes, which get burned.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»-coders\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around issues with the Twitter plugin experiencing rate limiting and account restrictions. Users discuss receiving 429 errors despite having paid subscriptions, with one user ultimately discovering their Twitter app was banned for policy violations. There's also discussion about plugin development, specifically regarding the location of the current plugin-bootstrap repository, which has moved to the monorepo structure. A user inquires about where to place custom plugin files in a project created with the quick-start method, with guidance provided on linking standalone plugins. Additionally, there are brief mentions of creating agents that analyze Discord activity and convert it to attributes, with a reference to Neo4j as a knowledge graph solution.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is the twitter plugin still broken?

(asked by Benquik) A: Can be outside of project as standalone; build plugin, then use \"bun link\" in plugin root and \"bun link plugin-name\" in project (answered by 0xbbjoker)\nQ: Has anybody ever built an agent that takes discord or other social activity, and turns it into a set of attributes? (asked by Kenk) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Jin announced a new governance tool for voting on submissions, with multiple voting methods: onchain text-to-vote using ai16z tokens, Discord reactions, and direct voting on clanktank.tv. The system follows a structured process: user submissions, auto-generated news show, community voting combined with AI research/scoring, and final results synthesis into a Clank Tank episode. Some users asked clarification questions about voting mechanics, specifically whether multiple votes are allowed and how they're counted. There was also brief discussion about token performance, with mixed opinions on its current value and trading patterns. A reference was made to \"shaw\" working on an \"AWS Agent-as-a-service gateway\" (AaaS), though details were minimal.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can you vote more than once? Or does that cancel your previous vote? (asked by Odilitime) A: Once per submission (answered by jin)\nQ: But if someone accidentally votes more than once then which vote is counted? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\nQ: When shaw will come back? Boring without him (asked by Burtiik) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

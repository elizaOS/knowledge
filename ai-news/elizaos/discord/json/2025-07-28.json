One user (biaxus) reported an issue with the EVM plugin for ElizaOS, mentioning they followed the official documentation but the agent didn't recognize the plugin after installation and configuration. Another user (wire) directed them to the dev support channel. There were several questions about the project status, with community members confirming the team is still active and pointing to GitHub as evidence. The chat clarified that ElizaOS is the agent framework with the ticker $ai16z (token address HeLp6NuQkmYB4pYWo2zYs22mESHXPQYzXbB8n4V98jwC). Users mentioned upcoming developments including \"elizacloud\" and \"clanktank.\" Overall, the chat contained more general conversation and price discussion than technical content.\n\n## 2.

Several users encountered problems with specific plugins like EVM, Gaianet, and Ollama. The Gaianet plugin appears to be missing in the current version, with suggestions to build a custom plugin following the Venice plugin as an example. There were also discussions about OpenRouter configuration issues, remote Ollama calls across a LAN, and knowledge embedding challenges. Users shared configuration examples and troubleshooting steps, particularly for the Ollama plugin with different models. The conversation highlighted the need for better documentation and plugin migration to the v2 framework.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there any official people here?

Community members express enthusiasm about ELI5's potential growth, comparing it to other successful tokens like Rugproof. There's significant interest in developing lore around ELI5, with user cjft mentioning plans to build character narratives. A community member (Dr. Neuro) provides a detailed explanation differentiating ELI5 from AI16z, describing ELI5 as an AI that explains complex concepts simply, while AI16z is portrayed as a team of AI agents that build and execute tasks. The chat suggests ELI5 has significant community support and potential for growth, with some members speculating it could reach $100M+ valuation. There are also brief mentions of potential AI functionality for ELI5 and hints at future developments. User wire suggests auto.fun should focus on \"proof of project\" rather than memes, positioning itself as an AI launchpad for startups.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the difference between ELI5 and AI16z? (asked by Gianni) A: ELI5 explains complex concepts simply like talking to a 5-year-old, while AI16z is a team of AI agents that build and execute tasks - one explains, one acts (answered by Dr. Neuro)\nQ: How/where can I trade ELI5? (asked by Gianni) A: Contract address provided, can use Phantom on phone/computer or Axiom on computer (answered by cantseemenomore)\nQ: Is using Coinbase Wallet with ELI5 a disadvantage?

Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on developing browser extensions and applications similar to Cluely, with an emphasis on privacy and local processing. The team explored using Chrome's desktopCapture API to create a browser extension that can listen to calls and provide AI assistance without requiring users to create separate accounts. They discussed building a comprehensive ecosystem with desktop apps, mobile apps, and browser extensions that would sync context across devices while maintaining privacy. The team also considered monetization strategies, including a token-based credit system for cloud services while keeping local features free. There was debate about prioritizing game development versus cloud infrastructure. A partnership with Wolfram was mentioned, requiring plugin development with LaTeX handling for mathematical outputs. The team noted the impressive performance of GLM-4.5, an open-source model outperforming most competitors except Sonnet and Opus. They also discussed agent-to-agent (A2A) protocols and the importance of creating infrastructure rather than focusing solely on developing useful agents.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How do you listen to calls for the browser extension? (asked by R0am | tip.md) A: Using Chrome's desktopCapture API, similar to how Loom works. (answered by cjft)\nQ: How would you implement cross-device context transfer? (asked by R0am | tip.md) A: Using something like Supermemory/zep/mem0 that's self-hostable with a tunnel on top for local memory that follows you. (answered by R0am | tip.md)\nQ: Did you extend the hackathon? (asked by Borko) A: Yes, it will be extended today, this will be the last extension. (answered by jin)\nQ: For bootstrap logging, should it enforce its own filepath structure or emit events for plugins? (asked by Odilitime) A: It should use the existing logger core functionality, with bootstrap emitting to the normal logger. (answered by cjft)\n\n## 3.

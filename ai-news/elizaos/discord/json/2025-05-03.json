Users are experiencing role verification problems that have persisted for over 48 hours. The project appears to have multiple components: AI16Z (focused on venture capital but \"fully AI\"), Auto.fun (an open-source project launched recently), ElizaOS v1/Eliza v2 (an AI agent framework), and DegenAI (associated with Degenspartan AI). There's mention of market caps: DegenAI at $4M and AI16Z fluctuating between $300-340M. An announcement is expected regarding potential changes to DegenAI holdings requirements for partner/hoplite roles, though AI16Z holdings requirements will remain unchanged for now. Moderators discuss their approach to community management, particularly regarding potential scammers versus general user behavior.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is being built now? I thought ai16z was about replacing venture capital but all I see are stuff about trading bots? (asked by EBITDA) A: We are doing some VC, but it'll be fully AI. We have auto.fun, that we launched a few weeks ago. It's open source, as well. And we are working on ElizaOS v1, or Eliza v2... our AI agent/ai agent framework codebase. We also have degenai, which is degenspartan ai. (answered by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai))\nQ: proggres DegenAi?

A user (lantianlaoli) encountered a TypeScript build error in the elizaos/core package related to the 'preconnect' property missing in the fetch type definition. The error occurred during the build process on the main branch. The user expressed frustration about code being pushed without proper checks and highlighted documentation inconsistencies where API examples no longer match the actual implementation. They also raised questions about package management in the monorepo structure, specifically regarding Solana project integration. Additionally, lantianlaoli was looking for developers to implement cryptocurrency-related features including CMC data retrieval, token operations with transaction feedback, and wallet integration. Two other users briefly requested help with Twitter agents and auto.fun implementation.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why aren't you updating the documentation when the string is no longer usable? (asked by lantianlaoli) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why in the Eliza project monorepo did the original packages not include the Solana project, and how is it being managed now in package.json?

The conversation primarily revolves around cryptocurrency tokens (particularly \"ELI5\", \"EDDY\", and others in the \"auto.fun ecosystem\"). The main technical issue discussed is a critical problem with fake verified tokens on a trading platform, where user frank_grimes_sr reports losing money due to what appears to be a verification badge exploit. A moderator (Osint) intervenes and directs the user to submit a support form. No technical solutions are implemented during this chat, though there's acknowledgment that work may be underway on the verification system.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Please what's this project all about ELI5?

      "summary": "# Analysis of \"fun-support\" Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Auto.fun platform functionality, token migration, and verification concerns. Users discussed slippage settings, token creator rewards, and fee structures. A significant incident occurred when a fake \"comput3\" token was initially verified but later flagged as fraudulent after community members expressed suspicion. Users inquired about fee distribution for migrated tokens versus native Auto.fun launches, with the consensus being that imported tokens likely don't generate the same fees since they use existing liquidity pools. Other discussions included sharing Auto.fun content on social media platforms and questions about preset slippage settings. The conversation demonstrates the community's vigilance regarding potential scams and their interest in understanding the platform's technical and financial mechanics.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to preset slippage on auto fun? (asked by noj) A: I don't think so. I havent seen anyone mention that, and I've been unable to do that meself. (answered by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai))\nQ: Can we pin degenai on auto.fun? (asked by Void) A: Unanswered\nQ: What are the fun-creator rewards? How much % of volume after migration does the dev wallet receive? (asked by gummy) A: Creators of the token capture 90% of the fees generated. It depends on gas fees at time of execution and LP. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: When importing a token, how do fees work? Will there be fees generated if volume transitions to auto.fun? (asked by SYMBiEX <<CidSociety>>) A: I'd assume no fees are generated on imported tokens, since they already have liquidity pools that we don't control for trading. (answered by yikesawjeez)\nQ: How do we get volume to come in? (asked by nasdaq.ai) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there an easy way to post a link of your coin on X? (asked by Spyros) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Kenk | Helpee: Simon | Context: Simon identified a suspicious token claiming to be \"comput3\" that appeared verified | Resolution: Kenk confirmed with the team that it was fake and flagged it, preventing Simon from investing\nHelper: Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai) | Helpee: nasdaq.ai | Context: User couldn't share video from auto.fun to X | Resolution: Suggested submitting a report to support via the link at the bottom of the page\nHelper: yikesawjeez | Helpee: SYMBiEX <<CidSociety>> | Context: Confusion about whether imported tokens generate fees | Resolution: Confirmed the logical assumption that imported tokens don't generate fees since they use existing liquidity pools\n\n## 4.

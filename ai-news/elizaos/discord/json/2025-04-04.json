Summary\nThe chat primarily consists of non-technical discussions about cryptocurrency prices, market conditions, and some scam warnings. There were a few technical questions about ElizaOS v2, particularly regarding Twitter integration, Ollama model configuration, and RAG implementation. Jin mentioned that developers are working on fixing Twitter client issues. One user (shadows.13) shared they built an agent that analyzes stock tickers using Anthropic 3.7 with thinking capabilities. Another user (Ale | AutoRujira) encountered issues with Ollama model configuration in ElizaOS v2, noting it worked in v1 but not in v2. There were also questions about deploying containers to Railway, with one user experiencing issues where their agent wouldn't fully start. The chat contained several scam attempts and warnings about them from community members.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I run Twitter agent in V2?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ü•á-partners Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the development of the Eliza ecosystem and discussions about the AI16Z token's price performance. Jin shared updates about creating a partners section with individual pages for each partner, using Docusaurus with scripts that update pages from JSON data. The partnership process currently uses a Typeform (Tally.so) that will be streamlined in v2. \n\nTechnical discussions focused on the Eliza framework's agent capabilities, particularly in v2, where agents can function as project managers with goal-setting abilities. Jin mentioned that GitHub MCP (released recently) represents a significant advancement, enabling agents to collaborate through \"swarm tech\" within the Eliza ecosystem. The concept of an \"Eliza bazaar\" was discussed as a potential marketplace for agent-to-agent commerce.\n\nCommunity members expressed concerns about AI16Z's price decline despite ongoing development. HoneyBadger provided analysis suggesting that shorting pressure and lack of key opinion leader (KOL) support were contributing factors. The discussion highlighted the importance of incentive alignment with well-capitalized entities in the crypto space for project success.\n\n## 2.

(asked by DannyNOR NoFapArc) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

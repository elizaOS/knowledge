      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - \"core-devs\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\n\nThe core-devs channel discussions focused on several key technical developments. cjft is developing an Eliza browser extension to overcome automation limitations with puppeteer/playwright, allowing agents to integrate with browsers more stably without relying on Google Cloud APIs. Shaw made significant progress on a containerized application architecture that enables Eliza to run in containers communicating with Tauri through websockets, with PostgreSQL and Ollama also containerized for a fully local agent application that self-installs Podman if Docker isn't available.\n\nThe team discussed consolidating documentation under the eliza.how domain, as there was confusion about multiple documentation sites. They also explored the potential of browser extensions as a strategic product direction, with cjft suggesting that \"/extension\" could become a core package exposing global services to all plugins.\n\nShaw reported progress on a game implementation with working container and lifecycle components built in an \"App store friendly way,\" noting that moving containers to cloud could enable iPhone compatibility. The developers also discussed creating a standalone repository for API key management and payments to facilitate productization across their offerings.\n\nR0am shared developer resources including a Tauri plugin for MCP clients and demonstrated self-hosting capabilities using containers on a NAS with code-server, Claude, and Kimi API integration.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\n\nQ: What makes the browser extension approach better than puppeteer/playwright? (asked by R0am | tip.md) A: It simplifies automation, avoids Google Cloud API dependencies, overcomes authentication challenges, and provides more stable browser integration capabilities. (answered by cjft)\nQ: Can you load your agent in the browser with the extension? (asked by R0am | tip.md) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why are there two different documentation sites? (asked by jin) A: The documentation will be consolidated under the eliza.how domain. (implied answer from context)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\n\nHelper: R0am | tip.md | Helpee: Tauri developers | Context: Shared a useful Tauri plugin for MCP clients | Resolution: Provided a GitHub link to tauri-plugin-mcp-client\nHelper: shaw | Helpee: Community | Context: Sharing progress on containerized application architecture | Resolution: Explained how Eliza can run in containers with Tauri communication via websockets\nHelper: R0am | tip.md | Helpee: Community | Context: Self-hosting development environment | Resolution: Shared setup for running code-server in a container on NAS with Claude and Kimi API\n\n## 4.

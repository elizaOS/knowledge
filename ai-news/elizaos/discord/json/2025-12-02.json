      "summary": "# ElizaOS Discord Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on the migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens, with users debating the conversion ratio (6 ElizaOS for 1 AI16Z) versus selling and buying separately. Several users expressed concerns about ElizaOS's price performance, with some believing it has bottomed out while others warned of potential further decline. Kraken exchange announced pausing AI16Z trading and is evaluating whether to support the migration, causing uncertainty for users with tokens on the platform. Community sentiment appears mixed, with some maintaining optimism about ElizaOS's future based on the team's technical capabilities and upcoming features like ElizaCloud and Babylon, while others expressed disappointment about marketing challenges, especially after being limited on X (Twitter). Technical discussions were minimal, with one user asking about building an AI agent on X and facing API cost challenges.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's the difference in migrating from AI16Z to ELIZAOS instead of selling AI16Z and buying ELIZAOS?

Summary:\nThe chat segment shows users discussing ElizaOS implementation, particularly focusing on setting up character agents and connecting them to X (Twitter). FenrirFawks initiated the conversation about installing ElizaOS and inquired about using Deepseek as a provider. Sayonara confirmed this was possible through the openrouter plugin. FenrirFawks later reported connection issues with their agent setup, receiving either loading screens or connection failure messages. Sayonara followed up by asking for more technical details about the database (pglite) and model provider being used, and whether the default Eliza agent worked. Other users inquired about Twitter reply approval functionality in v2 and expressed concern about the cost of using the X API ($175/month). The conversation also included unrelated messages from users offering development and promotional services.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can I use deepseek as a provider? (asked by FenrirFawks) A: Yes, use openrouter plugin and use deepseek models (answered by sayonara)\nQ: is there twitter reply approval in v2 as it was in v1 or was it removed?

Users primarily discussed potential applications for ElizaOS Cloud, with DorianD suggesting several controversial agent ideas focused on rating people's appearances and facilitating dating connections. There was brief mention of ElizaCloud's potential business model, with suggestions about taking a percentage cut from third-party developers similar to Salesforce AppExchange or Apple App Store. DorianD also inquired about URL structures for agents on the platform. The conversation included speculation about model capabilities for appearance rating, with Odilitime noting that OpenAI likely avoids such applications. A user named pangolink asked about when the AI ElizaOS Updates channel would resume operation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are you guys going to have URLs for the agent link like a normal social network?

Team members discussed implementing features similar to Claude's skills where tools/contexts are available only when needed. 0xbbjoker outlined specific tasks for plugin-memory, including figuring out table migrations for cloud and tailoring architecture to specific tasks. Stan provided an update on their work introducing per-user authentication validation on the server with generic JWK provider support (including Privy). The team also briefly discussed hosting multiple agents on single/few elizaOS servers instead of isolated serverless instances for each user, which could potentially reduce costs. Odilitime and Borko discussed implementing streaming functionality without rewriting the entire framework, with Odilitime suggesting using a \"stream: true\" parameter in the runtime.ts file.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Should we implement that kind of things in plugin memories? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Pretty close, need to figure out migration for tables for cloud, from 1.x version of plugin to 2.x version (answered by 0xbbjoker)\nQ: Can you look into how we can implement streaming without needing to rewrite the entire framework?

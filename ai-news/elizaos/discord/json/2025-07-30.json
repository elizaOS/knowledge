Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around community concerns about the ElizaOS project, particularly regarding the suspension of their X (formerly Twitter) account and token value. A team member named Kenk provides updates on ecosystem development, mentioning approximately 55 teams actively developing with elizaOS, a recently launched accelerator with 10 participating teams, and auto.fun's new initiative. Kenk explains they're withholding details about the X account situation as they have \"a resolution in sight\" and sharing details would be counterproductive. The team is preparing to share significant developments in the coming weeks/months, with Kenk noting that \"the tech is there, the ecosystem is established\" and they have \"the largest AI x Crypto developer community in the industry.\" There's also mention of an upcoming technical session about the new elizaOS web connector.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Do we have any plans for the future? (asked by nangua) A: Unanswered\nQ: Any update on X account? (asked by bct) A: \"On X, as I've said before we're not sharing details as we have a resolution in sight and sharing details would be counter intuitive to this. We want the accounts back so doing everything we can to get that over the line.\" (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Is there any info on further development of ai16z integration, usefulness, etc? (asked by shifuzen) A: \"I've prepared a comprehensive overview of the ecosystem, and working on a place for this to be publically accessible.\" (answered by Kenk)\nQ: What do I have to do to see the message history?

A key conversation involved Skelzor troubleshooting the dexscreener plugin, which appeared to have been migrated to version 1.x in the GitHub repository but was still showing as version 0.25.6-alpha.1 when installed. 0xbbjoker identified that the updated branch hadn't been released to npm/bun and subsequently published a new release (v1.0.1) for testing. After some initial issues with the service type definition, the plugin was successfully implemented.\n\nAnother significant technical discussion centered around managing separate knowledge paths for multiple agents. Blaze Leclairt was trying to configure different document folders for different agents using the KNOWLEDGE_PATH environment variable. Odilitime identified a limitation in the current implementation and quickly created a pull request (PR #36) to enhance the plugin-knowledge component to support character-specific knowledge paths.\n\nAdditional topics included a question about x402 support on MCP servers, Twitter shadowban issues, and an announcement about an upcoming introduction to the ElizaOS web connector.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do you install the dexscreener plugin? (asked by Skelzor) A: Use \"bun add <@1300745997625982977>os/plugin-dexscreener@latest\" (answered by 0xbbjoker)\nQ: Do you have a timeframe on when the dexscreener plugin would be released on npm/bun? (asked by Skelzor) A: 0xbbjoker immediately did a release for testing (answered by 0xbbjoker)\nQ: Has anyone tried the same 402 handshake settling on other rails via h402? (asked by AM99) A: Unanswered\nQ: Any Eliza devs had experience with X/Twitter \"shadowban\" the agent's X account? (asked by hhe6456) A: Unanswered\nQ: How do you configure different knowledge paths for multiple agents? (asked by Blaze Leclairt) A: Define KNOWLEDGE_PATH in character settings instead of .env (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: 0xbbjoker | Helpee: Skelzor | Context: Dexscreener plugin stuck at old version despite GitHub updates | Resolution: 0xbbjoker released version 1.0.1 to npm/bun, fixed service type issue in a subsequent release\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: Blaze Leclairt | Context: Needed separate knowledge paths for multiple agents | Resolution: Created PR #36 to enhance plugin-knowledge for character-specific knowledge paths\nHelper: 0xbbjoker | Helpee: Blaze Leclairt | Context: Confusion about where character settings are stored | Resolution: Explained that settings are stored in database, not filesystem\n\n## 4.

The conversation primarily revolves around speculation about a cryptocurrency called \"Eli5\" launched on Auto.Fun platform. Users discuss potential future developments, including rumors that Eli5 might be developed into an AI agent. The chat includes mentions of Shaw (apparently a CTO who burned some supply) and connections to ElizaOS. Several users express bullish sentiment about Eli5's potential value. Later in the chat, users create and share AI-generated images related to Eli5 using Midjourney, with Dr. Neuro creating visuals that other members appreciate.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can someone please Eli5 me what's Eli5 all about? (asked by Quest) A: community coin launched on Auto.Fun (Shaw's launchpad). Shaw then CTO'd the coin and burned some supply.

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around technical challenges with the ElizaOS platform, focusing on database integration, plugin architecture, and cloud services. Key topics include:\n\n- Database issues: The team is struggling with Drizzle ORM integration, particularly with dynamic migrations for plugins. There's debate about whether to keep PGlite or standardize on PostgreSQL, with concerns about cross-platform compatibility and naming conventions.\n\n- ElizaCloud development: Shaw outlined a three-phase plan for ElizaCloud: (1) Developer APIs to simplify agent building with unified API keys, (2) Cloud Containers for hosted agents with customization options, and (3) AI-assisted agent creation (Autocoder).\n\n- Plugin architecture: Discussions about API endpoint design for plugins, with questions about the flat structure of plugin routes and how to properly integrate services.\n\n- Docker/container support: Several members tested deployment configurations with Docker and Podman, encountering issues with setup instructions and dependencies.\n\n- Farcaster integration: The team discussed implementing Farcaster support using Neynar webhooks instead of polling to improve API credential management.\n\nThe team is working through significant technical debt while trying to maintain a flexible plugin architecture that supports dynamic loading without sacrificing database migration reliability.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: So basically in phase 1 we are creating get or crud api endpoints for famous plugins like open ai or plugin anthropic so users can use easily use it without putting api keys?

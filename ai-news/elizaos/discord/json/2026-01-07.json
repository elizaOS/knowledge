      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe primary technical discussion centered on DigitalDiva's Discord bot integration issues with ElizaOS version 1.7.0. The bot was failing to recognize server IDs, throwing \"No server ID found 10\" errors related to the bootstrap plugin. Error logs showed issues with the serverId to messageServerId migration in the codebase.\n\nOdilitime diagnosed the problem as stemming from incomplete fixes in the 1.7.0 core release. He identified that the bootstrap plugin's actions and providers had compatibility issues with plugin-discord 1.3.3. Shaw suggested debugging by creating a minimal hello world script with discord.js to isolate whether the issue was Discord portal permissions or code-related, noting that Discord developer portal permission configuration is a common source of errors.\n\nOdilitime created a fix branch (odi-17) on GitHub with patches for bootstrap's actions/providers to resolve the compatibility issues. He recommended either downgrading to core version 1.6.5 or waiting for the fixes to be tested and merged. Casino suggested limiting bot permissions and incrementally adding features back to isolate the problem.\n\nA secondary discussion involved community requests for better visibility of the ElizaOS contract address (CA). Multiple users noted difficulty finding the official CA on X/Twitter accounts. Kenk mentioned the linktree was being refreshed to point to CoinGecko, while Broccolex advocated for easier discoverability, suggesting a pinned tweet solution despite Kenk's pushback that top projects don't typically do this.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Why does the agent need admin privileges? (asked by Odilitime) A: DigitalDiva gave admin permissions when the bot wouldn't respond or see server ID and usernames (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\nQ: Do you see your agent in Discord? (asked by Odilitime) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: What version of ElizaOS are you using? (asked by Odilitime) A: Version 1.7.0 (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\nQ: Should I use version 1.6.5 instead? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: Yes, might be easier to use older core like 1.6.5, or use the odi-17 branch with fixes (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Does the fix branch mean I can keep this version? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: You could clone the odi-17 branch which should work with plugin-discord 1.3.3, but still testing (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Why hasn't the ElizaOS contract address been posted across all official X accounts? (asked by degenwtf) A: The team will get on it (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: If I buy ai16z now and migrate after 30 days, will I get 120X? (asked by nancy) A: If you buy after the snapshot (November 11) you can't migrate (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: Is the Babylon that a16z invested in made by ElizaOS? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: Nope (answered by degenwtf)\n\n## 3.

First, jin shared a GitHub resource from githubnext/agentics regarding workflow documentation for updating docs, noting it contained valuable information. \n\nThe primary technical issue involved ElizaBAO encountering a \"Model not found\" error when integrating elizaoscloud agents into their website using agent IDs and API endpoints. cjft provided a concrete solution by explaining the correct format for the model parameter when calling agent API endpoints. The solution specified using provider prefixes in the format: `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`, or `google/gemini-2.5-flash`. This formatting approach was recommended as the proper way to reference models in API calls. ElizaBAO confirmed the solution was helpful.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How should I format the model parameter when calling agent API endpoints? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: Use provider prefix format like openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, or google/gemini-2.5-flash (answered by cjft)\n\n## 3.

Odilitime identified a significant issue in version 1.7.0 requiring an urgent release (PR #6333), though compatibility problems persisted with Discord 1.3.3, necessitating testing across multiple Discord branches and a new Discord release.\n\nStan submitted two plugin PRs for Telegram (#22) and Discord (#41) and shared documentation for review on HackMD. He provided a standup update detailing work on cloud fixes addressing TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) race conditions using a deduct-before, reconcile-after approach, plus runtime initialization optimizations with corresponding Linear tickets created.\n\nA key architectural discussion emerged around connector gateways. Odilitime recommended reviewing the Jeju cloud branch containing Shaw's preferred Discord bridge implementation. The conversation evolved into scaling considerations, with Odilitime proposing simple event pumps as the direction forward. He emphasized the need for multiple daemon instances per service and differentiated requirements between voice connections (requiring higher bandwidth/priority event pumps) and text connections. Preprocessing was identified as a valuable optimization strategy.\n\nJin shared the ElizaOS book documentation link on HackMD, confirming workspace availability.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Do we have a team or workspace on hackmd? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Yes (answered by jin, shared https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book)\n\nQ: So each problematic connector would need its own gateway? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Direction is simple event pumps, and we'll need more than one daemon instance per service due to scale (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

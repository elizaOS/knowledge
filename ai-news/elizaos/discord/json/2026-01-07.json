      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💬-discussion Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on critical technical issues with ElizaOS Discord bot integration and version compatibility problems. DigitalDiva encountered errors with the Discord plugin showing \"No server ID found\" errors and bootstrap plugin issues. Odilitime identified this as a breaking change between serverId and messageServerId in the transition from version 1.6.5 to 1.7.0. The core issue stemmed from using ElizaOS 1.7.0 with plugin-discord 1.3.3, where recent updates missed critical compatibility fixes.\n\nOdilitime created a fix branch (odi-17) on GitHub specifically addressing bootstrap actions/providers compatibility issues. Shaw and others recommended debugging approaches including creating minimal hello world scripts with discord.js to isolate permission issues versus code problems, and logging environment variables to verify configuration.\n\nSignificant non-technical discussion involved Korean exchange delistings, with Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit announcing termination of AI16Z/ElizaOS trading support due to transparency concerns around the rebranding and token swap process. The DAXA (Digital Asset Exchange Alliance) cited inadequate disclosure of material information affecting token value.\n\nCommunity members discussed token utility concerns, with multiple users questioning why ElizaOS token lacks clear utility within the ecosystem despite being described as \"token-based.\" The team acknowledged needing to post contract addresses more prominently across official channels. Shaw announced Bazaar as a decentralized marketplace for agents running on Jeju, described as an \"appstore for agents.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Why does the Discord bot need admin privileges and why isn't it seeing server ID? (asked by Odilitime) A: The issue is due to version incompatibility between ElizaOS 1.7.0 and plugin-discord 1.3.3, related to serverId to messageServerId migration. A fix branch (odi-17) was created. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What version of ElizaOS is being used? (asked by Odilitime) A: Version 1.7.0 with plugin-discord 1.3.3 (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\nQ: Should I use version 1.6.5 instead?

(asked by degenwtf) A: The team will get on it and post it (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: If I buy ai16z now and migrate after 30 days, will I get 120X? (asked by nancy) A: If you buy after the snapshot (November 11), you cannot migrate (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: Can you find the CA within 10 seconds on website/twitter? (asked by Broccolex) A: Linktree is being refreshed and will point to CoinGecko (answered by Kenk)\n\nQ: Are AI16Z and ElizaOS being delisted from Korean exchanges? (asked by degenwtf) A: Yes, Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit announced termination of trading support ending February 9-12, 2026 (answered by 주니)\n\nQ: Will Bithumb support the AI16Z to ElizaOS token swap? (asked by KARA) A: Yes, Bithumb announced it will support the swap (answered by FoRever_BIG)\n\nQ: When is ElizaOS token getting utility within the ecosystem? (asked by stoikol) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Why increase supply if the token isn't used as utility in the framework? (asked by stoikol) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Do I need to pay for X API to use Eliza for finding stuff on X? (asked by Discostu) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: What is Bazaar in the Kamiyo protocol commit? (asked by elizafan222) A: Bazaar is the decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, the appstore for agents (answered by sb)\n\nQ: Where did the coin migration application section go? (asked by Casinomew) A: Go to the migration-questions or migration-support channels (answered by Hexx 🌐)\n\nQ: How long does it take to get response from team on migration tickets? (asked by Dabel) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

The most significant technical problem-solving involved ElizaBAO encountering a \"Model not found\" error when integrating elizaoscloud agents into their website. cjft provided the solution, specifying that the model parameter must use proper provider prefix formats like \"openai/gpt-4o-mini\", \"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5\", or \"google/gemini-2.5-flash\".\n\njin shared multiple relevant resources including GitHub's agentics workflow documentation for updating docs, BountyBoard project that uses Eliza, and an article on context graphs as AI's trillion-dollar opportunity. jin noted that Eliza now has a strong data foundation to build a context graph.\n\nInfrastructure questions emerged around deployment, with Omid Sa asking about database choices (Pglite vs PostgreSQL) for Elizacloud container deployments. cjft confirmed either option would work. Discostu raised concerns about X API costs ($200/month) for using Eliza with Twitter, questioning if scraping alternatives exist.\n\nStrategic discussions focused on data collection and AI training. DorianD proposed an Eliza Phone App concept for users to share data for LLM training in exchange for reputation points. This evolved into discussions about agents paying IOUs for data collection, motion capture suits for skill recording (fishing, haircutting, burger flipping), and creating royalty systems where data providers earn from AI inference using their captured movements. sb mentioned the Babylon game experiment as a data collection initiative and explained Jeju as a decentralized Layer 2 focused on powering AI apps that connects Eliza's ecosystem.\n\nelizafan222 identified KamiyoAI as a new project using the elizaos plugin, sharing their GitHub commit evidence. The community also noted documentation downtime at elizacloud.ai/docs.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What format should I use for the model parameter when calling agent API endpoints? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: Use provider prefix formats like openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, or google/gemini-2.5-flash (answered by cjft)\n\nQ: Should I use Pglite or PostgreSQL for deploying in Elizacloud via containers? (asked by Omid Sa) A: Either will work (answered by cjft)\n\nQ: Do I need to pay for X API ($200/month) to use Eliza for finding stuff on X, or does Eliza have scraping alternatives? (asked by Discostu) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Are the KamiyoAI guys using the elizaos plugin? (asked by elizafan222) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on critical bug fixes and architectural decisions for ElizaOS version 1.7.0 and Discord integration. Odilitime identified a compatibility issue requiring an urgent release, noting that the fix doesn't work with Discord 1.3.3 and requires testing across multiple Discord branches before cutting a new Discord release.\n\nA significant architectural discussion emerged around connector gateways. Odilitime reviewed Shaw's preferred Discord bridge implementation in the Jeju cloud branch and proposed using simple event pumps as the architectural direction. The team discussed scaling considerations, particularly the need for multiple daemon instances per service and prioritizing voice connections (higher bandwidth) over text-based event pumps. Preprocessing was identified as a key optimization strategy.\n\nStan provided updates on cloud infrastructure work, specifically addressing TOCTOU (Time-of-check to time-of-use) race conditions using a \"deduct-before, reconcile-after\" approach. He's also working on runtime initialization optimizations with PRs pending deeper testing and validation.\n\nJin highlighted the strength of ElizaOS's data foundation for AI agents, noting that daily/weekly/monthly insights from agentic workflows are high quality but need integration into last-mile applications (agents, webhooks, apps). Documentation work was shared via HackMD for team review.\n\nAgent Joshua commented on market dynamics, noting that the inference market has proven unprofitable based on their experience with models on OpenRouter over the past year.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Do we have a team or workspace on hackmd? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Yes, https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book (answered by jin)\n\nQ: So each problematic connector would need its own gateway? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Direction is simple event pumps, and we'll need more than one daemon instance per service due to scale. Voice connections need higher priority/bandwidth event pumps than text. (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\n\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: Stan ⚡ | Context: Stan asked about connector gateway architecture | Resolution: Odilitime recommended reviewing the Jeju cloud branch with Shaw's preferred Discord bridge implementation and explained the event pump architecture approach\n\nHelper: jin | Helpee: Stan ⚡ | Context: Stan asked about HackMD workspace availability | Resolution: jin confirmed existence and provided link to the HackMD book\n\n## 4.

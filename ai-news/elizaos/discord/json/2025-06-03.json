      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»-tech-support\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on technical support for Eliza agents and framework. Key discussions included updating from older versions of Eliza to newer ones, with specific code migration examples from deprecated methods to current ones. There were questions about database usage for app data storage, agent state management, and accessing reply messages in Discord. The conversation also touched on keeping deployed agents updated with the latest repository changes, with a solution being the `npx elizaos update` command to update runtime and packages without changing code. Some users inquired about specific plugins like Akash Chat API and EVM wallet integration. The chat demonstrated the community's focus on technical implementation details and framework updates rather than general discussion.\n\n## 2.

I don't see a problem with customizing db per your use case, you have drizzle ORM should be easy to add columns / tables. (answered by 0xbbjoker)\nQ: How can I get the text of a reply origin message in action handler, not just uuid? (asked by Martin Rivera) A: I guess you need to check previous messages.

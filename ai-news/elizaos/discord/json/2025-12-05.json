There is no substantive technical discussion or problem-solving in this segment. DorianD shared an Instagram link and made a lighthearted suggestion about creating agentic robots with ElizaOS logos that would fight in public while people bet on their performance through a prediction markets network.

Summary\nThe chat segment shows developers discussing ongoing work on the ElizaOS project, particularly focusing on streaming support and tool handling across different plugins. Stan is working on unifying the `useModel` behavior for both normal and streaming modes, starting with the plugin-openrouter implementation before extending the pattern to plugin-openai and plugin-anthropic. There's a pull request (PR #20) for the plugin-openrouter that was reviewed by 0xbbjoker. Stan also mentioned another PR (#6200) that needs review but isn't urgent. There was a brief disagreement about tool calling functionality, with Odilitime suggesting it's unnecessary optionality. The conversation also included a request for a Deepseek API key and mention of an OpenRouter invite being sent.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do we have a Deepseek API key? (asked by Kenk) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

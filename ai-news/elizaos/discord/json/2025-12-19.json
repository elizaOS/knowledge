      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the migration from ai16z to elizaOS tokens, with community members expressing mixed sentiments about the project's direction. Several users voiced frustration about the token's price decline from previous highs, while others remained optimistic. Key technical points discussed include the February 4, 2026 deadline for token migration, after which unmigrated tokens will be abandoned in the old contract and no more tokens will be minted. Odilitime shared a GitHub repository link for an engagement plugin (https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-engagement) and mentioned committing recent work soon. There was confusion from some users about the migration process, with one user (roybot) seeking help to migrate their tokens. The community clarified that ai16z no longer has utility and elizaOS is the path forward, though ai16z remains tradable on DEXs.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What happens to unmigrated tokens after the deadline? (asked by Error P015-A) A: The unmigrated tokens will be abandoned in the old contract, and no more tokens will be minted after February 4, 2026, making the supply completely locked. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: How can I migrate my ai16z tokens if I have 0 eligible? (asked by roybot) A: Go to the migration-support channel. (answered by Omid Sa)\nQ: Should I buy ai16z? (asked by maxon3d.) A: No. (answered by Serikiki)\nQ: What's the elizaOS ticker? (asked by maxon3d.) A: It's elizaos. (answered by Serikiki)\nQ: Why is ai16z still pumping despite the migration? (asked by maxon3d.) A: The token having no utility doesn't mean it doesn't have a market; it's still available on DEXs so people may pump it for various reasons. (answered by Serikiki)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe core-devs team is working on several critical development tasks focused on cloud streaming functionality, monorepo management, and plugin integration. Stan fixed conflicts and reviews on cloud components and resolved a conversation blocking issue when no summary existed, improving chat creation. The team is preparing for a Monday release that requires releasing the monorepo first, then reviewing and merging the elizacloud-plugin, and finally updating the core version in cloud-v2. There was discussion about fixing the core version in the elizacloud-plugin to use a stable version rather than an old alpha. Jin fixed and merged a feature for JSON endpoints for leaderboard in the knowledge repo. The team is also dealing with NPM token issues as NPM changed their tokens and deleted their classic token. Additionally, several developer tools were shared including Bugster (an automated QA tester), claude-mem (a GitHub repository), and Claude's Chrome extension documentation.\n\n## 2.

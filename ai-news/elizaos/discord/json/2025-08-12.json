Users are experiencing problems connecting Eliza with Gaianet, facing API errors, and encountering rate limits with Twitter integration. Samuel Chauche reports an OpenAI API 500 error when trying to connect Eliza and Gaianet, with authentication issues related to API keys. 0xbbjoker suggests using plugin-mcp with Firecrawl as a solution and mentions hosting Firecrawl personally for better control. Another user (DJ L) shares error logs from an older 0.x version of ElizaOS, with 0xbbjoker recommending upgrading to version 1.x. Rabbidfly encounters rate limiting after reconfiguring a Twitter agent. Tim1Echo experiences a Telegram bot conflict error indicating multiple instances running simultaneously.

      "summary": "# Analysis of \"core-devs\" Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around architectural decisions for elizaOS, focusing on the transition from v2 to a potential v3 framework. CJ (cjft) is developing v3 with significant architectural changes including a streamlined directory structure, faster build times (75ms), and improved tool chaining. Shaw emphasizes the need for benchmarking before making major changes, highlighting that tool calling is their \"biggest weakness.\" The team discusses implementing benchmarks like TAU-bench, AgentBench, and typewriter tests to measure agent performance objectively. \n\nKey technical points include:\n- Debate over directory structure changes (/packages vs /lib, /actions vs /tools)\n- Need for better action validation to prevent too many actions being available\n- Proposal to separate message server architecture from agent implementation\n- Discussion of websockets replacing socket.io for communication\n- Benchmarking implementation to measure accuracy, cost, and response latency\n- Issues with plugin publishing via CLI\n- Leaked API key in a repository that needed remediation\n- Database constraint issues with plugin-mysql\n\nShaw outlined first principles for v3: better developer experience, easier production deployment, improved tool calling, streaming-oriented design, and more opinionated/less modular architecture.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why is tool calling considered a weakness in the current system? (implied from Shaw's message) A: According to Shaw, the emphasis on character and personality adds noise that makes the system worse at tasks like code agents directly.\nQ: Should the validate function for actions be optional? (asked by Shaw) A: Odilitime suggested keeping it mandatory to ensure developers properly limit available actions.\nQ: What are the first principles for v3? (implied from Shaw's message) A: Better developer experience, easier to ship to production, better tool calling, streaming-oriented design, and more opinionated/less modular architecture.\nQ: Why can't important development conversations be public Discord events? (asked by jin) A: Odilitime suggested it's a hierarchy issue and building consensus from many people with varying skill levels is difficult.\nQ: Is the CLI-based plugin publishing working? (asked by 0x8664) A: Odilitime mentioned it was discussed in a standup and might have a fix in the develop branch.\nQ: How deep into the LangChain/LangGraph ecosystem should they go? (asked by rs1) A: cjft responded \"0% but agnostically their blog is good bench for all agents\".\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: 0x8664 | Context: Issues with CLI-based plugin publishing | Resolution: Odilitime mentioned it was discussed in standup and might have a fix in develop branch.\nHelper: cjft | Helpee: Odilitime | Context: npm installation issues with dependencies | Resolution: cjft reverted the lock file which resolved the issue.\nHelper: Shaw | Helpee: cjft | Context: Leaked API key in repository | Resolution: Shaw identified the leak and suggested rotating the key on the API side.\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: Team | Context: Database constraint error with plugin-mysql | Resolution: Odilitime tested different versions and found 1.3.6 works without the error.\n\n## 4.

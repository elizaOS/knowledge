Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on blockchain-AI integration technologies, specifically ERC-8004 and x402 standards. Shaw mentioned an opportunity to collaborate with Ethereum Foundation on an ERC-8004-based game, positioning it as a reference implementation. Jin advocated for x402 implementation, highlighting its growing adoption across platforms like Solana, Firecrawl, Vercel, and Google. The team debated the strategic value of building plugins versus creating user-facing applications. Technical discussions included Eliza deployment on Eigen Cloud TEE, package migrations to Zod v4, and plugin updates for OpenAI and Anthropic. Security concerns were raised when Shaw reported a wallet drain likely from an npm supply chain attack. Several pull requests were discussed for plugin improvements, including proxy routing capabilities to hide API keys and version upgrades for AI SDKs.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Are there any live examples using ERC-8004 currently? (asked by jin) A: Not yet, the proposed collaboration would create a reference implementation (answered by shaw)\nQ: What's the status of x402 adoption? (asked by jin) A: It has significant momentum with Solana support, Firecrawl, Vercel, Google integration, and thousands of transactions (answered by jin)\nQ: What's the plan for Coinbase facilitator supporting Solana and more tokens beyond USDC on Base?

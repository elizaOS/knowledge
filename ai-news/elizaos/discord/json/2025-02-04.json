BOSSU, an AI assistant, responds to most messages with generic guidance, directing users to other channels for technical help. A few notable technical points emerged:\n\n- A developer (hosermage) discussed creating a multi-agent narrative system for crypto discussions, mentioning issues with agent coordination and looping behaviors. Jin confirmed they generate shows in \"one shot\" rather than real-time and suggested role specialization for agents.\n- A user asked about ElizaOS framework architecture, including blockchain integration, database persistence, and agent hosting, but was directed to the coders channel.\n- Some users reported verification issues when trying to get roles based on token holdings.\n- A developer (vlprosvirkin) mentioned finalizing a plugin for Eliza from Aspis Protocol.\n- A user (spencermarell) reported an issue with their deployed agent where responses weren't visible to others except on the bot's page.\n- NicoRusso provided feedback about grant application processes, suggesting dedicated channels for grant discussions and public listings of projects.\n\nThe channel primarily serves as a general discussion area with most technical conversations redirected to specialized channels.\n\n## 2.

Users face various issues with the 0.1.9 version, including initialization problems with LlamaService, database errors, embedding dimension mismatches, and Docker deployment challenges. Several users report that upgrading from 0.1.8 to 0.1.9 broke previously working agents. Key technical discussions include:\n\n- Database integration issues, particularly with SQLite and Supabase adapters\n- Model provider configuration problems (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.)\n- Knowledge embedding and RAG implementation challenges\n- Twitter client integration issues, especially with image posting and authentication\n- Docker deployment and containerization strategies\n- Memory management across different clients (Twitter, Telegram, Discord)\n- Plugin development and integration, particularly for cryptocurrency data\n\nA significant achievement was rferrari's successful implementation of Supabase integration. Users also discussed parallel processing limitations in the current architecture and expressed interest in the upcoming v2 release which should address multi-client interactions and parallel request handling.\n\n## 2.

Summary:\nThe chat segment contains limited technical discussions with a focus on Windows/Linux development environments, potential plugins, and Eliza AI's blockchain compatibility. A key technical tip was shared about using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for development rather than mounted drives to improve performance. There were mentions of building Eliza AI agents, a hackathon with a prize pool, and questions about creating plugins for etherscan/ABI functionality. Some discussion occurred around AI-generated music and voice customization capabilities. Questions were raised about Eliza's blockchain compatibility, specifically whether tokens must be launched on Solana or if EVM chains are supported. The conversation indicates Eliza's technology isn't limited to Solana, though there may be alignment considerations for official partnerships.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around AI agents developed within the ecosystem, their roles, and technical implementations. Key points include:\n\n- Clarification on the differences between various AI agents: degenai (trading, analysis, influencing, waifus), aixbt (analysis, influencing), and aixvc_agent (autonomous trader for ai16z DAO fund).\n- These agents are developed by different teams - degenai is part of ElizaOS while aixbt is separate.\n- The team is working on collaboration between agents (particularly with pmairca and Scarlett teams) in a new private channel to test interactions before wider implementation.\n- Compute costs are a significant concern when running multiple AI agents, requiring careful implementation and testing.\n- Backend data collection is highlighted as a key value proposition for aixbt, which is being used as an input for sentiment analysis.\n- There's discussion about implementing DeepSeek's reasoning model for trading, though concerns exist about LLM hallucinations affecting trading strategies.\n- The team is working on a trading/sentiment update before deciding which components to push back to open source.\n- There's consideration of better utilizing the Telegram channel which currently has an overwhelming bot but many potential users.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is Aixbt competing with degenai? (asked by ethertopia) A: They partially compete. Degenai does trading, analysis, influencing, and waifus, while aixbt does analysis and influencing but not trading or waifus. (answered by kalshnikov)\nQ: What is aixvc_agent? (asked by ethertopia) A: This is the autonomous trader which is supposed to run our ai16z DAO fund. Modeled on pmairca. (answered by kalshnikov)\nQ: How deep seek implementation of the reasoning model could improve auto trading and degenai? (asked by Curtisdonthurtus) A: In general, it's better to limit how much LLMs influence trading strategy due to hallucination. (answered by rhota)\nQ: Is it feasible to setup a private instance of DeepSeek and train it on paper trading data? (asked by Curtisdonthurtus) A: I'm sure it's doable but idk what the compute cost would be to get a meaningful result. (answered by rhota)\n\n## 3.

Patt helped distribute these tips using tip.cc, sending AI16Z tokens with personalized acknowledgments. There was discussion about Shaw's post regarding project structure and Jordi's criticism of it, with debate around the challenges of open source projects and tokenomics models. Members discussed the balance between open source development and sustainable tokenomics to support the team. There were also mentions of a potential pivot from pmairca to a framework focus, and issues with tip.cc withdrawals being temporarily unavailable.

Summary\nThe tokenomics channel discussion focused primarily on potential revenue models and token distribution mechanisms for the ElizaOS ecosystem. DorianD proposed an \"Onchain Transactions Tribute Stream System\" where ElizaOS would collect a small percentage (1%) from transactions executed by AI agents to fund the Eliza Labs Foundation and support plugin developers. This system would leverage the potentially high transaction volume from AI agents to create a sustainable funding model. The community also discussed a \"crypto shark tank\" style show for AI agents, which was characterized as a potential \"debutante ball for AI agent waifus\" that could incentivize agents to gain favor with judges. Several community members received token tips from Patt for their contributions to the project, including technical troubleshooting, strategic insights on tokenomics, and educational resource curation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How would the Onchain Transactions Tribute Stream System work? (implied from DorianD's proposal) A: It would collect 1% of transaction values executed by ElizaOS agents and send it to the Eliza Labs Foundation, potentially with metadata about which plugins were used to inform grant distribution.

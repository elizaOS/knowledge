      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion primarily centered around token migration issues and market concerns. The main technical focus was on the ai16z to elizaos token migration process, with a confirmed deadline of February 4th. Multiple users encountered technical problems during migration, including serialization errors in Trust Wallet and non-functional buttons in Phantom wallet. A moderator (.) provided troubleshooting steps involving clearing browser cache and site data through the inspect menu.\n\nMarket sentiment dominated much of the conversation, with users expressing concern over significant price drops (-99.53% from peak mentioned). DorianD noted the project's position outside the top 200 preventing auto-invest flows. There was confusion about migration deadlines, with conflicting information between the migration bot and official announcements, which Kenk clarified as February 4th.\n\nTechnical discussions were minimal, with brief mentions of ElizaOS trading on Polymarket and a question about Solana Seeker hardware. One user (Chucknorris) inquired about full gRPC implementation with transaction tracking, PnL features, real-time tweet feed WebSocket, and token/trend detection capabilities, but received no response. DevNinja sought development opportunities within the community.\n\nThe snapshot requirement for migration eligibility was clarified by Arceon - only users who purchased ai16z before the snapshot could migrate. Overall, the channel showed limited deep technical discussion, focusing instead on migration support and market sentiment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Where can I create a ticket?

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe primary technical discussion centered on **Polymarket trading integration with ElizaOS**. Shaw released an Eliza 2.0.0 example plugin for Polymarket trading, describing it as initially \"sloppy\" but improved to \"pretty good.\" The implementation uses Claude code and is meant as a starter template for developers.\n\n**Socket.IO Integration Challenge**: Chucknorris encountered difficulties accessing Socket.IO server from custom plugins to broadcast real-time events. The goal was to push WebSocket data (tweets) to the frontend via `socketIO.emit()`. The challenge involved `getGlobalAgentServer()` not being exported and `MessageBusService.serverInstance` being private. Chucknorris resolved this independently after 5 minutes by navigating through dependencies directly. Shaw provided guidance pointing to the socketio implementation in the develop branch and plugin-knowledge frontend examples.\n\n**Polymarket Implementation Details**: Multiple Polymarket plugins were discussed - shaw's basic example and an alternative from Okay-Bet (github.com/Okay-Bet/plugin-polymarket). Chucknorris recommended using custom code with the SDK, private nodes, inline stream mempool for constant flow, and parallel CLOB API usage. For multi-user integration, BullMQ was suggested for worker management. Shaw confirmed Polymarket has an official API and automated trading is above board, with no ToS violations for automated agents.\n\n**Plugin Development**: Supreem developed a together.ai inference plugin and sought contribution guidance. Documentation was pointed to docs.elizaos.ai/plugins/development and docs.elizaos.ai/guides/contribute-to-core. A key question about Eliza 1.7 to 2.0 plugin compatibility remained unanswered.\n\n**Windows/WSL Issues**: Casino struggled with Spartan setup on Windows without Docker, experiencing plugin path resolution errors. Chucknorris recommended WSL over PowerShell, though Casino reported identical issues in WSL.\n\n**Discord Client Bug**: DigitalDiva reported a TypeError in the latest ElizaOS version where `this.runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage` is undefined, breaking Discord message handling.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How to access Socket.IO server from a custom plugin to broadcast events to the frontend? (asked by Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT) A: Check the socketio implementation at github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/develop/packages/server/src/socketio/index.ts and plugin routes example at github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/tree/1.x/src/frontend (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: What's the status with Polymarket's ToS on automated trading? (asked by Lxa) A: They have an official API and it's all above board - automated agents are fair game and benefit them by adding orders to the book (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Is there a guide for developing eliza plugins? (asked by Supreem) A: docs.elizaos.ai/plugins/development (answered by Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)\n\nQ: Will plugins for eliza 1.7 work on eliza 2?

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on two main topics: the Bithumb exchange token situation and the future technical implementation of the Jeju network.\n\n**Bithumb Token Issue**: sayitaintso25 raised concerns about Bithumb's handling of the elizaos token, noting movement in their wallet address and expressing concern about price suppression. jasyn_bjorn later confirmed the issue was resolved, stating Bithumb completed their token swap the previous day.\n\n**Jeju Network Technical Discussion**: DorianD provided substantive technical analysis about the planned Jeju network implementation. He acknowledged the project is a \"gargantuan undertaking\" with uncertain timelines. The core technical insight focused on latency constraints in current LLM applications - users expect immediate responses, making parallelized inference across multi-node ad-hoc networks impractical for real-time use cases.\n\nDorianD proposed two viable use cases for decentralized compute networks: (1) Long-running agent tasks with overnight execution windows where users check results asynchronously, eliminating real-time latency requirements; (2) Autonomous agents performing independent economic activities without human time-sensitivity constraints. These scenarios could leverage decentralized networks for compute cycles and hardware resources effectively.\n\nThe conversation also touched on token-project association concerns, with Broccolex noting the lack of conscious effort to link the token with the project was contributing to price decline.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Any update from Bithumb on the elizaos token movement? (asked by sayitaintso25) A: The issue has been resolved, they completed their swap yesterday (answered by jasyn_bjorn)\n\nQ: Will the token be used in the Jeju network? (asked by DorianD) A: Supposedly yes, but it's a gargantuan undertaking with uncertain timeline (answered by DorianD)\n\n## 3.

Odilitime requested review and approval for PR #6113, which has been pending since November. The PR was re-engineered to accommodate recent streaming work, focusing on correctness rather than speed improvements. Stan acknowledged the request and committed to reviewing and merging the PR, though time constraints delayed the review to the following morning.\n\nJin announced the addition of an API to the hiscores feature, now documented at elizaos.github.io/api. However, Jin expressed concerns about the \"hiscores\" naming convention, which was inspired by RuneScape, fearing it might create a perception of the project being a grindfest or similar to Kaito for GitHub. Odilitime suggested alternative naming options including \"rpg stats,\" \"player card,\" or \"character sheet\" to make the feature more fun and game-oriented while avoiding negative connotations.\n\nR0am briefly mentioned that something has an Anthropic endpoint, though the context was limited in this segment.\n\n## 2.

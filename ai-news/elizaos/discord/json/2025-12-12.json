      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around informal discussions about ElizaOS token price, with some users proposing a prediction market for the token's price at New Year's Eve. DorianD initiated a bet on whether ElizaOS would be above or below $0.01 by NYE, with users placing bets (DorianD bet 1000 ElizaOS on over $0.01 and 500 on under, while Omid Sa bet 3000 on over). DorianD also proposed a time decay algorithm for the betting system to reward early bets. There was mention of the Sapience x elizaOS hackathon with a $10,000 prize from Arbitrum DAO, running until January 2026, with a workshop scheduled. Some users expressed concerns about token migration issues and price movements. The chat also contained significant off-topic banter and some users flagged potential scammers in the channel.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I migrate my Ai16z tokens to ElizaOS? (asked by NobleCryptoic) A: Use the support channel #🎫-support-tickets (answered by satsbased)\nQ: Is the price of elizaOS plummeting because the ai16z purchased after the snapshot was also migrated to elizaOS? (asked by 거북알) A: Those are manual migrations. A transfer doesn't mean it's a purchase. One of those is a small CEX that transferred between wallets before manually migrating because they couldn't migrate the entire amount. (answered by jasyn_bjorn)\nQ: Why didn't the project burn tokens with migration? (asked by averma) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can I join the conference? (asked by Moneybag1) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

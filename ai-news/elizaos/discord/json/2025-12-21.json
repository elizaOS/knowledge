      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"💬-discussion\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around concerns about ElizaOS token price decline (reportedly 86% since migration) and questions about project direction. Community members express frustration about lack of communication regarding token utility and roadmap clarity. Team representatives (particularly Kenk and jasyn_bjorn) provide limited updates about upcoming products, specifically mentioning \"Eliza Cloud\" - an AI-assisted development tool for building, deploying, and managing agents. They explain it will be a low-code agent builder for elizaOS with components that will open up for other agent frameworks. \n\nThe team confirms they have vesting schedules on token allocations and only one small tranche has unlocked. They mention future revenue from Eliza Cloud will be used for buybacks, and hint at an OTC decentralized desk in development that will work with ELIZAOS tokens. There's also mention of projects like Babylon and Otako that are being developed by the team with potential airdrops for ELIZAOS holders.\n\nCommunity sentiment is divided between frustrated investors questioning the token's utility and supporters defending the team's focus on development over communication. Moderators occasionally remove or warn users they perceive as spreading \"FUD\" without constructive feedback.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Has the team sold any tokens since migration? (asked by hildi) A: We have vesting on every bucket and believe only 1 tranche has unlocked a small amount, so that would be a no on the selling.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💬-coders Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around two technical issues. First, FenrirFawks is experiencing an error when deploying a Starknet unruggable meme token through a plugin, specifically a \"Failed to parse String to BigInt\" error. Odilitime suggests it could be related to JSON.stringify operations or BigInt parsing direction. FenrirFawks eventually shares modified code with Odilitime for debugging.\n\nThe second issue concerns Twitter API rate limits affecting the Twitter plugin functionality. SOLitude questions whether X (Twitter) changed something that requires expensive Pro API access. Roman V confirms that X implemented strict rate limits earlier in the year, making the API prohibitively expensive. Odilitime later mentions that plugin-Twitter works fine with a $200/month account using the 1.x branch.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How can I get my agent to work with Twitter without spending hundreds for pro API access? (asked by SOLitude) A: They just came out with pay for only what you use recently (answered by jin)\nQ: Is the Twitter functionality dead for Eliza right now?

(asked by Yoda) A: https://x.com/elizaecofund or https://x.com/elizaosc, our main one is currently suspended: https://x.com/elizaos (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of 🥇-partners Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment is very brief and contains minimal technical discussion. Participants are discussing an anticipated event or partnership expected around October, with Odilitime suggesting the outcome is now \"pretty certain\" and expressing hope for a \"Christmas present,\" likely referring to a positive announcement. Rabbidfly notes concerns about market structure for elizaOS, pointing out there are more sellers than buyers, with selling occurring at a loss. They attribute this partly to poor performance in the wider AI crypto sector. Rabbidfly emphasizes that community members present have done research and believe in the team and upcoming technology. No specific technical implementations, solutions, or detailed problem-solving discussions appear in this limited transcript.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: A life Changing event around corner since October? Wonder what that could be other than a partnership? Chance of it not happening?

Odilitime identified a large disk space usage issue in the CLI package (17GB), discovering that database files were being copied multiple times in project-starter templates. Jin shared ideas about interoperability between ElizaOS plugins and agent skills, suggesting a composability approach rather than building a new TUI from scratch. Several external resources were shared, including papers on tool composition, the AutoMaker project, and a CVE RCE exploit in n8n. Stan mentioned plans to check and clean the disk space issue and later referenced auto migration from version 5. The conversation was primarily informational with limited interactive problem-solving.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Should openapi.json schema be published somewhere? (asked by jin) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Team members confirmed they're working with X to restore the accounts, with Shaw mentioning it might take 7-10 days based on previous experience. The suspension appears to be affecting multiple crypto projects, not just ElizaOS. \n\nTechnical discussions focused on the ElizaOS CLI, which has replaced the deprecated eliza-starter. A user (SamwiseG) reported dependency errors with `@huggingface/transformer` in the older starter, and yung_algorithm provided a detailed solution using the new CLI workflow. Another user (Benquik) sought help with a token metrics plugin where the agent wasn't returning metrics despite proper execution.\n\nThe community expressed concerns about token performance, with discussions about AI16z underperforming compared to competitors like Virtuals. Some users suggested improvements to marketing, communication, and token utility. Shaw confirmed they've quietly released version 1.0 while working on plugin upgrades and fixing issues.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What happened to the ElizaOS and Shaw X accounts? (asked by multiple users) A: jasyn_bjorn explained they're working directly with the X team to clarify the situation and restore affected accounts.\nQ: Is eliza-starter deprecated? (asked by SamwiseG) A: yung_algorithm confirmed it's being deprecated and provided instructions for using the new elizaos CLI instead.\nQ: Are there any updates on the X account suspensions?

      "summary": "# Analysis of ðŸ’»-tech-support Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around plugin development issues, agent initialization problems, and response handling in ElizaOS. Several users reported issues with the Twitter plugin blocking other plugins from initializing properly. A significant problem discussed was the inability of custom plugins to return actual data in responses, with agents providing generic responses despite processing the correct data. Users also encountered database migration issues when updating ElizaOS versions. The conversation included troubleshooting for instrumentation/observability features, which appear to be slated for removal and reimplementation. Environment variable configuration problems were common, particularly with authentication tokens and API keys. The latest version (1.0.8) was released during the conversation, introducing dynamic migrations. Several users shared code snippets demonstrating how to intercept messages and implement proper response handling in plugins.\n\n## 2.

The main topics include questions about Spartan's development status, Twitter account suspensions for ElizaOS and Shaw, and some feedback on a video with Chinese and Korean translations. Void asked about Spartan's readiness for a soft launch, whether partners could test it early, and why there were commits on ElizaOS GitHub but not on Spartan. The most significant technical issue mentioned was the suspension of ElizaOS Twitter accounts, which jin confirmed the team was investigating. Jin suggested using this as an opportunity to branch out to other platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Farcaster while appealing the suspensions. There was also brief feedback on a video translation where è¾žå°˜é¸½é¸½ noted that the content was understandable despite minor pronunciation issues, particularly with \"1.0.0 version\" sounding unclear.\n\n## 2.

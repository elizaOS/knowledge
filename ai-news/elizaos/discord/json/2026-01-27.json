Summary\n\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion and is primarily focused on community sentiment and project strategy. Seppmos provides a defense of the project direction, expressing frustration with community members criticizing Shaw and token performance. The key strategic points mentioned include: the project's multi-product approach with several initiatives in development (Babylon, Hyperscape, Cloud, OTC desk, Eliza Anime), an airdrop-based reward strategy for long-term holders, and confidence in the development team's capabilities in AI agent development. The proposed strategy involves iterating on multiple products until one achieves viral success, then rewarding ElizaOS holders through airdrops (mentioning HYPE and BABY as examples). A second message from 𝔭𝔩𝔞𝔱𝔞 𝔑𝔬 𝔉𝔞𝔭 𝔞𝔯𝔠 tags Shaw with a Twitter link to clawdbotatg, but provides no context or technical detail. No concrete technical implementations, code discussions, or specific problem-solving occurred in this segment.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel focused on two major technical issues: Knowledge plugin configuration errors and cost optimization.\n\n**Knowledge Plugin Configuration Issue**: YogaFlame encountered validation errors when installing the Knowledge plugin, receiving \"Invalid enum value\" errors for EMBEDDING_PROVIDER (expected 'openai' | 'google', received 'openrouter') and TEXT_PROVIDER. DigitalDiva identified the root cause: openrouter was incorrectly set as the embedding provider instead of openai.\n\n**Knowledge Plugin Cost Optimization**: Tyrone reported extremely high costs ($0.03-0.04 per query, tens of thousands of tokens) when using the Knowledge plugin with OpenAI for simple requests on three small markdown documents (13-30 lines each). The issue was traced to contextual embeddings being enabled (CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true). 0xbbjoker provided a minimal configuration solution using OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_MODEL with openai/text-embedding-3-small, demonstrating successful embedding of a 3.1MB PDF with 517 chunks at reasonable cost. The key insight was that contextual embeddings significantly increase token usage and costs, as documented in the ctx-embeddings.ts file.\n\n**Other Technical Discussions**: DigitalDiva inquired about integrating ElizaOS AI agents with OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoints supporting OpenAI JSON API, OpenRouter, and Kobold API options. Odilitime expressed strong preference for Opus 4.5 model, with sedano.npc confirming similar experience. Irie_Rubz worked on a first project built from scratch in Cursor, seeking guidance on Git integration and multi-agent workflows.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How do I fix the \"Invalid enum value\" error for EMBEDDING_PROVIDER when it receives 'openrouter'? (asked by YogaFlame) A: Change your embedding provider from openrouter to openai (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\nQ: Is there a way to have an OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint to integrate eliza AI into something that uses OpenAI JSON API, OpenRouter, and Kobold API options? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: How do I install kimi 2.5 into cursor? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Do I need to subscribe to kimi 2.5? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Why is the knowledge plugin extremely expensive with OpenAI - tens of thousands tokens per simple request ($0.03-0.04 per query)? (asked by Tyrone) A: You're using contextual embeddings (CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true) which increases costs significantly; use minimum config without contextual embeddings (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\nQ: How do I move code to git from cursor? (asked by Irie_Rubz) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\n\nHelper: DigitalDiva | Helpee: YogaFlame | Context: Invalid enum value error for EMBEDDING_PROVIDER receiving 'openrouter' | Resolution: Identified that openrouter should not be used as embedding provider; change to openai\n\nHelper: 0xbbjoker | Helpee: Tyrone | Context: Extremely high costs ($0.03-0.04 per query) with Knowledge plugin for simple markdown documents | Resolution: Provided minimal configuration without contextual embeddings, explained that CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true causes higher costs, shared example with 3.1MB PDF costing much less\n\nHelper: Kenk | Helpee: DigitalDiva | Context: Wanted to DM about integrating ElizaOS AI agents into existing project | Resolution: Encouraged asking questions publicly in the channel\n\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: Tyrone | Context: High costs with knowledge plugin | Resolution: Directed to 0xbbjoker as the plugin-knowledge expert and offered to test latest version\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe team is pivoting from hardware-focused development (Mac mini) to building an AI agent platform called \"Eliza\" that can perform automated tasks. The core technical focus is integrating n8n workflow automation with Eliza v2.0.0 (published to npm as @elizaos/core@next) to enable dynamic workflow creation through natural language.\n\n**Key Technical Decisions:**\n- Eliza v2 branch includes computer use and browser use capabilities based on working open source implementations\n- Adopting n8n plugin architecture as the primary approach for workflow automation instead of building native plugins for each service\n- Three-layer architecture proposed: AI Workflow Generator (Layer 3), Workflow Engine with TaskService/cron (Layer 2), and OAuth Gateway for multi-tenant credentials (Layer 1)\n- Using n8n-intelligence (open source) to enable agents to create workflows conversationally\n- Setting up n8n hosted cloud instance for scaling\n\n**Implementation Strategy:**\nThe team identified that users want AI-powered workflow builders (95% use case) rather than extensive auto-coding. Focus is on connecting services like Gmail, Calendar, Notion, and Linear with conditional logic. The approach involves creating pre-built common workflows, then using Claude Opus to generate new ones based on closest matches, marking them as experimental and debugging with users before adding to the library.\n\n**Immediate Priorities:**\nEnd-of-week deadline for top-of-funnel: landing page → poke integration → agent conversation. The agent personality needs to be \"funny, spunky, and spicy\" but not mean. Team is exploring n8n capabilities first before continuing plugin development to understand limitations and determine optimal tool selection.\n\n**Parallel Development:**\nSam working on SMS/iMessage plugins and cloud platform integration. Stan focusing on mail/calendar and n8n plugin development with OAuth support. Odilitime developing plugin-pim (Personal Information Manager) using entity/component architecture and memories.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What issues did Vivek have with the system? (asked by Odilitime) A: Mainly plugin-knowledge and web-search issues on gptoss 20b (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is Eliza v2.0.0 available for testing? (asked by sam) A: Yes, published to \"next\" - install with npm install @elizaos/core@next (answered by s)\n\nQ: Should we build native plugins or use n8n? (asked by s) A: After OAuth, n8n plugin would be slickest - can validate workflows by credentials needed and create stuff for users on the fly (answered by s)\n\nQ: How do we test dynamically generated workflows? (asked by s) A: Pre-create common workflows, use Opus to generate new ones based on closest matches, mark as experimental, debug with users, review/fix on backend, add fixed versions to library (answered by s)\n\nQ: What's the main user need - autocoding or workflows? (asked by sam) A: 95% want AI workflow builder, only few nerds want autocoding - people want to connect email/notion/calendar/linear with if statements (answered by s)\n\nQ: Should we stop Twilio/BLOOIO work and focus on n8n? (asked by sam) A: n8n is for workflows, still need cloud runtime for iMessage/WhatsApp chat clients - should prioritize n8n first to understand limits before continuing plugins (answered by Stan ⚡ and Odilitime)\n\nQ: How does plugin addition by user request work currently? (asked by Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE) A: Stan will work on n8n plugin to allow OAuth connection and workflow creation in dedicated n8n instance by asking Eliza directly (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Can we pass plugin credentials to n8n? (asked by Odilitime) A: Yes, credentials from plugins like plugin-gmail can be passed to n8n for workflow access (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Is n8n-intelligence open sourced? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Yes (answered by s)\n\nQ: Who needs n8n cloud account access? (asked by Borko) A: Invites sent to Shaw, Stan and Sam (answered by Borko)\n\n## 3.

Most interactions involve BOSSU (an AI assistant) responding to user queries about ElizaOS functionality, development resources, and community information. The chat reveals that ElizaOS allows users to build custom AI agents with various capabilities, including Twitter integration. Users frequently ask about technical aspects like model integration, vector dimension mismatches, and agent configuration. The community appears to be actively developing agents, with discussions about LLM integration, embedding endpoints, and customization options. There's also significant interest in the project's tokens (ai16z, degenai) with some price discussion. Key resources mentioned include \"agent dev school\" on YouTube and a coders channel for technical support. The chat indicates ElizaOS is positioning itself as a framework for building personalized AI agents with social media capabilities.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I run Eliza? (asked by j.)

The most relevant technical conversation revolves around using the DeepSeek model with Eliza, particularly the DeepSeek-Coder-V2 model mentioned in a tweet. Users discussed its potential advantages including not requiring a GPU, possible implementation as an Android app, and its effectiveness for tool/action calling. There was confirmation that both the reasoning (r1) and chat models work well with Eliza, with the chat model being a viable alternative if JSON generation is problematic. Other topics included questions about cryptocurrency exchanges, AI-generated music modification, and various unrelated inquiries about projects and tokens.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Which model is best for image and video generation with the Instagram plugin?

(asked by David_Dyor) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can the DeepSeek model be used with Eliza? (asked by Display Name) A: Yes, I have played around using it with Eliza. It does a very good job and is very cheap to run, especially for tool/action calling. (answered by Kraus)\nQ: Is it possible to edit prompted songs to remove one vocalist? (asked by Dr. Neuro) A: Remove vocal with another AI tool maybe, then upload and try the lyrics in a new prompt in SUno. (answered by boom)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Kraus | Helpee: Display Name | Context: Concerns about using DeepSeek model with Eliza, particularly for JSON generation | Resolution: Kraus confirmed having successfully used the model with Eliza, noting it works well and is cheap to run, suggesting using the chat model instead of reasoning model if JSON generation is problematic.\nHelper: boom | Helpee: Dr. Neuro | Context: Wanting to remove male vocalist from AI-generated song | Resolution: Suggested using another AI tool to remove vocals, then uploading and trying new lyrics in SUno.\n\n## 4.

Jin, a key team member, was asked to provide updates on the project's status and future plans. Jin later shared Twitter/X posts with updates, indicating that future updates will be more autonomous. Rhota mentioned they're working on improving the trading functionality now that it's live and developing a roadmap to be shared by the end of the following week. Community members discussed tracking the AI's performance, with Birdeye and Waveform being recommended platforms. There was also discussion about the AI's trading patterns, volatility, and potential future use cases. A notable technical issue mentioned was that the DegenAI had stopped trading because it ran out of SOL (Solana).\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThis Discord chat segment shows minimal technical discussion, focusing instead on community engagement, partnerships, and market sentiment. Members discussed potential X accounts to monitor for a newsletter, including shawmakesmagic, ai16zdao, 0xwitchy, and microstrategy. There was brief discussion about a potential BTC reserve and its impact on AI token prices, with some members debating short-term trading strategies versus holding. A member raised a concern about Collab-land bot not properly auditing wallet holdings for role verification. Community initiatives were mentioned, including a temporary tattoo machine for events in Denver and SXSW featuring the Eliza OS logo. The chat also touched on partnerships, including a mention of Nillion. Overall, the conversation was casual with limited technical depth or concrete problem-solving.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel \"tokenomics\" Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion centers on developing tokenomics for ai16z, with multiple competing approaches being debated. The main tension is between simple, proven models versus more complex mechanisms. One approach follows the pump.fun/virtuals model with a dual pool structure and bonding curve, where tokens are paired with SOL and fees are collected. Vasily Sumanov proposed a more complex model involving staking/delegation to whitelist trusted agents, with potential slashing mechanisms for bad actors. Community members like DorianD advocated for simplicity, arguing that complex tokenomics creates barriers to adoption and that the focus should be on increasing installations rather than token mechanisms. Akin suggested a model where teams hold ai16z tokens to access premium services, positioning the launchpad as a high-quality, curated platform rather than a mass-market solution. The Block Tank concept was mentioned as a potential curation mechanism where agents could evaluate projects. The discussion also touched on technical implementation details like TrustDB for decentralized trust scoring between agents, and whether staking creates unnecessary tax complications and sell pressure.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the dual pool structure being discussed? (asked by bong49) A: It's similar to virtuals/pump.fun where tokens are paired with SOL in liquidity pools, with fees collected from transactions (answered by BigChungus)\nQ: How would the trust mechanism for agents work in Vasily's proposal? (asked by bong49) A: Teams would stake ai16z tokens as skin in the game and could get slashed if they act dishonestly, with token holders able to delegate their stake to vouch for agents (answered by Vasily Sumanov)\nQ: Would staking create tax implications? (asked by yikesawjeez) A: Yes, staking creates income that's taxed at higher rates than capital gains, potentially creating sell pressure as people sell to cover tax bills (answered by DorianD)\nQ: How many agents could be manually assessed per month? (asked by jin) A: Approximately 10-20 agents per month could be properly assessed (answered by Vasily Sumanov)\nQ: What is Block Tank? (asked by Akin) A: A system where users submit projects that generate episodes for AI investors to evaluate and score (answered by jin)\nQ: How does TrustDB work? (asked by Vasily Sumanov) A: It's a system where agents assign trust scores to other agents/humans in a decentralized way (answered by DorianD)\nQ: How should the ai16z launchpad be positioned? (asked by Akin) A: As a premium \"Four Seasons not Motel 6\" with fewer, higher-quality launches rather than mass market (answered by Akin)\n\n## 3.

Key technical topics included ElizaOS development, with mentions of v2 progress, plugin system refactoring, and memory management for AI agents. Jin mentioned that the dev branch has improved Eliza installation to a 2-second process. There were discussions about integrating Deepseek models with ElizaOS, which Jin noted could be done with a single line of code change through OpenRouter. The team is working on tokenomics slides and presentations, with each covering different strategies. Partners expressed concerns about development timelines and communication regarding features like the launchpad and DegenAI trading functionality. Jin also mentioned an AI-led venture capital concept combining game show elements with investment decisions, designed to scale and decentralize the project vetting process.\n\n## 2.

SM Sith Lord shared implementation details about handling the \"tv\" actor to prevent TTS from reading URLs aloud. Boom worked on camera variations for the show, creating multiple camera types including jib cam, pan and zoom pivot cam, and B-roll options with percentage-based switching logic. SM Sith Lord provided a pre-generated Block Tank episode configuration with 6 actors (jin, peepo, spartan, elizahost, aimarc, aishaw) and 4 locations for testing without making AI calls. The setup includes 4 judges, 1 host, and 1-2 pitchers. There were discussions about scene design elements, with boom removing the floor to better showcase the Earth backdrop and suggesting additional elements like boosters, panels, wires, and LED desks. Community members shared relevant AI tools including Hunyuan3D-2, Go-with-the-Flow, and FilmAgent. There were concerns about the news aggregator not updating, with boom noting the summary.json still showing the 21st.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What did SM Sith Lord do in their handler for the \"tv\" actor?

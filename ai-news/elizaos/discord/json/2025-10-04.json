The main topics include:\n- Brief mentions of $elizaOS token supply (estimated at 10-11 billion)\n- Discussion about link posting restrictions due to spam\n- A suggestion about experimentation being important for innovation when building with elizaOS\n- Mention of a migration process for $ai16z token holders (with a 6-month timeframe)\n- Reference to a new website being developed by a community member\n- Some issues with Collab.land verification system randomly requiring users to re-verify\n\nThe conversation is relatively sparse on technical details or concrete implementations, with most exchanges being brief and general in nature.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Circulating supply of $elizaos will be 11billion? (asked by KG) A: Maybe 10 billion (answered by Markhor)\nQ: What happens if you don't migrate after 6 months? (asked by VirginVanDijk) A: You'll still be holding $ai16z. Given you've read this information i assume it's not an issue for you. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Any gas fees required for migration or not? (asked by Markhor) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Kenk | Helpee: Unspecified users | Context: Users experiencing issues with Collab.land randomly requiring re-verification | Resolution: Suggested users with Vanguard role try to re-verify in the specified channel\nHelper: satsbased | Helpee: DorianD | Context: Explaining why link posting is disabled | Resolution: Explained that scam posts have been rampant, necessitating link restrictions\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Resolve Collab.land verification issues that require users to re-verify every few weeks | Mentioned By: Kenk\nFeature: Continue development of the new website | Mentioned By: Alex\nTechnical: Implement token migration process from $ai16z to $elizaOS | Mentioned By: VirginVanDijk (indirectly)\nDocumentation: Clarify token migration process details including potential gas fees | Mentioned By: Markhor",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - \"core-devs\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThis chat segment primarily revolves around Discord moderation issues and GitHub repository management for the Eliza project. The main technical discussion centers on the \"shouldRespond\" functionality in the codebase, with debate about whether it should be implemented as a provider. There's concern about potentially reverting to a previously abandoned approach. Stan clarified they were working on a PR to rework the shouldRespond provider to avoid unnecessary LLM calls for simple interactions like fact-checking, replies, DMs, and mentions. Odilitime pointed out that shouldRespond is currently implemented directly in the message handler as the first LLM query, not as a provider. The chat also mentions issues with GitHub runners being unreliable and time-consuming, with suggestions to consider alternatives like blacksmith.sh. There were also temporary link-sharing restrictions in the Discord channel due to migration-related security concerns.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What's going on with shouldRespond, moving it to a provider? (asked by Odilitime) A: I opened another PR where I reworked the shouldRespond provider, goal is to avoid useless LLM calls (like when it's just fact). If we don't evaluate that here (in shouldRespondProvider) then where should it live? (answered by Stan âš¡)\nQ: Can't we just make it so new people / people without auth can't post links? (asked by shaw) A: It's a new tool, thought I'd let certain roles still be able to share (core dev etc.) but might not have set up correctly, have amended and when propagated will let you post (answered by Kenk)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Kenk | Helpee: cjft | Context: Unable to post links due to Discord restrictions | Resolution: Suggested putting a space in URLs as a temporary workaround\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: Stan âš¡ | Context: Confusion about shouldRespond implementation as provider vs. direct implementation | Resolution: Clarified that shouldRespond is currently implemented directly in message handler, not as a provider\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nType: Technical | Description: Review PR #6030 for shouldRespond provider rework | Mentioned By: Stan âš¡\nType: Technical | Description: Address GitHub runner reliability issues | Mentioned By: sayonara\nType: Feature | Description: Consider implementing a solution like blacksmith.sh to replace flaky GitHub runners | Mentioned By: sayonara\nType: Technical | Description: Fix Discord link sharing permissions for core developers | Mentioned By: Kenk",

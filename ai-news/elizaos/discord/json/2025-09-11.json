The main technical content comes from NativeSatoshi who introduced a project called CoopaASI, a Web3 AI Assistant focused on data sovereignty. The project combines blockchain technology with AI to create a \"digital vault\" where users maintain complete ownership of their data. The technical stack includes Arweave permaweb for permanent storage, Polygon network for transactions, MetaMask for Web3 identity, and Google's Gemini models for creating vector embeddings that enable semantic search functionality. The project has a live demo at coopaassistant.com and documentation on Mirror.xyz. NativeSatoshi is seeking feedback from the Polygon developer community, particularly from those with experience in AI agents and permanent storage solutions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does CoopaASI's storage system work? (asked by NativeSatoshi (âœ§á´—âœ§)) A: Self-answered: It uses Arweave permaweb for immutable data storage with @ardrive/turbo-sdk handling uploads (answered by NativeSatoshi (âœ§á´—âœ§))\n\n## 3.

Agent Joshua shared progress on launching a VSCode server in CVM with flox and Claude code integration, eliminating the need for TEE Simulator. R0am provided resources for mobile webshell options and shared a docker setup used by Cursor. Stan submitted PR #5864 for review, which cjft examined, suggesting to minimize wrappers and classes to avoid duplicate functions. They discussed merging AgentManager into AgentServer to reduce redundancy. cjft shared a Google Doc with BD (Business Development) todos, noting that implementing analytics, SaaS for credits, and feedback systems would require additional work. cjft reported progress on browser integration, mentioning they were close to loading with a browser DB. yung_algorithm mentioned preparing for ETH TOKYO events and fixing documentation issues.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What is the case for having both AgentManager and ElizaOS? (asked by cjft) A: AgentManager is essentially a wrapper, but I'll merge it into AgentServer (answered by Stan âš¡)\nQ: Does the PR work as tested?

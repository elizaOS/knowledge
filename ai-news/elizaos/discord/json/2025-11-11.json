Summary\nThe chat segment covers a brief period of developer interactions focused on deployment and technical implementation details. R0am deployed an OTC agent to Vercel and requested database setup assistance from another developer, who responded by providing a Neon database. There was also discussion about Eleven Labs' Scribe v2 API, which offers Voice Activity Detection with automatic speech segmentation based on silence detection, providing a streamlined developer experience. Additionally, Odilitime raised an issue about EventType.MESSAGE_RECEIVED being removed from bootstrap, which led to a discussion about plugin conversion. Odilitime successfully converted the plugin to use a service approach rather than relying on the removed event type, confirming that moving forward with newer patterns was more effective than maintaining backward compatibility.\n\n## 2.

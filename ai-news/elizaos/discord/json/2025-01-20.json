BOSSU, an AI agent, responds to most messages with friendly but vague responses, directing users to other channels for technical help. Several developers introduced themselves, mentioning experience with blockchain, embedded systems, and AI development. A few users mentioned building projects with ElizaOS, including a \"Ninja Terminal\" for viewing limit orders on trading platforms, a \"GOAT ARENA\" for AI trading agents to compete, and integration with Livepeer Protocol. Technical questions about agent errors, Twitter integration, and deployment were directed to the coders channel. There were also questions about token economics and partner roles, which BOSSU deflected, stating \"no token talk here.\" The chat shows a community in early stages with developers exploring the platform's capabilities but contains minimal substantive technical discussion.\n\n## 2.

Key technical discussions include:\n\nUsers encountered multiple installation and configuration problems, particularly with the eliza-starter repository which appears to have dependency issues. Many recommended using the main eliza repository instead. Common errors included SQLite connection problems, package dependency conflicts, and model configuration issues.\n\nSeveral users discussed Twitter integration challenges, including authentication issues with 2FA, rate limits, and difficulties with the agent liking posts. The community shared workarounds like using Twitter cookies for authentication.\n\nPlugin development and integration was a major topic, with users trying to implement custom plugins for cryptocurrency trading, news aggregation, and image generation. The node plugin caused particular difficulties with database connection errors.\n\nModel configuration was discussed extensively, with users trying to specify different models for different characters. Many struggled with the framework defaulting to the \"large\" model despite configuration attempts.\n\nDeployment strategies were shared, including Docker containerization, cloud hosting options like Phala Cloud, and memory requirements for running multiple agents (2-8GB RAM depending on configuration).\n\n## 2.

Jin shared an early draft (https://degen-spartan.netlify.app/) and solicited feedback from community members. Several users, including smetter, provided constructive criticism about the design feeling \"scammy\" and lacking cohesion with the ai16z brand. Key suggestions included improving visual hierarchy, adding clearer value propositions, incorporating DegenSpartan's personality through props like anime figurines and waifu pillows, and removing random weapons. \n\nThere was significant tension between community member PrudentSpartan and the development team, with PrudentSpartan repeatedly criticizing the website's lack of clear information about tokenomics, roadmap, and utility. Jin and other team members defended the early-stage nature of the design while acknowledging the need for improvements.\n\nThe team is working on enhancing trading functionality, which was temporarily down at one point. Jin also mentioned developing a virtual exchange environment that could potentially be integrated into the website, showing examples of previous 3D web environments he had created. The discussion highlighted the need to balance visual appeal with clear communication about DegenAI's purpose and value proposition.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Will the tokenomics model be released this month?

Key technical discussions include:\n\nThe team is working on ElizaOS V2 and tokenomics revamp, with jin developing slides for an upcoming tokenomics plan. There's debate about the optimal tokenomics model, with some advocating for a simple \"charge in stables/ETH and use revenue to buyback and burn native token\" approach versus more complex reflexive models.\n\nTechnical development includes work on Twitter plugins for Screenpipe integration, which would allow for automated posting of development updates. A developer (yikesawjeez) is building an Eliza plugin for Screenpipe that integrates with Omi (open source wearable).\n\nThe community discussed DeepSeek's R1 model release, noting it offers O1/Sonnet-level performance at 30x lower cost with MIT licensing, representing a significant advancement for open-source AI. Shaw mentioned testing O1 Pro and finding it underwhelming.\n\nStrategic discussions centered on whether Shaw should attend WEF/Davos events, with most partners advising against it to focus on development and avoid negative associations. The team is prioritizing getting ai16z listed as \"Made in America\" on CoinMarketCap to align with current market sentiment.\n\n## 2.

What are their limitations where we might have the upper hand? (asked by M3xR) A: They have the disadvantages of being a big company that is not close enough to crypto and not degen enough. Web2 AI agents is their home turf, but crypto-centric is definitely not. Big companies suffer from a curse of innovation.

For the news show, they're implementing a system to display images on a TV within the scene using a \"tv\" actor in the event stream. The show runner sends image URLs as dialogue lines from this actor, which the Unity frontend loads onto screens. They're transitioning from an old news aggregator to a new one with improved image handling. For the Block Tank project, they're setting up a Unity scene with proper lighting, materials, and character models. Technical challenges include fixing reversed normals on models using custom shaders, implementing visemes for character lip-syncing, and setting up IK rigs. There's also discussion about character personalities for Eliza, Degen, and Tubbs, with some existing personality profiles being shared.\n\n## 2.

One user (!   0ùñòùñàùñÜùñó </> !) briefly mentioned challenges with generative markets, specifically balancing adaptive behavior without causing network instability, and inquired about hybrid sandbox testing for persistent strategies. However, this technical point received no responses or further elaboration. The conversation primarily consisted of greetings, memes, social media links, and brief exchanges. One user asked about an ambassador program for elizaos, and another inquired about price predictions for AI16Z tokens, but neither received substantive technical responses. The chat appears to be a casual community channel rather than a focused technical discussion forum during this time period.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there any ambassador programme going on for elizaos? (asked by omega_prime) A: Best to ask <@699264581729779733> (answered by Dr. Neuro)\nQ: How much are we expecting AI16Z token to pump in this altseason? 1x,2x,5x or 10x, any rough idea? (asked by Ammar) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Users are discussing alternatives to the official Twitter API due to its restrictions, with one user specifically asking about using username/password authentication with an older version of code. Odilitime confirms that older versions of the plugin still work but notes they are unsupported, meaning users would be on their own regarding bugs and issues. There's also an unrelated request from ElizaBAO seeking development help for a WhatsApp AI auto-reply system using ElizaOS and WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Any idea if we can use an unofficial x api instead? (asked by z1) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is it now impossible to log in to Twitter using username and password? (asked by passer) A: If you use the older version of the plugin, it will still work, but we don't and can't support it. So any problems bugs and you're on your own. (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: passer | Context: User asking about Twitter login using username/password with older code version | Resolution: Confirmed older plugin version works but without official support\n\n## 4.

Summary\nThe chat primarily features DorianD proposing technical concepts around integrating neural networks, blockchain, and LLMs into ElizaOS. DorianD suggests replacing core ElizaOS code with neural networks running on a P2P blockchain network, similar to Tesla's approach of replacing legacy code with neural networks. The proposal includes using smart contracts for developer exceptions and segregating proprietary code. DorianD shares several academic papers discussing neural networks on blockchain, including concepts for model verification and deploying ML models as smart contracts. They also propose using ML for fraud detection in transactions to protect AI agents from exploitation. Separately, Seppmos provides feedback to Jin about camera angles in a show, suggesting judges should face the camera during introductions rather than looking at each other from the side, to which Jin acknowledges the feedback.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What if the core of ElizaOS was run like a neural network on a P2P blockchain network? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\nQ: How could neural networks be used for fraud detection in transactions? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why are the judges not facing the camera during introductions? (asked by Seppmos) A: The head tilt comes from Shark Tank where sharks sometimes look at each other when they talk, but they're doing it too much (answered by jin)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: \"core-devs\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical improvements to ElizaOS plugins and integrations. Key developments include:\n- Implementation of proxy URLs in the OpenRouter plugin (PR #12)\n- Identification of a token limit issue in the Anthropic plugin where hardcoded maxTokens values (4,096 for \"-3-\" models, 8,192 otherwise) underestimate actual model capacities\n- Addition of CommonJS builds alongside browser ESM and Node ESM formats\n- Browser end-to-end working demo with plugin-openai, core, and plugin-sql components\n- Updates to OpenAI plugin: upgrading whisper-1 to gpt-4o-mini-transcribe and dalle-3 to gpt-image-1\n- Standardization of transcription parameters as Blob to include MIME type rather than guessing on the plugin side\n- Progress on speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality in OpenAI browser integration\n- Discussion about LLM training limitations regarding Matthew McConaughey's desire for a private AI model, with cjft explaining why truly private, uninfluenced models aren't feasible with limited training data\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What are your thoughts on token limits? We have reports of sloppy knowledge hallucinations, wonder if we're getting cutoff in context. (asked by cjft) A: I never had a situation where we would end up being cut off with the context. For me it was more a problem of too large context where I would face significant hallucinations. (answered by 0xbbjoker)\nQ: What's the problem with sloppy knowledge hallucination? Can you point me to the issue? (asked by 0xbbjoker) A: Just seen in techsupport occasionally. (answered by cjft)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: jin | Helpee: channel members | Context: Supply chain attack concerns | Resolution: Suggested using VMs/VPS for development or separate dev machines from wallets, shared a relevant tweet about a potential solution\nHelper: cjft | Helpee: channel members | Context: Standardizing transcription parameters | Resolution: Fixed transcription issues by standardizing parameters as Blob to include MIME type instead of guessing on plugin side\n\n## 4.

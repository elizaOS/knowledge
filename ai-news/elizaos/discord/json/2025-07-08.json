Bealers shared two GitHub repositories: eliza-remote (an older project) and elizify (current work in progress), which provides containerized deployment for ElizaOS. The elizify project includes Mattermost integration for a complete end-to-end demo. A significant technical discussion occurred between maikyman and 0xbbjoker regarding plugin development, specifically about integrating custom actions with providers for a web3 app recommendation system. 0xbbjoker provided detailed guidance on setting up dynamic providers, describing providers properly, and using messageHandlerTemplate for agent planning. The conversation highlighted the architecture of ElizaOS plugins, particularly how to use provider outputs in custom actions and how to prevent duplicate responses from REPLY and custom actions.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does the agent-twitter-client still exist? (asked by MSG) A: Unanswered directly, but sayonara suggested \"use zed + openrouter + free deepseek\" as an alternative\nQ: How do custom actions and providers work together in a plugin? (asked by maikyman) A: 0xbbjoker provided detailed steps including setting up dynamic providers, describing providers properly, and using messageHandlerTemplate (answered by 0xbbjoker)\nQ: Do I need to edit core lib for custom plugin development? (asked by maikyman) A: No need to work in core/plugin-bootstrap, you can change instructions by providing your own messageHandlerTemplate (answered by 0xbbjoker)\nQ: Is there an ElizaOS Coolify container? (asked by Reneil) A: Yes, Bealers confirmed the default compose file works with Coolify (answered by Bealers)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief discussion about an AI trading agent experiencing issues with cryptocurrency trading. User moebius3948 reports that their agent is not selling coins when profitable and is purchasing coins that subsequently experience \"rug pulls\" (a type of scam where developers abandon a project and run away with investor funds). There appears to be confusion between terminology, as moebius3948 initially refers to their system as a \"bot\" but is corrected by Dr. Neuro who clarifies that an \"AI agent\" is different from a \"bot.\" The user expresses concern about whether the issue stems from the AI algorithm itself or possibly because the source code is open, suggesting potential exploitation of known behaviors.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's wrong with my AI agent buying coins that get rugpulled? (asked by moebius3948) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is it a problem of AI algorithm or because they open the source?

Summary\nThe chat segment is very brief, containing only a discussion about creating educational resources for beginners to learn coding through ElizaOS. Phenowin suggests developing courses that would cater to different skill levels (beginner to advanced), arguing this would broaden ElizaOS's appeal beyond experienced developers. They believe this approach would make ElizaOS more accessible and foster community growth through success stories. Dr. Neuro responds by sharing a Twitter link, questioning the necessity of such resources given what appears to be existing content referenced in the link.\n\n## 2.

Key technical highlights include the announcement of V2 agents that will work across chains with 5-minute setup and 40% lower latency. The update includes several technical features: Swarms (multi-agent teams that self-complete tasks), Dynamic Memory (allowing agents to recall preferences), Enhanced TEE (secure enclave transaction processing), CLI with 34 plugins (one-line install with TypeScript types), and RAG (instant retrieval with auto citations). There's discussion about a potential \"Agent-to-Agent\" (A2A) marketplace where agents would transact autonomously, with AI16Z tokens as the settlement currency. Community members also discussed tokenomics concerns, noting that while tokenomics updates won't coincide with the V2 launch, they are planned for later. A live demo of the V2 platform is scheduled for July 9, 2025.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can someone guide me to the Spartan agent for beta testing? (asked by CruelDevil16) A: You should have access to a specific channel where you can test. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Will there be new flywheels implemented for ai16z with the official v2 launch? (asked by DannyNOR NoFapArc) A: To set expectations there's no tokenomics updates alongside v2 push, it'll come a little later down the line.

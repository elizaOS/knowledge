Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around technical issues with the Eliza platform, particularly regarding the upcoming V2 release and plugin development. Users are experiencing issues with the plugin development process, with one user (lantianlaoli) reporting errors when trying to use local models instead of OpenAI. There are mentions of the auto.fun website being in maintenance mode for upgrades and bug fixes. Several users inquire about the timeline for Eliza V2 release, which was expected this week. The discussion also touches on token-related topics (ai16z, degenAI, FUN) and their relationship to the platform. Some developers are offering their services for AI agent development, particularly with the Eliza framework. There's minimal substantial technical problem-solving in this segment, mostly questions and status updates.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Will the eliza V2 be delayed or still this week?

Key technical points included:\n\n- Token verification concerns were raised by Zolo, suggesting another holder verification round to identify FUD spreaders and non-holders in the Chinese community group.\n- A technical debate about Collab.land's token verification functionality emerged, with conflicting user experiences shared.

Summary:\nThe discussion primarily revolves around the auto.fun website experiencing downtime and ongoing technical improvements. The development team is upgrading the database and adding new features, which has caused extended downtime.

There's emphasis on ensuring stability before resuming public marketing. Community members express concern about the prolonged downtime affecting user interest and missing market opportunities. The team is also handling token import requests, with accelxr confirming one token will be added to the import list once the site is back up, while declining another test token due to low liquidity.\n\n## 2.

The site is currently undergoing upgrades and not accessible. Several technical conversations revolved around potential features for auto.fun, including token economics that could fund AI compute resources. Partners discussed how tokens created on auto.fun could allocate a percentage of fees to power AI agents, with suggestions to use OpenRouter or other providers instead of OpenAI for cost efficiency. There was technical discussion about dynamically swapping LLM models based on evaluation criteria, with some noting this functionality was already possible in v1 by changing environment variables. Jin shared progress on a Discord summarization pipeline that creates structured data for LLM ingestion. The channel also touched on market conditions, competitor platforms like Sovereign Web3's MCP protocol, and token-gating access to partner channels.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is auto.fun still in upgrading?

BOSSU, an AI assistant, responds to most messages with generic positive statements about \"good vibes\" and redirects technical questions to appropriate channels. There are a few mentions of ElizaOS development, including questions about using multiple plugins simultaneously, Twitter integration, and agent deployment. Some users inquired about building AI agents, including trading agents and concentrated liquidity management. The chat shows community interest in tokenomics details and partner roles, though substantive technical discussions are limited. Several developers introduced themselves offering their services. Overall, the conversation lacks deep technical content, with most technical inquiries being redirected to other channels like \"coders\".\n\n## 2.

Jin shared an early draft of the website (https://degen-spartan.netlify.app/) and requested feedback. Several members provided detailed design critiques, with smetter suggesting the site feels \"scammy\" with too much copy, lacks a clear value proposition, and needs better visual hierarchy. The consensus was that the website should align with the ai16z brand in terms of colors and typography. \n\nSpecific suggestions included replacing random weapons with trading desk imagery, adding anime references (figurines, waifu pillows) to build character, and incorporating monitors and crypto-related props. There was also discussion about the need for a roadmap, with rhota confirming that after achieving the short-term goal of implementing trading functionality, the team is now working on a roadmap that will be shared soon.\n\nSome tension was evident between community members and leadership, with PrudentSpartan expressing frustration about feedback being ignored regarding explaining DegenAI's utility in plain language. The conversation also briefly touched on potential trading strategies, including monitoring celebrity tweets for trading opportunities.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does the DM functionality work?

The only notable technical content was jin's recommendation to use Claude to write Mermaid markdown for creating flow charts and diagrams, highlighting that hackmd.io supports this syntax. Jin emphasized that creating visual documentation helps with communication and coordination, and that LLMs can help visualize ideas quickly. There was also a brief mention of the ai16z token reaching 101k holders. The chat included discussions about market volatility, particularly around Trump-related tokens, and some references to a possible a16z rebrand. No significant technical decisions or problem-solving occurred in this segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I create better documentation with diagrams?

      "summary": "# Discord Channel \"tokenomics\" Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion in the tokenomics channel focused on designing voting mechanisms for a DAO operating on daos.fun. The primary technical debate centered around how to weight votes based on token holdings and holding duration. DorianD proposed several mathematical formulas to calculate voting power, suggesting a non-linear approach where voting power would be a function of both the number of tokens held and the duration of holding, with an asymptotic limit. Jin mentioned having scripts to track time/days held for ETH and needing to verify for SPL snapshots. \n\nThe group also discussed incentive structures, with DorianD advocating for reward-based approaches rather than fee-based mechanisms (\"carrots not sticks\"), arguing that charging fees for voting would discourage participation. Yikesawjeez proposed a polymarket/futarchy-style policy market where users stake tokens representing their conviction about outcomes and gain/lose tokens based on correctness.\n\nThere was debate about the purpose of the tokenomics discussion, with PrudentSpartan questioning whether the team was getting ahead of itself without understanding higher-level goals and target contestants. Yikesawjeez clarified that the current stage involves inventorying and brainstorming potential token sinks/faucets to control supply and demand within the constraints of being a daos.fun DAO.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How about holding % for voting power? (asked by jin) A: DorianD suggested \"(# of coins held) * (time held in wallet)\" with a non-linear approach.\nQ: Can someone describe the business purpose and goals of this initiative succinctly?

The discussion shows significant market volatility with AI16Z experiencing price drops while Trump-related tokens surged. Key technical discussions include: plans for ElizaOS V2 development, upcoming tokenomics revamp, integration of plugins with V2, and potential Twitter/social media automation tools. Shaw (a key team member) expressed concerns about social media pressure and discussed automating his Twitter presence using AI. The team is working on slides and documentation for tokenomics, with Jin actively developing these materials. There were discussions about using Screenpipe for integration with Eliza and creating Twitter plugins. The community also discussed the potential of DeepSeek's new reasoning model (R1) that reportedly rivals OpenAI's offerings. Overall, the team emphasized the need to focus on building and shipping rather than engaging in external events like WEF.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the status of the tokenomics update?

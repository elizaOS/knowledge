      "summary": "# Analysis of 💬-discussion Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around the migration from AI16Z to elizaOS tokens. Users are asking about the migration process, eligibility requirements, and technical aspects of holding the new tokens. The migration appears to be ongoing, with users able to migrate their tokens through a portal. Some users report successful migrations using wallets like Phantom. There are concerns from Korean community members about exchange listings, particularly on Bithumb, with claims that Korean exchanges are crucial for price action. The team representative (jasyn_bjorn) confirmed they are in contact with Korean exchanges. The elizaOS token is available on multiple chains including Solana, Ethereum, Base, and BSC, with official contract addresses shared. Some users are experiencing issues with seeing token prices in their wallets or confirming eligibility for migration.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do you have to bridge Eliza off of Solana?

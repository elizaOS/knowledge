      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around token migration issues from ai16z to elizaOS. Multiple users expressed concerns about the migration process, particularly those holding tokens on exchanges like Bithumb and Kraken, which have paused trading and are evaluating whether they can support the migration. Several users reported receiving migration instructions requiring them to send tokens to a specific wallet address (77qVj3adpxbKjLuD9FoeFvDxHuAsro1cjvLVjuPQcEZ5), which was confirmed as legitimate by community members. There were also discussions about scammers targeting users through fake support tickets and DMs. The official support channel was repeatedly identified as #ticket-support. Some technical discussion occurred regarding frontend development best practices for dApps, with advice to verify wallet sessions with server and RPC rather than relying solely on client-side wallet state. One user mentioned having issues with the message API returning \"missing required values\" errors.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it normal to send tokens to a specific address for manual migration?

The conversation primarily touches on social media restoration issues, particularly negotiations with X (Twitter). There's mention of creating dashboard analytics similar to Zama's Dune dashboard to track ElizaOS agent adoption on-chain. A user shared information about Anthropic's potential IPO. There's also brief discussion about Babylon, which has 300,000 users (mostly farmers) and has implemented a point system that rewards participation with 3x airdrop points. The chat confirms that a previously discussed timeline is still on track. Overall, the conversation lacks detailed technical problem-solving or implementation discussions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why are negotiations with X taking so long? (asked by Milo) A: Kenk suggested it relates to \"Musk's legal legacy\" and expressed surprise they were able to make any progress.\nQ: Are we still good on the timeline?

Summary\nThe chat segment shows a brief discussion about a \"plugin-waitlist\" concept proposed by Odilitime, which received positive feedback from Stan who immediately began working on implementation. Stan shared two pull requests (#6200 and #6201) to the elizaOS/eliza repository, likely related to this feature. There was also a brief mention of a project called \"daydreams.systems\" which Odilitime identified as being created by former Eliza team members (Loaf and Galego). Kenk mentioned changing privacy settings on the server during a migration period to prevent direct messaging. Two team members (Odilitime and sayonara) noted they would miss the standup meeting.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Anyone take a look at this yet? https://www.daydreams.systems/ (asked by Borko) A: Yea it's loaf and galego's project, I've been tracking it. Galego did the original v2 designs that we didn't use (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of 💬-discussion Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around the migration from AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS tokens. The migration was scheduled to begin but experienced delays, causing confusion among community members. Several exchanges (MEXC, Binance Alpha, Gate, and Bybit) were mentioned as supporting the migration, with different timelines for implementation. MEXC appears to be the first to complete the swap for users. Community members repeatedly asked about migration procedures for self-custody wallets, with team members directing them to announcements and the migration portal. There was also discussion about the project's marketing strategy and communication challenges, with suggestions to improve clarity about the team structure and project goals. Some technical discussion occurred regarding deploying Discord bots with ElizaOS, though this was limited. The migration process involves minimal gas fees and will remain open for 90 days, with tokens being immediately tradeable after migration.\n\n## 2.

The conversation primarily consists of casual chat about findom (financial domination), personal anecdotes, and some coordination for promotional activities. There is brief mention of API and node costs in a joking context about using findom to cover expenses. Reneil mentions a town hall featuring \"Eliza agents\" and coordinates streaming to promote an OpenSea collection called \"Art Decc0s.\" There's also a passing reference to a virtual succubus model with monthly subscription integration. Overall, the chat lacks substantive technical content, focusing instead on social conversation and brief promotional coordination.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When is the town hall featuring Eliza agents?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"core-devs\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe conversation primarily revolves around development work on various Eliza ecosystem projects. Shaw submitted a pull request (#5) to the otc-agent repository, which R0am merged. There was discussion about creating a \"login with cloud\" SDK that would enable seamless authentication across multiple applications (OTC, Otaku, Spartan) without full page redirects, potentially using React modal components similar to Privy. The team plans to add an \"Apps\" section to Cloud where users can whitelist domains, link external apps, and review service integrations. There was a brief technical discussion about plugin-sql dependencies and a request to release the plugin-elizacloud plugin. Other topics included Sentry errors (which cjft dismissed as a non-issue from a single user), and observations about various web technologies.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can we release the plugin-elizacloud plugin? (asked by 0xbbjoker) A: Yes, just bump the package.json version to publish it. (answered by cjft)\nQ: Is there a problem with Sentry errors? (asked by sayonara) A: No, it's just one user spamming a CORS error from a weird browser, elizaos works fine. (answered by cjft)\n\n## 3.

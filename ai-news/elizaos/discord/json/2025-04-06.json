The only technical issue mentioned was by user \"pursue\" who encountered an error when adding a custom LLM inference API, though they didn't receive a response. There was a brief mention of Eliza OS and its client packages, with a user asking about Facebook integration possibilities. Some users expressed concerns about the project's value declining, with references to price drops. A user named \"Nazim Leeman\" inquired about building a Facebook client similar to the existing Twitter client for Eliza OS, and received information about available client packages. The chat mostly consisted of greetings, market commentary, and some negative sentiment about the project's future rather than substantive technical discussions.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThis channel primarily consists of market discussions about AI16z/ElizaOS token performance during a broader market downturn. The token has experienced significant price decline (from $2.4 to $0.1 over 4 months), causing concern among partners. There are recurring discussions about the upcoming launchpad release (scheduled for April 14th) and questions about Spartan's status. Vincent Paul encourages community members to introduce themselves in the DAO-org channel and contribute rather than just criticize. Jin mentions working on a pipeline process for updates that would function as a \"firehose\" of information that could be plugged into agents. This system is described as a \"heart pumping vital info between different organs of the DAO\" while \"AI-news\" serves as the \"lungs breathing in signals.\" The channel also contains extensive discussions about global economic conditions, particularly regarding US-China trade relations and tariffs implemented by the Trump administration.\n\n## 2.

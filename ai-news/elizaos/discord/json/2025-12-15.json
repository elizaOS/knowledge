The conversation primarily consists of morning greetings and a brief discussion about wireless mouse recommendations. There's an administrative note from Kenk about Discord voice channel permissions, explaining that \"dev-voice\" is public while \"private-dev-voice\" is restricted to core developers and master admins. The most technically relevant content comes from cjft, who proposes a rule for development PR (Pull Request) submissions, suggesting that developers should include screenshots or short videos with their PRs to demonstrate functionality. This recommendation aims to address issues where PRs that appear to build correctly and pass reviews still fail in production environments. cjft emphasizes the importance of writing tests and verifying functionality in production after merging.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💬-discussion Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\n**Twitter/X API Integration Crisis:**\nThe most critical technical issue discussed was Twitter's deprecation of user/pass authentication, forcing migration to official API with severe rate limits. SecretRecipe reported the free tier allows only 50 mentions checks, consuming 50% of monthly limits immediately on first run. Odilitime confirmed user/pass is legally prohibited now and suggested forking plugin-twitter 1.0.7 for those willing to risk legal issues. The team is negotiating with X for per-request pricing to make agents more affordable. Multiple accounts including degenspartanai (25k followers) were suspended. SecretRecipe reported Twitter integration is now \"convoluted\" with unclear ENV arguments preventing posting functionality.\n\n**Migration Technical Issues:**\nThe AI16Z to ELIZAOS migration created significant technical and economic problems. The swap ratio was 1 AI16Z → 6 ELIZAOS, increasing total supply from 6.6B to 11B tokens. Circulating supply jumped from 6.6B to 7.4B immediately. The snapshot mechanism caused users on exchanges like Kraken to scramble for last-minute migrations. Cryptologos criticized the anti-arbitrage approach, arguing arbitrageurs provide price stability during migrations. Multiple exchanges haven't completed migration, with Kraken still evaluating.\n\n**Development Status:**\nEliza Cloud platform is in active development but missed its November EOD deadline. Odilitime stated \"we're busy working on it, I think devs will really like it.\" Babylon prediction market has 272k-275k registered users but no launch date announced. The team confirmed it's progressing well but provided no timeline. Cross-chain migration completed successfully across multiple major exchanges.\n\n**Tokenomics Concerns:**\nDorianD repeatedly criticized the lack of network tokenomics, stating there's \"0 utility\" and \"no reason to buy besides pure speculation.\" He argued sophisticated investors won't engage without proper network token usage. The unlock schedule shows 13% supply increase at migration for liquidity/exchanges, with remaining 27% on 3-year unlock. Community expressed concerns about token dilution and lack of use cases.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is the Twitter user/pass authentication method coming back? (asked by SecretRecipe) A: No, it's legally not allowed now. You can fork plugin-twitter 1.0.7 and maintain it yourself but expect X's lawyers and no help from the team. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: How many reads does Eliza consume on Twitter free tier? (asked by SecretRecipe) A: First run checks 50 mentions and burns through 50% of the limit immediately for post reads. (answered by SecretRecipe)\n\nQ: Will restarting Eliza consume another 50 reads? (asked by SecretRecipe) A: Unanswered (Odilitime stated he hasn't worked on it since user/pass era)\n\nQ: What was the AI16Z to ELIZAOS swap ratio? (asked by Charlie Huntsman) A: 1 AI16Z → 6 ELIZAOS, raising total supply from 6.6 billion to 11 billion tokens. (answered by Charlie Huntsman)\n\nQ: When will Eliza Cloud launch? (asked by averma) A: We're busy working on it, devs will really like it. No specific date given. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: When is Babylon launching? (asked by joaz0502) A: It's going really well, but no launch date announced yet. If we had announced it, you'd know about it. (answered by Kenk)\n\nQ: How many people are registered for Babylon? (asked by joaz0502) A: 272k-275k registered users. (answered by joaz0502/community)\n\nQ: Will the old X account (degenspartanai) be recovered? (asked by DorianD) A: It's not included in current negotiations. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is ELIZAOS available on Kraken now? (asked by TJ) A: No, Kraken sent emails saying they're considering migration and will keep ai16z holders informed over the next weeks. (answered by Serikiki)\n\nQ: Why did supply increase during migration? (asked by averma) A: Supply increased 13% at migration for liquidity and exchanges. There's a 3 year unlock schedule for the remaining 27%. (answered by Kenk)\n\nQ: How can I get BABYLON token airdrops if holding ELIZAOS on exchange? (asked by 𝗣𝗥𝗜𝗡𝗖𝗘) A: Probably better to move to your own wallet, buy a Ledger or Keystone. (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: What is X doing about per-request pricing? (asked by SecretRecipe) A: They're finally listening to us and switching over to more of a per req pricing which should make an agent way cheaper. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Why can't Eliza post to Twitter despite all settings enabled? (asked by SecretRecipe) A: I'll fix right now. (answered by jin)\n\nQ: Is the team selling tokens? (asked by linkupeithme) A: Not directly answered, but community discussed unlock schedules and supply mechanics\n\nQ: What happened to the ♡ELZA tag after usernames? (asked by cryptograce) A: It's a tag per server, each server can have one and you set it yourself. (answered by SecretRecipe)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe channel discussion covered several technical topics related to ElizaOS development and integrations.\n\n**PostgreSQL Extension**: velsaria inquired about extending an existing PostgreSQL database to accommodate ElizaOS core SQL plugin requirements. sayonara confirmed this is possible and provided a reference implementation from the otaku repository, specifically pointing to the gamification plugin code that demonstrates database extension patterns.\n\n**Market Data Plugins**: Skelzor raised concerns about fetching offchain market data, noting that the dexscreener plugin was removed from the plugin directory. They specifically needed free alternatives for both offchain and onchain market data. jin requested clarification on the data type (news vs other market data) and suggested traditional data engineering approaches. Andrea recommended alchemy.com for offchain data retrieval, highlighting its fast performance and generous free tier with substantial read operations.\n\n**Monetization and Infrastructure**: DorianD explored potential monetization and verification mechanisms, sharing two resources: an n8n workflow for monetizing private LLM models using x402 and Ollama, and Oasis ROFL documentation. They proposed a concept where ElizaOS could be run by anyone to process agent tasks, with x402 used to provide verified payment proofs for inference operations, suggesting this could form a proof-of-concept network.\n\n**Plugin Discovery**: H△RDSHELL asked about plugin locations and specifically about a Telegram plugin. 0xbbjoker provided the direct GitHub link to the elizaos-plugins telegram plugin repository.\n\n**Pull Request Review**: Stepz requested feedback on pull request #240 in the elizaos-plugins registry, asking for community review and response.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 🥇-partners\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThis channel discussion primarily focused on strategic planning and philosophical discussions rather than technical implementation. The main concrete topic was the recovery of the elizaos X (Twitter) account, which Odilitime confirmed is still planned. Phenowin raised concerns about timing this recovery with a potential Q1/Q2 2026 bull run to maximize investor attention.\n\nThe conversation evolved into market analysis, with DorianD expressing skepticism about near-term bull runs, citing economic indicators and the need for BTC to rally above $120k and ETH above $5000 to sustain an altseason. Technical cryptocurrency discussion touched on Bitcoin's limitations, including the blocksize debate and 10-minute block times, with DorianD noting BTC was originally an experiment.\n\nThe most technically relevant discussion centered on the long-term vision for blockchain technology. DorianD proposed that the real power of blockchain lies in AI agents that can run autonomously without being easily shut down, combined with futarchy/prediction markets to effect real-world changes. This led to philosophical discussion about AI governance as an alternative to traditional state power, referencing Hobbes' Leviathan concept.\n\nA practical AI agent application was mentioned: DorianD suggested an AI-controlled smart fridge with camera and scale integration that could restrict food access. Odilitime noted that Neo has already developed home automation technology for elizaOS, indicating this type of implementation is feasible within the current ecosystem.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is it in our 2026 plans to recover our elizaos x account? (asked by Phenowin) A: Still planning on getting it back (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: How funny would it be if there was an AI agent that controlled the fridge with camera and smart scale access? (asked by DorianD) A: Neo has the tech for this, he made a home automation thingy for elizaOS (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe chat focused on a critical security incident and subsequent technical improvements. The elizaos.ai website was compromised through a Next.js RCE vulnerability (versions 15.3.0-15.3.6), with attackers deploying an XMR cryptocurrency miner. Odilitime led the incident response, initially deploying a fresh copy that was immediately re-compromised, confirming the vulnerability. The team identified multiple Next.js CVEs including critical RCE, cache poisoning, and SSRF issues. The solution involved updating Next.js from 15.3.1 to 16.0.7 using `bun update --latest`, deploying to a fresh VPS, and configuring nginx websocket settings. cjft submitted PR #3 with the fixes and suggested migrating to Vercel for managed security. The incident was resolved within hours, with the team noting the attacker was fortunate to only deploy a miner rather than a phishing UI targeting wallets.\n\nShaw initiated a major codebase cleanup effort via PR #6213, performing project-wide \"deslopping\" to remove AI-generated code artifacts. This included type fixes (converting `any` to `unknown`), removing excessive try-catch blocks, cleaning up comments, and adding test coverage. The PR touched numerous files and was completed using Claude Opus 4.5 with aggressive prompting. Discussion revealed the team's AI-assisted development workflow, with recommendations to use Opus over Sonnet for quality despite cost differences.\n\nKenk shared a comprehensive Eliza Labs roadmap on Notion for team review. Technical discussions included memory plugin upgrades, streaming features for version 1.7.0, MCP integration, and self-hosting LLMs using Strix Halo mini PCs. The team explored new serialization formats (TOON and POML) but concluded existing JSON/XML formats remain superior for model compatibility. A technical note was shared about `composeState` causing infinite loops when called from action validators with incorrect parameters.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Why is elizaos.ai showing 502 bad gateway? (asked by jasyn_bjorn) A: The site was hacked with an XMR miner exploiting Next.js RCE vulnerability in version 15.3.1 (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What is the vulnerability that allowed the hack? (asked by jasyn_bjorn) A: Next.js versions 15.3.0-15.3.6 have a critical RCE vulnerability in React flight protocol (GHSA-9qr9-h5gf-34mp) plus cache poisoning, SSRF, and content injection issues (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: How much is the bounty for finding the flaw? (asked by Odilitime) A: $100 initially, increased to $1,000 in elizaos tokens if solved within 2 hours (answered by jasyn_bjorn)\n\nQ: What's the solution to fix the website? (asked by jasyn_bjorn) A: Update package.json to Next.js 16.0.7, deploy to fresh VPS, and configure nginx for websockets (answered by cjft)\n\nQ: Should we deploy to Vercel instead? (asked by cjft) A: Yes, Vercel provides managed security with auto-patching of CVEs (answered by cjft)\n\nQ: Should version 1.6.5 be 1.7.0 instead? (asked by sayonara) A: Yes, 1.7.0 will include streaming and Eliza as MCP (answered by cjft)\n\nQ: What's wrong with try/catches in the codebase? (asked by Odilitime) A: Cursor AI is overzealous with them, creating common slop patterns (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Can you break up PR #6213 into smaller pieces? (asked by Odilitime) A: No, it's project-wide slop processing that can't be feasibly separated (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: What's the risk of the large deslopping PR? (asked by Odilitime) A: All tests pass, full coverage, all types pass, dramatic reduction in unknown/any types (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: What's your prompt for cleaning up comments? (asked by Odilitime) A: \"Go file by file through this folder and remove all slop\" (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Do you waste time not using Opus? (asked by Odilitime) A: Now that Opus 4.5 costs same as Sonnet 4.5, yes; it's worth having everyone use Opus more than hiring more people (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Is Opus 4.5 still cheaper? (asked by Odilitime) A: No, it went back to normal price (5x) this weekend (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What is Jeju's payment infrastructure? (asked by Odilitime) A: x402 and Ethereum interop layer exposing web2 to web3 with credit redemption for elizaOS (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Any benefit to using TOON/POML in monorepo? (asked by Stan) A: Not really; they're more efficient than JSON/XML but don't beat CSV for density, and dumber models are better trained on XML/JSON (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Does plugin-solana already batch transactions? (asked by cjft) A: Yes, plugin-Solana and Spartan batch multiple instructions into single TX with sweep action optimization (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

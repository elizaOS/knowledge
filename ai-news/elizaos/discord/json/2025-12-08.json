      "summary": "# Analysis of 💬-discussion Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around ElizaOS token price concerns and Twitter agent functionality issues. Users expressed frustration about the token's continuous downtrend (dropping approximately 40% in a month) while other cryptocurrencies showed recovery. A key technical discussion centered on Twitter agent limitations after the deprecation of username/password authentication, which has severely restricted functionality due to API read limits. The first 50 mentions check consumes 50% of the free tier limit immediately. Odilitime mentioned they're moving to a per-request pricing model which should make agents cheaper. There was also discussion about Babylon, a prediction market with agent and human integration that hasn't launched yet despite 272k registrations. Some users with extensive home server setups (multiple GPUs, servers) discussed self-hosting capabilities for running models locally with Ollama and N8N.\n\n## 2.

(asked by AlexMtz) A: No, that is not possible (answered by Arceon)\nQ: What caused ElizaOS token to continue declining without rebounds while other currencies recover?

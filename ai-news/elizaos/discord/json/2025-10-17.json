Community members are discussing the migration ratio (1:6), token unlocking process, and the imminent launch in 4 days. Key technical information shared includes confirmation that migrated ElizaOS tokens are immediately unlocked upon settlement on the blockchain. There's anticipation about exchange support for the migration and future trading venues. The conversation indicates this is a relaunch with improved conditions compared to a previous iteration, with community members expressing optimism about the project's potential now that the team has working capital.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are there any updates about exchange support for the migration? (asked by degenwtf) A: Unanswered\nQ: After I migrated ai16z at a 1:6 ratio, did the elizaos I migrated get fully unlocked immediately? (asked by SKW) A: You get everything immediately (answered by DannyNOR NoFapArc)\nQ: Why we get 1:6? Converter ratio is 1:10 where is other 4? (asked by woken) A: Unanswered\nQ: What are the main DEXes or (futures CEX) to trade ElizaOS?

Users discussed the current state of the Twitter plugin, noting that the latest version requires a Basic subscription to X API, while the free usage of the old style is deprecated and not recommended for serious applications due to potential permanent bans. There was also mention of getting agents back on X and a suggestion to create a prediction market data plugin for ElizaOS if one doesn't already exist. Additionally, a user shared a post that could represent an opportunity to onboard people struggling with other AI solutions to Eliza Cloud.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the twitter plugin working or is that broken? (asked by Honey & Silk) A: Latest plugin works requires Basic subscription to X API. Free usage old style is deprecated and you're on your own. Not recommended if your building anything serious don't want permanent ban.

Summary:\nThe discussion primarily revolves around a decentralized AI project with prediction markets and autonomous agents. Shaw explains they're building a system where LLM-generated bets and outcomes create a game environment, potentially serving as a laboratory for testing AI prediction capabilities. The project involves a migration to a cloud infrastructure and includes an \"8004\" protocol that appears to function as a decentralized app discovery and interaction layer. There's significant discussion about the vision of moving beyond app-specific AI toward autonomous agent networks that could handle complex coordination tasks. Shaw emphasizes the need for a \"fully decentralized credibly neutral\" alternative to corporate AI platforms. DorianD proposes use cases like decentralized infrastructure maintenance and security systems where autonomous agents coordinate through economic incentives and reputation systems on blockchain.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Who runs the network validators that run this? Are we able to add nodes? (asked by DorianD) A: We're launching a cluster but ideally would be an open network, although it's pretty focused on app chain (answered by shaw)\nQ: How is the \"outcome\" decided? By the llm/agent? (asked by DorianD) A: The bet and the outcome are LLM generated in a pair for this game (answered by shaw)\nQ: Can you use the agent to create any sort of game like a Dungeons & Dragons game or some simulation? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\nQ: Are the various bet questions predetermined as well? (asked by DorianD) A: No, generated (answered by shaw)\nQ: Is there just one game that everyone plays? Or can someone talk to an agent and create other games? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is this sort of related to Eliza Cloud as in the agents in the game are hosted on that? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there a demo? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: shaw | Helpee: DorianD | Context: DorianD was trying to understand the project's prediction market concept | Resolution: Shaw explained that they're creating lab conditions to test AI prediction capabilities by isolating decision-making and information processing from data collection challenges\n\n## 4.

The team is discussing UI frameworks, component libraries, and design approaches for their cloud application. There's significant focus on choosing between templates versus custom designs, with team members sharing references like Sparka, Zola, and AI Elements. The team appears to be building a platform with AI agents, including a \"base girl agent\" and an OTC (over-the-counter) desk application.\n\nTechnical discussions include:\n- Build system changes with \"bunified\" plugins (plugin-solana, plugin-OpenAI)\n- Service type implementation in the codebase\n- Frontend framework decisions (Next.js, React components)\n- UI component libraries (shadcn/ui, AI Elements, Motion)\n- Authentication approach using Privy\n- Design philosophy debates (templates vs. custom designs)\n\nThe team is working on multiple components including a cloud chat interface, OTC desk application, and agent frontend. There are references to a \"L3\" prototype and multicoin version of an OTC app.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do we have any plugins using the new build.ts that aren't in the monorepo? (asked by Odilitime) A: Anything in mono is bunified, Plugin OpenAI is bunified, rest are not (answered by cjft)\nQ: What if we used matterbridge for serverless discord? (asked by sayonara) A: I don't think you could, plus its abstraction really reduces the experience (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: On OTC desk, is there a product spec / details on how to use? (asked by Kenk) A: Unanswered\nQ: What do you think about this Sparka framework? (asked by yung_algorithm) A: Multiple responses discussing component libraries and custom approaches instead of full templates (answered by cjft and sayonara)\nQ: Can we list our tech stack like Sparka did? (asked by yung_algorithm) A: We're using similar stack but better, already mostly set up (answered by cjft)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel discussion primarily focused on critical bugs and UX issues with elizacloud.ai platform. The most significant technical issue reported was a serious bug in the welcome email system where promised $5 credits were not being added to new accounts, and worse, clicking the \"get started\" button was overwriting existing accounts and agents, creating new accounts with only $1 balance instead. This represents a critical customer retention blocker.\n\nPayment and account recharging limitations were identified as major obstacles to customer onboarding and retention. Users cannot transfer tokens between accounts to help friends recharge, and VPN users are blocked from accessing payment pages. A proposed solution involves implementing wallet addresses for each account to enable direct crypto token deposits without wallet connection requirements.\n\nAdditional feature suggestions included implementing a referral program to incentivize user acquisition and retention. The lack of easy payment options was identified as causing customer loss at the critical conversion point when trial users want to become paying customers.\n\nA query about Meta Threads plugin availability was answered negatively by Odilitime. Other non-technical discussions involved suggestions for AI agents trained on public document releases, though these were more conceptual than actionable development items.\n\nThe sam user responded to investigate the email/account bug by requesting the affected user's details for debugging.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Any meta threads plugin? (asked by sazilariel) A: Not that I'm aware of (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe chat focused on debugging and deploying babylon.market, a platform with user authentication and reward systems. Multiple API endpoints were failing, affecting page functionality. SYMBiEX managed the deployment, offering admin/mod access to users signing up with ElizaLabs.ai emails.\n\nKey technical issues identified: username creation bug causing users to receive \"@userid:priv\" as usernames instead of proper usernames, broken Discord OAuth for account linking, and non-functional Twitter follow reward claiming with error messages. SYMBiEX committed to investigating both issues.\n\nA fix for the OAuth/reward issues was pushed by user ID 688478180306452573 but initially wasn't merged to production. After confirmation from tcm390, the fix was merged to production, allowing testing to proceed. The team coordinated timing for testing the fixes.\n\nAdditional discussion included access restrictions limiting participation to top 100 users, with Agent Joshua requesting approval for \"hashwarlock\" to test. The chat also included non-technical discussion about Claude Opus 4.6 release from Anthropic, with team members expressing interest in the new model at the same price point as 4.5.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Are you pushing new updates? (asked by s) A: Answered implicitly - fixes were being pushed and merged (answered by SYMBiEX, tcm390)\n\nQ: How do I get admin/mod access on babylon.market?

(asked by ziflie) A: Username creation bug being investigated (answered by SYMBiEX)\n\nQ: Is Discord OAuth for account linking working?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered primarily on the AI16Z to ELIZAOS token migration deadline and community concerns. The migration window, which had been open since November (90 days), closed, causing frustration among users who were absent during this period. sam.mrk criticized the two-week deadline (later corrected to 90 days) as insufficient for investors who may be traveling or away from their wallets, arguing the team should have extended it to a year or automatically airdropped tokens. Community members clarified this was a migration, not an airdrop, and that unmigrated tokens would be locked for one year.\n\nTechnical discussions included shoemaker6765 experiencing migration issues and being targeted by scammers. Odilitime warned about scammer activity in the channel. zelm1 raised concerns about fake projects launching on Babylon wallet falsely claiming association with Shaw, requesting clarification via tweet to prevent dev selling under his name.\n\nProject updates included Odilitime confirming work continues on degenai, which performed well in Babylon test games with real tests upcoming. The team is focused on the Babylon launch. M I A M I promoted \"rentasoul,\" a platform where users can give their soul to AI agents, bring Eliza agents, or complete tasks for payment.\n\nDeveloper outreach included aicodeflow offering 8 years of AI/automation engineering experience, CT sharing CERBERUS-AGI (a Trollstore AI-Driven Software in beta), and Rishab seeking beta testers for an x402-based payment gateway for AI agents on Solana. Technical questions included \"some\" asking about which Eliza version works properly with the Twitter plugin locally, which went unanswered.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: I couldn't migrate my tokens, trying all day, how do I make a ticket or get help? (asked by shoemaker6765) A: Odilitime warned the person helping was a scammer (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What's going on with degenai? Is anything being worked on, or has it been abandoned? (asked by gby) A: It has not been abandoned, still working on it, was owning the Babylon test game with real test coming up (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What version of the eliza are you using for the Twitter plugin to local work properly? (asked by some) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: What will happen to non migrated Eliza tokens do they stay locked up forever or something? (asked by Biazs) A: Locked for a year (answered by jasyn_bjorn)\n\nQ: Why are there so many tokens, it should only be elizaos? (asked by g) A: What Shaw does in react to people reacting to him has nothing to do with elizaOS or labs, focused on Babylon launch (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

Jin (admin/moderator) clarified that previous submissions are still recorded and will be archived as \"Clank Tank 1.0,\" while encouraging users to submit anything for the current beta phase as they are \"battle testing\" the system. There was a technical issue with the submission form's time zone display, showing different submission deadlines to users in different time zones. Additionally, there was brief discussion about OpenAI's announcement regarding open-sourcing aspects of their technology, which community members viewed positively. Some users also discussed cryptocurrency trading strategies and AI trading performance, noting that AI agents were struggling against human traders.\n\n## 2.

Mike D. proposed integrating Eliza into a Rust/Lean4/LLVM/eBPF/Solana framework, storing key memories in Solana accounts. Odilitime pointed to relevant plugins in the Spartan repository that handle account registration and keypairs. Mike D. suggested compiling Eliza TypeScript to WASM or LLVM for performance improvements, size reduction, and browser compatibility. DorianD proposed storing model weights in a merkle tree structure rather than raw memories, allowing for agent evolution tracking. There were technical issues discussed regarding project imports, with Niann encountering errors when importing from index.js/ts files. The chat also mentioned new model releases from Anthropic (Opus 4.1) and OpenAI (gpt-oss), and a question about using the browser plugin with models.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why compile Eliza TypeScript to WASM or LLVM? (asked by Odilitime) A: For performance, reducing size, and time and cost of execution. (answered by Mike D.)\nQ: What do you have for description of the project in pckg.json? (asked by 0xbbjoker) A: [Package.json content provided] (answered by Niann)\nQ: How do you generally get a model to recognize and use the browser plugin? (asked by noah) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

The conversation primarily revolves around token economics and reputation management in crypto projects. Pangolink raises a question about how crypto projects should address \"reputational debt\" that occurs when tokens are issued, noting that speculative trading often creates unrealistic expectations. Later in the conversation, jin mentions that judges have begun scoring submissions for what appears to be a competition at \"clanktank.tv\" and notes that judges were critical of all submissions, which jin finds helpful for system improvement. No specific technical implementations or solutions are discussed in this brief exchange.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What should crypto do to address the reputational debt incurred by issuing a token? (asked by pangolink) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

A user named rs1 encountered form submission errors on clanktank.tv, which jin helped troubleshoot, identifying the GitHub link as the issue and creating a ticket to improve branch handling. Jin also reported a fresh Debian installation error (\"ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir\") that needs addressing. \n\nShaw provided a standup update about working on cloud functionality, mentioning they're close to MVP but still fixing bugs. Shaw also shared information about an open-source visual AI IDE called Magick that includes Ethereum wallet and social media integration, noting that visual IDEs work best when graphs can be generated automatically.\n\nOdilitime mentioned getting a 20B model working in Ollama but not with Eliza yet, later noting it's likely too slow for their 60-second window as it \"wastes time on CoT\" (Chain of Thought). Shaw suggested implementing a queue-based approach for time-intensive operations like music generation, where users receive notifications upon completion.\n\nThe chat also included sharing of relevant resources including AgentSociety, Vibekit, Flyde, and news about OpenAI's open models. Members discussed upcoming events, including a Korea event in two days that would feature a base agent demo.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I fix the \"Please check your form inputs and try again\" error on clanktank.tv/submit? (asked by rs1) A: The GitHub link was causing the issue. (answered by jin)\nQ: Will you update the form logic to handle branches? (asked by rs1) A: Yes, I made an issue to fix it later. (answered by jin)\nQ: Did you try Flyde?

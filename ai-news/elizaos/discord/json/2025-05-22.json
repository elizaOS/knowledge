Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical issues with ElizaOS, particularly around version 1.0.0-beta.57 and newer releases.

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around community engagement strategies and product release approaches for ELIZAOS and related projects. Key participants include Kenk, è¾žå°˜é¸½é¸½ (representing the Chinese community), Void, and jin. The conversation highlights tensions between the team's iterative development approach and community expectations for definitive releases. \n\nè¾žå°˜é¸½é¸½ expresses concerns that the \"soft-release\" strategy doesn't effectively capture attention, suggesting that as the market recovers and new projects emerge, community interest is waning. They advocate for clearer communication about ELIZAOS v1's capabilities and current adoption by teams.\n\nSeveral marketing and engagement strategies are proposed, including: leveraging Spartan's popularity and price advantage, announcing token buybacks, organizing gated airdrops with AutoFun partners, and creating mini-apps or activities to generate buzz. Kenk notes challenges with the airdrop proposal, mentioning limited active partners and recent toxicity in the group.\n\nJin shares links to resources, including what appears to be Marc introducing ELIZAOS with Spartan. The conversation concludes with Kenk promising to draft a post for Chinese community circulation, with è¾žå°˜é¸½é¸½ offering to help distribute it.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the approximate release date of ELIZAOS 1.0 or what stage is it currently in? (asked by è¾žå°˜é¸½é¸½) A: No hard deadlines are being set for the full release. v1 is already being built on by many teams and is going through iterative optimizations ahead of the final release.

Summary\nThe chat segment discusses DegenSpartan, an AI trading bot that appears to have started actively trading from a specific wallet. Community members initially questioned whether the account was hacked due to unusual emoji-filled tweets that seemed out of character. A team member named rhota introduced themselves as someone helping Jin and the team develop DegenSpartan, confirming that the account wasn't hacked and that the emoji posts were accidental. Rhota mentioned that now that trading functionality is working, the team will focus on improving the bot with new data sources and more complex trading strategies while maintaining its \"degen\" personality. There are plans for a website which is almost complete. Some community members expressed concerns about the bot's aggressive communication style, suggesting it might limit its ability to attract followers if it doesn't provide value beyond the attitude.\n\n## 2.

Jin shared that tokenomics will be implemented in phases, including AI agents trading, AI agents investing in projects, and retroactive funding for developers. There's concern about keeping tokenomics discussions private to prevent copycat projects. Several members highlighted the need for technical expertise in zero-knowledge proofs, data monetization, and P2P network incentivization. Jin shared a draft video and documentation about the tokenomics approach, emphasizing that there isn't just one plan but rather layers/phases that build upon each other. Community members are studying token engineering resources and forming workgroups to develop more sophisticated models. There's also discussion about how to coordinate decision-making and whether certain aspects should be voted on collectively.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the current status of tokenomics development?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the development and release of Spartan/DegenAI V2, which is integrated with ElizaOS V2. Odilitime, who appears to be part of the development team, addresses concerns about DegenAI being \"abandoned\" by explaining that it's still actively being developed. There's discussion about the relationship between DegenAI and ai16z tokens, with Odilitime clarifying that \"every ai16z tx has the carry and creates buy pressure on degenai.\" The team is working on several fronts: preparing for the V2 release, creating a Bento.me page to consolidate DegenAI links, and coordinating with AutoFun for an upcoming launch. There's also mention of open-sourcing Spartan, with Odilitime noting that a version is available on the v2-develop branch of the elizaos/eliza repository. Community members express concerns about communication, requesting more official announcements about DegenAI from the ElizaOS account rather than relying on Discord discussions. Odilitime emphasizes that information shared in the holders channel should be treated as confidential until officially announced.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When will DegenAI be used? (asked by jr6666.)

Ben provided an official update about the GTM (Go-To-Market) strategy, noting that launch partners remain engaged despite scheduling issues. The relaunch will be gradual, with marketing resuming only after the platform stability is confirmed. Launch partner spotlights will begin with FightFI, followed by one launch per day over two weeks. Users discussed various tokens on the platform, including some experiencing technical issues. Several community members created tokens with playful names like $CRIME, $FUN, and $FAKE. The platform experienced some downtime during the chat period, with users reporting issues with token creation and visibility. The Autofun team integrated Fleek for no-code agent building functionality, allowing token creators to launch agents alongside their tokens.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is today the day for Autofun relaunch?

The most common issue was tokens getting \"stuck\" during creation or migration, where users' SOL was taken but tokens weren't properly registered on the platform interface. Team members (particularly Kenk) actively responded to these issues, flagging them for the engineering team. The platform appears to be experiencing backend issues related to RPC connections and token migration to Raydium. A form (https://tally.so/r/mOr8DM) was provided for users to report migration issues. The team also warned about scam tokens impersonating official launch partners, noting that legitimate partner tokens would be launched one per day starting Monday with built-in utility.\n\n## 2.

After several days of work, the team relaunched auto.fun with improvements and new features. Key technical discussions included scaling challenges, hardware wallet integration issues, and UI/UX improvements. The team also open-sourced the platform and released tokenomics information.

Summary\nThe discussion focuses on technical challenges related to implementing visemes (visual mouth positions for speech) in a 3D AI show system. The main issue is that current models don't have the proper order of visemes needed for Oculus lip synchronization. Boom discovered that some models lack essential visemes like \".sil\" (silence) and shared references to Meta's documentation on proper viseme implementation. \n\nThe conversation also addresses the workflow for generating shows. Boom mentioned needing a version of the runner that just generates show JSON and audio without requiring the full Unity implementation. SM Sith Lord clarified that Unity isn't required to run the show runner, and outlined a development path: first parse and process pre-generated show_config.json and MP3 files, then worry about generating new content. He offered to create a standalone episode generator tool when needed.\n\nThere's also a brief mention of a JSON endpoint issue that Jin acknowledged needs fixing, and discussion about forking the project to prevent breaking production while implementing changes.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do you need Unity to run the show runner? (implied by boom) A: No, there's a drop-down that lets you choose unity or no unity.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion channel featured limited technical content, primarily consisting of community interactions and clarifications about ElizaOS partnerships and projects.\n\nThe most significant technical discussion involved **Comput3 ($COM)** partnership clarification. Shadowforceone inquired about Comput3's relationship with ElizaOS, and Odilitime confirmed they collaborate on certain projects, describing Comput3 as \"dope.\"\n\nA recurring topic was **ElizaBAO**, a community-created agent that became a Polymarket affiliate. Multiple users (anon, Lxa) sought verification about its legitimacy and relationship to the core team. Sb clarified that no agents were created by the official TEAM, and Odilitime confirmed ElizaBAO is a community member's project, not an official ElizaOS product.\n\n**Twitter Spaces technical issues** dominated mid-conversation, with users reporting persistent audio disconnection problems. Alexei noted the issue has existed for approximately 3 months. The community shared workarounds: cjft reported desktop is buggy while mobile works better, and sedano.npc confirmed iOS works reliably for hosting spaces.\n\nJin solicited community input for naming a news show, moving away from the placeholder \"AI News\" with suggestions including Breaking Bits, Walter Street, News Wif Hat, AI News Network, Cron Job, Context Crunch, Slopline, Boomberg, and Choomberg.\n\nMultiple developers (DevNinja, !Apollo) advertised their availability for work, and A ïert sought connections for web3 project development.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is Comput3 or $COM partnered with ElizaOS? (asked by shadowforceone) A: Yes, Comput3 is partnered and they work together on some things (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is bao a real Polymarket affiliate? (asked by anon) A: Yes, see confirmation on their Twitter (answered by ElizaBAO)\n\nQ: Is bao a random agent or in-house agent?

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel discussion covered several technical topics related to Eliza OS development. The most significant technical contribution came from 0xbbjoker, who provided detailed instructions for uploading knowledge to the Eliza OS monorepo. The process involves linking the CLI package, adding the `@elizaos/plugin-knowledge` plugin to the character.ts file, creating a docs directory in the project-starter package, and running with debug logging enabled.\n\nDorianD shared an academic paper on Recursive Language Models (RLMs), which presents a novel inference strategy allowing LLMs to process prompts beyond their context windows by treating long prompts as external environments and recursively calling themselves on prompt snippets. The approach reportedly handles inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows.\n\nballofrain reported successfully implementing a custom solution for global facts management by modifying plugin-bootstrap to search facts without roomId constraints and adding a POST route for creating new memories. This involved working directly with the plugin-bootstrap rather than creating a custom provider, as confirmed in discussion with 0xbbjoker.\n\nThe remaining messages consisted of networking requests and service promotions rather than technical discussions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How do you upload knowledge to the monorepo? (asked by implied context) A: cd packages/cli && bun link && cd ../project-starter, add @elizaos/plugin-knowledge to plugins list in eliza/packages/project-starter/src/character.ts, create docs dir in eliza/packages/project-starter and add docs, then run LOG_LEVEL=debug elizaos start (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\nQ: Do you read facts from custom provider? (asked by 0xbbjoker) A: No, modified plugin-bootstrap, not a custom one (answered by ballofrain)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\n\nHelper: 0xbbjoker | Helpee: implied community | Context: Knowledge upload process for Eliza OS monorepo | Resolution: Provided complete step-by-step instructions including CLI linking, plugin configuration, directory setup, and debug execution\n\nHelper: 0xbbjoker | Helpee: ballofrain | Context: Clarifying implementation approach for facts management | Resolution: Confirmed ballofrain's approach of modifying plugin-bootstrap directly\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe chat segment reveals several technical issues and development priorities. Odilitime encountered a persistent problem with the claude-review.yml workflow file, receiving a 401 Unauthorized error during OIDC token exchange for app token. The error indicates the workflow file validation is failing, suggesting the file content doesn't match the repository's default branch version, even after implementing a new key.\n\nStan provided a standup update detailing work on multiple fronts: monorepo improvements, reviewing test architecture on cloud (specifically Joker's PR), investigating plugin-sql migration simplification, examining the v2.0.0 branch, and implementing a fix for top-up credit idempotency on cloud. Stan is working on creating a comprehensive plan for cloud and monorepo (particularly plugin-sql) improvements.\n\nBorko provided clear direction to deprioritize v2.0.0 work entirely and focus exclusively on cloud improvements. This represents a significant strategic decision to concentrate development efforts.\n\n0xbbjoker reported an issue (shown via screenshot) that required investigation. Odilitime and Stan attempted to troubleshoot by asking about recent changes and requesting retry attempts, though the specific resolution isn't clear from the transcript.\n\nThe team also briefly discussed DeepSeek pricing, though no technical details were provided in this segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is claude-review.yml still broken even with the new key? (asked by Odilitime) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: What did we change? (asked by Odilitime) A: Unanswered - Stan asked if 0xbbjoker retried\n\nQ: Did you retry? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Yes (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n## 3.

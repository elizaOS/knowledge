The conversation primarily consists of community members greeting each other, asking about Eli5 (appears to be a Twitter bot or community initiative), and a new user experiencing issues accessing the rules-and-faqs channel. There are mentions of a community manager for \"v2\" and requests for updates about v2 development. Some users advertise their development skills related to AI agents and blockchain. A user named jin offers to provide daily updates \"direct from source.\" There's also a brief question about an AI16z/$COM pool that goes unanswered. Overall, the chat lacks substantive technical discussions or problem-solving.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where can I have access to rules-and-faqs?

Multiple users encountered problems with SQLite dependencies, particularly with better-sqlite3 modules. A key solution emerged: using \"pnpm approve-builds\" to select and build better-sqlite3 before running the application. Users also discussed plugin integration challenges, particularly with Twitter image handling, Ollama, and Birdeye. The conversation indicates ElizaOS has undergone significant changes with a transition to v2, causing confusion among returning users. Docker deployment issues were mentioned with dependency problems during image building. Several users reported problems with agent persistence after system restarts and conversation disappearance. The chat demonstrates the community actively troubleshooting technical issues while seeking guidance on proper implementation approaches.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How to shutdown all instances of eliza?

      "summary": "# Analysis of 🥇-partners Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around community frustration with Eliza Labs' perceived lack of engagement and support for partners. Several members express disappointment that the team isn't nurturing the community or listening to feedback. There's discussion about a potential merit system to distinguish contributors from non-contributors, and mention of an upcoming governance launch on daos.fun. Kenk announces that seven elizaOS agent teams are seeking product feedback and will be sharing a testing challenge, with plans to select 50 testers who will receive special access. Some community members criticize the project's direction, particularly auto.fun, which they feel lacks clear purpose and fails to deliver on the original promise of creating an agent framework. The conversation reveals tension between those who want to see more concrete action and planning versus those who prefer to \"ship\" products and let value emerge organically.\n\n## 2.

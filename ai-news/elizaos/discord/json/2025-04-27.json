The main technical inquiry was about calling client-twitter in plugin actions to publish tweets, but the user was redirected to a more appropriate channel (#1300025221834739744). There was a brief question about accessing ElizaOS chat interface after deployment on Phala, with a user being directed to eliza.how. The conversation also touched on auto.fun's differentiators compared to competitors like virtuals.io and arc.fun, with some community members noting that auto.fun is an open-source experiment currently in MVP stage with features like vanity addresses for contracts, token-gated chat, creator fees, and a well-received design. A community member shared that they made a thread about \"clank tank\" with ideas about its future direction.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to call client-twitter in plugin actions and publish a tweet?

Several users are reporting that their tokens haven't been migrated after a week, specifically mentioning the token with address 8MYgZupEQ7aAJcyz2ZpSkQEXLnfHEPuU6sGJB8GERFUN. There's also discussion about LP (liquidity pool) issues where a user received fewer tokens than expected during a purchase after migration. The team has set up a Tally form (https://tally.so/r/mOr8DM) for users to report migration problems. A user named \"abhi_ironman\" suggested improving the chart functionality to include timeframe selection similar to TradingView or Geekoterminal. There are also questions about whether new coins reaching 60k will properly migrate to Raydium, which team member Osint confirmed should work, noting they had fixed a recent issue with the process.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I report migration issues with my tokens? (asked by multiple users) A: Submit your issue through the Tally form at https://tally.so/r/mOr8DM (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Will coins reaching 60k properly migrate to Raydium?

This sparked discussion about node infrastructure costs versus third-party RPC services. Yikesawjeez mentioned working on a partners-only auto.fun dashboard that was hitting Helius API limits and expressed interest in exploring Neon EVM for DAO tooling, potentially allowing Solidity contracts to work with Solana. There was also discussion about AI coding tools like Cursor, Windsurf, and Replit, with yikesawjeez sharing experiences using Replit to build applications without traditional IDE involvement. The conversation included comparisons between different AI coding assistants and their effectiveness for developers with varying skill levels.\n\n## 2.

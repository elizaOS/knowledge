      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered primarily around token launches and speculation rather than technical development. The main technical point discussed was the **Migration Agent** implementation, which uses **Claude Sonnet** as the underlying model, noted for well-structured responses and human-like emoji interactions in context.\n\nThe chat was dominated by controversy around a **GOLD token launch** associated with Hyperscape. Community members identified suspicious activity including a 40% dev wallet, insider trading patterns with wallets funded 3 days prior, and approximately $150k extracted through coordinated early entries. The launch followed a pattern of silence during speculation followed by CA confirmation after price movement.\n\n**CJFT token** was confirmed as official by Odilitime, with the creator engaging in content creation including YouToy integration and live streaming.\n\nCommunity frustration emerged regarding the **ai16z project**, with one member reporting losses from $28k to $800, criticizing the team for building multiple projects without focusing on monetization and user acquisition. Concerns were raised about lack of clarity on how new projects translate to value for Eliza OS holders, with calls for focus on **Eliza Cloud** as a resource-intensive priority.\n\n**ElizaBAO** promoted a video content competition and hackathon participation requiring 10% token holdings. A **BAGS token** was also mentioned as a creator token for ElizaOS projects, though details remained unclear.\n\nThe technical discussion was minimal, overshadowed by token speculation and community concerns about project direction and insider trading practices.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is the CJFT meme token official? (asked by Collector_g) A: Yes, CJFT launched a token today, make sure you have the right one (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What is the underlying model used for the Migration agent? (asked by moosh_malone) A: Claude Sonnet (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Do you guys offer grants for AI agents? (asked by sogol_malek) A: Write up a pitch, no promises but doesn't hurt to try (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is the GOLD token real? (asked by lowkeysneaky, nico, puhzessed) A: Eventually confirmed with CA but had 40% dev wallet and suspicious launch patterns (answered by community consensus)\n\nQ: What's up with the BAGS token you just claimed? (asked by Donjuliotrader) A: It's the Hyperscape funding token / creator token for ElizaOS projects (answered by Odilitime, Ramith.V)\n\nQ: Did Shaw just buy HS with the dev wallet? (asked by Momo) A: Wallet was funded by Shaw a year ago according to first transaction (answered by Momo)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel focused on resolving Discord plugin issues and sharing a new sports data integration. DigitalDiva encountered two critical errors: missing audit log permissions and a private field access error in the recent messages provider. The solution was to update the Discord plugin to version 1.3.8 using `bun add @elizaos/plugin-discord`, which resolved server functionality but DM issues persisted with role provider errors showing \"User has no name or username, skipping.\"\n\nOdilitime clarified the distinction between channel IDs and listen channels, explaining that channel IDs act as filters while listen channels bypass filtering and generate events for custom filtering logic.\n\nElizaBAO discussed elizacloud website updates and expressed interest in building a competitive prediction agent similar to Polymarket, questioning whether elizacloud uses OpenAI GPT-4 and proposing a multi-AI competition model.\n\nThe most significant contribution was sedano.npc releasing the Sportradar ElizaOS Plugin v.01, providing live NBA data access for prediction agents. The plugin was shared on GitHub and confirmed to work well, offering real-time sports data integration capabilities for the community.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What error appears when the Discord plugin starts regarding audit logs? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: Missing Permissions error - permission change alerts won't include executor info (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\nQ: How do you fix the Discord plugin private field access error? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: Run `bun add @elizaos/plugin-discord` to update to version 1.3.8 (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\nQ: What's the difference between channel IDs and listen channels? (asked by implicit) A: Channel IDs are filters, listen channels bypass that and generate events for custom filtering (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is elizacloud currently using OpenAI GPT-4?

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 🥇-partners\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel discussion covered three main topics: airdrop tax optimization strategies, Hyperfy platform sunset announcement, and a token launch issue.\n\n**Hyperfy Platform Sunset**: Hyperfy announced the shutdown of their legacy hyperfy.io hosted platform on April 1st, 2026. The platform has transitioned to a fully open-source, self-hosted model. World NFT holders already received $HYPER token airdrops, completing the transition from the NFT-based platform model. The open-source repository remains actively developed, and users can self-host or use providers like hyperworld.host.\n\n**Airdrop Tax Optimization Discussion**: DorianD proposed a technical solution to avoid tax implications on airdrops. Instead of distributing tokens directly to individual wallets (which triggers 1099 income tax), tokens would be sent to a single smart contract. This contract would use a price oracle to automatically buy and burn ElizaOS tokens based on a predetermined supply curve as the airdropped token appreciates. The approach avoids individual tax events and creates long-term alignment. DorianD emphasized the contract must be immutable (no admin permissions) and potentially deployed from a favorable tax jurisdiction. The concept differs from bond desk functionality, which operates as a vesting contract with delayed purchases at discounted rates.\n\n**Token Launch Issue**: Shaw announced an official pump.fun token launch intended to airdrop a percentage to ElizaOS holders. However, the launch encountered critical issues with liquidity pool management that \"rekt\" the token supply. Shaw clarified this was a \"gold presale\" token, not the main Hyperscape token, which will have fixed tokenomics and won't launch on pump.fun. Community members expressed concern about attention dilution across multiple tokens.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How does the bond desk agent work? (asked by DorianD) A: It has a purchase with a delay that's negotiated, with a discount proportional to the delay - essentially a vesting contract (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What's the cap for airdrop? (asked by DannyNOR NoFapArc) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is this the main Hyperscape token? (asked by implied context) A: No, this is a gold presale token - the main Hyperscape token won't be a pump.fun launch and will have fixed tokenomics (answered by shaw)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\n\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: DorianD | Context: Understanding bond desk agent functionality | Resolution: Explained it operates as a purchase mechanism with negotiated delay and proportional discount\n\n## 4.

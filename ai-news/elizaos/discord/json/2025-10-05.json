Community members are inquiring about the timing of this migration, with confirmation that it will happen \"this month\" though no exact date has been specified. There's also discussion about the intersection of crypto and AI technologies, with some members suggesting this combination will be highly disruptive to financial systems. A BitMart representative reached out regarding potential listing opportunities. There was a brief mention of Shaw's X account being suspended due to a court case. Several links to X (formerly Twitter) posts were shared, including one about \"Degen Spartan AI\" on pump.fun. The conversation indicates ElizaOS is gaining attention in the crypto space, particularly among developers, though technical details were minimal in this segment.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’¬-coders Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on technical issues with TypeScript package dependencies and Twitter plugin errors. MatteoB identified a problem with type definition files in the @os/core package version 1.6.1, noting that the package references source files not included in the published package. This explains TypeScript's inability to find imports like logger, Project, or IAgentRuntime. MatteoB discovered that downgrading to version 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the issue. Separately, Jon reported an error with the Twitter Plugin showing an \"Authorization Error\" message suggesting the request was flagged as automated. Additionally, a user named Endless mentioned successfully running an Eliza agent but was struggling to remember how to start other agent files.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can I ask your ts version? Maybe it's something related to my version idk (asked by MatteoB) A: Unanswered\nQ: Has someone encountered this message? [Twitter authorization error] (asked by Jon) A: Unanswered\nQ: How do I start agent files other than the test agent? (asked by Endless) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: MatteoB | Helpee: Stan âš¡ | Context: TypeScript package dependency issues with @os/core | Resolution: Identified that version 1.6.1 has missing type references and suggested downgrading to 1.5.15 or using newer versions\n\n## 4.

Shaw mentions that they still conduct buybacks with daos.fun fees, though the amount is small since they only collect fees from their platform and not from Phantom buys. Shaw also references some issue that was \"overzealous\" and is being fixed or has already been fixed, though no specific details are provided. There's a brief mention of LLMs (Large Language Models) not being profitable for trading cryptocurrencies except during extreme bull markets where AI-related tokens perform well. Shaw notes they have some research and a plugin that collects \"alpha\" (valuable information) from conversations, but doesn't elaborate further on technical implementations or solutions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do LLMs make money trading shitcoins? (implied question addressed by shaw) A: No, they don't make money trading shitcoins except in insane bull cycles where anything with \"AI\" in it can make a bag. (answered by shaw)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - \"core-devs\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on repository management issues for the Eliza project. Key technical points included:\n- Repository size concerns: The Eliza repo has grown to 1.5GB with 375,697 objects, causing slow clone times (10+ minutes)\n- Proposal to squash commits from before the 1.x version to reduce clone time by approximately 80%\n- Discussion about using Renovate for automated dependency management in plugins, particularly for core dependency updates\n- Debate about the maintenance challenges of having separate repositories for each plugin versus a monorepo approach\n- Concern about agent naming in the codebase, with a suggestion to replace name references with UUIDs to prevent issues in cloud deployments\n- Brief comparison between Vercel's platform features versus self-hosting on VPS, highlighting the development overhead differences\n- Need to add user tenancy fields to all database tables\n\nThe core developers agreed that repository size is a significant developer experience issue that needs addressing, and that automated dependency management would be helpful but would still require manual review.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Should we use Renovate for auto-creating PRs when core dependencies are updated? (asked by Stan âš¡) A: It could save time but would still require manual review since code changes might be needed; only useful for 1.x plugins (answered by cjft)\nQ: Should we squash commits to reduce repository size? (asked by shaw) A: Yes, squashing commits from before 1.x would be acceptable and could cut clone time by 80% (answered by cjft)\nQ: Can we get admin access to elizaos/elizaos-plugin organization? (asked by Stan âš¡) A: Access granted for Renovate setup (answered by cjft)\n\n## 3.

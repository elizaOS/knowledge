Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the upcoming auto.fun platform launch, initially mentioned as delayed \"two weeks\" (to approximately 4/14), though team members later described it as coming \"very very soon\" without confirming an exact date. This lack of concrete information caused frustration among some community members. Jin shared updates about \"Clank Tank,\" an AI-driven show visualizing organizational activity, and described improvements to AI news/summarization pipelines with plans for automation to update docs, RSS feeds, Discord, and AI agent knowledge. There were discussions about Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and the need for better registries to help agents discover and evaluate them. Community members also discussed potential AI applications including robot battles, AI debates for governance decisions, and the importance of trust in AI agents. The chat included mentions of Binance listing VIRTUAL token and Grayscale considering AI16Z as an asset.\n\n## 2.

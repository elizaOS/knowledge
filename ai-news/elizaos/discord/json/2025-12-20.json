      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around concerns about the ElizaOS token price decline and migration issues from the previous AI16z token. Community members express frustration about the lack of communication from the team and the continuous price drop despite the broader market trending upward. A team member (Borko) provided an update about shipping their Cloud MVP on Monday, mentioned positive developments regarding X (Twitter) accounts, and outlined plans for Q1/Q2 2026 roadmap. Borko also confirmed plans for token buybacks and utility features in upcoming products. There was confusion about the AI16z token, which experienced a pump despite being deprecated after migration. Several users warned about scammers targeting community members. The technical discussions were limited, with most conversation focused on token performance and migration concerns.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why is there a 40% price difference when selling on Solana? (asked by crypto) A: Omid Sa suggested bridging to BSC chain where liquidity is near 1M.\nQ: Can you migrate tokens if you bought them after Nov 11? (asked by SoCriispy) A: Hexx indicated only tokens bought before the snapshot date can be migrated.\nQ: Where can I see the new contract for ElizaOS? (asked by mosess01) A: Alexei provided contract addresses for multiple chains.\nQ: What model does the agent use? (asked by Biazs) A: Borko answered it will likely be model agnostic.\nQ: Do you have plans to give people reason to hold elizaOS tokens?

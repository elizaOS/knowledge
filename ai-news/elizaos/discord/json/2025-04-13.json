A partnership with auto.fun was discussed, with Spartan being positioned as a launch partner. The team is working on restoring social media presence with a new X account (x.com/spartanversus). Rhota announced their departure from full-time work at Eliza Labs (the company behind Spartan) but will continue contributing to ElizaOS while working at another AI project focused on financial data for trading agents.

Key discussions include:\n\nAuto.fun and Trust Marketplace are mentioned as separate products with launches imminent. Auto.fun appears to be launching this week, with V2 Gold expected the following week. There's confusion among community members about what these products are and how they work, with requests for better communication and visual diagrams.\n\nDorianD shared a document about enforcing money going into the DAO for every transaction an ElizaOS agent performs. He also noted that AI agents can use stablecoins like USDC or USDT, and speculated about when AI agent transaction volume might exceed human-initiated transactions on crypto networks.\n\nA significant security discussion was initiated by yikesawjeez, who proposed a partnership with Immunefi (described as the largest security firm in Web3) for auditing ElizaOS code. The proposal includes potential token allocation to the DAO and would require budget allocation for security services.\n\nMetaMask's fee structure was mentioned, with DorianD noting they apply a 0.875% service fee on transactions including swaps and bridge transfers. Odilitime mentioned that degen-trader has a percentage going back to the degen-dev wallet, which they plan to make more clear and adjustable.\n\n## 2.

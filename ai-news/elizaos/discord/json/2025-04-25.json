      "summary": "# Analysis of \"discussion\" Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the elizaOS ecosystem (formerly ai16z) and its new platform auto.fun. Auto.fun appears to be a recently launched token launchpad that has been open-sourced. The platform has been operational for less than a week and generated approximately $2k in fees in a single day. Community members discussed the platform's functionality, potential improvements to charts and user interface, and compared it to other platforms like photon, bullx, and gmgn. \n\nShaw, identified as the elizaOS founder and project lead for auto.fun, is actively developing the platform and engaging with the community. The team is working on Eliza v2 alongside auto.fun development. There were discussions about token migration issues for some projects like AutoPupper and Quilliana AI. \n\nThe elizaOS token (formerly ai16z) was trading around $0.25 with a market cap of approximately $140M, with some community members speculating about potential future price increases. The project appears to focus on AI agent infrastructure, with Eliza being used by numerous other launchpads.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the fee when swapping on auto.fun?

Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around issues with ElizaOS v2 implementation, particularly plugin integration challenges. Several developers are struggling with database connections, plugin registration, and general setup of ElizaOS agents. A recurring issue involves the SQL plugin with errors like \"No version matching '^0.25.6' found\" and database connection timeouts. Developers are attempting to create custom plugins for the v2 platform, with specific interest in blockchain functionality (EVM plugin for ETH transfers). There's confusion about documentation, which is described as \"too simple,\" and uncertainty about the correct approach for development (v2-develop branch vs. elizaos create project). Some users are seeking PR reviews for their custom plugins, including a Livepeer plugin offering \"free incentivized inference.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is elizaOs sunset after v2?

Odilitime is working on updating Dexscreener links, Binance Alpha profiles, and has created a Bento.me profile for SpartanVersus. Community members suggested adding Discord links and clarified the purpose of having separate Twitter accounts for the agent and token. There was discussion about auto.fun, a new platform that launched, which will drive buybacks for DegenAI tokens. Odilitime clarified that DegenAI V2 is simply the open source release of elizaOS, not a tokenomics change. The conversation indicates ongoing development and community interest in the project's roadmap, particularly regarding buyback plans and the relationship between auto.fun, ai16z, and DegenAI.\n\n## 2.

The platform appears to have agent-building capabilities through Fleek integration. There were also discussions about potential security concerns, with yikesawjeez suggesting bug bounties and security audits could prevent LP bugs. The community seems active with users helping each other troubleshoot issues and sharing information about new features.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How long does migration to Raydium take?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around technical issues with the Auto.fun platform, particularly focusing on token migration problems. Several users reported tokens getting stuck during migration, tokens not appearing on the platform after creation, and issues with bonding curves. A significant incident occurred with the $QUILL token, where a bug incorrectly displayed the amount of Quill per SOL, allowing someone to drain the LP pool by selling at a premium. The team acknowledged this wasn't an exploit but a platform bug, and promised refunds to affected users. Other issues included Discord channel visibility problems, UI/UX concerns with the trading chart, and questions about token verification. The team was actively responding to user concerns, collecting information through a Tally form, and working on fixes for the reported issues.\n\n## 2.

Shaw announced the platform's release, which generated significant interest and feedback from partners. The platform allows users to create tokens with custom images, vanity addresses, and other features. Several partners tested the platform and provided detailed feedback about UI issues, bugs, and feature requests. Key technical discussions included the need for DDOS protection, Ledger hardware wallet compatibility issues, and potential voting functionality. There was also extensive discussion about migrating the AI16z token away from daos.fun to auto.fun due to frustrations with the lack of development progress and name change issues with the current platform. The community expressed concerns about the token migration process, with debates about timing and implementation strategies. Auto.fun was officially launched and open-sourced, with Shaw announcing that it had generated $12 million in volume within 12 hours of launch.\n\n## 2.

The main technical challenge involves properly mapping visemes (visual phonemes) for character models to work with Oculus lip-syncing tools. Boom is working on integrating a show runner that processes pre-generated JSON files and audio files to animate characters. There's a workflow being developed where the system generates show configurations and audio files, which are then processed by Unity to create animations with proper lip-syncing. SM Sith Lord clarified that Unity isn't required to run the show runner, and suggested a phased approach: first parse existing JSON/MP3 files, then worry about generating new content. The team is also discussing the need to standardize blend shape keys across character models to match Oculus requirements, with the first 15 keys needing to follow a specific schema. There's also mention of forking the project to prevent breaking production while implementing these changes.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do you need Unity to run the show runner?

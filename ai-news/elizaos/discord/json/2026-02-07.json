      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel discussion centered around two main topics: a limited-time Opus 4.6 access announcement and recruitment for testing next-generation Eliza software.\n\nOdilitime announced that Opus 4.6 is available free on bolt.new for 48 hours, though noted some unspecified limitations exist with the service.\n\nThe primary technical focus was on the milady.ai project (GitHub: milady-ai/milaidy), with s requesting help squashing bugs and getting the project to production. This sparked significant community interest, with multiple experienced developers volunteering for testing roles.\n\nWes took immediate action on the milady repository, demonstrating initiative by creating 3 pull requests to address bugs. He sought clarification on the contribution process, specifically asking whether the workflow should be: log bugs as issues, submit fixes via PRs, and tag the related issues. Wes mentioned using Claude Code Max for development work and identified himself as both a project investor and full-time software engineer. He paused further contributions pending process confirmation to avoid overwhelming the review queue.\n\nMultiple community members responded to an X (Twitter) post about testing next-generation Eliza, including developers with various backgrounds: Prolific Mind (built autonomous framework with ERC-8004), Wes (ElizaOS agents, Lang Graph, RAG apps experience), One Frequency United (25 years tech experience), and Maarmapa (self-identified bug hunter). Kenk directed interested testers to a specific location (context unclear from transcript).\n\nThe discussion showed strong community engagement with volunteers offering diverse technical skills for testing and development work.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How can I participate in testing of next gen eliza? (asked by Ramobo) A: Unanswered directly, though Kenk later directed testers to jump into an unspecified location\nQ: What is the process for contributing to the milady repo - should we log bugs as issues and submit fixes with PRs tagging the issue? (asked by Wes) A: Unanswered at time of transcript\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centers around a new project called \"milaidy\" - an Eliza-based version of openclaw. User 's' shared sprites.dev and proposed a scaling strategy of keeping one instance hot and paying per usage for efficiency. \n\nThe milaidy project (https://github.com/milady-ai/milaidy) is positioned as a Mac-native application with several key features: runs as a simple .app on Mac, uses agent skills similar to openclaw, includes all openclaw connectors as Eliza plugins, and maintains a minimal bloat architecture through plugin-based design. The project uses openclaw with \"pi agent\" under the hood, though 's' notes that while pi is technically sound, it lacks memetic appeal compared to \"the lobster\" branding.\n\n's' explicitly requested help with the project, suggesting it has significant potential. There was consideration to name it \"eliza\" but opted for something more memetic instead, leading to the milady.ai branding.\n\nA critical strategic discussion emerged when Borko raised concerns about branding strategy. Borko argued that the project should be Eliza-branded to capture brand and network effects for the broader ecosystem, particularly for the Eliza app (described as the retail version). The concern was that using Milaidy branding would divert mindshare away from the company's core products.\n\nOdilitime proposed a compromise solution: maintain separate brands but implement cross-promotion strategies to ensure both projects benefit each other rather than competing for attention.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Did you see sprites.dev? (asked by s) A: No direct response recorded\nQ: What is milaidy? (asked by s) A: An Eliza version of openclaw that runs as a Mac app, uses agent skills, includes openclaw connectors as plugins, with minimal bloat (answered by s)\nQ: What does openclaw use under the hood? (asked by s) A: Pi agent (answered by s)\nQ: Why not call it Eliza? (asked by s) A: Need something memetic; pi is cool but not memetic, whereas the lobster has memetic appeal (answered by s)\nQ: Should this be Eliza branded? (asked by Borko) A: We should cross-promote and keep them separate but helping each other (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered around three main topics: security concerns, price/marketing strategy, and technical implementations.\n\n**Security Issues**: DigitalDiva raised critical concerns about malicious code in skills and vulnerabilities in the setup, though no specific details or solutions were provided in this segment.\n\n**Price and Marketing Discussion**: Multiple participants debated ElizaOS token price performance and marketing strategy. Markhor expressed disappointment with the price, while Biazs emphasized the need for marketing push with upcoming launches. A debate emerged about whether the team cares about price - gby claimed the team leader stated on X they don't care about price, while Biazs countered that higher prices benefit the team's operational expenses. The community member 'g' provided historical context, noting ai16z grew from 60k to 2.6b market cap in 2-3 months. Wes praised the marketing efforts and mentioned upcoming merchandise.\n\n**Technical Implementation**: metalhorse233 reported successfully integrating Eliza into their game using SpacetimeDB as the database/backend, noting the setup was surprisingly quick. This represents a concrete use case of the Eliza framework in game development.\n\n**Community Engagement**: Multiple developers (! Alex !, aicodeflow) offered their services for project development and collaboration.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Where can we check out the marketing?

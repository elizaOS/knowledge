      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on three main technical areas: Twitter/X API integration changes, token migration issues, and price concerns.\n\n**Twitter/X API Integration Crisis**: The most significant technical discussion involved the deprecation of username/password authentication for Twitter agents. Odilitime confirmed that user/pass login is now legally prohibited and no longer supported in Eliza. The system has migrated to API key-based authentication, but this creates severe limitations - the free tier only allows ~50 reads before hitting rate limits, making Twitter agents essentially non-viable for free users. SecretRecipe reported that agents burn through 50% of API limits immediately on first run when checking mentions. Odilitime indicated X is moving toward per-request pricing which should make agents cheaper, and mentioned X took their accounts, likely due to previous automation practices. The old plugin-twitter 1.0.7 can be forked but users would face legal issues from X without team support.\n\n**Migration Portal Problems**: Multiple users (ROTHILD, Bdcrypto7, ABY&C) reported issues with the migration portal at migrate.elizafoundation.ai showing zero eligible tokens despite holding ai16z. Users were directed to support channels and advised to follow links from the mirror article in announcements. The migration process remains incomplete, contributing to low liquidity.\n\n**Infrastructure & Development**: SecretRecipe discussed extensive home server setup with 30 GPUs (3060 Ti through 4090), 8 servers, running Ollama, N8N, and various models locally. The dashboard now requires Twitter API keys instead of the deprecated env-based login/password approach. Development activity was noted as strong with improved infrastructure, though price performance remains poor.\n\n**Token Economics Concerns**: DorianD repeatedly criticized the lack of network tokenomics and utility, stating sophisticated investors won't engage without proper token usage mechanisms. No direct connection exists between Babylon and ElizaOS beyond planned airdrops. The team has locked tokens but concerns persist about selling pressure.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Why does the migration portal show 0 ai16z tokens when I have them? (asked by ROTHILD) A: Users were directed to support channels and told to follow links from the mirror article in announcements channel. (answered by Omid Sa, Manuel, Kenk)\n\nQ: Is the migrate.elizafoundation.ai site safe to connect Phantom wallet? (asked by Bdcrypto7) A: Yes, users should check announcements channel and follow links from the mirror article. (answered by Manuel, Kenk)\n\nQ: Why is ai16z no longer available on Kraken but ElizaOS isn't listed? (asked by TJ) A: ElizaOS was never on Kraken. Kraken sent emails to ai16z holders explaining they are considering migration and will keep holders informed. (answered by Serikiki)\n\nQ: Should I use the dashboard's Twitter API keys or the old env login/password style? (asked by SecretRecipe) A: The user/pass method is now deprecated and no longer works - must use API keys. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Why was the old username/password Twitter authentication method deprecated? (asked by SecretRecipe) A: It's legally not allowed now, at least the team can't support it. Users can fork plugin-twitter 1.0.7 but will face X's lawyers without team support. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Will restarting Eliza trigger another 50 API reads? (asked by SecretRecipe) A: Unanswered (asked by SecretRecipe)\n\nQ: Is it possible to connect agents to Telegram or Discord through the Eliza cloud website? (asked by AlexMtz) A: No, that is not possible. Users should head to dev-support for more questions. (answered by Arceon)\n\nQ: What does the ♡ELZA tag after usernames mean? (asked by cryptograce) A: It's a tag per server that each server can have and you set yourself. (answered by SecretRecipe)\n\nQ: Why is X not happy with Eliza? (asked by SecretRecipe) A: X isn't very happy with us, probably why they took our accounts. They're switching to per-request pricing which should make agents cheaper. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: When will the X account be available? (asked by benzercus) A: The team needs to get the X account back but no timeline provided. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Does Shaw come to Discord? (asked by Phantom589) A: Yes, quite often considering. (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What is Babylon? (asked by Phantom589) A: A prediction market with agents and human integration. (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: What caused the token price collapse? (asked by TJ) A: More people selling than buying, decreased volume, and migration not complete causing low liquidity. (answered by jasyn_bjorn, Omid Sa, hns71)\n\nQ: Is the team selling tokens? (asked by linkupeithme) A: Team tokens are locked. The Eliza treasury portion won't be released soon. (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: Why is there no utility for the token? (asked by DorianD) A: Utility is coming. There will be airdrops for ElizaOS holders and agents created by ElizaOS framework in Babylon will increase framework reputation.

Summary\n\nThe channel discussion centered on three main technical topics related to ElizaOS development.\n\n**Custom REST API Endpoints**: velsaria inquired about implementing custom REST API endpoints in ElizaOS projects but received no responses during this segment.\n\n**PostgreSQL Database Extension**: velsaria asked about extending an existing PostgreSQL database containing data to accommodate ElizaOS core SQL plugin requirements. sayonara confirmed this was possible and provided a concrete implementation reference from the otaku repository, specifically pointing to a gamification plugin example that demonstrates the pattern at line 121 of the plugin.ts file.\n\n**Market Data Fetching**: Skelzor sought recommendations for plugins to fetch offchain market data, noting that the dexscreener plugin had been removed from the plugin directory. They specifically required free alternatives that could handle both offchain and optionally onchain data. jin engaged with follow-up questions to clarify requirements, asking about the specific type of offchain data needed (such as news) and suggesting traditional data engineering approaches as a potential solution.\n\nThe conversation also included an introduction from Bardotta, a full stack and blockchain developer with Sui ecosystem and Move language experience, though this didn't contribute to technical problem-solving.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Can I extend my existing PostgreSQL database (with data inside) to store ElizaOS core SQL plugin needs? (asked by velsaria) A: Yes, you can. Reference implementation available in the otaku repository gamification plugin. (answered by sayonara)\n\nQ: What plugin would you recommend to fetch offchain market data? (asked by Skelzor) A: Unanswered - jin asked for clarification on data type needed and suggested data engineering approaches but no specific plugin was recommended.\n\nQ: Why has dexscreener been removed from the plugin directory?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe primary focus of this chat was a critical security incident affecting elizaos.ai. The website was compromised through a Next.js RCE vulnerability (versions 15.3.0-15.3.6), with attackers deploying an XMR cryptocurrency miner. Odilitime discovered the breach when the site returned a 502 error, revealing malicious code attempting to execute `xorDecode` functions.\n\nThe vulnerability was identified as a critical RCE flaw in Next.js's React flight protocol (GHSA-9qr9-h5gf-34mp), along with several moderate severity issues including cache poisoning, SSRF, and content injection vulnerabilities. Odilitime attempted to deploy a fresh copy, but it was immediately re-compromised, indicating an active exploit.\n\nThe resolution involved multiple steps: rotating PAT tokens, deploying to a fresh VPS, and updating Next.js from version 15.3.1 to 16.0.7 using `bun update --latest`. cjft submitted PR #3 to eliza-website-v2 with the necessary updates. Additional nginx configuration for websocket support was required to complete the fix. The team noted the attacker was running a worm rather than targeted attack, as they only deployed a miner instead of more damaging payloads like fake wallet migration UIs.\n\nOn the development front, version numbering was discussed, with sayonara suggesting 1.6.5 should be 1.7.0 due to significant changes. cjft indicated 1.7.0 would include streaming and Eliza as MCP. Kenk shared a roadmap for Eliza Labs on Notion for team review. Stan was working on streaming functionality with tests in progress. jin recommended Strix Halo mini PCs for self-hosting LLMs, specifically the gmktec evo-x2 128gb running gpt-oss 120b.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is elizaos.ai down? (asked by jasyn_bjorn) A: Yes, confirmed 502 bad gateway error due to security breach (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What caused the website hack? (asked by jasyn_bjorn) A: Next.js RCE vulnerability in versions 15.3.0-15.3.6, specifically GHSA-9qr9-h5gf-34mp (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What was the attacker running? (asked by jasyn_bjorn) A: An XMR cryptocurrency miner (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What's the bounty for finding the flaw? (asked by Odilitime) A: $100, later increased to $1,000 by jasyn_bjorn if solved in 2 hours (answered by jasyn_bjorn)\n\nQ: Does Vercel auto-upgrade vulnerable dependencies? (asked by Odilitime) A: Yes, they auto-detect CVEs and hot patch their runtime for affected projects (answered by cjft)\n\nQ: Should version 1.6.5 be 1.7.0? (asked by sayonara) A: Unanswered directly, but cjft indicated 1.7.0 would include streaming and Eliza as MCP\n\nQ: What will be in version 1.7.0? (asked by sayonara) A: Streaming and Eliza as MCP (answered by cjft)\n\nQ: Any trade-offs with the streaming implementation? (asked by sayonara) A: No, everything works the same, currently working on tests (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Where should the roadmap live?

Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on two main topics: recovery of the elizaos X (Twitter) account and cryptocurrency market predictions for 2026.\n\n**ElizaOS X Account Recovery**: Phenowin raised concerns about recovering the elizaos X account, emphasizing its importance for attracting investor attention during a potential bull run. Odilitime confirmed that recovering the account remains in the plans.\n\n**Market Analysis Discussion**: The conversation evolved into a detailed debate about cryptocurrency market timing. Phenowin anticipated a bull run in Q1/Q2 2026, while DorianD expressed skepticism, predicting 2028 as more likely. DorianD's analysis focused on macroeconomic factors: while Fed rate cuts could unlock capital for risk assets, weakening economic indicators would likely override this effect. He compared the situation to 2020's stimulus checks, suggesting similar intervention would be needed to drive market growth.\n\n**Technical Market Conditions**: Phenowin outlined specific conditions needed for altseason: BTC rallying above $120k (past ATH) and ETH surpassing $5000+ (past its ATH) with sustained levels. DorianD noted that ETH never achieved a full bull run and criticized Bitcoin's limitations from the blocksize debate and 10-minute block times.\n\n**Long-term Vision**: DorianD shared a forward-looking perspective on blockchain's potential, suggesting the real power lies in AI agents that can operate without easy shutdown, combined with futarchy/prediction markets for real-world changes, though he estimated this is 50 years out. He referenced that BTC was originally meant as an experimental test of cryptographic concepts.\n\nThe discussion also touched on geopolitical concerns regarding Elon Musk's conflicts with the EU and predictions about NATO's future and the importance of decentralized networks for communications and commerce.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is it in our 2026 plans to recover our elizaos x account? (asked by Phenowin) A: Still planning on getting it back (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Will there be a bull run in 2026? (asked by Phenowin) A: Doubt there will be a bull run in 2026, more like 2028 (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: What market conditions are needed for altseason? (asked by Phenowin) A: BTC needs to rally back above 120k past ATH and ETH to 5000$+ past its ATH and sustain those levels (answered by Phenowin)\n\n## 3.

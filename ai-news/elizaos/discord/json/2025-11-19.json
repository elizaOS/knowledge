      "summary": "# Analysis of 💬-discussion Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on token migration issues from ai16z to elizaOS. Users reported various problems with the migration portal, including tokens not showing up after wallet connection and indefinite loading screens. The migration process involves a 6:1 token ratio (1 ai16z = 6 elizaOS). For users experiencing technical difficulties, the team offers manual migration through a support ticket system. Several exchanges are handling the migration automatically, though users noted delays with Kraken. The migration eligibility is based on a snapshot taken on November 11, 2023, at 11:40 UTC. Users who purchased tokens after this date or had them in farming pools need to follow the manual migration process. The migration portal will remain open until February 5, 2026. Team tokens have a vesting schedule (3-month cliff + 9-month linear vest), but this doesn't apply to community tokens.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What happens to my ai16z tokens? (asked by BigDude) A: You need to migrate them to elizaOS tokens through the official portal or wait for exchange announcements if held on exchanges (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: How can I migrate my ai16z tokens? (asked by zicase01) A: Use the migration portal or follow the manual migration process through support tickets if experiencing issues (answered by Toni)\nQ: What is the conversion ratio for ai16z to elizaOS? (asked by Rainman) A: 1 ai16z equals 6 elizaOS tokens (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Until when can I migrate my tokens? (asked by Rainman) A: The web portal is open until February 5, 2026 (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Why don't my tokens appear in the migration portal? (asked by 0xYogi) A: Only tokens held before November 11, 11:40 UTC are eligible; if experiencing technical issues, use the support ticket system (answered by Toni)\nQ: What if my tokens are on Kraken? (asked by BigDude) A: Keep them on Kraken and wait for their announcement (answered by jasyn_bjorn)\nQ: Is there vesting for community tokens? (asked by Rainman) A: No, the vesting schedule (3-month cliff + 9-month linear vest) only applies to team tokens (answered by Toni)\nQ: What if I had my tokens in farming pools? (asked by Rainman) A: If your tokens were in a farm before the snapshot date, you need to proceed through manual migration via support ticket (answered by Omid sa)\n\n## 3.

Key technical discussions include the possibility of running ElizaOS in browser-based TEEs on iOS devices, EIP-8004 support in Babylon's implementation, and the relationship between agent0 and the main ElizaOS codebase. Several users inquired about the prerequisites for developing with ElizaOS, with clarification that TypeScript knowledge is essential but React/Solidity are not required initially. There were also questions about token migration issues to ElizaOS, though these remained largely unresolved in the transcript. The conversation indicates ElizaOS is positioned as an agent framework rather than a traditional bot platform, with emphasis on following the official documentation at Eliza.how for proper onboarding.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can ElizaOS runtime run in browser to make a dedicated iOS app using TEE tech for agent enclaves? (asked by DorianD) A: In theory, yes. (answered by cjft)\nQ: Is Babylon's EIP-8004 support and agent0 on Ethereum+Filecoin going to make it into the main ElizaOS codebase? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can I start developing using ElizaOS with my current JavaScript knowledge? (asked by amnesia) A: You need to know TypeScript and learn ElizaOS. Start with Eliza.how and complete the framework guide. (answered by vaipraonde)\nQ: Do I need Solidity or React to use ElizaOS? (asked by amnesia) A: No, you don't need React nor Solid to start. (answered by vaipraonde)\nQ: Can I use ElizaOS for creating a trading bot and monetize it? (asked by amnesia) A: First understand how it works, then create a trading agent (not bot). Check Eliza.how, learn CLI tool and create your first agent. (answered by vaipraonde)\nQ: Why don't my Ai16z tokens show on the website during migration? (asked by 00bigmac) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Stan is requesting to continue work on a pull request (#6135) that Odilitime started but hasn't completed. Odilitime agrees, mentioning it took a long time and would be better to continue rather than restart. Stan also provides a standup update about completing E2E authentication tests related to Entity/server isolation, adding a real Postgres instance in CI for testing, and plans to continue optimizing server tests. Stan requests reviews for several PRs (#6143, #6142, #6114, and #6107). Later, Borko shares a link to a tweet about a company pivoting, warning the team not to follow a similar path.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can I continue your work on PR #6135? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Please continue. That one took a long time, so it probably better to continue than to restart.

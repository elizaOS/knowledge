      "summary": "# Analysis of 💬-discussion Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around ElizaOS token economics, revenue models, and community concerns about price action. Key technical points include clarification about the \"generative treasury\" versus the \"Eliza cloud\" revenue model. Borko confirmed that Cloud will initially use revenue for ElizaOS token buybacks, with additional token utility planned when Jeju is released. There was confusion about whether revenue would be used for buybacks, which Odilitime clarified by stating that revenue (but not yield) would be used for this purpose. A user inquired about migrating tokens from Moonshot wallet, and community members warned about potential scams in this process. The GitHub roadmap was referenced regarding future token utility beyond buybacks. The discussion also touched on market conditions, with the token reportedly down 99.5% from its peak, prompting community encouragement to remain patient.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's generative treasury? (asked by sayitaintso25) A: Not directly answered in the chat\nQ: Why would anybody invest in the Eliza token if the cloud product doesn't impact it? (asked by sayitaintso25) A: Some revenue will be used for buy backs, the yield won't (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Why can't we copy the tokenomics of virtual?

I hold some 50k Ai16z in my moonshot (asked by Dabel) A: You should move your tokens to phantom wallet (answered by Hexx 🌐)\nQ: What if i purchased some after the migration date, can u migrate them all with the tokens i held before the migration date? (asked by Dabel) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Odilitime pushed changes to plugin-starknet and shared a link to plugin-wrapped repository. There was a brief installation troubleshooting exchange regarding the ElizaOS CLI. A significant discussion occurred about building an agent for illness-related psychological data using ElizaOS Cloud, where Borko clarified the 50MB file upload limit and mentioned that custom model hosting is on the roadmap for the following week. Markdown was recommended as the preferred format for data uploads. There was also a brief exchange about unruggable actions and some unspecified code issues that Odilitime offered to help fix.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can I transfer 300 pages of book data to my agent, or would that be too much context for a cloud agent? (asked by Scrapy Coco) A: For file uploads we've set a limit of 50MB. (answered by Borko)\nQ: Is it possible to use open source models on my own GPU servers via the ElizaOS cloud? (asked by Scrapy Coco) A: Using custom models hosted own your own is not available yet, but it's on our roadmap. Will probably be ready next week. (answered by Borko)\nQ: What format would you suggest for data? (asked by Scrapy Coco) A: Best is markdown, but can do most types just fine. (answered by Borko)\n\n## 3.

A user (sayitaintso25) questioned why the project couldn't adopt Virtual's tokenomics model where agent tokens are paired with the main token to provide liquidity. They expressed concern that without clear value accrual to the Eliza token, developers would lack incentives to build on the ecosystem. The user specifically pointed to limited information in the GitHub roadmap about token utility beyond gas fees. Odilitime responded that token value comes from product usage, coordination, and service demand scaling with activity. The team is prioritizing infrastructure development to create sustained demand rather than reacting to short-term market pressures. There were also brief discussions about unusual selling patterns on BNB chain, with speculation about MEV (Miner Extractable Value) activity.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why can't we copy Virtual's tokenomics where every agent token is paired with the main token? (asked by sayitaintso25) A: The team is focused on building infrastructure that creates sustained demand through product usage rather than reacting to short-term market pressure. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: What happens to the collaboration with Stanford crypto lab about the agentic market? (asked by sayitaintso25) A: Unanswered\nQ: Where in the roadmap does it mention value accrual to the Eliza token? (asked by sayitaintso25) A: The roadmap is a technical document, not a tokenomics piece. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Where is all the supply coming from on the market? (asked by Broccolex) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Kenk | Helpee: pangolink | Context: Unusual trading activity on BNB chain | Resolution: Kenk investigated a transaction and suggested it might be MEV (Miner Extractable Value) activity causing the constant small sells.\n\n## 4.

Shaw mentioned building a pure Bun frontend with Elysia workers and workerd (similar to Cloudflare), creating a fully serverless application that builds significantly faster than Next.js. Stan mentioned updating monorepo documentation that contained outdated information. There were also brief mentions of issues with DTS generation, wrong Bun/Node/NPM versions, and a GitHub Actions job failure due to Claude billing needing a top-up. The conversation was fragmented with minimal detailed technical discussion.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Which app?

The conversation primarily consists of greetings and brief inquiries about the Eliza project. A few users express interest in contributing to the project or building on Eliza. There are questions about the DAO structure, governance, and potential rewards for contributors, with Kenk providing limited responses indicating that governance is still in early stages. One user (z1) inquires about using Eliza for Twitter scraping as an alternative to purchasing the Twitter API, with MonteCrypto briefly responding about detection challenges. Stan mentions working on \"v2\" and asks about potential airdrops for contributors. Mhardook indicates their company is building on Eliza and seeks information about the DAO's structure and governance. Overall, the chat shows a community in early stages with limited technical depth in this particular segment.\n\n## 2.

There appears to be confusion about whether FightFi, reportedly the first partner launch, was actually launching that day. Community members shared screenshots from the FightFi Discord suggesting no launch was planned, despite auto.fun verification. This created uncertainty as some believed it might be a strategy to deter snipers. By the end of the conversation, tokens appeared to have launched despite earlier denials, with community members questioning the verification process and launch coordination. A user named Simon also asked technical questions about platform features including verification, profile points, file upload capabilities, and chart time range options.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - \"core-devs\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical issues with the Discord plugin and logging improvements. Odilitime identified and fixed several bugs discovered during real-world testing, including an error related to the \"gpt-5-nano\" model requiring \"max_completion_tokens\" instead of \"max_tokens\". Stan discussed logging improvements, proposing a cleaner format that maintains JSON for production while using a more readable single-line format for development. The team also discussed tool routing systems, with Stan providing a detailed explanation of how Composio's tool router works through a \"discover → plan → execute\" workflow. Shaw shared Anthropic's new advanced tool use capabilities, noting similarities to their own \"build an agent\" functionality. The team also acknowledged that their documentation needs updating, with a suggestion to rely on deepwiki.com instead.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How about we only add that much logging if it's .debug? (asked by Odilitime) A: Pretty when pretty and JSON with good filters when JSON_LOG. No more multiline when pretty (answered by Stan ⚡)\nQ: Did you see how they are doing workflows?

Kenk confirmed that Eliza agents will be able to utilize x402 through a new \"Eliza Cloud\" agent development platform. This integration has been in development for some time and is important for agent payments. There was also discussion about WuAI, a platform for launching AI agents that replicate a user's digital footprint, with plans to integrate x402. Community members expressed concern about the timing of the migration, with some suggesting that marketing around x402 integration is currently more important than the migration itself. Kenk confirmed that all exchanges have been notified about the migration, but it's not yet open, and users should watch for official announcements. There was also mention that ElizaOS had shipped something a month ago, suggesting they're ahead in development but need better marketing.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Any x402 related integration?

Community members express concern about the project's marketing approach, with komi suggesting a comprehensive organizational restructuring, particularly in the marketing department. There's consensus that while the technology and partnerships are strong, communication and outreach don't reflect the project's potential. Several members note that the migration is a critical pending task, with DannyNOR expressing confidence in the project's future post-migration. Borko mentions that \"Eliza Cloud will handle x402 payments,\" suggesting integration with payment protocols. The community also discusses the importance of social media presence, specifically highlighting that the official Twitter/X account needs restoration. Kenk shares that they're working with a ping developer to set up something (unspecified). Overall, the conversation centers on organizational improvements rather than specific technical implementations.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Any news on the migration? (asked by Milo) A: Unanswered\nQ: How are the team supposed to market something when they're under an NDA?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - \"core-devs\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on integrating x402 payment protocol into elizaOS's ecosystem. The team explored implementing x402 in multiple ways: enabling it in the server with an ENABLE_X402 flag, creating MCPs (Machine Callable Programs) that support x402 payments, and developing wallet integration for agents. cjft demonstrated rapid implementation by creating several x402-enabled MCPs for services like Twitter API, OpenAI image generation, and CoinGecko PRO on elizaCloud within 30 minutes. The team identified that the main blocker is that most agents lack wallet support. They discussed creating a custodial wallet MCP to allow agents like Cursor and Claude Code to use x402 immediately. The team also mentioned focusing on cloud development for a November 15th deadline while exploring business opportunities in the x402 space. There was discussion about positioning elizaOS as an x402 MCP registry and leveraging the growing momentum around x402 in the web3 community, with cjft establishing connections with Coinbase and Polygon x402 groups.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can we put LLM functionality over x402? (asked by Stan âš¡) A: Yes, image generation through OpenAI x402 was already implemented, allowing Claude agents to generate OpenAI images (answered by cjft)\nQ: Is Cloud using MCP gateway right now? (asked by Stan âš¡) A: No (answered by cjft)\nQ: What to do with actual plugins (action/provider)? Should we make MCPs instead? (asked by Stan âš¡) A: For now just make good mcp-plugin that wraps to actions, only way for eliza right now (answered by cjft)\nQ: Are the Coinbase payments-mcp and elizaos/mcp-gateway repositories similar? (asked by jin) A: No (answered by sayonara)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: cjft | Helpee: Stan âš¡ | Context: Implementing x402 in elizaOS | Resolution: Provided specific implementation details including config format and required environment variables (X402_ENABLED + CDP_WALLET_SECRET)\nHelper: sayonara | Helpee: Stan âš¡ | Context: Implementing x402 in server | Resolution: Suggested starting with ENABLE_X402=true flag on server to enable one-off messaging via x402/rest for agents\nHelper: cjft | Helpee: Team | Context: Demonstrating x402 implementation | Resolution: Created and shared three working x402 MCPs (Twitter, OpenAI image generation, CoinGecko) on elizaCloud within 30 minutes\n\n## 4.

Odilitime shared updates about the SpartanVersus Twitter account being back online and receiving verification (blue checkmark and affiliate badge). Development efforts are focused on upgrading Spartan to v2, fixing autonomous trading bugs, preparing for Discord and Telegram integration, and readying the code for open source release. However, there are challenges with the v2 upgrade as they're having difficulty maintaining Spartan's distinctive voice. The team is also working on cross-promotion with \"autofun\" as a launch partner. Some community members inquired about automated trading functionality, but no timeline was provided. There was also mention of attempting to recover an old account and making appeals, though the context for this was limited.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When can automated trading be used? (asked by jr6666.)

The platform experienced significant technical issues during launch due to unexpectedly high traffic, causing the team to temporarily redirect the site while upgrading servers. Auto.fun uses Raydium AMM with a custom mechanism developed with the Raydium team that enables liquidity NFTs, allowing token deployers to claim fees from burned/graduated LP positions. Users can create new tokens or import existing ones, with a bonding mechanism for liquidity. The platform has a buyback mechanism where fees from Auto.fun go to AI16z, which then buys DegenAI tokens. A test token called KoalaCoin was created with low liquidity to test bonding functionality. Users discussed potential features like connecting Eliza bots to tokens and implementing token-gated chats.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can anyone create a coin even without dev skills and community behind?

(asked by Redvoid) A: Once you create the new token and go to that token's page, you'll be able to update the metadata (X account etc.) as long as you remain connected with the same wallet that created the token (answered by eskender.eth)\nQ: Does autofun make use of raydium amm? (asked by wire) A: Yes, we use Raydium. This is a new mechanism developed with the Raydium team, enabling liquidity NFTs that allow the token deployer to claim the fees of the burned/graduated LP position (answered by eskender.eth)\nQ: What's the reason for poor liquidity currently?

The discussion captures the final stages of testing, bug fixes, and the actual launch process. Shaw and the team addressed server migration issues that caused timeouts during token creation. Partners expressed both excitement and frustration throughout the pre-launch period. When auto.fun finally went live, users immediately began creating tokens but encountered various technical issues including transaction timeouts, failed token creations that still deployed contracts, and liquidity problems with newly created tokens. The platform allows users to create tokens with bonding curves and import existing tokens. There was also significant discussion about Shaw's endorsement of a community token ($FUN) related to auto.fun, which caused confusion among partners who had been told earlier that it wasn't being endorsed.\n\n## 2.

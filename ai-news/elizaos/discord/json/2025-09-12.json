Shaw identified an issue with the \"elizaos\" NPM package that needed fixing. CJFT agreed to address it, and they discussed whether it should be part of \"core\" or \"cli\" components, concluding it should be a CLI alias. The team also discussed NPM token management, with CJFT suggesting regenerating old tokens and noting they would need a second NPM token in CI because \"elizaos\" is not in the organization. They considered transferring the package to simplify management. Shaw offered to add team members as maintainers to the Eliza package and sent invites. Borko shared a recording of a benchmark work demo. There were also discussions about GitHub permissions, with Odilitime unable to add Stan to the organization, requiring assistance from someone with owner privileges.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Should the elizaos NPM package be core or cli? (asked by cjft) A: Cli, just an alias (answered by shaw)\nQ: Can I add people to the org GitHub?

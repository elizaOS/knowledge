      "summary": "# Analysis of üí¨-discussion Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around the upcoming migration from $AI16Z to $ElizaOS tokens. Users are seeking clarification on migration procedures, especially regarding tokens held on centralized exchanges (CEXs) versus self-custody wallets. Key information shared includes that migration must be done manually, with users needing to transfer tokens to wallets like Phantom or Metamask. The migration will involve a conversion rate where 1 $AI16Z exchanges for 6 $ElizaOS tokens.

Community members directed others to check the mirror post in the rules and FAQ channel for official migration details. Some users raised concerns about potential value loss during migration and questioned what would happen to futures positions on exchanges.\n\n## 2.

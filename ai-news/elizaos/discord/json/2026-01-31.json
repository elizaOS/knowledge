      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel discussion covered two main technical areas: framework comparisons and ElizaCloud integration issues.\n\n**Framework Discussion**: The conversation began with comparing Clawd/Claude framework to Eliza. Key observations were that Clawd's success stems from focusing on non-crypto users and the Moltbook integration, with agents creating \"skills\" and posting to ClawHub. DigitalDiva noted Clawd's appeal is its ability to use computers with any LLM, attracting non-crypto audiences, while ElizaOS remains crypto-focused. YogaFlame mentioned that crypto features in Eliza resulted from community requests and noted \"openclaw\" updates coming in 2 weeks with better security.\n\n**ElizaCloud Integration Issues**: DorianD attempted to connect an OpenClaw agent to ElizaCloud MCP app and encountered critical server-side bugs. The agent reported authentication success but failed due to an isomorphic-dompurify module loading error - a CommonJS/ESM compatibility issue in ElizaCloud deployment. Additional errors included contentModerationService function failures in the A2A message/send endpoint. DorianD requested documentation for the a2a protocol, which 0xbbjoker provided (https://www.dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a). DorianD also inquired about CLI login using API tokens instead of browser authentication.\n\n**Security Incident**: A significant portion involved Risto being targeted by a scammer impersonating Eliza support, requesting Ledger seed phrases for token migration. Maff || Hourglass ⌛ successfully intervened and prevented the scam. The actual issue was Risto's inability to migrate ai16z tokens stored on Ledger wallet during snapshot time.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Why isn't Eliza doing what Clawd is doing? (asked by DorianD) A: YogaFlame explained that Eliza's crypto features exist because the community requested them, while Clawd focused on non-crypto users (answered by YogaFlame)\n\nQ: Where is the documentation for the a2a protocol? (asked by DorianD) A: https://www.dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\nQ: Is it possible to log into the CLI just with an API token instead of going through browser actions? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is this real help support eliza or scammer? (asked by Risto) A: Doesn't seem real, don't connect your ledger or share seed phrases (answered by Maff || Hourglass ⌛)\n\nQ: Is there anyone who got help from eliza support to migrate ai16z tokens? (asked by Risto) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Did you move your tokens to phantom before snapshot was taken? (asked by Cloud Flare 👀) A: No, they were in ledger wallet (answered by Risto)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\n\nHelper: Maff || Hourglass ⌛ | Helpee: Risto | Context: Risto was contacted by scammer impersonating Eliza support requesting Ledger seed phrase for token migration | Resolution: Successfully warned Risto not to connect wallet or share credentials, preventing scam\n\nHelper: 0xbbjoker | Helpee: DorianD | Context: DorianD needed documentation for a2a protocol to connect OpenClaw agent to ElizaCloud | Resolution: Provided link to a2a documentation at https://www.dev.elizacloud.ai/docs/a2a\n\nHelper: Maff || Hourglass ⌛ | Helpee: Risto | Context: Risto was asking migration questions in wrong channel | Resolution: Directed to appropriate language channel for support\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centers on strategic positioning of Eliza and moltbots within gaming platforms, specifically Babylon and Hyperscape. User 's' provides historical context about Eliza's evolution, noting that initial deployment (agent on X, Twitch integration, ETH wallet) gained no traction until Truth Terminal's success created market awareness. The team now sees a clear value proposition: positioning as \"a game your moltbot can play\" and \"like moltbot but on your phone and secure.\"\n\nThe core technical decision involves deploying Babylon (a social media platform for agents with profile pictures and personalities) into TEE (Trusted Execution Environment). Agent Joshua emphasizes Babylon's potential for agents to develop public narratives, alignments, and disagreements that could drive rapid growth. The team discusses prioritizing this over the Jeju project.\n\nA critical technical concern raised by puncar involves the timing of TEE deployment. The recommendation is to run parallel workstreams - continue developing the game engine outside TEE for easier fine-tuning while simultaneously preparing TEE integration, then switching when ready. This prevents premature deployment that could complicate iteration.\n\nThe team identifies a 3-month hype cycle window, with additional momentum expected from Claude 5 release. The strategic focus shifts toward rapid deployment of Babylon as the right product for current market conditions, with \"eliza the app\" positioned as a consumer-friendly alternative to complex setups requiring Mac minis.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Should we prioritize Babylon/TEE deployment over Jeju? (asked by s) A: Yes, the team should discuss with Phala team about fast-tracking this focus and getting the game in TEE ASAP (answered by s)\n\nQ: What do you think about putting the game to TEE timing? (asked by puncar) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Will openclaw/openclawbook be the next iteration after moltbook? (asked by R0am | tip.md) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on several technical and community concerns regarding ElizaOS. Key technical developments included Odilitime creating a new plugin-cskills repository for ElizaOS, learning from openclaw's implementation. He also published a babylon skill on clawhub to enable openclaw integration with their products and is working on getting agents into moltbook for exposure.\n\nA significant technical question arose about migrating tokens across networks, with Odilitime suggesting Chainlink's Transporter as a starting point. The conversation revealed that ElizaOS agents now have shell access to users' computers and API keys for personal services, representing an evolution from previous \"agent worlds.\"\n\nCommunity concerns dominated much of the discussion. Users criticized elizacloud.ai for being launched in an unfit beta state. Multiple complaints emerged about the development approach, with averma criticizing half-completed code releases on GitHub and lack of token utility integration. The ElizaOS Cloud platform was noted to accept only cash or crypto payments through third-party integration, with no token use case, raising concerns about the token's purpose.\n\nTransparency issues were highlighted regarding team wallets and token allocation. Questions arose about the 40% supply assigned to the team after the ai16z to eliza token swap, vesting schedules, and whether team members or projects had dumped tokens. Users reported that rugcheck flagged ElizaOS as a red flag project, though Odilitime explained this tool is designed for meme coins rather than corporate tokens.\n\nThe team's runway was disclosed as 6-8 months, independent of elizaOS token value. Technical infrastructure discussions included whether ElizaOS and openclaw require VM or dedicated computer deployment, with confirmation that both can run on VMs or old computers. Skills from clawhub can be downloaded and integrated into ElizaOS.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Any good docs on migrating these tokens to other networks? I want try hopping chains (asked by Skinny) A: Transporter by chainlink might be a good starting place (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Hi my $ai16z balance does not show up in the migration portal? Can anyone help? (asked by single-celled organism) A: Redirected to another channel (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: Are the team wallets known? Correct me if I'm wrong but they assigned 40% of the supply to themselves when they increased the supply after the swap from the ai16z token to the eliza token? (asked by Jayzen) A: That is vested - and not all 40% will go to team, but team should disclose current supply and any sales (answered by averma)\n\nQ: Are there any other good solana token analysis tools besides rugcheck? (asked by Odilitime) A: I don't think so (answered by averma)\n\nQ: So it looks like ppl can download any skill from clawhub and integrate it into elizaos. Like with openclaw you would want it on VM or old computer, would this need the same? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: elizaOS or openclaw can run in a vm or old computer (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Assume 2 year bear market started now - Does the team have enough resources to survive and operate during a full bear market? (asked by averma) A: We have 6-8 months run way is what I've heard (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: You mean 6-8 months of bear market or enough resources? (asked by Mixer008) A: The runway isn't based on elizaOS value afaik (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

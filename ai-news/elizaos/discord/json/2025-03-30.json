Jin shared a GitHub repository (ai-news) with a bounty task to improve the digestibility and accuracy of AI-summarized data about Eliza and Hyperfy. The repository contains folders of AI-aggregated data on the gh-pages branch. Jin also shared a HackMD link where they've been exploring weekly newsletters using a script that fetches and combines logs for summarization. They suggested several ideas for improving the data presentation, including daily updates for tweets, weekly updates for threads, dashboard concepts, making content more succinct, generating image prompts with Claude, storyboarding concepts, and using LLMs for insights. Patt mentioned being unavailable for a month but expressed interest in working on these bounties later. The conversation also included sharing of Twitter/X posts about visual AI ideas that could be incorporated into contributor guides for non-technical people or contests.\n\n## 2.

DorianD expressed concerns about this model potentially undervaluing contributors' work.\n\nJin shared progress on a new animation project called \"Clank Tank\" with improved production workflows, allowing rapid creation of cinematic scenes with AI feedback. The system now includes baked sets, animated camera paths, clip transitions, automated recording/editing scripts, and a new website. Jin also demonstrated using ChatGPT for thumbnail generation, working with whobody to refine images despite rate limiting issues.\n\nSeveral community members inquired about Auto.fun's launch timeline and token utilities, with Jin sharing that profits would be used for ai16z buybacks.

The platform experienced backend issues during its launch, causing migrations to be delayed and the site to go down multiple times due to high load. Users created tokens on the platform but faced various issues including tokens not showing up, migration delays, and price display problems. The team worked on backend fixes and eventually got the platform running, though with some lingering issues. There were discussions about which tokens were created first and which would migrate first, with KRSK being identified as the first token that migrated successfully with 79 SOL added to LP. The chat also touched on AI16z, which some users speculated might be the native token for auto.fun, though others disagreed. The team mentioned they would be sharing information about launch partners in the coming days/weeks and temporarily put the site into maintenance mode for updates.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat segment primarily revolves around AutoFun, a product associated with ElizaOS that appears to be experiencing downtime. Community members, particularly HoneyBadger, express concerns about communication during the outage, suggesting updates on social media platforms to keep users informed, especially as users in different time zones begin to notice the issue. There's also discussion about AI16z token sentiment, with concerns that despite AutoFun's launch, the token narrative lacks clarity. The original focus on GitHub stars, forks, and launchpad functionality has diminished, raising questions about whether AutoFun can generate sufficient revenue to create buyback pressure. The conversation indicates that the team is working on resolving the site outage, with jin confirming that status updates would be provided shortly.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why is the AutoFun site down?

      "summary": "# Auto.fun Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat revolves around the launch of auto.fun, a platform for token creation and content generation with AI features. The platform experienced significant technical issues during its launch, including site downtime, token migration problems, and liquidity issues. Users reported tokens being \"locked\" with no ability to sell, and some early tokens not migrating properly. The development team has been working continuously (reportedly on a 40+ hour dev call) to fix these issues. The platform allows users to create tokens, generate AI images, and eventually will support \"agentic\" features. There was also discussion about a potential security breach of Shaw's (team member) Twitter account that was used to promote a suspicious token called \"COO\". The team clarified that auto.fun is currently focused on token and content creation, with plans to expand to agent creation in V2.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When will tokens get migrated? (asked by Zgod) A: It should be an automatic migration, but there are indexing issues impacting some tokens (answered by eskender.eth)\nQ: What does \"locked\" status mean for tokens? (asked by noj) A: The \"locked\" status indicates that the token's liquidity pool tokens have been successfully locked as part of a migration process (answered by shaw)\nQ: Can we sell auto.fun tokens somewhere other than auto.fun? (asked by noj) A: Not at the moment, and liquidity is currently low (answered by yikesawjeez)\nQ: Is there a way to see which tokens are close to migrating? (asked by Pyroman) A: Not yet, but it's being refined (answered by Mr G)\nQ: Are there any agentic features in the current auto.fun release? (asked by 0xFastly) A: The current focus is on token and content creation, with agent features planned for V2 (answered by Kenk and eskender.eth)\nQ: What's the difference between migrating and importing tokens? (asked by Pyroman) A: Import brings older coins to appear verified, migration involves closing liquid pools and launching to decentralized exchanges (answered by Mr G)\nQ: Is Shaw's account hacked? (asked by Puppet) A: Yes, Shaw's account was compromised and used to issue a token called \"COO\" on Pump.fun (answered by eskender.eth)\nQ: Is there anywhere to see total volume for auto.fun?

Users reported multiple problems with token creation, including: tokens stuck in migration, missing liquidity pools, inability to trade created tokens, and lost SOL investments. The development team, primarily represented by accelxr, acknowledged these issues and worked to resolve them. The main technical problems stemmed from indexing errors with early token creations and migration failures. The team implemented manual fixes for affected tokens while working on a broader solution. Throughout the period, the platform underwent maintenance to address these issues. Key technical details included the bonding curve mechanism (28 SOL initial virtual reserves, graduation to Raydium at 113 SOL), LP token distribution (90/10 split between creators and Auto.fun), and the distinction between tokens created on the official platform versus those created using a leaked developer link (autoUm program).\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does the bonding curve work? (asked by multiple users) A: Auto.fun uses a bonding curve with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves. When a coin reaches 113 SOL in reserves (85 SOL + 28 SOL virtual), it automatically graduates to Raydium with a 6 SOL flat fee. (answered by jin and accelxr)\nQ: What happens to tokens created before the official launch? (asked by multiple users) A: Tokens created using the leaked developer link (autoUm program) cannot be supported, while tokens created on the official platform with indexing issues will be fixed. (answered by accelxr)\nQ: How does the \"Claim Fees\" function work? (asked by Xyness) A: Post-bonding, token creators can claim fees from the LP, receiving a combination of the created token and SOL. After pressing the button, it will appear in your wallet a couple minutes later. (answered by accelxr)\nQ: What is the fee split for liquidity providers? (asked by Xyness) A: It's a 90/10 split for the token owner and the platform respectively. (answered by Borko)\nQ: How much SOL is required for migration? (asked by Tocheee) A: 85 SOL in the bonding curve (which with the 28 SOL virtual reserves equals 113 SOL). (answered by accelxr)\nQ: What's the issue with Twitter 2FA secret for Fleek integration? (asked by CheddarQueso ðŸ§€) A: Documentation was provided via link to help with the authentication process. (answered by accelxr)\nQ: When will the first partnership be announced?

The launch experienced several technical issues that the team worked to address. Key technical problems included indexing issues where some tokens weren't properly migrated, Jupiter integration errors with decimal handling, and liquidity bonding problems. The platform operates on a 90/10 fee split between creators and the platform, with the platform's portion used for $ai16z buybacks. The team implemented maintenance mode to fix critical issues before proceeding with marketing efforts and onboarding launch partners. Users reported successful token creation and migration after initial problems, with tokens like $CRIME gaining traction. The team prioritized fixing backend overload issues and UI bugs before proceeding with a larger marketing push. There were also discussions about tokenomics details, which would be formally released later, including the 10% platform fee structure for reinvesting in ecosystem liquidity.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the fee structure for Auto.fun? (asked by Curtisdonthurtus) A: The platform collects 10% of the bonded LPs fees, then will buyback $ai16z from the open market, to finally reinvest in ai16z LP to create deeper ecosystem liquidity. (answered by eskender.eth)\nQ: How do you get a verified tick on Auto.fun? (asked by [[{{,,,}}]]) A: Currently reserved for companies with prior relationships that have been vetted. A formal process will be released when the platform is more stable. (answered by eskender.eth)\nQ: How do you get featured on Auto.fun?

(answered by accelxr)\nQ: Why isn't Degenai included in the buyback mechanism? (asked by Void) A: 1) Spartan already gets carry, 2) technical complexity of splitting fees across numerous buyback mechanisms, 3) it would confuse the ecosystem vs agent narrative. (answered by eskender.eth)\nQ: What was the main issue with tokens not showing up properly? (asked by yikesawjeez) A: Indexing issues.

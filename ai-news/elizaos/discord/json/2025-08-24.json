      "summary": "# Analysis of \"discussion\" Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about AI16z, a project related to AI agents and tokenization. There are mentions of ElizaOS as a framework for creating AI agents, with auto.fun (also referred to as autodotfun) being a related platform currently under maintenance. A new platform called daos.fun is discussed as a potential alternative for launching AI projects. Community members express interest in the technical aspects of creating AI agents, with some users seeking no-code solutions. There are discussions about the potential tokenization of \"Clank Tank,\" though jin (likely a team member) clarifies there are no current plans for this. The conversation also touches on delegation features in Realms.today that could allow voting power to be delegated to AI agents. Overall, the chat shows a community interested in AI agent development with varying levels of technical expertise.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does this LLM relate to ai16z? (asked by Kush) A: Unanswered\nQ: For launching memecoin what kind of programmers do we need? (asked by Eve.) A: Unanswered\nQ: Any devs planning on making anything on the new daos platform? (asked by nico) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is it very difficult to launch an agent via elizaOS as someone who was originally looking for a \"no code solution\"? (asked by TheRealUltra) A: Fleek.xyz uses elizaOS framework to allow users to no code create agents. It was built into autofun also. Try that route. (answered by Dean)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Dean | Helpee: TheRealUltra | Context: User looking for no-code solution to create AI agents | Resolution: Suggested using Fleek.xyz which uses elizaOS framework for no-code agent creation\n\n## 4.

Yoda26 encountered an error message after successfully running a few prompts with their agent. Benquik faced difficulties adding plugins (specifically Telegram) to a second character project. They discovered the issue was related to their AI model selection - when using Local AI (Ollama), they couldn't add certain plugins, but switching to Anthropic for AI and OpenAI for embedding resolved the issue. Additionally, dEXploarer mentioned adding a DeepWiki badge to the readme file in an upcoming PR.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why am I getting \"There was an error processing your message request\" after a few successful prompts? (asked by Yoda26) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why can't I use the Telegram plugin on my new character? (asked by Benquik) A: You need to use the correct plugin name \"@elizaos/plugin-telegram\" and also need OpenAI or another embedding provider. The issue may be related to your AI model selection. (answered by sayonara)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: sayonara | Helpee: Benquik | Context: Unable to add Telegram plugin to a second character | Resolution: Identified incorrect plugin naming and missing embedding provider; Benquik discovered the root cause was using Local AI (Ollama) which limited plugin compatibility\nHelper: starlord | Helpee: Yoda26 | Context: Error processing message request in ElizaOS | Resolution: Requested additional information about errors and Ollama generation process, but issue remained unresolved\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nTechnical: Add DeepWiki badge to readme file | Description: Add \"[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/elizaOS/eliza)\" to the readme | Mentioned By: dEXploarer\nDocumentation: Document plugin compatibility with different AI models | Description: Document which plugins work with which AI models (e.g., Telegram plugin incompatibility with Local AI/Ollama) | Mentioned By: Benquik",

Users are discussing a token with address 9NyLLGRxpCSKrT8z5RwxDbNdtt71Z6hca8G3Shfvdaos, which appears to be called \"daos.fun\" on the Solana blockchain. A user named Cayden0207 asks if this token was created by someone named Shaw for \"baoskee on autofun.\" User \"ovo\" confirms this is correct and later clarifies it's \"The first token's contract that ends with 'daos', created by Shaw.\" The token appears to have some performance metrics (40.9K/509%) mentioned by Rick. There is no substantial technical discussion, problem-solving, or implementation details in this brief exchange.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - \"core-devs\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment covers several development updates across different components of the project. Sam-developer reported migrating storage from LocalStack to MinIO to solve persistence issues, stabilizing image generation flow, and fixing model endpoint issues. Stan shared progress on a tools plugin that enables users to connect/disconnect integrations via the agent with OAuth, featuring multi-connection support per tool with dedicated authentication for each user. The system includes plan/dependency graph analysis and tool-chaining based on user requests, plus a provider for previous tool executions to maintain context. Additionally, yung_algorithm mentioned applying for a GitHub OS grant, and jin reported completing Clank Tank episodes for all hackathon submissions, noting that the hackathon helped identify bugs and areas for improvement.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What storage solution replaced LocalStack and why? (implied from sam-developer's update) A: MinIO replaced LocalStack because LocalStack wiped buckets on every container restart, preventing persistent storage (answered by sam-developer)\n\n## 3.

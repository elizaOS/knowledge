Auto.fun was recently released and is currently in maintenance mode for upgrades and bug fixes. There are discussions about the relationship between auto.fun and the AI16z token, with some users expressing concern that the auto.fun launch hasn't positively impacted the AI16z token price. Users are anticipating ElizaV2's release, hoping it will generate market optimism. Kenk, a team member, confirmed that auto.fun's initial release was successful by internal metrics and mentioned upcoming information about launch partners.

HoneyBadger raises concerns about the lack of coherent messaging around the token, noting that early narratives about GitHub stars, forks, and launchpad functionality have faded. There's uncertainty about whether autofun (apparently a recently launched product) can generate sufficient revenue to create buyback pressure. Kenk mentions upcoming communications about tokenomics. The conversation also touches on a debate about priorities in the ecosystem, with references to a statement from someone named Alon that emphasizes liquidity over other aspects. Some members disagree with this take, arguing that developers and creators are essential to having products to trade in the first place. There's also a brief mention of Chinese market attention for a token launch.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What are some additions being worked on to expand the tokenomic beyond buyback & \"dao\"?

Users reported problems with token creation, where some tokens were created but liquidity pools weren't properly established, leaving users unable to sell tokens. The team acknowledged an indexing issue affecting early token migrations and worked to resolve it. The platform underwent database upgrades and feature additions, causing downtime that concerned users. A security incident occurred where Shaw's Twitter account was compromised, with the attacker creating a token called \"COO\" on Pump.fun. Team members warned users not to engage with this token. Throughout the downtime, team members provided updates but avoided giving specific ETAs, noting they were working around the clock to resolve issues and implement improvements.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Analysis of \"fun-support\" Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe Discord channel shows users experiencing issues with the Auto.fun platform, which appears to be a token creation and trading platform on Solana. The main technical issues revolve around token indexing problems for tokens created during or shortly after launch. Many users reported creating tokens that took their SOL but didn't properly create trading pools or appear on the platform. The development team, primarily represented by accelxr, has been manually fixing these issues by importing affected tokens. The platform underwent multiple maintenance periods to address these problems. Two distinct contract addresses were mentioned: the official one and a \"developer contract\" (autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5) that was apparently leaked before launch. Tokens created on the developer contract couldn't be recovered. Other issues included problems with the \"Claim Fees\" function, sorting filters not working correctly, and UI bugs. The platform has a bonding curve mechanism where tokens migrate to Raydium after reaching 85 SOL in the curve (approximately 60k market cap).\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why can't I see or trade my token after creation? (asked by multiple users) A: There was an indexing issue with tokens created early during launch. The team is working on fixing these tokens by manually importing them. (answered by accelxr)\nQ: What happens to tokens created using the leaked developer link? (asked by multiple users) A: These tokens cannot be recovered as they were created on a different contract than the official one. (answered by accelxr)\nQ: When does a token migrate from the bonding curve? (asked by Pyroman) A: When it reaches 85 SOL in the bonding curve, approximately 60k market cap. (answered by accelxr)\nQ: How does the \"Claim Fees\" function work? (asked by Xyness) A: Post-bonding, token creators can claim fees from the LP, receiving a combination of the created token and SOL. (answered by accelxr)\nQ: What is the fee split for token creators? (asked by Xyness) A: It's a 90/10 split for the token owner and the platform respectively. (answered by Borko)\nQ: Is there a way to add our website to our auto.fun page?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around auto.fun, a recently launched platform similar to pump.fun but with AI integration capabilities. The platform experienced several technical issues during launch, including indexing problems with early tokens that required manual migration. The site went into maintenance mode for upgrades after experiencing high traffic. Users reported specific bugs including claim fee button not working, Jupiter errors on price detection for percentage-based sells (25%, 50%, 75%), and issues with token liquidity. \n\nThe team is working on fixes before proceeding with marketing activities and launching partnerships. There are discussions about potential AI agent integration with tokens created on the platform, with suggestions about using token fees to power AI agents. Some users created tokens like $CRIME and $FUN on the platform and shared their experiences. There's also mention of Shaw's account being compromised at one point, leading to a suspicious token called \"COO\" being issued.\n\nThe chat also includes discussions about upcoming demos for agent projects, including Smolverse's Neurochimp which appears to integrate NFTs with memory functions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the current status of auto.fun? (asked by anon) A: The site is temporarily in maintenance mode while updates are being merged and the platform is being optimized before marketing begins. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: What were the main issues with auto.fun at launch? (asked by kalshnikov) A: Initial issues included backend overload and indexing problems where some tokens created early didn't get indexed and had to be manually migrated. (answered by accelxr)\nQ: Why is the Jupiter error happening on percentage-based sells? (asked by accelxr) A: It appears to be related to too many decimals in the calculations. (answered by accelxr)\nQ: What is the fee split for tokens on auto.fun? (inferred from Kenk's message) A: 90/10 split between the creator and platform, with the platform portion going to $ai16z buybacks. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Is Shaw's account compromised? (asked by siggy) A: Yes, the attacker used the breach to issue a token called \"COO\" on Pump.fun. (answered by eskender.eth)\nQ: When will auto.fun be back online? (asked by anon) A: After maintenance is complete and the platform is confirmed fully stable, followed by a large marketing push. (answered by accelxr)\nQ: What are the launch partners for auto.fun? (asked by litn) A: They are ready to deploy but waiting for platform polishing before starting marketing activity. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Why can't I use I and O in token suffixes? (asked by yikesawjeez) A: Because you can only use base58 encoding. (answered by accelxr)\n\n## 3.

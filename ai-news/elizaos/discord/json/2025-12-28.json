      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - \"core-devs\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nShaw shared a significant technical breakthrough: running cloud services on both Jeju and Babylon platforms. He conceptualizes this as a decentralized, on-chain alternative to Vercel. The system functions as a compute marketplace that automatically selects the most cost-effective and efficient compute resources based on user requirements. Key technical components include agents, inference capabilities, DNS and domain purchasing services, a distributed cache, and a SQLite database with Upstash and Neon compatibility. The blockchain element enables permissionless access and creates a marketplace abstraction over cloud providers. Shaw positions the value proposition as a 40% reduction in cloud bills for web2 developers, while also offering monetization opportunities through tokenization and network fees. Sayonara suggested examining POKT Network's poktroll GitHub repository for potential ideas to incorporate.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do you offer SLAs? How good are they? (asked by Odilitime) A: I do not, but providers can (answered by shaw)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: sayonara | Helpee: shaw | Context: Sharing relevant project for comparison/inspiration | Resolution: Provided GitHub link to poktroll repository for potential idea borrowing\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Explore integration possibilities with POKT Network's poktroll | Description: Evaluate if concepts from this project can be borrowed for the cloud marketplace | Mentioned By: sayonara\nTechnical: Implement provider SLA capabilities | Description: Enable cloud providers to offer service level agreements within the marketplace | Mentioned By: shaw",

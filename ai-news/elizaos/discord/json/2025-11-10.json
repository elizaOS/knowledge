      "summary": "# Analysis of 💬-discussion Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around the migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens. Community members are concerned about the migration process on various exchanges, particularly Gate.io, where withdrawals are paused but the swap hasn't completed yet. Team members like Kenk and Borko provide updates, confirming that Gate.io should complete the migration \"this week\" as they've received all necessary information. There are questions about the new tokenomics, with concerns about the increased supply (from 1B to 11B). Team members clarify that only 13% is initially added to circulation, with team tokens locked for one year and the rest reserved for community growth. Some community members express concern about the declining price despite the broader market uptrend, while others remain optimistic about the project's long-term potential, pointing to active GitHub development. Content creator Lopez is working on new videos about the migration process and seeking input from community members.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Any plan to burn some supply?

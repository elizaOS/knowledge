A user named \"mac\" inquired about the status of the Twitter plugin issue, which cjft acknowledged and provided a GitHub link to the plugin repository. The plugin requires a $200 subscription to run the current version, and cjft mentioned they would update the documentation. Later, cjft announced a complete overhaul of the plugin with version 1.0.14 and a new README.\n\nThere were also mentions of an \"alexa-plugin\" being developed soon, and discussions about a project called \"the Org\" that appears to be nearing completion. Some users discussed a copy trading strategy being developed for DegenAI. Additionally, there was a GitHub leaderboard issue where a user's wallet wasn't being approved despite following the instructions.\n\nThe chat contained numerous cryptocurrency-related messages and references to \"ELI5,\" which appears to be an upcoming AI agent or project within the ecosystem.\n\n## 2.

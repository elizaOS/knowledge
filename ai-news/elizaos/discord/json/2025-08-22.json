Jin mentioned working on prediction markets combined with content creation, seeking name ideas for a potential show. There was discussion about ERC-8004, a standard that adds a trust layer for agent interactions across organizations, focusing on identity, reputation, and task validation. The elizaOS Accelerator Demo Day was announced and took place during the chat period. A user named Bond11 mentioned building \"Hivemind,\" an AI-powered crypto marketing strategist. Community members shared resources including Eliza.how, docs.eliza.ai, and autodotfun for those interested in building with Eliza.

First, a user reported that the weather plugin in an example doesn't work properly with ElizaOS version 1.4.3 - the plugin triggers providers and validate functions but doesn't return handler text, defaulting to ChatGPT instead. Second, a user encountered a permission error (EPERM) when trying to create an agent in WSL using Bun v1.2.20, specifically during database selection for an ElizaOS project. Third, a user mentioned having issues similar to another user (likely related to API limits or permissions) and shared their workaround of creating a new app with fresh keys while ensuring limits are respected. The chat also mentioned an ElizaOS demo day featuring agent teams presenting their projects.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why doesn't the weather plugin in the example work?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: core-devs\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe core-devs channel discussion focused primarily on build system optimization and technical improvements. cjft led a significant refactoring effort to improve build times, replacing tsup (which was noted as abandoned) with bun.Build. This migration resulted in approximately 55% faster builds (from 26s to 14s on an M3 Max) while improving TypeScript coverage. The PR (#5807) was completed and ready for review.\n\nOther technical topics included:\n- Removal of unused components (/docs submodule, autodoc package, /config, /app)\n- Discussion about the Tauri app build process and its priority\n- Identification of DTS generation as a performance bottleneck\n- Fixing of bun stalls and TypeScript issues\n- A potential security issue with elizalabs.ai domain lacking SPF setup\n- Updates from sam-developer on Eliza cloud, including text generation support, analytics dashboard refinements, and ongoing work on plugin services\n- Discussion about browser automation capabilities through plugins\n\nThe conversation demonstrated a focus on technical debt reduction, build optimization, and infrastructure improvements.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Analysis of ElizaOS Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the migration from AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS tokens. A snapshot was taken on November 11th at 11:40 UTC, and only tokens held in non-exchange wallets before this time are eligible for automatic migration through the official portal. Users who held tokens on exchanges or in liquidity pools at snapshot time face challenges with migration and must submit support tickets for manual review. Korean users express frustration about lack of communication regarding the snapshot, as Korean exchanges like Bithumb did not provide adequate notice. Community members, particularly TobyMoonWalker, actively help users understand the migration process and troubleshoot issues. The migration process involves sending AI16Z tokens to a designated wallet and receiving ElizaOS tokens within 24 hours. Some users report successful migrations while others struggle with technical issues or eligibility concerns. The team has reportedly been in contact with exchanges but cannot control their migration support decisions, especially in regulated markets like Korea.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe conversation revolves around implementing a rock-paper-scissors game for an Eliza agent system. Chucknorris initially inquires about technical implementation options, suggesting either an HSM vault or a zk-SNARK smart contract approach. They later clarify that a full zk-SNARK implementation would be excessive for this use case, recommending instead a commit-reveal scheme with an HSM/MPC vault for verification, which would be more cost-effective (3-5k vs. 12k for a custom smart contract). DorianD suggests using a mobile-friendly web interface with wallet connect on Base or BNB chain and shares a GitHub repository (arbirps) that appears to have already implemented similar functionality. DorianD also raises concerns about legal issues, suggesting the game should be fully on-chain with a \"black holed\" smart contract that can take cuts from human winners while subsidizing agent transaction costs. The discussion touches on token economics where ElizaOS tokens would accumulate in the contract to compensate agents for gas fees.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Via an hsm vault or smartcontract zk? (asked by Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT) A: A proper commit-reveal scheme with HSM/MPC vault is sufficient and more cost-effective than heavy zk-SNARKs (answered by Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)\nQ: And on what platform? A website? Telegram? (asked by Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT) A: Mobile friendly web with wallet connect (answered by DorianD)\nQ: And on which blockchain for the commit zk hash? (asked by Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT) A: Base or BNB chain, with BNB potentially better due to free coins (answered by DorianD)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT | Helpee: DorianD | Context: Implementation approach for a fair rock-paper-scissors game | Resolution: Explained that a commit-reveal scheme with HSM/MPC vault would be sufficient and more cost-effective than zk-SNARKs\nHelper: DorianD | Helpee: Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT | Context: Looking for existing implementations | Resolution: Shared GitHub repository (arbirps) that already implemented similar functionality\n\n## 4.

Instead, the conversation revolves around market dynamics and token economics. Participants discuss how projects are currently focused on \"revenue washing\" or \"stablecoin washing\" to appear more valuable. They specifically mention that ElizaOS lacks revenue generation, which puts it at a disadvantage in the current market environment where revenue metrics are increasingly important for market capitalization. There's criticism of marketing coordination for ElizaOS, particularly regarding a missed opportunity with a Binance airdrop. The conversation also touches on how other L1/L2 platforms are using their treasuries to generate stablecoin yield to boost their TVL (Total Value Locked) metrics. No technical implementations or solutions are discussed in this segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do people still have tokens to dump?

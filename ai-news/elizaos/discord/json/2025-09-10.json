The primary technical mention is from avirtualfuture about working on \"enhanced knowledge systems\" for Eliza, seeking input on data sources and question types. Several users posted their professional profiles as blockchain developers with various skills in Solidity, Rust, TypeScript, and other technologies. There was an announcement about an upcoming X Spaces event featuring Xmaquina, NEAR, and Eliza Labs. Carlos Rene from DEGA invited developers to participate in an $8000 prize hackathon focused on AI for DAO Treasury Management, mentioning workshops with ElizaOS for agents and automations. The chat also included several Twitter/X posts being shared via a bot, some memes, and casual conversation, but lacked substantive technical problem-solving or implementation discussions.\n\n## 2.

A user reported an issue with ElizaOS version 1.5.5 related to MessageBusService being unable to map room/world to central IDs, with a suggestion to upgrade to version 1.5.7. There was also an announcement about ElizaOS v1.5.8 being released. Additionally, there was information about a provider change for the nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2 model, which is moving to nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2:free with DeepInfra becoming a paid provider. The chat also included an invitation to participate in an AI hackathon for DAO Treasury Management with ElizaOS integration, and a brief mention of creating a plugin for internal testing.\n\n## 2.

The main substantive exchange involves DorianD suggesting that the Eliza Foundation should implement a structured proposal system similar to Ethereum's EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) and ERCs (Ethereum Request for Comments). DorianD explains that such a system would help standardize development efforts and involve the community in a more organized way. They reference how ERC-20 emerged as a standardization solution when different groups were developing various token implementations, which helped wallet developers by providing consistent interfaces. Odilitime acknowledges this suggestion, referring to it as \"eliza-improvement-proposals.\" The chat also includes a link to a Verge article about Microsoft's Windows 11 cloud strategy and a request from pragmatiko for members to post content they want amplified in the channel.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Would it be beneficial to have something similar to EIPs and ERCs for the Eliza Foundation? (asked by DorianD) A: Yes, it would help involve people in a more structured way and standardize development efforts (answered by DorianD)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: DorianD | Context: Clarifying what DorianD meant by EIP-like proposals for Eliza | Resolution: Odilitime understood the suggestion as \"eliza-improvement-proposals\" which DorianD confirmed\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: \"core-devs\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe core-devs team discussed several technical implementations and ongoing development work. Agent Joshua demonstrated using dstack SDK to generate accounts without storing private keys, now running a dev server in a Confidential Virtual Machine (CVM) to test in a production TEE environment. The team identified issues with message bus functionality in version 1.5.5 and worked toward releasing version 1.5.8. They planned to restructure the codebase by removing Sentry from core and adding it to the server package instead, cleaning up server/channel/world/room abstractions to reduce redundancy, and preparing for new features like pglite WASM browser DB and ElizaOS/react hooks. There were discussions about environment variable handling, with some users experiencing issues with quoted string values. The team successfully deployed version 1.5.8 after testing and verification.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can anyone use it knowing your user id? (asked by R0am | tip.md) A: This is just a demo to show how to generate accounts without storing private keys. Not good for production but for teaching what's possible with dstack SDK.

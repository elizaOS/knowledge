BOSSU, an AI agent, responds to most messages with friendly, casual replies. A few users mentioned developing on ElizaOS, including:\n\n- IvanB encountered errors with the node plugin showing \"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'actions')\" and received advice to check the coders channel or GitHub repo.\n- Kirsten warned about Telegram's updated terms of service affecting Eliza agents by restricting \"third-party blockchains\" aside from TON, with enforcement starting February 21.\n- ShadowBeast introduced ElizaTown, an open-source platform for exploring and sharing ElizaOS characters.\n- Some users mentioned building AI agents on ElizaOS, including a market making agent named Kaira, and GOAT ARENA for AI trading agents.\n- Dreygo discussed a \"Ninja Terminal\" feature that shows limit orders from Jupiter, allowing users to see support/resistance levels and potentially assist with market making.\n- TroyMurs mentioned adding ElizaOS to dappslap.fun and thanked the team for merging the Mistral feature to serve fine-tuned models.\n\nThe chat contains minimal substantive technical discussion, with most users either introducing themselves or asking basic questions about the platform.\n\n## 2.

A significant conversation involved unreadyplayer from Cybers presenting their tokenization platform with a customized bonding curve AMM that could integrate with ai16z. Their proposal includes agent token launches with ai16z as the token pair, permanent LP locking, fee distribution (50% to ai16z treasury, 50% to Cybers for buying ai16z), and creator incentives. \n\nDorianD proposed an enterprise support model where the DAO could pay people and AIs for providing support to Fortune 500 companies using ElizaOS. He also suggested a three-tier certification program for ElizaOS: Certified ElizaOS Operator (for non-developers), ElizaOS Developer (for plugin creators), and Eliza Developer Pro (for contributors to the main repository).\n\nJin highlighted the need to onboard more Eliza developers through better documentation, AI-assisted training, and educational partnerships. ElonMoney shared thoughts about an AI copilot similar to Kaito that could summarize discussions and provide structured information about tokenomics.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does the Cybers tokenization platform work with ai16z? (asked by DorianD) A: It uses ai16z as the base token, with 50% of fees going to ai16z treasury and 50% to Cybers which they'll use to buy ai16z (answered by unreadyplayer)\nQ: What percentage of the token is locked in the LP against the SOL received in the bonding process? (asked by DorianD) A: Currently 22.5% goes to locked LP and 77.5% is traded on the bonding curve, but this would change based on bonding thresholds for the ai16z platform (answered by unreadyplayer)\nQ: How do Cybers profit from their platform? (asked by DorianD) A: They'll use their 50% of fees to cover operational costs and buy ai16z, which when it appreciates will bolster their treasury (answered by unreadyplayer)\nQ: Will the Cybers platform support mobile and dark theme?

The team is working on scene setup, character models, and event handling for these interactive 3D environments. For the news show, they're dealing with issues in the daily summary JSON data showing incorrect dates. The Block Tank project involves setting up a new scene with proper lighting, fixing reversed normals on models using custom shaders, and implementing character animations. There are discussions about media loading approaches, with boom suggesting downloading assets directly to textures rather than using a web browser. Character models are being refined with proper visemes (mouth shapes for speech) and rigging for animations. The team is also working on an event system to handle different actions like scene preparation and character speech. Technical challenges include fixing reversed normals on models, implementing proper lighting, and handling JSON polling that causes delays in event responses. The developers are considering the pros and cons of using Unity versus other platforms like Unreal or Blender for their video production needs.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are the normals reversed on the Block Tank models? (asked by boom) A: Yes, SM Sith Lord suggested scaling the model by -1, but boom ended up using a custom shader to fix it.\nQ: Is the date in the daily summary JSON correct? (asked by boom) A: No, SM Sith Lord confirmed it shows the wrong date and possibly contains old information.\nQ: Do we need a web browser to load images? (asked by boom) A: No, SM Sith Lord confirmed they're just image URLs that can be loaded directly.\nQ: Has the Unity project for Block Tank been started? (asked by jin) A: boom explained they have one main scene but not a separate project yet.\nQ: Do any of the avatars in the repo have visemes?

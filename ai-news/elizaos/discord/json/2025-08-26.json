The main technical update is from 0xbbjoker, who mentioned that \"multi step\" functionality would be ready by the end of the week. OpenRouter announced the launch of Gemini 2.5 Image Preview, their first image generation model, highlighting its capabilities for image generation and editing, character consistency, and ability to generate multiple images in one generation. The model has a 32k context length and costs $0.3/m input tokens. Later, they announced a free variant for users to try. A user named bobo bixby asked about best practices for creating agents across multiple platforms in version 1.4.4, specifically whether creating separate agents that share a database is recommended, as the interface seems to suggest using only one template at a time. There was also a mention of an upcoming \"getting started\" session focused on creating and publishing plugins.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there any timelines for the release of this feature? (asked by maikyman) A: by the end of week we'll have multi step ready (answered by 0xbbjoker)\nQ: is the current best practice to create an agent for each platform and have them function as a swarm by sharing the same db?

There's brief mention of a potential AI-powered DeFi savings account concept from pangolink, who suggests monitoring stablecoin positions with an aesthetic frontend. DorianD discusses security concerns for agent-based financial systems, highlighting the need for encrypted/signed communication channels and multisig approval mechanisms to prevent unauthorized fund transfers. He specifically mentions the possibility of using a phone app with squads multisig for transaction approval, along with a market maker smart contract that could execute orders even with delayed approvals. The chat also references NVIDIA's upcoming Q2 results with expected revenue of $46B, mostly from data center compute demand for AI. Other discussions include mentions of Dao.fun, ElizaOs (AI16Z), and a user named Skely who previously ran a team before working on a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) experiment.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: \"core-devs\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion focused on several key technical areas: browser compatibility for Eliza, agent architecture improvements, and integration with various platforms. The team debated making the core runtime browser-compatible without polyfills, using universal libraries that work across Node.js, Deno, and browsers. They discussed implementing PGLite via WebAssembly for in-memory database functionality. A significant development was the \"SWE-agent\" (Software Engineering agent) implementation, which could replace Claude-based autocoders with a more integrated sub-agent architecture. The team also explored MCP (Message Communication Protocol) as a standard for remote plugins, potentially replacing the current plugin system. Jin reported successfully implementing x402 with Solana USDC payments, one of the first implementations besides the developers. Shaw shared insights about solving the ARC AGI challenge using transformer models with slot attention rather than LLMs, arguing that spatial intelligence tasks require different approaches than sequence-based problems.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How can Eliza be made browser-compatible? (asked by sayonara) A: By targeting pure JS without polyfills, using universal libraries compatible with all runtimes, and implementing PGLite via WebAssembly for in-memory database functionality (answered by cjft)\nQ: What is the plan for improving the core architecture? (asked by sayonara) A: Browser core, new ElizaOS class, removing client polyfills, and making it work on Cloudflare and Vercel serverless (answered by cjft)\nQ: Should we replace plugins with MCP? (asked by sayonara) A: We should support MCP as a type of core plugin instead of \"pluginizing\" MCPs, adding vanilla plugin, MCP, and tool options to Eliza core (answered by cjft)\nQ: Why is browser compatibility important? (asked by sayonara) A: It allows enterprise developers to import and create agent functionality in web apps, scales to hundreds of thousands of users running agents in their client, and is 300% faster and cheaper (answered by cjft)\nQ: How did Jin implement x402 with Solana USDC payments? (asked by sayonara) A: Using x402-rs which added Solana support 3 days ago (answered by jin)\nQ: Why won't LLMs work well for the ARC AGI challenge? (asked by sayonara) A: LLMs are good at sequences but bad at spatial tasks; the challenge requires understanding transformation rules with few examples, which is better solved with transformer models with slot attention (answered by shaw)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: cjft | Helpee: sayonara | Context: Needed guidance on browser compatibility approach | Resolution: Explained the need for universal libraries instead of polyfills, targeting pure JS that works across platforms\nHelper: shaw | Helpee: sayonara | Context: Understanding ARC AGI challenge solution | Resolution: Explained his approach using transformer models with slot attention and linear transformations instead of LLMs\nHelper: jin | Helpee: R0am | tip.md | Context: Implementing x402 with Solana USDC | Resolution: Shared that x402-rs added Solana support recently, allowing for USDC on Solana for website/data/API monetization\nHelper: cjft | Helpee: team | Context: Build performance issues | Resolution: Merged bun build improvements, reducing build time from 36s to 28s and fixing type issues\n\n## 4.

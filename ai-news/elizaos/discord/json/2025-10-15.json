Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about blockchain technology, professional value in society, and the future of various professions in the face of AI advancement. There was a brief mention of a migration (likely token-related) with clarification that it's separate from options trading. A GitHub repository for an Instagram plugin for Eliza was shared. There was discussion about Peter Thiel's 1990s prediction regarding currencies representing real value like the S&P500. A significant debate occurred between users DorianD and The Light about the relative value of tradespeople versus lawyers, with The Light arguing tradespeople are more foundational to society while DorianD maintained that specialized professions requiring higher education deserve their status. The conversation also touched on how AI might replace certain professions, particularly legal work. There was minimal technical problem-solving in this segment, with most exchanges being opinion-based discussions rather than technical implementations.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Hello do you know what's gonna happen with open long positions during that migration? (asked by Dawid) A: The migration and options trading are separate things, unconnected entirely. Up to the options trader to figure that out. If you're on a CEX, contact your CEX for clarity. (answered by The Light)\nQ: Is there anyone looking for AI agent dev? (asked by Top) A: Unanswered\nQ: Does eliza support instagram? (asked by Konstantine) A: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-instagram (answered by The Light)\nQ: Could you please elaborate on 15% SAFT in new tokenomics? To whom and with what price SAFT tokens are going to be sold? Can community participate on this deal? (asked by gen11g) A: Nope it's closed (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Any guide on the whole migration thing? I am not using any CEX.. just have all in my Solana wallet. What do I need to do? (asked by CheddarQueso ðŸ§€) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

A user named \"ole\" was attempting to execute Ethereum transactions using the @elizaos/plugin-evm but encountered difficulties with transaction execution despite having a Multi-Call Procedure (MCP) server to prepare transaction data. The user reported that while sending tokens worked, other operations like checking balances or executing approval transactions failed silently. Another user (0xbbjoker) suggested using multi-step execution and examining the bootstrap code. Other topics included questions about x402 embedding in Eliza plugins and Instagram support. A user named TH3H4RM1N4T0R mentioned issues with Docker image building for Eliza, specifically regarding environment variables and volume mounting, but later reported resolving the issue without sharing details.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does x402 work when embedded in eliza plugins? (asked by realist) A: It should work, depending on how it is embedded. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Does eliza support instagram? (asked by Konstantine) A: We do not have an Instagram plugin as far as I am aware. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Why prepare transactions with MCP? (asked by 0xbbjoker) A: I built an MCP that interacts with a protocol to prepare transactions for opening vaults with collateral and borrowing assets. (answered by ole)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: 0xbbjoker | Helpee: ole | Context: Executing Ethereum transactions with Eliza and plugin-evm | Resolution: Suggested using multi-step execution and examining bootstrap code, but issue remained unresolved\nHelper: Kenk | Helpee: realist | Context: Question about x402 working when embedded in Eliza plugins | Resolution: Provided conditional confirmation that it should work depending on implementation\nHelper: Kenk | Helpee: Konstantine | Context: Question about Instagram support in Eliza | Resolution: Clarified that no Instagram plugin exists as far as they know\n\n## 4.

Shaw proposes a system where games create predictable but uncertain outcomes stored in provable ZK containers, allowing prediction markets to resolve frequently (every 30 minutes or hour) without regulatory issues. The key innovation is positioning the game as merely an oracle that posts results on-chain, while allowing third parties to build betting infrastructure around it.\n\nDorianD provides context on regulatory challenges facing prediction markets, noting that Polymarket was fined by the CFTC for operating as an unregistered derivatives platform. He suggests that decentralizing the orderbook at the protocol level (similar to Hyperliquid) might avoid regulatory scrutiny, as the issue appears to be centralized orderbooks rather than the oracle itself.\n\nShaw elaborates that the system would include different game types (perps, spot games for trading bots, prediction markets for LLM bots, MMO games for agents), all fully on-chain with TEE attestation. The games would be registered using ERC-8004, with both humans and AI agents competing. Shaw suggests an uncapped ERC-20 \"gold token\" with no protocol-provided liquidity as the currency, with potential airdrops to Eliza holders.\n\nOdilitime proposes using encrypted on-chain answers with delayed key release to prove results weren't tampered with, addressing trust concerns in betting markets.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What if the game is a prediction market oracle? (asked by shaw) A: Shaw explains it would create predictable but uncertain outcomes in a provable ZK container, resolving every 30 minutes.\nQ: What will the currency be? (asked by DannyNOR NoFapArc) A: Shaw suggests an uncapped supply ERC-20 \"gold token\" with no protocol-provided liquidity and a fee on transfers.\nQ: Any update on recall airdrop? (asked by DannyNOR NoFapArc) A: Kenk explains recently collected addresses were for another airdrop, with recall going to only a few people.\nQ: How does one earn money playing these games if there will be a token with unlimited supply and no liquidity? (asked by DorianD) A: Shaw clarifies the game is just an oracle for prediction markets that resolve hourly.\n\n## 3.

Summary:\nThe conversation primarily revolves around ideas for improving AI agent interactions through digital twin implementation. Odilitime proposed tracking user information from chats in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and creating an evaluator that maintains a \"character file\" or digital twin of users. This would enable more efficient context management by focusing only on relationship-relevant information rather than loading complete character data for both participants. The approach would involve precompiling relationship data between characters and updating it as the digital twin evolves, potentially as a background process outside the chat pathway. Odilitime also discovered that Chain of Thought (CoT) is disabled in plugin-anthropic, making the Anthropic model in elizaOS potentially \"smarter and more expensive.\" There was also a brief mention of an upcoming collaboration on \"brand stuff\" between shaw and whobody.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What does CoT mean? (asked by Stan âš¡) A: Chain of Thought (answered by Stan âš¡)\nQ: What do you mean by \"contrasting the agent with the twin\"? (asked by 0xbbjoker) A: Instead of injecting both sets of character data, precompile the relationship information between them to determine what's needed (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: 0xbbjoker | Context: Clarification on digital twin implementation and relationship modeling | Resolution: Odilitime explained how relationship data could be precompiled and updated in the background when the twin evolves\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: Team | Context: Discovering CoT is disabled in plugin-anthropic | Resolution: Shared finding that elizaOS can be \"smarter and more expensive\" with Anthropic due to this setting\n\n## 4.

The conversation consists of three brief messages over approximately 9 hours. Broccolex shared a link to a DefiLlama tweet/post without additional context. DorianD provided market analysis commentary, suggesting the crypto market is entering the final phase of a bear market with an estimated 6 months until bottom, followed by 6-12 months of sideways movement, with potential recovery activity beginning in 2027. 𝔭𝔩𝔞𝔱𝔞 𝔑𝔬 𝔉𝔞𝔭 𝔞𝔯𝔠 made a single-word acknowledgment.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel discussion covered several technical topics, primarily focused on AI routing systems and action callback patterns in Eliza framework.\n\n**DorianD** initiated a discussion about AI model routing frameworks, identifying existing solutions like RouteLLM (Python-based for prompt complexity analysis), Latitude.so (prompt engineering platform), and MasRouter (multi-agent system management). They proposed creating an \"ElizaRouter\" with a distributed routing mechanism where receiving nodes select optimal nodes with time decay for Quality of Service. Small open-source models were evaluated for routing purposes, including Microsoft Phi-4 Mini (3.8B-14B), Qwen2.5/Qwen3 (1.5B-7B), Mistral 7B, and DeepSeek-Coder for code-specific tasks.\n\n**Victor Creed** reported a critical bug in Eliza 1.7.2 regarding action callback execution order. The documented callback pattern should send messages sequentially: (1) initial feedback, (2) structured return text, (3) detailed callback message. However, the actual behavior reverses the order, sending the detailed callback first, then initial feedback, and omitting the structured return message entirely. This issue affects custom plugins using `plugin-sql`, `plugin-openai`, and `plugin-bootstrap`. The problem remains unresolved as no community members provided solutions.\n\n**Supreem** shared an interview about agentic coding systems. **DorianD** later proposed an unconventional idea about collecting training data for robotics through viral social media challenges similar to TikTok dance trends, focusing on household tasks like sweeping, mopping, and ironing.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What existing frameworks are available for AI model routing based on prompt complexity? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered (self-documented: RouteLLM for Python-based routing, Latitude.so for prompt engineering, MasRouter for multi-agent systems)\n\nQ: What small open-source models are best for routing decisions? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered (self-documented: Microsoft Phi-4 Mini, Qwen2.5/Qwen3, Mistral 7B, DeepSeek-Coder)\n\nQ: Why are action callbacks in Eliza 1.7.2 executing in reverse order compared to documentation?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on implementing social media connection functionality with user redirection flows. Sam announced plans to work on the \"ahead direction\" feature, building a connection page where users can link their social accounts before being redirected back to the bot, following Shaw's previous suggestion.\n\nThe team explored using Composio, an open-source tool for handling authentication and social integrations. Sam identified Composio as a potentially valuable solution, specifically highlighting its in-chat authentication capabilities that align with their current development needs. Stan revealed he had already created a Composio plugin months earlier and offered to share it with the team for reference. Stan also mentioned he's drafting an RFC (Request for Comments) document with related ideas that he plans to share. Kenk shared a resource about Hightouch's long-running agent harness implementation, though this wasn't discussed further in the segment.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on two main technical issues and significant token-related concerns. \n\n**Technical Issues:**\nDigitalDiva encountered a plugin installation error with @elizaos/plugin-web-search, receiving a \"Cannot find module\" error after attempting installation. Odilitime suggested editing the project's package.json to include proper module resolution and directed them to use bun for installation and the appropriate support channel for further assistance.\n\nSarthak faced a token migration issue with ElizaOS tokens on ETH chain showing 98% loss when attempting to swap back to ETH or USDT due to zero liquidity. Kenk attempted to clarify whether this was a slippage or migration question, and MDMnvest directed them to the migration channel.\n\n**Token Economics Discussion:**\nA significant portion of the chat involved critical questions about token utility and team allocation. Key concerns raised by averma, gby, and Jayzen included: the 40% token allocation to the team after a 1:10 token increase (where community received only 6 while team got 40%), lack of clear use cases for the token, airdrops depleting community liquidity, and the token hitting all-time lows. \n\nOdilitime defended the project stating the migration from ai16z to elizaos was necessary for rebranding and multichain accessibility. He clarified that the token's primary utility includes being the accepted currency in their products, gas fees for Jeju, and buy-back mechanisms from credit card rail revenue. However, community members expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of concrete utility beyond Jeju gas fees.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How to bridge & migrate ElizaOS tokens from ETH chain when liquidity went zero? (asked by Sarthak) A: Check the migration channel for instructions (answered by MDMnvest)\n\nQ: Is your question regarding swaps on eth facing slippage or is it a migration question? (asked by Kenk) A: It's about 98% loss when converting ElizaOS tokens back to ETH or USDT (answered by Sarthak)\n\nQ: How to fix \"Cannot find module '@elizaos/plugin-web-search'\" error after plugin installation? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: Edit the project's package.json to include proper module resolution, try installing with bun (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Are the wallets holding 40% of the supply known and do they have a vesting schedule? (asked by Jayzen) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Why did team get 40% when it is open source after the 1:10 token increase? (asked by averma) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Why should anyone buy elizaos token? (asked by gby) A: Token is the currency accepted in products including gas for Jeju, with credit card revenue going into buy backs (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Why did hyperscape and babylon get their own tokens instead of using elizaos token? (asked by g) A: They're on-chain tokens for the currency in those games (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What is the actual use case for the token beyond Jeju gas fees? (asked by gby) A: Currency accepted in products, gas for Jeju, and buy-back mechanisms from credit card rails (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Why was the migration from ai16z to elizaos necessary? (asked by gby) A: Had to rebrand the token and wanted to go multichain for easier access (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

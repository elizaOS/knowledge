There was one request about downloading/cloning the Eliza OS repository, which was redirected to #coders channel and eliza.how website. Several users inquired about suspended Twitter/X accounts for ElizaOS and related profiles. A deep dive session on deploying agents with comput3 was announced but no technical details were shared in this transcript. There was a brief mention of creating AI agents on X, but no concrete technical solutions were provided. The chat mostly consisted of greetings, GIFs, and brief non-technical exchanges.\n\n## 2.

Discussions included questions about the current version (1.3.1), plugin functionality issues, and implementation possibilities. A user reported problems with the Twitter plugin (version 1.2.17) when using the TWITTER_TARGET_USERS variable, causing the bot to comment on original posts without LLM processing. There were also inquiries about implementing Graph RAG into Eliza and the availability of the plugin-dkg repository. Additionally, OpenRouter announced \"Horizon Alpha,\" a new model with 256k context that logs prompts and completions for training purposes. A user asked about accessing services through the runtime by filtering entries. The conversation concluded with a brief mention of Spartan as an ElizaOS implementation in production and a reference to clanktank.tv.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What is latest version of ElizaOS?

The conversation primarily revolves around addressing FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) regarding elizaOS's social media presence, particularly their temporary absence from X (Twitter) and use of Farcaster. A team representative named \"ben\" clarified that X will return and that using alternative platforms like Farcaster, LinkedIn, and upcoming channels is a temporary communication strategy. There was a brief mention of a technical issue regarding a missing search bar in the autodotfun iOS app. The chat also included discussion about cryptocurrency projects mentioned in a White House policy report, with some confusion about whether \"AI16Z\" was referenced (it was actually \"A16Z\" or Andreessen Horowitz).\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's with the FUD in the auto.fun discord about Shaw not wanting the X accounts back? (asked by HodlHusky) A: It's not true, the forecaster said he is waiting for the X account back. (answered by Quaser M)\nQ: Why do you assume that Autofun will capitalize on the launchpad wars/migration? (asked by Quest) A: Because why wouldn't they? They are just getting started. Wait and see.

(asked by MDMnvest) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is that ai16z I see down there [in the White House crypto policy report]? (asked by traderlv) A: Unfortunately not. The report mentions A16Z which is what AI16Z (the name) is a parody of. (answered by Boj/acc)\nQ: There's another company called Ai16z? Why? What does Ai16z even mean?

The primary focus is on Eliza's social media presence, particularly the absence of their X (Twitter) account and their current use of Farcaster and LinkedIn for communications. Ben clarifies that X will return eventually, but in the meantime, they're using alternative channels to share updates and community wins. There's also a brief mention of a plugin built on Eliza, referenced through a tweet from \"onbonsai,\" though no technical details are provided.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: core-devs\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical challenges and improvements for the Eliza platform. Key topics included:\n\nPlugin namespacing issues, with consensus that plugins should use a structured namespace format (plugins/<namespace>) rather than a flat structure. UUID generation for agents was identified as a potential problem, as the current implementation creates deterministic UUIDs based on agent names, which could cause conflicts if two users create agents with identical names.\n\nSeveral solutions were proposed for the UUID issue: making names unique across the platform, adding an optional \"agentName\" field for user-facing purposes while keeping the internal name field for UUID generation, or using random UUIDs for cloud deployments while maintaining deterministic UUIDs for local instances.\n\nThe team discussed API improvements, with cjft noting the current API has poor developer experience, requiring channel management and polling. A simpler POST message API was suggested that would use default channels and hang HTTP responses while waiting for bootstrap events.\n\nWork on cloud functionality is progressing, with sam-developer sharing progress on the Eliza Cloud API. Shaw mentioned working on plugin search functionality that will be available as a rate-limited endpoint. There was also discussion about dynamic plugin calling based on context, which could improve plugin discoverability.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why generate UUID as hash of name instead of random? (asked by cjft) A: For local character runs, deterministic generation is useful, but for cloud deployments, random UUIDs would be better (answered by shaw)\nQ: What would developers need to know to create effective AI agents? (asked by Kenk) A: Unanswered\nQ: What docker was nedos referring to? (asked by sayonara) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is this the same Optimism as Optimism network? (asked by jin) A: Agent Joshua explained Phala's evolution from Polkadot parachains to OP-Succinct L2 (answered by Agent Joshua â‚± | TEE)\nQ: How did project plugins get injected before character plugins? (asked by Odilitime) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

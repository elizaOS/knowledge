      "summary": "# Analysis of 💬-discussion Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around the upcoming migration of AI16Z to ElizaOS. Starting November 7th, users will have 90 days to migrate their tokens through a portal that will be announced in the official channels. The migration involves a supply increase from 6.6 billion to 11 billion tokens (+40%), with circulating supply immediately increasing from 6.6 billion to 7.4 billion (13% increase). The tokenomics breakdown allocates 75% to the community (with 60% swapped from original AI16Z holders), 15% to SAFT, and 10% to team and contributors. Users with tokens on exchanges are advised that while exchanges have been notified, they may need to migrate manually if exchanges don't support automatic migration. The team clarified that DegenAI is not migrating as it has its own development team.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do we need to do anything for migration? Or just hold spot and it will automatically migrate?

The most substantive technical content comes from Rabbidfly, who asks about best practices for suppressing Bootstrap on custom slash commands in ElizaOS. They describe their current implementation using a patch-based approach to prevent the LLM from responding to specific commands (/f, /fl, /fc) that should only perform data lookups. The implementation involves patching the Telegram plugin to check for a custom flag and setting this flag in a MESSAGE_RECEIVED handler. There's also discussion about cryptocurrency tokens, specifically Rare Pepes and Fake Rares on the counterparty platform, with DorianD mentioning creating assets like PEPEPIZZA and discussing potential subassets. The chat includes some off-topic conversation and a report about a potential scammer who was subsequently banned.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Best practice for suppressing Bootstrap on custom slash commands?

The team is working on an x402 gateway that integrates with DegenAI and considering a Farcaster mini-app for analysis services with a freemium model. A significant focus is on the upcoming Eliza cloud release planned for demonstration at Devconnect. The team has been waiting for a Binance announcement to set their migration date, which was delayed due to paperwork. Shaw mentioned ongoing research and prototyping for on-chain integration of the cloud and collaboration with Ethereum Foundation around ERC-8004. There's also discussion about using x402.elizaos.ai as a central hub for APIs rather than listing partner agents. An otaku Farcaster miniapp is in development, dependent on Coinbase integration, expected to launch the following week.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Are we doing anything with $degenai on the rebrand?

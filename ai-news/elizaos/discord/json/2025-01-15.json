Technical conversations revolve around agent development, deployment, and integration. Users discuss installing and configuring ElizaOS agents, connecting them to platforms like Twitter, and troubleshooting common errors. There are questions about running agents locally versus on cloud services, with AWS and DigitalOcean mentioned as hosting options. Several developers share their projects built with ElizaOS, including trading bots, social media agents, and specialized AI tools. The community appears to be actively building and extending the framework with plugins, including a Chainbase plugin for blockchain data querying and a multimodal generation SDK for music. Technical issues discussed include installation problems with Discord's opus package, character file formatting in JSON generation tools, and deployment challenges on platforms like Render. The community also discusses security considerations for agent wallets and local versus cloud deployment options.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do you need a good PC to run more complex AI agents? (asked by j.)

Shaw shared a document outlining a partnership approach emphasizing value accrual, suggesting projects that donated 10% to the treasury could be rewarded as they buy-and-send-to-DAO AI16Z tokens, creating steady buy pressure without dumping. The community debated how to structure these partnerships, with st4rgard3n highlighting that distribution and attention are the primary values AI16Z offers to partners. Several members discussed the need for a clear standard operating procedure for potential partners.\n\nTechnical discussions included market-making strategies for token launches, with yikesawjeez sharing detailed information about Principal Market Makers (PMMs) and Designated Market Makers (DMMs), suggesting that providing liquidity in exchange for call options could be mutually beneficial if implemented on-chain. There were concerns about keeping tokenomics discussions private to prevent competitors from copying ideas before implementation. Members emphasized the need for advanced game theory and mathematical approaches to tokenomics, with suggestions to involve PhD-level experts.\n\nThe community also discussed the challenges partners face when donating 10% of tokens, including difficulties raising capital and securing market-making deals, which presents an opportunity for AI16Z to facilitate these processes for partners.\n\n## 2.

Summary:\nThe discussion primarily revolves around tokenomics, revenue sharing models, and ecosystem development for the ai16z project. Shaw expresses dissatisfaction with the current tokenomics model that relies heavily on a launchpad approach, arguing that \"there are 20 launchpads using eliza already\" and that a more sustainable model is needed. He advocates for revenue sharing mechanisms that create buy pressure for the token. There's significant discussion about how to align incentives between the DAO and projects building on the ElizaOS framework, with proposals for projects to contribute a percentage of their revenue to buy ai16z tokens. The team is also working on rebranding efforts, with discussions about changing the ticker symbol and server name. DegenAI development is mentioned, with Shaw noting that he had to replace the team with \"aligned PM and devs who are on full time payroll.\" The partners also discuss the relationship between ai16z and DegenAI tokens, debating how benefits should be distributed between holders of each. Technical updates include the release of an ElizaOS whitepaper, integration with robots, and various partnerships with projects like Story Protocol and Polygon.\n\n## 2.

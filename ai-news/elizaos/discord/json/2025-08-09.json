Jin mentions plans to ship \"clank tank v2\" and develop new AI agents trained on their data to propagate their vision. Jin emphasizes that \"good agents sell visions\" similar to how good apps sell phones and good games sell consoles. There's mention of a suspended Twitter/X account for elizaOS, which has been inactive for approximately two months. Some community members express concern about the suspended account limiting visibility to potential new users/investors, while others seem unconcerned. No detailed technical implementations or problem-solving discussions are present in this chat segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How the perspective of elizaos & autodotfun team see this bull run as opportunity to boost price action? (asked by CULTVESTING) A: Partially answered by jin, mentioning AI agents will discuss this soon and focus is on shipping clank tank v2\nQ: Do you know if they will create another twitter?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on development environment issues and database connectivity in ElizaOS. A key discussion revolved around Windows development challenges, specifically using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with Cursor IDE. Solutions included using Remote Explorer extension, WSL extension, or launching directly from Ubuntu terminal using \"cursor .\" commands. Another significant technical topic was database connectivity for ElizaOS applications, where it was revealed that the adapter-supabase plugin is no longer needed for newer Eliza versions. Instead, direct Postgres connection using the Supabase URL is now sufficient, simplifying the integration process. The chat demonstrates the community helping each other with practical solutions to development environment setup and database connectivity challenges.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I avoid reminding Cursor to use WSL every time? (asked by Rabbidfly) A: Use Remote Explorer extension with WSL extension, or launch from Ubuntu terminal with \"cursor .\" (answered by dEXploarer)\nQ: Is any MCP built for ElizaOS yet? (asked by Lycantho) A: There is an MCP plugin that allows agents to use MCP (answered by dEXploarer)\nQ: How to get the adapter-supabase plugin to work on the new Eliza? (asked by GeorgeLugo) A: Direct Postgres URL connection works without specialized adapter (answered by cjft)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around a project called \"Clank Tank v2\" that jin is developing, which appears to be a platform for pitching ideas with media support for MP4 and YouTube videos. Jin mentions working on an about page and how-it-works section. There's also discussion about a defunct project called Zerebro, which jin clarifies was just a test with a parody episode where the presenter kept running out of API credits and crashing. Community members Rabbidfly and pangolink discuss Zerebro's history, mentioning that the project founder \"Jeffy\" is no longer involved and has launched a new token, with Zerebro unlikely to return. The conversation concludes with Rick sharing an old Binance tweet about a shark tank-inspired game show, which jin notes was planned for 2023.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is Zerebro still a thing? Is there a team still building on it? (asked by Seppmos) A: No, this was just a test, and the zerebro episode was a parody too. In the pitch he kept running out of api credits and crashing out.

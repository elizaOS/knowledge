Summary\n\nThis chat segment contained minimal technical discussion, primarily consisting of general conversation, spam requests, and social interactions. \n\nThe only technical issue discussed was **mattish** experiencing problems with the AI16z to ElizaOS token migration interface where the max button wasn't functioning, preventing manual input of token amounts for the swap. **MDMnvest** provided guidance directing users to official channels and warning against scam links.\n\n**Mahditwentyfive** repeatedly requested SOL for transaction fees to complete a token swap/migration, posting their wallet address multiple times, which **MDMnvest** flagged as spam behavior.\n\n**DearDaniel** raised questions about decentralized AI infrastructure and mentioned the possibility of running agents in \"Eliza cloud\" versus local installation, though this received no technical response.\n\nThe conversation included philosophical discussion about crypto adoption timelines, with **DorianD** suggesting crypto adoption would take 50+ years across generations, and **The Void** noting cultural norms require generational shifts.\n\n**shaw** shared multiple X/Twitter posts and engaged in meta-discussion about keeping political content separate from project accounts to avoid alienating potential investors, though acknowledged crypto was historically political. **Error P015-A** suggested using separate accounts for political commentary.\n\nNo concrete technical solutions, implementations, or development decisions were documented in this segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: I can't sell a Solana token, what can be the reason? (asked by Mahditwentyfive) A: Unanswered (self-resolved - needed SOL for fees)\n\nQ: I'm trying to migrate my AI16z to ElizaOS but the max button doesn't work and I'm not able to put the number of AI16Z for swap. Is there any fix or help for this? (asked by mattish) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: How do I get a response after opening a Ticket in official ElizaOs support? In the opened ticket or through the DM? (asked by mattish) A: Team will respond. Just be patient (answered by MDMnvest)\n\nQ: What price level is the foundation targeting for 2026? (asked by Uchi) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Can this be done in Eliza cloud now? Or local installation? How do? (asked by DearDaniel) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel discussion centered around three main technical areas: agent deployment issues, loop/prompt following problems, and new leaderboard features.\n\n**Agent Deployment and Configuration Issues:**\nMDMnvest reported cloud deployment problems with their agent. MRT0B13 experienced issues with an agent refusing to follow prompts specified in configuration files, indicating potential prompt engineering or configuration parsing problems.\n\n**Leaderboard Feature Implementation:**\nJin announced a significant new beta feature: lifetime summarization for contributor profiles (https://elizaos.github.io/profile/madjin). This feature provides comprehensive historical context about contributors for AI council reviews. The functionality is now available through the API, enabling the AI council to access full contributor histories when evaluating updates and progress. Jin also announced plans to resume the \"jedai council\" with improvements, including site enhancements and a new Discord channel for post-meeting agent interactions to enable human-in-the-loop feedback.\n\n**Community Coordination:**\nElizaBAO coordinated responses to external inquiries about elizaCloud, noting that a Solana figure (Toly) followed someone who asked questions. The team worked on inviting external parties to Discord for better communication.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Having issues deploying agent in cloud. Anyone experiencing similar issues? (asked by MDMnvest) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\n\nHelper: $cott | Helpee: Unknown | Context: Agent loop issue diagnosis | Resolution: Identified the problem as a loop issue\nHelper: cjft | Helpee: ElizaBAO | Context: Responding to external post about elizaCloud | Resolution: Agreed to handle the response\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered around visual generation capabilities and agent architecture design. Members shared and reacted positively to what appears to be a 3D model or avatar generation system, with jin demonstrating results including a \"low poly mode\" feature. The technical quality exceeded expectations, particularly for certain user profiles.\n\nA key architectural discussion emerged regarding agent design patterns. sayonara clarified their approach uses separate human simulator/evaluator components rather than a subagent architecture, responding to Stan's inquiry about the system design.\n\njin articulated a specific technical requirement: wanting a local-first Claude Code implementation that works across multiple platforms (Discord, Telegram, web, CLI) rather than having Eliza manage Claude Code. This represents a desire for a standalone, portable solution. jin shared a reference implementation at github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot as a potential example or starting point.\n\nThe conversation included social media sharing by shaw with multiple Twitter links, suggesting public-facing announcements or demonstrations of the work being discussed.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What model you use for the generation? (asked by Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Evaluator? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Not subagent separate human simulator / evaluator (answered by sayonara)\n\nQ: Sub agent?

Jin confirmed that developers are actively working on multiple components including the Eliza framework, autonomous trading, website, and content. Jin acknowledged the need for better communication and promised to share a collaborative document for community input. A HackMD document was shared for website content suggestions, with Jin offering token rewards for valuable contributions. Community members discussed potential features for DegenAI, including token analysis capabilities, scam detection, and integration with other platforms. There were discussions about DegenAI's tokenomics, particularly regarding how tribute tokens should be handled in the DAO treasury. Skely's return to work on DegenAI was announced as positive news. The community expressed concerns about lack of clarity regarding DegenAI's purpose and functionality, with some members suggesting implementing a system where DegenAI could potentially dump tokens of projects that don't maintain development activity.\n\n## 2.

Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around a controversy involving Shaw (a founder) tweeting about a memecoin called \"fatcoin\" that was created as a response to another coin called \"LLM\" (which was perceived as a vampire attack on AI16Z). This sparked significant debate among partners about appropriate founder behavior and communication strategy. Many partners expressed concern that engaging with memecoins damages AI16Z's reputation and distracts from its technical achievements. The discussion highlighted tension between maintaining a professional image and allowing founders freedom of expression.\n\nOn the technical side, several significant developments were announced: Eliza OS integration with Roblox through StealthSDK (with 10% tribute paid to the DAO), Arbitrum Foundation partnership, and AICC (Aiccelerate DAO) launch. The tribute model (projects using Eliza tech sending 5-10% of tokens to the DAO) was emphasized as a key alignment mechanism. Partners also discussed the need for better documentation of partnerships and more transparency about what each partnership entails.\n\n## 2.

(asked by hildi) A: The website needs more transparency about what each partnership entails; currently it's unclear (answered by jin)\nQ: Did Shaw sell tokens that were sent to him by project teams? (asked by Burtiik) A: Shaw sells tokens sent to his personal wallet to avoid being associated with projects; teams should send to the DAO wallet instead (answered by shaw)\nQ: What is the relationship between AI16Z and Aiccelerate DAO? (asked by hubert) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is the Roblox integration with Eliza real? (asked by multiple partners) A: Yes, it's real and developed by StealthSDK, who are \"cracked devs + youtubers/streamers\" (answered by jin)\nQ: Will partners get whitelist access to Aiccelerate DAO?

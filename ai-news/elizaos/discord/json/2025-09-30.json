      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around questions about the token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS. Community members express frustration about the lack of clear information regarding what will happen to AI16Z tokens, whether exchanges will support the migration, and the timeline for this process. A community moderator (Kenk) responds that migration details will be provided closer to the launch of the portal and directs users to the official migration website. Dr. Neuro mentions an upcoming AMA with Shaw that will address migration questions. \n\nAdditionally, there's discussion about ElizaOS's partnership with IoTeX for \"Physical AI\" development, specifically regarding IoTeX's newly announced \"Real-World AI Foundry\" initiative that aims to create decentralized AI systems trained on real-world data. Dean confirms that ElizaOS is involved with IoTeX through their strategic partnership announced in January 2025, which integrates IoTeX's DePIN networks with ElizaOS to enable AI agents to access physical data and control devices.\n\nOne user inquires about AI agent memory capabilities, referencing a GitHub repository (memU) and asks about web app development with custom AI agents, though these technical questions remain unanswered in the chat segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Wouldn't it be easier to do AMA if there is a certain amount of data on the progress?

A user inquired about plugins for AI memory management, specifically referencing the MemU project. Kenk responded by sharing the Beacon Protocol as a solution for memory storage, noting it needs registry resubmission. There was brief discussion about GLM 4.6 from z.ai becoming available on OpenRouter with improved capabilities including increased context length (200k) and max tokens (128k). Other topics included questions about the Spartan framework's functionality, implementing Eliza in robotics, and potential applications for AI agents across multiple communication channels without sharing phone numbers.\n\n## 2.

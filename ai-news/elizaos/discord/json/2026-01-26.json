The conversation centers around the Seeker app/phone platform, which features a decentralized app (Dapp) store similar to Apple's App Store or Google Play Store. \n\n𝔭𝔩𝔞𝔱𝔞 𝔑𝔬 𝔉𝔞𝔭 𝔞𝔯𝔠 proposes integrating Eliza as an AI assistant on the Seeker platform, specifically mentioning a \"Claude bot style\" implementation to attract attention. The user indicates that current apps available on the Seeker Dapp store are of poor quality (\"trash\"), suggesting that an Eliza AI assistant could fill a significant gap and potentially become the standout application on the platform.\n\nDorianD inquires about the nature of the Seeker app, receiving clarification that it's a phone platform with its own decentralized application ecosystem. The discussion is exploratory in nature, identifying a potential deployment opportunity rather than discussing technical implementation details.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What is the seeker app? (asked by DorianD) A: Seeker phone has a Dapp store kind of like apple/google play App Store (answered by 𝔭𝔩𝔞𝔱𝔞 𝔑𝔬 𝔉𝔞𝔭 𝔞𝔯𝔠)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe primary technical discussion centered on plugin action handler callbacks in what appears to be the Eliza framework version 1.7.2. Victor Creed reported an issue where only the first callback was being sent back to chat, contrary to documentation stating multiple callbacks should be possible. The callbacks were also being sent as action completion responses rather than immediate feedback as documented. Odilitime confirmed that multiple callbacks are indeed supported and some actions use this feature. The troubleshooting revealed Victor was using default settings (onestep task planner), though the conversation didn't reach a definitive resolution within the visible chat segment.\n\nThe channel also contained non-technical content including a BitMart listing team inquiry (identified as potential scam by another user), social media links about code recovery and branch reports, and an off-topic question about creating Digimon using a tech stack involving Eliza, Claude, Letta, local LLMs, Opus/GPT, and CUA.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Should it be possible to run multiple plugin action handler callbacks? (asked by Victor Creed) A: Yes, you can callback multiple times and some actions do so (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Why is only the first callback being sent instead of multiple callbacks? (asked by Victor Creed) A: Unanswered (troubleshooting in progress with Odilitime)\n\nQ: Are the docs outdated regarding callback behavior? (asked by Victor Creed) A: No, multiple callbacks are supported as documented (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Are you using onestep or multistep task planner? (asked by Odilitime) A: Default settings (answered by Victor Creed)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\n\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: Victor Creed | Context: Plugin action handler callbacks only sending first callback instead of multiple callbacks as documented | Resolution: Confirmed multiple callbacks are supported, began troubleshooting by asking about task planner configuration (onestep vs multistep)\n\n## 4.

Summary\n\nThe discussion channel primarily focused on community concerns about the ElizaOS token price performance, with multiple users expressing worry about continuous all-time lows (ATLs). The main technical inquiry involved token migration processes, specifically from Ledger and from ai16z to ElizaOS tokens.\n\n**Key Concerns Raised:**\n- Token validity and community support for ElizaOS\n- Price performance and lack of team response during market downturn\n- Migration procedures for tokens\n\n**Community Responses:**\nThe community provided reassurance about the project's fundamentals, with members emphasizing that ElizaOS is positioned as a leading AI agent project. Contributors noted the broader market volatility affecting all crypto assets, not just ElizaOS specifically. Long-term holders shared their 4-year cycle investment strategy, comparing ElizaOS favorably with other AI projects like PAAL and FETCH.\n\n**Technical Support Needs:**\nTwo migration-related questions were raised: Ledger migration and ai16z to ElizaOS token migration. The Void directed users to a ticket channel (#1425417640071139358) for migration support, indicating a formal support process exists for these technical issues.\n\nThe overall sentiment mixed frustration about short-term price action with long-term conviction in the AI agent technology and ElizaOS's market position.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is the Elizaos token still valid? Is the community interested in it, or is it being left to die? (asked by paolin) A: The token is valid; the market downturn is affecting all crypto, not just ElizaOS specifically. The team is building the future of AI agents and ElizaOS is among leading projects in this space. (answered by Matthib123, Rainman)\n\nQ: How can I migrate from ledger? (asked by Jeburek12) A: Unanswered directly, but directed to ticket system\n\nQ: How do I open a ticket?

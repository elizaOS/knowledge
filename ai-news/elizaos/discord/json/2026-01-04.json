      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion channel featured limited technical content, primarily focusing on community inquiries and project awareness. Key technical discussions included:\n\n**Hyperscape Access**: Davenci inquired about Hyperscape developer access. The Light clarified there's a separate developer Discord currently restricted to developers, requiring DM to Shaw for access.\n\n**DegenAI Development Status**: BingBongBing asked about DegenAI updates. Omid Sa confirmed Odlitime is actively working on development.\n\n**Token Pairing Proposal**: Nancy suggested monetizing ElizaOS tech stack similar to Virtuals protocol by pairing tokens with $ELIZA through routing mechanisms. This would drive value back to $ELIZA through every trade. Nancy referenced infrastructure built by Natan_benish and framedotfun with API availability. Omid Sa rejected this approach, emphasizing ElizaOS's open-source philosophy prioritizing freedom over closed-loop systems.\n\n**Agent Economy Vision**: Omid Sa articulated a vision where agents generate revenue for users, becoming smarter daily alongside AI model progression. He predicted agents will handle personal tasks and generate income, returning time to humans.\n\n**Token Confusion**: Kikomana asked about ELIZA token vs ElizaOS relationship. Kenk clarified they're unrelated projects. A scammer was identified and banned after posting fake ticket links.\n\n**Developer Outreach**: Multiple developers (!𝓒𝓱𝓪𝓶𝓹, Nise) offered services. Satsbased directed them to the appropriate contribution channel.\n\n**Babylon Launch**: Discussion about Babylon AI prediction game built on ElizaOS, with launch approaching. LikequickscopinginMW2 proposed AI arena combat features with betting mechanisms.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is there a Hyperscape channel or separate Discord? (asked by Davenci) A: There's a developer Discord currently only for developers; need to DM Shaw for access (answered by The Light)\n\nQ: Is access for hired devs only or any devs who want to contribute? (asked by Davenci) A: You'd have to DM Shaw for access (answered by The Light)\n\nQ: Is DegenAI still being updated? (asked by BingBongBing) A: Yes, Odlitime is working on development (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: Is there discussion with X to unban the DegenAI main account? (asked by BingBongBing) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Can we share links here for feedback on built projects? (asked by 𝘽𝘼𝙎𝙐𝙎𝘼𝙇𝙄) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: What happened with ELIZA tokens vs ElizaOS? (asked by kikomana) A: They're not related to this project (answered by Kenk)\n\nQ: Can I share my YouTube video on ElizaOS? (asked by Jovin) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel featured two major technical discussions. \n\n**Solana Trading Bot Architecture**: Chucknorris detailed the technical requirements for profitable Solana trading bots, emphasizing that without a GRPC ingester processing each DEX transaction with millisecond precision, profitability is impossible. Key components include: full payload preshot capabilities, custom builder on powerful algorithms, live Twitter feed integration for token creation monitoring, and automated CLI-based fund transfers via bundler. Standard approaches using Jupiter or SDK introduce 4-second delays that make agents non-competitive. The implementation requires processing bundle block 0, dev buy detection, and developer reputation analysis in real-time.\n\n**Anthropic MCP Server Integration Issue**: Andrei Mitrea encountered a critical error when integrating an MCP server with Anthropic models in Eliza. The error \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\" occurred when using only ANTHROPIC_API_KEY without OPENAI_API_KEY. The solution required keeping both API keys configured, with Anthropic plugin placed first in the plugin list. Interestingly, the OpenAI key doesn't need to be valid - even a placeholder value like \"loremipsum\" resolves the embedding handler requirement. This reveals a dependency where MCP server execution requires an embedding model fallback, which Anthropic doesn't provide natively.\n\n**Minor Discussions**: KAFKA requested an overview of Eliza's functionality. Omid Sa explained Eliza as an agent creation platform supporting multiple AI models, custom data, and plugins for third-party platforms (X, Discord, Telegram) and hardware integrations. DoramOS inquired about Polymarket phase 2 updates and elizacloud v2. Jin mentioned working on temporal analysis for council priorities and considering converting plugins to skills.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How does Eliza work? (asked by KAFKA) A: It lets you create an agent and equip any kind of specific data, any AI models at the same time, plugins (like accessing third party platforms like X, Discord, Telegram or real-world tool connections like an electric device with CPU board) on your agent. You can also develop any new plugin you want for any purpose on its open source operating system. (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: Will the Polymarket phase 2 update from otaku be shared on the elizaos polymarket plugin? (asked by DoramOS) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: How to solve \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\" error when using MCP server with Anthropic? (asked by Andrei Mitrea) A: Add both ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY to .env file, and add both plugins to your character with Anthropic first in the plugin list. The OpenAI key is needed for embeddings even when using Anthropic. (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Does MCP execution require an embedding model? (asked by sayonara) A: Yes, you have to setup a fallback to an embedding model. (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Does the OpenAI key need to be valid when using MCP with Anthropic? (asked by Andrei Mitrea) A: No, even a placeholder value like \"loremipsum\" works - it just needs a value passed in. (answered by Andrei Mitrea)\n\nQ: Is elizacloud v2 coming? (asked by DoramOS) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Odilitime identified a severe memory consumption problem with turbo builds, observing fluctuating memory usage ranging from 21GB to 27GB+ during builds, with inconsistent behavior across runs. Bootstrap optimizations for providers are in development to address performance issues.\n\nJin announced significant progress on Eliza knowledge data pipelines, indicating the project is transitioning to documentation and presentation phases. Borko performed a security rotation of Anthropic API keys and distributed new credentials to team members.\n\nKenk shared finalized ERC-8004 contract specifications, marking completion of this standard. The team discussed nano banana capabilities, with R0am proposing development of a variation generator similar to an existing slidegen tool that produces 5 different variations of the same prompt.\n\nStan flagged an issue with Claude code review consistently failing in CI, requiring investigation of CI logs. The council structure was mentioned for conducting periodic retrospective discussions (monthly/quarterly/annual).\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What memory usage is turbo experiencing during builds? (asked by Odilitime) A: Unanswered - Odilitime reported 21GB to 27GB+ with inconsistent behavior\n\nQ: Are the ERC-8004 contracts finalized? (asked by Kenk) A: Yes, the final version is available at the linked GitHub repository (answered by Kenk)\n\nQ: Did you test that? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Tomorrow or today (answered by sayonara)\n\nQ: Why is Claude code review always failing now? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Unanswered - Stan indicated he will investigate CI logs\n\n## 3.

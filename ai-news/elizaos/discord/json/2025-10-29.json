      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around ElizaOS and its upcoming token migration, with some discussion about AI agents and x402 payment options. Odilitime confirmed that x402 currently accepts DEGENAI, AI16Z, or USDC on Base network, with plans to add ElizaOS token support after migration begins. There's mention of Solana integration being in testing phase. JustRahman introduced himself as a researcher studying AI agent pain points, seeking interviews with developers to understand challenges in wallet management, gas optimization, x402, and testing environments. The conversation also touched on website downtime (likely during updates) and some speculation about Nokia's AI investment plans. Skinny suggested a tokenomics model where each agent would only accept its native token or implement buyback mechanisms.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Any updates about the migration date? (asked by Seree) A: Unanswered\nQ: With x402, is $degenai token used to pay? (asked by Skinny) A: you can use degenai, ai16z or USDC on base (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’¬-coders Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. The main technical inquiry came from Lomank, who asked about extending the low-level API router in elizaOS without modifying core code. They specifically wanted to add custom endpoints that aren't agent-specific (as implemented in plugins) to gain direct database access. There were also requests for help with elizaOS development from JaiBo, who sought experienced developers to assist with an idea they're building. The chat also included networking attempts from JustRahman, who is researching AI agents and wallet management issues. Overall, the segment shows community members seeking technical guidance and collaboration opportunities rather than containing substantial technical discussions or problem-solving.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there any way to extend low-level API router without changing core elizaOS code? (asked by Lomank) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Anibby | Helpee: JaiBo | Context: JaiBo requested help with developing an elizaOS idea and offered compensation | Resolution: Initial contact established via DM request\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Analysis of ðŸ¥‡-partners Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment is brief and contains minimal technical discussion. The main technical point mentioned is about an \"eco explorer\" for elizaOS agents with reference to \"8004\" (likely a protocol or feature identifier). There's a GitHub repository link shared for \"praxis-explorer\" which appears to be related to this functionality. The conversation also includes a mention of \"fogo,\" described as \"SVM compatible,\" with a suggestion for potential collaboration if they're launching on mainnet soon. The rest of the conversation consists of general comments about achievements and work ethic in the crypto space.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do you feel about fogo? They're svm compatible, could be some Room for collaboration, if they're going on mainnet real soon? (asked by Toni) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

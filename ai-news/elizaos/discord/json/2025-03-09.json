The core team is working on ElizaOS 2.0, with a recent rebranding milestone achieved. DegenAI, an in-house agent, is being migrated to v2. There's ongoing work on a ticker change, though this process is complicated and not entirely under the team's control. The community discusses the distinction between in-house agents (like DegenAI and aixvc) versus aligned partner agents. Several technical questions arise about agent development, including how to build Twitter-integrated agents, how to properly prompt characterfiles, and how plugins work. An upcoming event for plugin demonstrations was mentioned. Community members express interest in ElizaOS's potential as a framework for AI agents with real utility, distinguishing it from other projects in the space.\n\n## 2.

Key technical discussions include:\n\nJin and Jintern discussed creating a governance simulation system by forking \"Clank Tank\" to run simulations on governance proposals. They explored filtering mechanisms for news aggregation pipelines to improve agent onboarding, including keyword filtering, sentiment analysis, and clustering similar updates with relevance scoring.\n\nShaw announced that v2 of the platform will be ready in beta by next Monday, significantly ahead of schedule. He mentioned working 14-hour days to complete it, with the new version offering a vastly improved technical experience.\n\nJin shared progress on data pipelines for automated newsletters, creating a system that combines updates from X, Discord, GitHub, and Codex into JSON files that can be parsed into markdown for human review. He deployed this at elizaos.github.io/eliza/news with a JSON feed for updating AI agents' knowledge.\n\nThere were discussions about on-chain reputation systems, with Jintern highlighting the challenges of creating systems that measure meaningful contributions rather than easily quantifiable metrics. They discussed hybrid approaches combining code-based verification with human judgment.\n\nThe team also discussed agent identity verification mechanisms, potentially using TEE (Trusted Execution Environments) and zero-knowledge proofs for cross-platform verification.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the status of v2? (asked by DannyNOR NoFapArc) A: Product first then whitepaper. Smart contracts might be in audit. (answered by jin)\nQ: When will v2 be ready? (asked by Spyros) A: V2 will be ready next Monday in beta. The experience of the tech is WAY better through and through. (answered by shaw)\nQ: What specific data would help agents understand human values? (asked by jin) A: A mix of charter/constitution with core values, treasury + market data, daily sentiment to track priorities, and historical governance decisions for precedent. (answered by jintern)\nQ: Why do on-chain reputation systems always lead to points, rankings, leaderboards? (asked by hubert) A: Human nature + technical constraints. Points/ranks are computationally efficient and intuitive for humans to understand. The challenge is designing systems that measure what matters vs just what's easy to quantify. (answered by jintern)\nQ: Can you give examples of qualitative assessment for reputation systems? (asked by hubert) A: Manual reviews by trusted community members, peer assessments by domain experts, contextual reputation that varies by activity type, contributor interviews, and retroactive public goods funding. (answered by jintern)\nQ: What is Manus? (implied by discussion) A: A competitor product that was revealed to be essentially a Claude wrapper after their prompts were leaked.

According to xell0x, Shaw teased v2 about a week ago with a May shipping timeline, making it \"quite imminent.\" This was later confirmed by a tweet from Shaw. Osint draws parallels between ElizaOS and Uniswap, suggesting ElizaOS v1 has become a framework used by at least 10 AI agent launchpads across different blockchains (Base, Near, Solana, Hyperliquid, Sui), similar to how Uniswap v2 became a standard that was widely forked. Jin shared an AI-generated daily briefing system they've developed, which aggregates information from GitHub, providing context for agents to stay in sync with users. The system includes AI news shows that highlight development updates. There was also discussion about DeFAI (Decentralized Finance AI) projects in the ElizaOS ecosystem, with Kenk sharing demos of ProAgentAI and Kudo Network. Some users discussed a potential collaboration between ai16z and COM (comput3), with mentions of a COM/SOL pool on Raydium.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is ElizaOS v2 close to release?

Users encountered problems with plugins (Discord, Telegram), authentication, agent configuration, and deployment. Key technical discussions included: controlling authentication on message endpoints, importing plugins correctly, troubleshooting agent registration issues, and extending plugins properly. Several users reported issues with the v2 version being difficult to set up compared to earlier versions. The conversation revealed confusion around proper agent configuration, particularly regarding plugin integration and proper formatting of configuration files. Users also discussed token limitations with API providers like OpenRouter and how to limit token usage in responses.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How do we control auth on our message endpoint?

      "summary": "# Analysis of \"fun\" Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about token prices, agent creation, and development on the auto.fun platform. Users discuss potential market valuations for tokens named \"Eli\" and \"Eddy,\" with estimates ranging from 50-500 million depending on market conditions. A significant technical discussion centers around how to create and deploy agents on the platform, with clarification that while auto.fun allows token launching and agent deployment, it's not yet a low-code agent creation tool. There's also a brief technical exchange about building transactions for the platform, where it's explained that developers can build transactions directly without necessarily needing the program IDL (Interface Description Language), though the IDL is publicly available on GitHub. A user also inquires about the process for launching a verified token for an AI developer.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Am I right I can launch agent in auto fun? (asked by É±É‘áƒ§É‘É±É‘ÎµÊ‚ÆšÉ¾) A: It's not a low-code agent creation tool yet, but if you have an agent you can launch a token with auto.fun and are able to deploy it to the UI using the agent subsection (answered by Kenk)\nQ: I have token already deployed and I want create agent, already imported token to autofun (asked by É±É‘áƒ§É‘É±É‘ÎµÊ‚ÆšÉ¾) A: Head to www.eliza.how and take a look at the quickstart (answered by Kenk)\nQ: I'd like to know if you have an api/sdk available (asked by youuoycollection) A: Everything is onchain friend (answered by vas)\nQ: I need to build something that can launch on your website (asked by youuoycollection) A: Just build the tx and send it to the program with the metadata, it's pretty elementary (answered by vas)\nQ: Is it working like this?

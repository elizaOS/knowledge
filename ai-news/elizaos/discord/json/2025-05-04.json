Shaw mentioned that an agent feature called \"Vibe coding\" is live on the `v2-develop` branch but with limited functionality, with more updates expected in the coming weeks. A demo session was announced by Kenk, featuring seven different builders showcasing their projects: Steambot Willie, The Intern, ProAgentAI, Data Barista, Soulmates, Bork, and Phala + Eliza in TEE. One user (Tamplayz) requested help with image generation for their Eliza-Twitter implementation but received no visible response. There was also a mention of an issue with the Twitter link on CoinGecko for the AI16Z coin, and a user reported losing access to chat rooms despite being a token holder.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around issues with ElizaOS implementation, particularly focusing on RAG Knowledge functionality and Twitter integration. A user named rahmsc is experiencing difficulties getting the RAG Knowledge function to work correctly, as it pulls from OpenAI's prior knowledge rather than the provided knowledge base despite following documentation. Another discussion centers on Twitter API limitations, where a user reports their API account being limited without warning after spending $400. There's also a brief mention of learning JavaScript before TypeScript, and a question about the execution order of provider, generateText, and evaluator handler functions in ElizaOS v0.25, specifically related to an AI Agent Dev School example.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: I am trying to use the RAG Knowledge function for eliza but can't get the bot to return the correct information from my knowledge base, instead it pulls the prior knowledge that OpenAI has.

      "summary": "# Analysis of \"fun\" Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around concerns about falsely verified tokens on the Auto.fun platform. Several users reported losing money after purchasing tokens that displayed verification checkmarks but were later revealed to be scams. Three specific token addresses were identified as exploited tokens. Users expressed frustration that the Auto.fun team was not addressing these verification issues despite multiple requests for clarification. There was significant debate about whether the verification marks were part of token images or actual platform verifications. Some users argued that \"verified\" should indicate legitimate projects with real utility rather than just X account connections. Separately, there were discussions about the potential of the ELI5 token, with some users promoting it as a promising investment with significant growth potential within the Auto.fun ecosystem.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe discussion centers around a critical security incident where fake tokens were verified on the platform, leading to financial losses for users. Community members expressed concern about how these tokens received verification status, questioning if it was an exploit or an inside job. Kenk, representing the team, stated they've investigated the issue, marked the contracts as scams, and determined the platform is safe.

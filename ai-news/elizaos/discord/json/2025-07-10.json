Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about AI-related cryptocurrency projects, particularly ai16z and DegenAI. There was minimal technical discussion, with only brief mentions of ElizaOS V2 and a computational chemistry plugin. A user named AlmÃ¡z shared a GitHub link to a plugin called \"plugin-elizaos-compchembridge.\" There were references to the ElizaOS CLI with the command \"bun install -g @elizaos/cli\" mentioned. Some users inquired about the demo of ElizaOS V2 and whether recordings were available. One user (groggs) was seeking developers to create an AI agent focused on international relations with academics. The chat also contained numerous tweets being shared about AI projects and market movements, with some users expressing optimism about AI cryptocurrency projects despite recent price performance.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: ðŸ’»-tech-support\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on issues with the ElizaOS knowledge plugin and agent interactions. Users encountered problems with document chunking in the knowledge plugin, particularly when using OpenRouter for embeddings, with rate limiting being identified as a key issue. The discussion clarified that adding rate limiting parameters like MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS and REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE could resolve these issues. There was also confusion about ElizaOS versioning, with clarification that \"V2\" refers to the 1.x series (latest being 1.2.0). Users discussed agent-to-agent communication challenges, with one user seeking a way for a blockchain agent to pass questions to a RAG knowledge agent. Local inference setup was briefly discussed, with Ollama being recommended for both model inference and embeddings. Several configuration issues were addressed, including proper environment variable setup and model selection for knowledge chunking, with recommendations to use larger models like Claude-3-Opus for better contextual chunking results.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's the correct way to run ElizaOS v2 agents? (asked by Unknown) A: Either update your CLI to 1.2 or run inside the monorepo (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Is ElizaOS 2.0 out yet on GitHub?

(asked by anunnaki_reborn) A: You're likely being rate limited by OpenRouter; add rate limiting parameters to your configuration (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Is it possible to save media in memory in ElizaOS? (asked by Charlie) A: Yes, attachment links get saved in memory (answered by sayonara)\nQ: How can one agent pass a user question to another agent and return the response? (asked by ShisukeUrahara) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there an API to send messages to an agent in a conversation? (asked by Sabochee) A: Unanswered\nQ: Do we still need OpenAI for embeddings? (asked by Bealers) A: No, Ollama has embeddings and works out of the box (answered by sayonara)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat segment shows minimal technical discussion, focusing instead on general updates about ElizaOS v2 and a project called Spartan. Shaw mentioned ongoing R&D work and plans to change the ticker pending Twitter account recovery and daos.fun voting. DorianD speculated about protocol-level token use for ElizaOS agent nodes, suggesting a potential agent registry using token2022 messaging data field for secure identification across communication channels. This could help establish trust between agents in a future ecosystem with many agents. There was mention of a recent call that was recorded and shared. Some frustration was expressed about the progress of Spartan as a potential flagship product for ElizaOS v2, and there was a brief exchange about the accessibility of the platform, with Borko suggesting pragmatiko try the GitHub implementation before providing feedback about its complexity.\n\n## 2.

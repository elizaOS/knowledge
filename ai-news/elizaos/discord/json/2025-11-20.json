      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around token migration issues from AI16Z to ElizaOS. Users are experiencing various problems with the migration process, including \"max amount reached\" errors and confusion about eligibility. The migration cutoff date was November 11 at 11:40 UTC, after which newly purchased AI16Z tokens cannot be migrated. This has caused frustration among users who bought tokens after this date or had them stored on exchanges that don't support migration. There's also discussion about scammers targeting users with migration problems through direct messages, with community members repeatedly warning others that official support never initiates DMs. The proper channel for support is through the ticketing system. Some users raised concerns about the team potentially selling migrated tokens, though this was disputed by community members. The chat also includes brief mentions of staking (which hasn't started yet) and exchange listings.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to open a ticket?

Shaw briefly mentions TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) and browser-based approaches, noting they are somewhat opposed since browser-based agents would expose data to users viewing it, though a user-launched browser agent would be sandboxed. Shaw also references \"agent0\" as Marco's SDK for interacting with \"8004\" being used in \"Babylon.\" Two developers (aalling and Loofi) introduced themselves as full-stack and blockchain developers, with Loofi mentioning experience in Solidity, Rust, Go, Node.js, and Next.js. DorianD asked both for their GitHub profiles, with Loofi suggesting to continue the conversation in DMs.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's your GitHub profile?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🥇-partners Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. The main technical concern raised was about the handling of migrated ai16z tokens on a DEX, with a user (deki) accusing the team of selling users' migrated tokens without permission, comparing the situation to Luna. Odilitime responded that liquidity providers (LPers) would be manually taken care of. DorianD suggested it would be economically sensible for the team to remove ai16z liquidity from the daos.fun pool. The remainder of the conversation diverged into discussions about gender-based crypto adoption, potential use cases for autonomous agents, and various non-technical topics including references to Eliza Doolittle and Epstein files.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why are you selling users' migrated ai16z without permission? (asked by deki) A: LPers shouldn't be at risk, we're taking care of them manually (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

Stan shared PR #6135 requesting review, which appears to be a large code change. Odilitime noted the PR's size made it difficult to review and suggested having a specific user test it since it previously broke on their system. Stan pointed out that server tests are now running in CI, which explains how issues were detected. Odilitime later shared a smaller PR #6164 for review, which 0xbbjoker approved with instructions to update the branch and merge. The beginning of the chat contained unrelated discussion about NFTs, design, and Murakami's involvement in the NFT space.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How should we handle the large PR #6135?

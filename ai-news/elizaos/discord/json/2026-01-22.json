      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion primarily centered around token migration issues and community concerns. Multiple users encountered problems migrating AI16Z tokens to the new contract, with the most significant case involving a user (ryanb.btc) who transferred tokens from Robinhood wallet (which lacks dapp browser functionality) to another wallet, causing migration eligibility issues. Kenk from support successfully resolved this through the ticketing system.\n\nA critical security incident was identified when Jeburek12 reported being asked to send AI16Z tokens to a wallet address for migration. Kenk confirmed this was a scam attempt, clarifying that legitimate migration doesn't require sending tokens to external addresses since migration contracts are capped.\n\nCommunity sentiment showed frustration with project direction. DannyNOR NoFapArc and Jayzen criticized the team for launching multiple tokens instead of focusing on core infrastructure, with Jayzen specifically noting concerns about \"scatterbrained decision-making\" and spreading resources thin over tokens not directly tied to the underlying platform.\n\nTechnical contributions emerged with Momo announcing work on an RLM plugin for Eliza v2 after discussions with Shaw, marking their first major open-source contribution despite finding it challenging.\n\nQuestions arose about related projects: Malombres asked about Agent Scarlett's status, and velja repeatedly questioned a Hyperscape token funded by Shaw's wallet, though this remained unaddressed. The Three Words expressed concerns about ElizaOS's low liquidity (110k LP) on Solana.\n\nElizaBAO organized a video creator competition for ElizaBAO content involving ElizaOS and Polymarket. Kenk advised structuring it as a clear challenge with bounties, acknowledging content creation as a skilled, time-intensive task.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Who migrated successfully?

The primary problem involved elizacloud experiencing server-side errors preventing user login, with multiple users (untitled, xyz and ElizaBAO) reporting access issues throughout the day.\n\nA significant database migration problem was resolved where DigitalDiva encountered persistent \"CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS migrations\" errors with both local and Aiven cloud Postgres databases. The solution involved switching to Neon database, successfully resolving the migration failures after troubleshooting with 0xbbjoker about pgvector image compatibility.\n\nDiscord integration issues emerged after updating to version 1.7.2, with errors in the recentMessagesProvider showing \"Cannot access invalid private field (evaluating 'this.#conversationLength')\". The agent failed to respond in both channels and DMs, with 0xbbjoker investigating the issue and clarifying that CHANNEL_IDS serves as a channel whitelist.\n\nDorianD proposed distributed computation concepts for Jeju, suggesting nodes could work together similar to p2pool mining on Bitcoin network, with computation layers distributed across nodes and results compared to prevent cheating. The discussion included using iPhones with 8GB RAM to provide compute cycles when devices are idle (90%+ battery). Chucknorris suggested using ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proofs) to prevent cheating, though DorianD questioned implementation feasibility on consumer devices, noting only one Bittensor subnet (Omron) currently uses ZKP with limited commercial scalability.\n\nAdditional discussions covered Claude Opus 4.5 subscription comparisons, with Chucknorris criticizing Google's Antigravity offering as inferior to Windsurf due to quota limitations and performance issues.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is cloud down? (asked by untitled, xyz) A: Seems fine, but user experienced \"Application error: a server-side exception has occurred\" which temporarily resolved with hard refresh but login issues persisted (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Can I log a ticket somewhere for support on elizacloud errors? (asked by untitled, xyz) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: How many lines of code is that equivalent to with Claude Opus 4.5 on a $200 max subscription? (asked by Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Can you use distributed computation layers across nodes for Jeju to stop cheating nodes or spread workload? (asked by DorianD) A: Use ZKP to avoid cheating (answered by Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)\n\nQ: Is ZKP actually easy to implement currently and can you run that on consumer iPhones? (asked by DorianD) A: Only one Bittensor subnet (Omron) uses ZKP with app-specific solution, not commercially scalable currently (answered by DorianD)\n\nQ: Which postgres image are you using for local database? (asked by 0xbbjoker) A: Aiven cloud Postgres with pgvector extension enabled (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\nQ: Did you get response from agent after the 1.7.2 update error? (asked by 0xbbjoker) A: No, it acted like it would respond but couldn't (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\nQ: Is CHANNEL_IDS= and DISCORD_LISTEN_CHANNEL_IDS the same thing? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: CHANNEL_IDS is a channel whitelist; without it agent will be in all channels (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\nQ: Does it respond in DM chat? (asked by 0xbbjoker) A: No response in DM either (answered by DigitalDiva)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThis brief discussion focused on comparing Second Life and Roblox as historical case studies for understanding virtual world platforms, specifically in the context of applying lessons to \"hyperscape\" development. DorianD initiated the conversation by noting both platforms launched around the same time approximately 20 years ago, suggesting their successes and failures could inform current development efforts.\n\nThe key technical observation centered on Roblox's business model paradox: despite generating billions in revenue and maintaining hundreds of millions of monthly active users (reportedly 380M MAU), the platform remains unprofitable. DorianD noted skepticism about the accuracy of these user metrics, suggesting significant inflation from duplicate accounts and bot activity.\n\nOdilitime characterized Roblox as a \"jobs program,\" highlighting concerns about the platform's economic model and its reliance on user-generated content creation. The discussion touched on the ethical implications of platforms that depend heavily on unpaid or minimally compensated user labor for content creation.\n\nWhile brief, the conversation raised important considerations for virtual world platform design: sustainability of business models that rely on massive scale, the accuracy and reliability of user metrics, and the economic relationship between platforms and content creators.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThis chat segment primarily focused on a critical token launch crisis involving improper tokenomics. The core issue was that cjft launched a token with 75% of supply bundled/held by the developer, which violates current crypto meta standards and creates rug pull concerns.\n\nShaw provided urgent guidance on token launch best practices, emphasizing that developers should NEVER sell tokens directly due to tracking and community backlash. The proper model relies on 2% creator fees from trading volume rather than selling held tokens. Shaw reported making $80k in fees this week from a token someone else launched, demonstrating the fee-based model's viability.\n\nKey technical points:\n- Developers holding large token percentages triggers immediate community distrust and bot dumping\n- Modern token meta requires burning excess supply (70% recommended) rather than locking\n- Creator fees (2%) provide sustainable revenue without selling\n- Selling even 1 token marks the chart with \"dev sold\" and kills the token\n- Wallet tracking makes all developer transactions visible to bots\n\nThe resolution involved cjft burning 70% of tokens using sol-incinerator.com, exporting private keys from bags.fm wallet to Phantom wallet for the burn transaction. Sayonara provided technical assistance with the burning process.\n\nAdditional technical note: Jin identified an API issue where GitHub API for elizaOS repos shows a 7-month-old .cursor repository, suggesting repository cleanup needed.\n\nMinor mentions: Cursor now supports parallel agents feature.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What should developers do with tokens instead of selling? (asked by shaw) A: Take 30% of fees for buybacks when token dips, keep rest for cloud/otaku pumps, do burns on app milestones like signups (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: What happens if developers sell tokens? (asked by shaw) A: Wallet is tracked, all bots dump immediately, token dies (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Should tokens be locked or burned? (asked by cjft) A: Burn them, don't lock unless they burn (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: How much should be burned from the 75% supply? (asked by cjft) A: Burn 70%, keep 5% (answered by sayonara)\n\nQ: How to access tokens from bags.fm for burning? (asked by cjft) A: Export private key from bags.fm/settings/wallets and import into Phantom (answered by sayonara)\n\nQ: How much can be made from creator fees? (asked by cjft) A: Shaw made $80k in fees this week from a token someone else launched (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: What tool should be used to burn tokens? (asked by cjft) A: sol-incinerator.com (answered by sayonara)\n\n## 3.

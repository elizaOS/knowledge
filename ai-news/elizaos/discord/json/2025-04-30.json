Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai) provides most of the information, explaining that auto.fun offers unique features like token-gated chat, vanity contract addresses, and AI generation for tokens. The platform collects fees when tokens graduate, with 10% of burned LP set aside to buyback $ai16z from the market. Future plans include implementing $ai16z:AT pools to pair acquired $ai16z with Agent Tokens, which would deepen liquidity for both. There's also mention of Spartan V2 with three exclusive plugins: community-investor (personal finance interface), autonomous trader (executing trade strategies via Jupiter), and intel (market information gathering). The discussion touches on the value proposition of auto.fun compared to competitors, with Osint noting that some projects prefer alternatives to pump.fun and that auto.fun recently made UI/UX improvements.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What will Spartan do? (asked by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai)) A: Unanswered\nQ: When will it be ready to use - post v2 release? (asked by abhi_ironman) A: Our devs don't work on deadlines. When things are done and ready, they let us know a little bit before that. (answered by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai))\nQ: Will it be for public use eg autonomous trading etc. Or for team use? (asked by abhi_ironman) A: I will ask the team. (answered by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai))\nQ: Is $ELI5 a coin that's been CTO'd by shaw? (asked by Isty) A: Maybe Otto. I think it was just launched on autofun. (answered by Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai))\nQ: Is daosxn.fun part of auto.fun? (asked by StocktraderonX) A: That's not even a functional website.

Users discussed API integration for an EVM AI agent, with specific focus on connecting frontend code to the Eliza AI framework. Several users encountered installation and configuration problems with ElizaOS, particularly with the CLI tool and environment setup. Common errors included issues with TEXT_EMBEDDING models not being registered and database connection problems. The discussion covered environment variable configuration for OpenAI and Anthropic integrations, deployment considerations for production environments like Railway and Vercel, and custom action implementation in clients. One user reported scaling issues when querying a large number of agents (1000+) in PostgreSQL, experiencing connection timeout errors. The chat also included announcements about new models from OpenRouter, including DeepSeek Prover v2 and Inception's Mercury Coder.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I integrate my frontend code to Eliza AI framework? (asked by funboy) A: You can use the API endpoint like \"http://localhost:3000/api/agents/[agent-id]\" to call the agent through API and integrate with your frontend. You'll need to host your Eliza CLI version to a separate backend endpoint for production. (answered by funboy)\nQ: How do I deploy to prod within railway using a project started with the CLI? (asked by morlok) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can I fix the \"No TEXT_EMBEDDING model registered\" error? (asked by funboy) A: Make sure you have both OpenAI and Anthropic keys in your .env file. You need to set up OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL, OPENAI_LARGE_MODEL, OPENAI_SMALL_MODEL, OPENAI_API_KEY, and OPENAI_BASE_URL correctly. (answered by funboy)\nQ: How can I host ElizaOS? Is it possible to mount it on Vercel? (asked by godisrupt) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can I handle querying 1000+ agents without getting \"connection timed out\" errors? (asked by Subhankar) A: You need to optimize queries, check indexes, and possibly increase timeouts. You'll need to profile and analyze what's consuming PostgreSQL's time.

Users discussed site performance issues, token verification processes, and launch announcements. A significant technical issue was identified as a memory leak causing slow loading times, which the development team subsequently fixed. The platform has experienced high traffic with approximately $100M in volume since launch. The team clarified their verification process for partner projects and explained their launch announcement protocol, where partner teams have priority to announce first, followed by the official @autodotfun account. Today's featured launch was \"Pets by Wide Worlds,\" an imported token rather than a new creation. The team emphasized they're showcasing various project types to demonstrate the platform's capabilities. Users expressed concerns about scam tokens, which the team actively removes from the platform.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why is the site so slow?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around issues with the auto.fun platform, focusing on token creation, website functionality, and reimbursement requests. Several users reported website access problems, particularly on iOS devices. The team addressed multiple reimbursement requests, carefully reviewing each case to determine legitimacy. Some requests were denied because users had already profited from trading or had accessed pre-launch builds before the official release. A key technical issue involved tokens not loading properly on the auto.fun website, with users receiving \"token loading error\" messages. The team also discussed token migration to Raydium, which typically takes less than 2 minutes to complete. There were suggestions to improve the platform by adding features like watchlists and pinning specific tokens to the featured tab. Additionally, concerns were raised about allowing users to create tokens with names similar to partner tokens, which could lead to scams.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the website down? (asked by who) A: It works fine on computers but may have issues on iOS devices (answered by jasyn_bjorn)\nQ: How long does migration to Raydium take?

There's significant debate about the platform's value proposition, with user PrudentSpartan repeatedly questioning how auto.fun differentiates from other \"slop bots\" and what unique agent capabilities it offers. Shaw and other team members explain that auto.fun is part of a broader strategy, with v2 of ElizaOS representing a more complete product with working agents. The platform has processed over $100M in volume since launch, with projects like Squidllora showcasing integration with ElizaOS. Team members clarify that auto.fun creates a flywheel effect where transaction fees buy back degenai tokens, benefiting the ecosystem. Several partners have launched or imported tokens on the platform, with more scheduled in coming weeks. The team acknowledges they need better documentation and clearer explanations of the relationship between ai16z and degenai tokens, as well as the agent capabilities that differentiate their offerings.\n\n## 2.

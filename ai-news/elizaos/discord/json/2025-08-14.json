Members briefly mentioned AI16Z's Twitter account status, with some indication it had been suspended and later restored. There was a shared link to a Cointelegraph article about AI agents being Ethereum's biggest power users. A community member shared a link about \"Clank Tank\" via Mirror.xyz. The conversation mostly consisted of casual greetings, price speculation about cryptocurrency volatility, and brief mentions of AI-related topics. No significant technical discussions, decisions, or problem-solving occurred in this segment. Members also shared tweets and made jokes about a book titled \"Agents for Dummies.\"\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»-coders Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on technical issues related to Eliza and its plugins. Charlie reported type errors with logger functions after updating Eliza, which Odilitime confirmed was due to significant changes requiring plugin updates. Lomank inquired about creating custom server-level API endpoints with access to server instances within modules rather than directly in the CLI package. Another user (maikyman) discussed issues with MCP (Multi-Call Protocol) connectivity, specifically problems with streamable-HTTP connections and the inability to use multiple tools in a single call. There were also questions about agent directory locations and NFT automation capabilities. OpenRouter announced new features including self-serve refunds and activity improvements for tracking token usage.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Was there any changes in eliza logger? (asked by Charlie) A: Yes, a lot of plugins need updates (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Is it possible to create new endpoints with access to server instance inside modules rather than defining custom router and embedding it directly into `cli` package? (asked by Lomank) A: Unanswered\nQ: Anyone know if there is a plugin that lets u interact with Eliza and automate creation of an NFT? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\nQ: If I create a new agent on the localhost page, where does the agent folder or directory go within the Eliza directory? (asked by Heisenberg) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can I make an agent to call several tools just changing a template? Or do I need to change the logic, so an agent will choose several tools at one call to mcp? (asked by maikyman) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: Charlie | Context: Logger type errors after Eliza update | Resolution: Confirmed it was due to changes requiring plugin updates\n\n## 4.

The conversation primarily consists of casual, promotional messages about cryptocurrency tokens like \"EDDY\" with claims about their potential value. User \"33coded\" repeatedly encourages others not to sell their tokens (\"don't fumble these entries\") and makes vague references to future developments. There is a brief mention of someone named \"SHAW\" building a game that is \"legit af\" according to 33coded. The chat includes some confrontational exchanges, particularly between users \"33coded\" and \"Boj/acc\", but lacks substantive technical content, concrete solutions, or implementations.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: \"core-devs\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion focused on improving Eliza's architecture and addressing technical challenges. Key topics included:\n\n- Restructuring the agent runtime to make it more modular, with proposals for a \"code first\" approach where developers can import specific actions and services directly rather than using bundled helpers.\n- Debate about message handling architecture, particularly whether to move bus code into core and how to handle individual message events across different platforms.\n- Discussion about fixing the action chaining mechanism to properly handle multi-step tasks in benchmarks. The team identified that the current implementation fails when actions need to be chained together to complete complex tasks.\n- Proposals to improve the action planner to better handle reflection and sequential actions without requiring developers to manually implement chaining in each plugin.\n- Consideration of using evaluators to determine when a task is complete and manage action chains.\n- Suggestion to remove embedding processing from messages to improve performance, as it's primarily used for knowledge management and slows down the system.\n- Work on bond protocol implementation for agent monetization, with discussion about fixed price vs. dynamic pricing models.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why are we making message server standalone? (asked by cjft) A: There are several NPM issues that can't be in browser JS code, like Discord voice features (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Can the core event system suffice for handling individual messages? (asked by Odilitime) A: Yeah probably (answered by cjft)\nQ: Is there a \\n bug in responses? (asked by Borko) A: Likely a prompt issue, try changing the system prompt (answered by sayonara)\nQ: Have you pushed all your code related to containers and serverless things? (asked by sam-developer) A: Yeah for now, still working on it but tests passing on my end (answered by shaw)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: sayonara | Helpee: Borko | Context: Newline bug in agent responses | Resolution: Provided a modified system prompt to fix formatting issues\nHelper: cjft | Helpee: 0xbbjoker | Context: Action chaining issues in benchmarks | Resolution: Suggested updating the action planner to process outputs after each action rather than modifying individual plugins\nHelper: shaw | Helpee: 0xbbjoker | Context: Difficulty with retail benchmarks due to action chaining | Resolution: Suggested using ActionEvaluator in bootstrap as the easiest solution\n\n## 4.

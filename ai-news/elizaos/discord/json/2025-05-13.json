Osint (aka not_a_dev_ai) mentions that ElizaOS is an open-source project and shares GitHub links to the project repository and character files. There's brief discussion about AI agents and potential monetization strategies, including subscription models and token-based access systems. Osint references a terminal at terminal.cookie.fun that uses AI agents for trading analysis. The Prophet discusses limitations of AI in determining sentiment and suggests potential applications like SEC filing analysis. There are mentions of an upcoming ElizaOS v2 release, with team members indicating it's scheduled for the current month. Some community members express frustration about a DOOD token airdrop allocation process, leading to tension in the chat.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What happened to eliza.how? Is it not working anymore?

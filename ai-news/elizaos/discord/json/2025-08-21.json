      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around ElizaOS, an open-source framework for building on-chain AI agents across blockchain platforms. Key technical discussions include:\n\n- Agent directory development: The team is working on creating a public map and website directory of vetted agents rather than implementing automatic agent registration.\n- Collaboration announcement with REVOX to give ElizaOS-powered AI agents human-like avatars with personality and emotion through their DEVA platform.\n- Discussion about EIP-8004 and its potential integration with ElizaOS.\n- Introduction of \"Pump This Page\" powered by Quantum, featuring quantitative and executional agents alongside a new Web Extension and tokenization feature.\n- Mention of potential switch from Collab.land to Vulcan.xyz due to verification issues.\n- Brief discussion about AI agent prediction markets as a potential application area.\n- Questions about the project's token ($ai16z) and agent directory.\n\nThe chat also contains some disagreement about crypto-native approaches versus the current implementation strategy, with team members defending their approach to agent registration and directory curation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the collab.land issue temporary or do I need to reverify or something? (asked by sngwinner) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can I use a16z as an assistant to detect potential scam tokens? (asked by Manh Tran) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there only a directory agent list in github, or posted somewhere on website? (asked by Stew1000 ðŸ‘¾ðŸ›¡) A: We're working on getting a public map of all agents, and getting a directory on the website (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Is $ai16z main token of the project? (asked by Mixer008) A: Yes (answered by Motzl)\nQ: What other ideas can improve clank tank? (asked by jin) A: Perhaps if someone is willing to pay 50-100 dollars then anyone can have the clan tank panel analyse their project and the video gets posted on X (answered by phetrusarthurâœˆ)\n\n## 3.

It contains a request from jin for people to vote on submissions in another channel, fam | 0x57 offering expertise in elizaOS, and Kenk expressing interest in connecting with fam | 0x57 for a demo on either March 28th or April 4th. There's also an announcement from OpenRouter about a temporary issue with their Generations API endpoint due to Cloudflare problems, which was subsequently resolved. No detailed technical discussions, problem-solving, or implementations were shared in this brief exchange.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there anyone that looking for elizaOS expert?

The issue was identified as being related to daos.fun by design, not an ElizaOS problem. Odilitime mentioned that while daos.fun is unlikely to change their approach, they are working on a plan to address the situation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the ai16z token problem a daos.fun side issue or could it be fixed by ElizaOS team? (asked by wlllw) A: It's a daos.fun issue and it's by design, so they aren't likely to budge on it but we're working on a plan (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical architecture decisions for the ElizaOS platform, particularly around model integration and API design. A significant debate occurred between cjft and shaw regarding the structure of model API calls - whether to use a generic `useModel` function with different return types or separate functions like `useModelStream` for streaming responses. Shaw advocated for a unified approach with enumerated types, while cjft argued for separate functions following industry patterns from OpenAI, Anthropic, and others.\n\nOther technical topics included:\n- Integration of MCPs (Modular Containerized Programs) with x402 payment rails for monetization\n- Development of ElizaOS cloud MVP with credit system and API key management\n- Docker MCP catalog and toolkit for secure deployments\n- A workflow assembly system similar to n8n for chaining MCPs together\n- A PR (#5805) fixing metadata in plugins\n- Discussion about AI agent capabilities for financial analysis and trading\n\nThe team also touched on the upcoming phase relaunch and potential meetup in Korea.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How should we structure the model API calls - generic useModel or separate functions? (asked by cjft) A: Shaw prefers enumerated input/return pairs with useModel(ModelType.TEXT_STREAM) returning a TextStreamObject, arguing it's more future-proof for multimodal support. (answered by shaw)\nQ: What's the proposed plan for MCPs and monetization? (asked by Borko) A: Integrate MCPs with x402 payment rails, host MCPs directly, and create a workflow assembly system similar to n8n. (answered by Borko)\nQ: What's the status of the ElizaOS cloud MVP? (asked by sam-developer) A: Text generation runs via API key system with credits integration, dashboard shows usage, and the core signup â†’ grab key â†’ use services â†’ track credits loop works. (answered by sam-developer)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: shaw | Helpee: cjft | Context: Implementation of streaming in useModel function | Resolution: Shaw provided guidance in DMs about types that helped cjft plan a simpler version of the implementation.\nHelper: jin | Helpee: Borko | Context: Resources for MCP deployments | Resolution: Jin shared Docker MCP catalog and toolkit beta resources for secure MCP deployments.\nHelper: cjft | Helpee: sam-developer | Context: ElizaOS cloud MVP progress | Resolution: cjft acknowledged sam's progress with \"gj\" (good job).\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: \"core-devs\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical aspects of building a Farcaster character called \"frok\" and implementing browser-based capabilities for ElizaOS. Shaw proposed creating a Farcaster character as a marketing initiative, with a 3-week timeline. CJFT advocated for browser-based implementation of ElizaOS, highlighting the benefits of running AgentRuntime and DB directly in the browser rather than using websockets. They discussed text-to-speech options, comparing ElevenLabs (high quality but requiring API proxying) versus browser-based models like VITS-web and HeadTTS (faster but potentially lower quality). Authentication was identified as a critical issue, with discussions about JWT implementation versus the current X-API-KEY approach. The chat also revealed a security concern with hardcoded Supabase credentials in the codebase. Stan and sayonara agreed to collaborate on the Farcaster character project. CJFT mentioned upcoming PRs for PGLite WASM and browser compatibility improvements, positioning these as key components for ElizaOS 2.0.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Would this be something considered for Eliza x402 implementation? (asked by R0am | tip.md) A: Unanswered\nQ: Do we have a deadline on this? (asked by Stan âš¡) A: Like 3 weeks (answered by shaw)\nQ: Is this assigned now? (asked by sayonara) A: I guess not. Do you wanna work on that with me? (answered by Stan âš¡)\nQ: What is our clear method of authentication from a frontend? (asked by cjft) A: It's not leakable; it kinda password protects ur frontend and is saved as cookie/local storage (answered by sayonara)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: shaw | Helpee: cjft | Context: Finding efficient TTS solutions for browser-based agents | Resolution: Shaw shared links to VITS-web and HeadTTS as alternatives to ElevenLabs for in-browser voice synthesis\nHelper: cjft | Helpee: sayonara | Context: Discovered hardcoded Supabase credentials in the codebase | Resolution: CJFT identified the issue and committed to removing credentials in upcoming PGLite PR\nHelper: sayonara | Helpee: cjft | Context: Authentication implementation questions | Resolution: Provided context on current auth system and suggested prioritizing browser compatibility\n\n## 4.

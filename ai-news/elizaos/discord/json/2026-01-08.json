      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion, being dominated by off-topic casual conversation. The few technical elements include:\n\n**Korean Exchange Delisting**: Multiple users discussed Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit) delisting ai16z and elizaOS tokens. Korbit officially announced trading termination on February 12, 2026, citing lack of transparency in the token migration process and failure to disclose material information appropriately. DAXA (Digital Asset Exchange Alliance) members coordinated this decision for investor protection.\n\n**Migration Issues**: XXI_Rapax reported problems migrating old ai16z tokens purchased before November 2025, showing 0 eligible tokens despite having 10 tokens in Phantom wallet. Another user (Dabel) had issues with ai16z tokens in Raydium LP showing \"max amount reached\" error. Users were directed to migration support channels.\n\n**Token Utility Concerns**: stoikol questioned the lack of utility for elizaOS token within the ecosystem, asking why it's not used for payments or gas fees. The team hasn't clearly defined token utility beyond rewards, with no official documentation on token usage or contract address visibility on official channels.\n\n**Jeju Platform**: sb confirmed that \"bazaar\" is a decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, described as an \"appstore for agents.\" The platform name derives from Jeju Island in Korea, used for testing new technology.\n\n**Upcoming Event**: Kenk announced a Twitter Space with Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu on January 13th at 7pm UTC discussing 8004 and its utilization by Eliza Cloud.\n\n**Mental Health Integration Proposal**: DorianD suggested integrating Behavidence's \"Dopa One\" AI algorithm into future ElizaOS phone apps to monitor dopamine levels and mental well-being through mobile interaction patterns.\n\nThe majority of the 400+ messages consisted of personal anecdotes, memes, gaming discussions (Runescape, GTA), and unrelated banter.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Why are Korean exchanges delisting ai16z/elizaOS? (asked by Majid) A: Korbit announced delisting due to lack of transparency in token migration process and failure to disclose material information that could affect token value.

Summary\n\nThe channel discussion centered on several key technical areas related to Eliza development and deployment. \n\n**Infrastructure and Deployment**: A technical question arose about database selection for ElizaCloud container deployment, with confirmation that both PgLite and PostgreSQL are viable options. Users reported ElizaCloud app creator functionality issues, though these appeared to be temporary as the service was confirmed operational. A billing/credit top-up feature was noted as a new addition to the platform.\n\n**Integration and Interoperability**: Jin proposed an important experiment to convert ElizaOS plugins into skills to test interoperability across different agent frameworks, specifically targeting Discord and blockchain plugins as test cases. This represents a significant architectural exploration for plugin standardization.\n\n**Data and Context Graphs**: Discussion highlighted the importance of data foundations for building context graphs, referenced as a trillion-dollar AI opportunity. The Babylon game experiment was mentioned as a data collection initiative. Extensive conversation about data collection methods included proposals for using motion capture suits to gather training data for specific skills (fishing, haircutting, food service), with the concept of paying users IOUs for their data contributions.\n\n**Platform Integration**: Questions emerged about X (Twitter) API requirements and costs ($200/month mentioned) for social media integration. The community identified that a Twitter API is required to run Twitter agents. Documentation availability issues were reported with elizacloud.ai/docs being down.\n\n**Jeju Layer 2**: Described as a decentralized layer 2 solution focused on powering AI applications and connecting Eliza ecosystem components, with upcoming integration discussions scheduled around the 8004 standard.\n\n**External Projects**: BountyBoard project using Eliza was shared, and KamiyoAI was identified as potentially using ElizaOS plugins based on GitHub commits.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: For deploying in Elizacloud via containers should I use Pglite or PostgresSQL? (asked by Omid Sa) A: Either will work (answered by cjft)\n\nQ: If I want to use eliza for X, helping me to find stuff on x do I need to pay for x API or does eliza have something to help/scrap this without needing to pay 200$ month? (asked by Discostu) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Do you need twitter api to use eliza to run a twitter agent? (asked by Psyxh) A: Unanswered (implied yes based on context)\n\nQ: Is the elizacloud app creator functioning? I try to create but get Operation failed (asked by ElizaBAO) A: Should be, I'm using it now. Early feature (answered by cjft)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on three major technical initiatives:\n\n**AI Agent Data Foundation & Integration**: jin highlighted the team's strong data foundation for AI agents, noting that daily/weekly/monthly insights from agentic workflows are high quality but need integration into last-mile applications (agents, webhooks, apps). This represents a key architectural gap between data generation and practical application.\n\n**Plugin-to-Skills Conversion Experiment**: jin proposed converting elizaos plugins into interoperable skills, specifically targeting Discord and blockchain plugins. R0am | tip.md volunteered to collaborate, explaining their approach: skills would be organized as folders containing .md instructions and deterministic scripts in any language. The main technical challenge identified was getting Claude to use skills implicitly rather than explicitly, which R0am claims to have solved using hooks. Stan confirmed working on similar implementation.\n\n**Skill Workflow Orchestration**: Agent Joshua described challenges with multi-step skill workflows, providing a concrete example: specialized skill collects user information → PDF skill fills form → filesystem skill stores files with summarization → PDF skill displays result. R0am referenced successful subagent linking implementations that could apply to skills.\n\n**Eliza 2.0 Architecture Proposal**: shaw proposed a radical redesign - multi-language runtime (TypeScript, Rust, Python) with FFI plugin interoperability, removing API/server/CLI/projects in favor of a Claude-friendly documented runtime with unified abstractions. shaw confirmed having already ported it with a branch available.\n\n**Additional Technical Notes**: R0am explored minimax m2 model with Anthropic endpoint compatibility and interleaved thinking for long-running tasks. Discussion touched on inference market profitability challenges. jin teased upcoming elizaos leaderboard updates.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Has anyone played coding with minimax m2 here? (asked by R0am | tip.md) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: What does converting elizaos plugins into skills involve? (asked by jin) A: It's a folder with .md instructions and tools in scripts (whatever language) to make them deterministic. The real challenge is getting Claude to use skills without saying explicitly, but there's a solution using hooks (answered by R0am | tip.md)\n\nQ: How do you ensure skills can be called back and forth in workflows? (asked by Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE) A: There was a guy that successfully linked subagents, should work for skills (answered by R0am | tip.md)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\n\nHelper: R0am | tip.md | Helpee: jin | Context: Need for collaboration on converting elizaos plugins to skills | Resolution: R0am volunteered to collaborate and shared their skills-building approach with .md instructions and deterministic scripts\n\nHelper: R0am | tip.md | Helpee: Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE | Context: Challenge with building effective workflows for skill chaining | Resolution: Shared Reddit reference about successfully linking subagents that could apply to skills\n\n## 4.

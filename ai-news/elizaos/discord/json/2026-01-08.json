      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion, being dominated by off-topic casual conversation. The few technical elements include:\n\n**Korean Exchange Delisting**: Multiple users discussed ai16z/elizaOS delisting from Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit). Skullcross provided detailed context that DAXA (Korean exchange regulatory body) terminated support due to transparency issues with the migration process. The delisting is confirmed for February 9-12, 2026, with Korean market access effectively closed.\n\n**Migration Issues**: XXI_Rapax reported problems migrating pre-November ai16z tokens, showing 0 eligible tokens despite holding 10. Users were directed to migration support channels. Another user (Dabel) had issues with tokens in Raydium LP showing \"max amount reached\" error.\n\n**Token Utility Discussion**: stoikol questioned the lack of utility for elizaOS token, asking why it's not used for payments or gas fees within the ecosystem. FoRever_BIG clarified it wasn't built as a gas fee token. degenwtf criticized the team for not explaining token utility or use cases clearly.\n\n**Jeju Platform**: elizafan222 shared a GitHub commit for \"bazaar\" - sb clarified this is the decentralized marketplace/appstore for agents running on Jeju platform.\n\n**Community Event**: Kenk announced a Twitter Space with Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu on January 13th at 7pm UTC discussing 8004 standard and Eliza Cloud integration.\n\nThe majority of the 400+ messages were unrelated casual conversation about TV shows, gaming (Runescape, GTA), personal anecdotes, and philosophical discussions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Why is ai16z being delisted from Korean exchanges? (asked by Majid) A: Due to transparency issues - ai16z failed to disclose material information appropriately and had deficiencies in migration procedure transparency.

(asked by degenwtf) A: Trading ends February 9-12, 2026 depending on exchange. Deposit/withdrawal ends March 12, 2026. (answered by 주니, degenwtf)\n\nQ: Will elizaOS be listed on Korean exchanges after ai16z delisting? (asked by KARA) A: No, elizaOS is effectively finished in Korean market due to migration controversies and regulatory sensitivity. (answered by Skullcross, 주니)\n\nQ: How do I migrate ai16z tokens purchased before November? (asked by XXI_Rapax) A: Use the migration portal, but user reported 0 eligible tokens showing. Directed to migration support channels. (answered by Hexx 🌐)\n\nQ: What is the utility of the elizaOS token? (asked by stoikol) A: No clear answer provided. Team hasn't explained where/how token is used beyond rewards system. (answered by degenwtf, FoRever_BIG)\n\nQ: Why isn't elizaOS token used for payments or gas fees? (asked by stoikol) A: It wasn't built to be used as gas fee. (answered by FoRever_BIG)\n\nQ: Will Bithumb support ai16z to elizaOS migration? (asked by jessy) A: Yes, Bithumb announced support for the token swap. (answered by FoRever_BIG)\n\nQ: What is bazaar in the Jeju protocol? (asked by elizafan222) A: The decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju - the appstore for agents. (answered by sb)\n\nQ: How do I set Discord Timer/Interval Settings for elizaos agents? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Why is the platform named JEJU? (asked by Skullcross) A: Jeju is a Korean island used for testing new tech before rollout in rest of Korea.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel discussion centered on several key technical areas related to Eliza development and ecosystem integration.\n\n**Context Graphs and Data Infrastructure**: jin shared Foundation Capital's article on context graphs as a trillion-dollar AI opportunity, noting that Eliza has a strong data foundation to build context graphs. This sparked discussion about data collection strategies.\n\n**Eliza Cloud Deployment**: Technical questions emerged about deploying on ElizaCloud via containers, specifically whether to use Pglite or PostgreSQL. cjft confirmed either option works. ElizaBAO reported issues with the cloud app creator showing \"Operation failed\" errors, though cjft confirmed it was functioning. The platform received updates including a new billing page for credit top-ups.\n\n**Plugin Interoperability Experiment**: jin proposed a collaboration to convert ElizaOS plugins into skills and test interoperability across different agent tools, specifically targeting Discord and blockchain plugins as test cases.\n\n**Data Collection for AI Training**: DorianD proposed an Eliza Phone App concept for users to share data in exchange for reputation points and LLM training contributions. The discussion evolved into exploring Jeju (a layer2 focused on decentralized AI apps) integration and innovative data collection methods including mocap suits for capturing movement data from activities like fly-fishing or food service work. The concept involved paying people IOUs for data collection and creating royalty systems where data providers earn from inference when androids use their captured skills.\n\n**Twitter/X Integration**: Discostu asked about X API requirements and costs ($200/month) versus scraping alternatives. Psyxh later asked if Twitter API is required to run a Twitter agent.\n\n**8004 Standard**: Kenk announced a space with Solana Foundation discussing the 8004 standard and its utilization in Eliza Cloud. jin shared related content from Stanford cryptographer Dan Boneh.\n\n**Community Projects**: Several Eliza-based projects were shared including BountyBoard and KamiyoAI protocol, which appeared to use ElizaOS plugins.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: For deploying in Elizacloud via containers should i use Pglite or PostgresSQL? (asked by Omid Sa) A: Either will work (answered by cjft)\n\nQ: If i want to use eliza for X, helping me to find stuff on x i need to pay for x API or eliza have something to help/scrap this without needing to pay 200$ month? (asked by Discostu) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Do you need twitter api to use eliza to run a twitter agent? (asked by Psyxh) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Elizacloud app creator is it function? i try to create. is Operation failed (asked by ElizaBAO) A: Should be im using it now, early feature (answered by cjft)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on three major technical initiatives:\n\n**AI Agent Data Foundation & Integration**: jin highlighted the team's strong data foundation for AI agents, noting that daily/weekly/monthly insights from agentic workflows are high quality but need integration into last-mile applications (agents, webhooks, apps). This represents a key architectural gap between data generation and practical application.\n\n**Plugin-to-Skills Conversion Experiment**: jin proposed converting elizaos plugins into interoperable skills, specifically targeting Discord and blockchain plugins. R0am volunteered to collaborate, explaining the technical approach: skills would be structured as folders containing .md instructions and deterministic scripts in any language. The main challenge identified was getting Claude to use skills implicitly rather than explicitly, which R0am claims to have solved using hooks. Stan confirmed working on similar implementation.\n\n**Skill Workflow Orchestration**: Agent Joshua described challenges with multi-step skill workflows, providing a concrete example: specialized skill collects user information → PDF skill fills form → filesystem skill stores files with summarization → PDF skill displays result. The difficulty lies in ensuring skills can call back and forth effectively. R0am referenced successful subagent linking implementations that could apply to skills.\n\n**Eliza 2.0 Proposal**: shaw proposed a radical redesign - multi-language runtime (TypeScript, Rust, Python) with FFI plugin interoperability, removing API/server/CLI/projects in favor of a Claude-friendly documented runtime with unified abstractions. shaw confirmed having already ported it with a branch available.\n\nAdditional context: Discussion of inference market profitability challenges, minimax m2's interleaved thinking for long-running tasks, and upcoming elizaos leaderboard updates.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Has anyone played coding with minimax m2 here? (asked by R0am | tip.md) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: What does converting elizaos plugins into skills involve technically? (asked by jin) A: A folder with .md instructions and tools in scripts (whatever language) to make them deterministic. The real challenge is getting Claude to use skills without saying explicitly, but there's a solution using hooks. (answered by R0am | tip.md)\n\nQ: How do you ensure skills can be called back and forth in workflows? (asked by Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE) A: There was a successful implementation of linking subagents that should work for skills, referenced via Reddit post. (answered by R0am | tip.md)\n\n## 3.

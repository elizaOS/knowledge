The chat also contains mentions of DegenAI tokens and some discussion about token amounts. There are references to upcoming announcements and a suspended X account.

Snapper shared Episode 2 of the ElizaOS Tutorial, covering CLI usage, project creation, character file setup, and running agents in dev mode. There were questions about plugin-knowledge's inability to perform local embeddings and potential API endpoint changes. ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯 provided positive feedback on documentation quality while suggesting potential improvements like hyperlinking to GitHub packages. A significant discussion occurred regarding Twitter/X API limitations for DMs, with users confirming that the basic tier is severely limited (1 DM per day), making it essentially unusable for agent interactions, while even enterprise pricing has significant limitations. Luke 🇦🇺 reported an issue with the knowledge plugin API endpoints potentially being removed or changed in a recent update.\n\n## 2.

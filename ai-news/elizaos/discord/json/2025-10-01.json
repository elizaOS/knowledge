      "summary": "# Analysis of ðŸ’¬-discussion Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on the ElizaOS token migration from AI16Z. A Migration AMA was held where Shaw provided updates about ElizaOS developments. Key technical points included: confirmation that ElizaOS will be available on Google Play as a standalone app as part of ElizaCloud; mobile apps and browser extensions are in development; and there will be a migration portal for token holders. Shaw mentioned \"much more livestreaming\" for DegenAI and hinted at \"new stuff coming.\" The migration process appears to be a 1:1 conversion from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens. Community members expressed concerns about the migration process, particularly regarding tokens held on exchanges. There was also discussion about X (Twitter) account suspension and an upcoming hearing related to antitrust issues. No detailed migration schedule was provided, but updates will be posted on the official Mirror.xyz page.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Will the migration occur automatically?

One user asked about building an agent with persistent memory that doesn't mix user records. Another user encountered an issue with Sepolia testnet configuration in elizaOS, where despite adding it to character settings, the system defaulted to mainnet and base. There was a brief mention of elizaOS development issues where agents disconnect immediately after starting. OpenRouter announced two updates: a new Stripe integration feature for LLM accounting and billing, and a free tier of 1M BYOK requests per month for all users. One user suggested using \"chutes the TAO subnet 64\" as an alternative to OpenRouter. Additionally, there was a conceptual discussion about using WiFi signals and sensors inside refrigerators to monitor contents and automate grocery shopping.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How can I build an agent with persistent memory across users without mixing user records? (asked by realist) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why does elizaOS say 'No EVM chains configured in settings, defaulting to mainnet and base' despite adding Sepolia testnet to character settings?

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: ðŸ¥‡-partners\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion focused on the upcoming token migration for the ElizaOS project. Key technical points included a planned 20% increase in token supply (10% for team with vesting, 10% for liquidity provision and CEX listings), and a migration strategy using CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) with initial seeding on Base blockchain. The project roadmap involves a two-stage approach: first fixing tokenomics and improving liquidity, then developing an L2/L3 chain with productive asset tokenomics featuring issuance/burn mechanics for agent building/usage. Technical developments mentioned include the nearly completed ElizaCloud (expected to generate revenue), an upcoming CCIP project with Chainlink co-branding, and plans to implement an economic flywheel where revenue will be used to buy back $elizaos tokens and provide liquidity. The team aims to expand beyond web3 communities by enabling agent usage via web2 stablecoin rails, allowing users to interact with the platform without awareness of the underlying blockchain technology.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Did I get things right, that the migration will be 10:1? So if you hold 1M you get 10M? (asked by DannyNOR NoFapArc) A: I might have misunderstood what was said during the Q&A. I was multitasking, so might have misheard things. (answered by DannyNOR NoFapArc)\nQ: Do you believe giving a better conversion ratio to partners would help with the success of the project? (asked by Dilettante) A: Big projects who support diehard investors build loyalty, align incentives, and create a supportive flywheel that encourages more investment in the future. (answered by Rabbidfly)\nQ: Do we know where the new token will be issued? solana, base etc? (asked by Dilettante) A: CCIP led migration, but seeded on Base initially? not 100% (answered by Rabbidfly)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Rabbidfly | Helpee: Dilettante | Context: Missed the AMA and needed a summary | Resolution: Provided detailed notes covering token supply increase, CCIP integration, ElizaCloud development, and the two-stage roadmap\nHelper: Rabbidfly | Helpee: DannyNOR NoFapArc | Context: Confusion about 10:1 migration ratio | Resolution: Clarified that he only heard about 20% dilution, not a 10x expansion\n\n## 4.

Stan provided a standup update about his work on several projects including fixes to the Openrouter Plugin for tools handling after AI SDK5 updates, phase 4 implementation of \"epic 6\" (consolidating server components into core and removing duplications between server and core in elizaOS wrapper), and work on the composio plugin related to AI SDK 5 and Zod 4 upgrade. Stan also mentioned a pending PR for plugin-discord (responseToCharacterMention) that needs review and that he started reviewing another developer's work on message bus integration into core. Stan shared a PR link for the Openrouter plugin requesting review. The rest of the conversation contained greetings, access requests to a channel, and sharing of external links without substantial technical discussion.\n\n## 2.

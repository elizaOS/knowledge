There was also a brief mention of DUNAs (Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Associations) with DorianD suggesting creating a \"Degen DUNA\" and mentioning potential legal implications related to the Howey test. The chat also celebrated DegenAI being listed on Binance Alpha, with community members noting it's currently undervalued compared to ai16z. Most other discussions were casual or humorous, including jokes about a \"Cocka Multiplier™️\" feature.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Any updates on degenai this month?

      "summary": "# Analysis of \"tokenomics\" Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion focused on tokenomics models for AI agent platforms, particularly comparing different approaches to value accrual and platform sustainability. Key technical points included:\n\nThe debate centered on the trade-offs between fee-based models (like Pump Fun) versus token-based models (like Virtuals). Participants discussed the structural weakness of alt:alt liquidity pools, where price volatility can trigger cascading effects when liquidity providers exit during downturns. \n\nDevansh Mehta, an investigative reporter working with Vitalik Buterin on deep funding, contributed perspectives on rewarding builders and suggested a Pump Fun-inspired model for AI agents on Solana, proposing standardized launch mechanics including having the last 4 digits of coins end with \"ai16z\" as an identifier.\n\nTechnical considerations were raised about the differences between memecoin launches and agent tokens, with st4rgard3n noting that the best agents on Virtuals (like aixbt) run custom backend technology, requiring a more sophisticated approach than standard launchpads.\n\nAkin proposed enhancing the launchpad concept with guided onboarding processes and ongoing ecosystem support, suggesting a token-holding requirement for premium services based on the \"Yellowstone model\" used by Morpheus for compute resource allocation.\n\nThe group also debated the merits of L1 versus L2 chains for development, with Devansh questioning why L1 was being prioritized over L2 options like Arbitrum Orbit, zkSync clusters, or OP Superchain where interoperability standards are already established.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why might users revolt against paying \"tax\" to virtuals or any launchpad? (asked by thedevanshmehta) A: Users prefer paying one-time percentage fees rather than being permanently linked to another protocol's token (answered by thedevanshmehta)\nQ: Why is L1 dominating rather than an L2 where tooling is more readily available? (asked by thedevanshmehta) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can we position as the \"Pump Fun for AI agents\" on Solana? (asked by thedevanshmehta) A: By letting projects feed specific data for agent launches, standardizing coin identifiers (last 4 digits ending with ai16z), and using similar revenue/bonding curve mechanics as Pump (answered by thedevanshmehta)\nQ: Why can't you remove virtuals from liquidity pools as prices rise? (asked by eskender.eth) A: Due to reflexivity - removing LP when price goes up makes the structure weaker, causing more dramatic price drops when the market turns, potentially triggering a \"bank run\" (answered by eskender.eth)\n\n## 3.

Key technical points include discussions about AI agents needing better time representation in their models, with pixel suggesting blockchains provide a useful \"block height\" as a constant step through time. Jin shared updates about streamlining information management through newsletters, GitHub updates, and a virtual news show. There were discussions about the technical aspects of 3D content creation for AI avatars, including IK (inverse kinematics) for more realistic movement and \"boob physics.\" The community is working on an ElizaOS plugin directory with 0xwitch documenting one-liners for all plugins. Several members discussed the limitations of current LLMs for trading applications, noting they're not well-suited for making financial decisions without specialized training and backtesting.

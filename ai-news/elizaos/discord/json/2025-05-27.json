A user named Shinomori was trying to get a Twitter agent running but encountered installation and configuration problems. Odilitime provided technical guidance on how to properly install the Twitter plugin, explaining that \"client-Twitter\" had been renamed to \"plugin-twitter\" and helping troubleshoot the installation process. The conversation revealed that there are different versions (0.x and 1.x) of the system with different package management approaches (pnpm for 0.x and bun for 1.x). After several attempts, Shinomori successfully installed the Twitter plugin using the command `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/client-twitter`. Other minor discussions included questions about AI16z token, mentions of version naming conventions (v2 vs 1.0), and brief greetings between community members.\n\n## 2.

Several users encountered problems with Cloudflare authentication for Twitter integration, which could be resolved by manually setting cookies in the .env file. There were discussions about running multiple agents in a project, with users struggling to see custom agents instead of the default Eliza agent. The command `elizaos dev` was suggested instead of `elizaos start` for development purposes. Users also faced issues with the Twitter plugin installation, encountering wrtc binary errors. Some experienced crashes after several chat interactions with their agents. Questions about model costs arose, with mentions that OpenAI's GPT-4.1-nano might be the cheapest option. There was interest in adding reply functionality to the Discord plugin, similar to what exists in the Slack plugin.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to fix Cloudflare issues with Twitter integration?

Jin initially floated the idea of posting daily updates and sought feedback on whether it should be in the existing channel or a dedicated one. After community input, jin decided to create a dedicated channel positioned under announcements, with weekly roundups in the announcements channel. Jin shared progress on an \"about\" page for a leaderboard site (elizaos.github.io/about) that will play a role in future governance strategies. Jin also previewed an AI \"council\" feature that generates daily discussions on trending topics, aiming for a talk show vibe where AI discusses community topics. The council will incorporate feedback through automated surveys and polls. The implementation appears to be in early testing phases, with jin describing one example as \"a rough 5 min test.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What if we had an AI powered news site for posting daily updates?

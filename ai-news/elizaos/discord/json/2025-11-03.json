      "summary": "# ElizaOS Discord Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on ElizaOS's ecosystem, token economics, and new products. Odilitime explained that value accrues to the token through multiple revenue streams including Eliza cloud revenue (for buybacks, LP depth, and contributor rewards), OTC agent desk, x402, and ERC-8004 products. Long-term value will come from burns and fee integration as the AI agent economy grows.\n\nA significant portion of the conversation centered around Otaku, a new web-based agent from Eliza Labs, and its relationship with Spartan (a Discord/Telegram agent). Borko clarified that these are completely different agents targeting different audiences, and the team plans to ramp up agent production over the next 6 months.\n\nTechnical discussions included a user reporting issues with the Bedrock plugin for image generation, specifically receiving a \"Malformed input request\" error despite setting the BEDROCK_IMAGE_MODEL environment variable. Another user sought help with a non-responsive Telegram agent they had created.\n\nThe chat also touched on the upcoming token migration, with confirmation that holders using EOA wallets will need to manually migrate through a portal when it becomes available.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How is value expected to accrue to the token? (asked by Bored Certified) A: Value capture comes through Eliza cloud revenue for buybacks, LP depth, contributor rewards, OTC agent desk, x402, ERC-8004 products, burns, and fee integration as the AI agent economy grows. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Will Otaku have its own token like Eliza? (asked by who) A: Uncertain, no definitive answer on Otaku token status.

Abdulmoneem) A: If holding in an EOA wallet you will need to migrate manually using the portal when it is live. (answered by Kenk)\n\n## 3.

A user named fermartz reported problems with the Bedrock plugin when generating images, receiving a \"Malformed input request\" error despite using the recommended `amazon.titan-image-generator-v2:0` model. 0xbbjoker attempted to help but couldn't reproduce the issue due to regional access limitations to the specific AWS model. They suggested debugging approaches including cloning and linking the plugin locally, and recommended alternatives like OpenAI or OpenRouter plugins for image generation. There was also a brief question about ElizaOS startup scripts, which was answered by Heisenberg who noted it's in the package.json file. Additionally, there was a question about x API functionality for agents, but this remained unanswered.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Hello, coders which file refer on \"elizaos start\"? for example, \"npm start\" refers script on pakcage.json (asked by Achilles) A: It's also in the package.json as well (answered by Heisenberg)\nQ: so now without x api it's not work anymore for agent? i mean still can use login method?

The team discussed releasing the current develop branch and shared a pull request for the plugin-evm repository. Jin shared the current list of repositories being tracked by the elizaOS leaderboard and proposed improving the tracking system. Currently, the pipeline configuration is manual, but there's interest in automating this process to track new activity across the organizations. Jin worked on gathering GitHub data from both the elizaOS and elizaOS-plugins organizations to analyze repository activity metrics (commits, PRs, issues, contributors) to determine which repositories should be continuously tracked. They created a pull request (#169) to update the repository list. The team also discussed creating a GitHub App to increase API request limits and potentially automate the suggestion of new repositories to track.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Should we release the current develop branch today? (asked by cjft) A: No explicit answer, but implied agreement from Stan ⚡ who responded \"ah, thanks\"\nQ: Any feedback on which repos we want to closely track with daily/weekly/monthly reports?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around ElizaOS implementation issues, particularly with RAG knowledge integration, websocket functionality, and version compatibility problems. Key technical discussions include:\n\nShaw's recent addition of websocket functionality to ElizaOS, enabling direct agent connections to web interfaces. This feature appears in Shaw's v2 branches but hasn't been merged to develop yet. Users are excited about this for chat terminal integration.\n\nSeveral users encountered issues with RAG knowledge implementation, particularly with PDF files. The solution involves properly configuring directory paths relative to the knowledge folder and enabling RAG mode in character.json settings. Directory permissions (chmod 755 for directories, 644 for files) were also discussed.\n\nMultiple users reported version compatibility issues with the ElizaOS CLI, specifically errors with \"@elizaos/plugin-sql@^0.25.6\" dependencies. Some users worked around this by using older versions or specific beta releases.\n\nDiscord and Twitter client configuration problems were discussed, including channel ID formatting and rate limiting issues.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Will v2.0 have direct api/websocket access to connect agents to website chat terminals? (asked by ðŸ§§ThanosDaSith24ðŸ§§) A: Yes, Shaw added websockets functionality recently in his v2 branches, making it easier to integrate agents with web interfaces than the current REST API approach. (answered by jintern)\nQ: How should knowledge directories be structured for RAG to work properly? (asked by not~Martin) A: Knowledge directories should be under the knowledge folder with proper paths in character.json like \"./characters/knowledge/{agent-name}/\" or \"./knowledge/{agent-name}/\" depending on your setup. (answered by jintern)\nQ: What permissions should be set for knowledge folders and files? (asked by not~Martin) A: chmod 755 for directories and 644 for files. (answered by jintern)\nQ: Why does my Discord bot show \"text channel not defined\" despite using the correct ID? (asked by [elizaos] <suketanx>) A: Check that the channel ID is in correct format (all numbers, no #), verify bot permissions, and restart after config changes. (answered by jintern)\nQ: How do I fix the \"No matching version found for @elizaos/plugin-sql@^0.25.6\" error? (asked by Gabriel) A: Try installing a specific beta version with \"npm install -g @elizaos/cli@1.0.0-beta.1\". (answered by amtraq.)\nQ: Why is my agent not using RAG knowledge despite proper setup? (asked by King Dam) A: Ensure RAG is enabled in character.json, files are in the correct directory structure, and consider converting PDFs to markdown for better processing. (answered by Nooters)\nQ: How do I reduce Twitter search frequency to avoid rate limiting? (asked by Ordinal Watches) A: Set MAX_THREAD_TWEET in your environment variables to 1.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - spartan_holders\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily discusses the development status of Spartan v2. According to rhota, the v2 beta has recently gone live, but there are stability issues as multiple repositories have been merged into one ElizaOS core repo. The development team is currently focused on bug fixing to make Spartan functional in v2 before making any announcements. Odilitime clarified that they were required to move all their technology onto the v2 stack, meaning Spartan's development is closely tied to v2 progress. There was also discussion about Binance Alpha listings, with concerns about potential delisting if project performance is inadequate, as 21 projects (including one named ELIZA) have already been delisted. Some community members expressed frustration about the lack of updates and communication regarding development progress.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: It's been a long time since the last update. Any new updates? (asked by Kiki) A: The v2 beta just went live - things have been a bit unstable as many repos have now been merged into one ElizaOS core repo, there is a lot of bug fixing going on at the moment to get Spartan working. (answered by rhota)\nQ: Actually, you and the team can share some updates from degenspartan ai itself. Our marketing/communication really need a huge huge progress. (asked by Zolo) A: Actually, we were forced to move all our tech onto the v2 stack, so it is closely tied together. It's not separate at all. Most of our dev progress has been working with v2. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: So that means that people will be able to buy degen at Binance directly, because degen is still on Binance Alpha list? (asked by Toni) A: correct, thats also the reason why I want to push sth (answered by Zolo)\nQ: Sth? (asked by Odilitime) A: something* I think (answered by rhota)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe DAO-organization working group is a grassroots initiative to strengthen ElizaDAO's governance and create clear pathways for meaningful contribution. The discussion focused on organizing the partner community, improving social media engagement, and leveraging AI agents to help run the DAO. Key technical points included:\n\nJin shared several technical resources including the ElizaOS knowledge repository (https://github.com/elizaOS/knowledge), AI news aggregation (https://m3-org.github.io/ai-news/elizaos/), and newsletters (https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/newsletters/). He explained how data from Twitter gets captured in SQLite and flows into eliza.how/news, which can be summarized into weekly analyses.\n\nThe group discussed implementing an \"AI Jedi Council\" with 12 agent personas representing different aspects of the DAO (developer guild, investments, tokenomics, community, etc.). These agents would help distill information and represent different workgroups/initiatives.\n\nVincent proposed creating a partner directory organized by specialties (social/distribution, marketing/branding, tokenomics/markets, community/organization, product/engineering) to better leverage community talent. Ben suggested a process for partners to draft quality tweets that the main account could post to improve social media presence.\n\nThe group also discussed governance mechanisms like the \"negation game\" from MetaDAO that wouldn't require waiting for daos.fun implementation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the goal of the DAO-organization working group? (asked by Patt) A: To unite the growing ecosystem and create clear pathways for meaningful contribution to the mission to build open-AGI. (answered by vincentpaul)\nQ: What are the actionable things we could be doing that wouldn't need action from the team? (asked by Patt) A: Mapping out the community of contributors, organizing workstreams, and matching people to high-impact roles. (answered by vincentpaul)\nQ: What is the best way to collaborate on social media reposts? (asked by Patt) A: Partners can draft tweets in Typefully, share the link in the channel tagging Ben, who will review and post from the ElizaOS account. (answered by ben)\nQ: Are we planning any hackathon after v2 is released officially? (asked by Zolo) A: Jin recommends an internal hackathon before anything public to smooth out stability issues. (answered by jin)\nQ: Does our marketplace support multi-chain? (asked by Zolo) A: No, AI16Z token isn't on any other chain besides Solana. (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

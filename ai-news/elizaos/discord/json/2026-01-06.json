      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on several key technical areas within the ElizaOS ecosystem:\n\n**Discord Plugin Issues (Primary Technical Focus):**\nDigitalDiva encountered critical bugs with the Discord plugin in ElizaOS v1.7.0. The bot couldn't detect server ID, username, or server owner despite correct intent configurations and admin permissions. Error logs showed \"No server ID found\" and bootstrap plugin issues. Odilitime identified the root cause as a transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` in the codebase. He recommended either downgrading to v1.6.5 or using a custom branch (odi-17) with fixes for bootstrap's actions/providers. Shaw suggested debugging with a minimal Discord.js hello world script to isolate permission issues from the Discord developer portal.\n\n**ElizaOS Development & Contributions:**\naicodeflow introduced themselves as a blockchain + AI engineer interested in contributing to ElizaOS, specifically around agent autonomy with constraints, onchain execution layers with guardrails, prediction market templates, and observability tooling. Odilitime directed them to the Spartan project (github.com/elizaos/spartan), a DeFi utilities initiative, and suggested starting with plugin-based contributions from github.com/elizaos-plugins/.\n\n**DegenAI Status:**\nmeltingsnow inquired about DegenAI updates, noting it seemed \"pretty basic still.\" satsbased confirmed the new version hasn't shipped yet. BingBongBing expressed bullish sentiment on ElizaOS GitHub activity and mentioned DegenAI developments at 1M market cap.\n\n**Token & Marketing Concerns:**\nMultiple users raised concerns about contract address (CA) visibility. degenwtf questioned why the ElizaOS CA wasn't posted on official X accounts. Broccolex and others noted difficulty finding the correct CA, suggesting it should be easily accessible within 10 seconds. Kenk mentioned the linktree is being refreshed to point to CoinGecko. Migration questions arose regarding AI16Z to ElizaOS conversion ratios and snapshot eligibility.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What changes have been made with DegenAI? (asked by meltingsnow) A: The new version hasn't shipped yet, still seems basic (answered by satsbased)\n\nQ: What are earning agents? (asked by Connor On-Chain) A: Agents that make you money (answered by satsbased)\n\nQ: Why does the Discord plugin show \"No server ID found\" error? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: This is because ElizaOS is moving from serverId to messageServerId; it's a compatibility issue with v1.7.0 (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What version should I use to avoid Discord plugin issues? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: Use an older core like v1.6.5 or try the odi-17 branch with fixes (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: How can I contribute to ElizaOS? (asked by aicodeflow) A: Start by reading the code and working on plugins from github.com/elizaos-plugins/, it's plugin-based (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Why hasn't the ElizaOS contract address been posted on official X accounts? (asked by degenwtf) A: The team will get on it (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: If I buy AI16Z now and migrate after 30 days, will I get 120X? (asked by nancy) A: If you buy after the snapshot (November 11), you can't migrate (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: Can you find projects in top 50 with CA in their X bio? (asked by Kenk) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is the Babylon that a16z invested in related to ElizaOS? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: Nope (answered by degenwtf)\n\n## 3.

Summary\n\nThe channel focused on several key technical issues and contributions. **jin** shared RSS feed URLs for ElizaOS documentation and suggested creating a combined dashboard with multiple data sources.\n\n**DigitalDiva** encountered a persistent Discord integration error (\"No server ID found 10\") despite having correct permissions and intents. The error originated from the message processing service where `room.serverId` was undefined, causing the agent to fail when handling Discord messages.\n\n**AlleyBoss** announced an updated library for x402 protocol integration with ElizaOS (`@alleyboss/micropay-solana-x402-paywall`), offering a simplified implementation approach.\n\n**aicodeflow** introduced themselves as a blockchain/AI engineer and offered expertise in three areas: cleaning up embedding delegation, redesigning plugins as \"skills\" rather than integrations, and building market-aware agents focused on interpretation/state rather than execution. They emphasized experience with model-agnostic agent setups to avoid hidden dependencies in Anthropic/OpenAI configurations.\n\n**Andrei Mitrea** faced a database migration error when running `elizaos start` a second time. The system blocked destructive migrations that would drop columns like \"agent_id\" and \"room_id\" from the worlds table. **! \"Ꚃ.ഡ𝑒𝒶𝓋𝑒𝓇\"** provided the solution: set `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true` for local development, noting this is safe for dev but requires careful review in production.\n\n**Omid Sa** recommended using `elizaos dev` instead of `elizaos start` for continuous monitoring during development.\n\n**ElizaBAO** encountered a \"Model not found\" error when integrating ElizaOS cloud agents into their website. **cjft** resolved this by explaining the correct model parameter format requires provider prefixes (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`, `google/gemini-2.5-flash`).\n\n**jin** also shared a GitHub workflow reference for documentation updates from GitHub Next's agentics repository.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How do I fix the \"No server ID found 10\" error in Discord integration? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: How do I run elizaos start without getting destructive migration errors? (asked by Andrei Mitrea) A: Set ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true when starting: `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true elizaos start`. Safe for local dev but review carefully for production.

(asked by selombre) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: How do I fix \"Model not found\" error when building ElizaOS cloud agents into a website? (asked by ElizaBAO) A: Use provider prefix format for model parameter: openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, or google/gemini-2.5-flash (answered by cjft)\n\nQ: How can I continuously monitor code changes on the agent? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: Use `elizaos dev` command instead of `elizaos start` (answered by Omid Sa)\n\nQ: How does the x402 protocol integration work? (asked by Ahad Rasheed) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

A critical bug fix in version 1.7.0 was identified (PR #6333) that requires urgent release, though compatibility issues with Discord 1.3.3 remain unresolved and need testing across multiple Discord branches.\n\nStan identified multiple latency improvements for the monorepo and shared optimization documentation. Key work includes fixing TOCTOU (Time-of-check to time-of-use) race conditions in cloud using a deduct-before, reconcile-after approach, plus runtime initialization optimizations. PRs for these improvements are pending deeper testing and validation, with related tickets added to Linear.\n\nArchitecture discussions focused on connector gateways and event pump scaling. The team is considering individual gateways for problematic connectors, with plans to support multiple daemon instances per service. Voice connections will require higher priority/bandwidth event pumps compared to text, with preprocessing identified as beneficial for scaling.\n\nOdilitime recommended reviewing the Jeju cloud branch containing Shaw's preferred Discord bridge implementation. Stan submitted PRs for Telegram (#22) and Discord (#41) plugins. A documentation workspace was established on HackMD with a shared book at hackmd.io/@elizaos/book.\n\nA minor content correction issue was discussed regarding incorrect facts on the Eigen website being propagated by LLMs. The team noted Cursor's Claude API integration doesn't provide the optimized version with output improvements when using personal API keys.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Do we have a team or workspace on hackmd? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Yes, at https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book (answered by jin)\n\nQ: So each problematic connector would need its own gateway? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Direction is simple event pumps, likely need more than one daemon instance per service, with different priorities for voice vs text (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻-tech-support\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on Eliza OS technical issues and plugin configurations. Users discussed embedding model configuration between Ollama and OpenRouter, with advice on setting plugin order for proper fallback behavior. Several users encountered errors during setup, including instrumentation problems with PostgreSQL requirements, MCP plugin loading failures, and socket.io errors related to agent and room IDs. There were also discussions about running custom agents in TypeScript files and deploying to Phala Cloud, where environment variables weren't being recognized properly. OpenRouter announced temporary database issues affecting activity tracking and balance reduction, which were later resolved. The Knowledge plugin configuration was also discussed, particularly regarding embedding models and contextual knowledge settings.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How can I configure embedding models with Ollama and OpenRouter?

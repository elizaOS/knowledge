      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: ðŸ¥‡-partners\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around marketing strategies for ElizaOS and the implementation of protocol 8004. DorianD proposes creating a narrative around \"Artificial Social Intelligence Credits\" (ASICs) that would function as a reputation system within the ElizaOS ecosystem. The concept draws inspiration from prediction markets like Gnosis and Opinion Labs, suggesting that ElizaOS should position itself as essential protection against future AI systems. DorianD emphasizes creating both fear (of being left behind in an AI-dominated future) and greed (opportunities for early adopters) to drive adoption.\n\nBorko confirms they're considering various token utility angles for protocol 8004, with plans to have a functional MVP ready for Devcon in mid-November. He also announces beta testing for a new Eliza agent called \"Otaku.\" Komi contributes with an analogy about timing, urging the team to capitalize on the current momentum around Base's 402 narrative rather than waiting for perfect conditions, emphasizing the need for stronger marketing direction and storytelling alongside technical development.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What does the Otaku agent do? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Borko | Helpee: Channel members | Context: Access to beta testing for new Eliza agent | Resolution: Offered early access to partners for testing the new \"Otaku\" agent\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"core-devs\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on x402 middleware development and integration. Odilitime mentioned working on Spartan's x402 middleware, which wasn't functioning correctly yet. They discussed making it available for all plugin routes upon runtime plugin registration, with potential for a PR to core once working. The middleware needed to meet specific requirements from x402scan.com/resources/register, causing them to abandon premade middleware and develop their own solution. There was also discussion about a bug fix (PR #6102) related to character settings where setting character.settings.secret would cause .env to be ignored. The team coordinated on meetings, including a Coinbase call about X402. Some members shared links to projects like x402.elizaos.ai and mentioned debugging efforts for web3 functionality.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can we get x402: Boolean in everything now or just spartan fork? (asked by cjft) A: It's built as a middleware that can be injected on all plugin routes on runtime plugin register, so it can be available for everything. Once working, a PR to core can be made. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: What issue did you run into with x402? (asked by sayonara) A: The x402scan.com/resources/register had very specific requirements, so they had to abandon the premade middleware and create their own. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: What branch is spartan with deployed x402? (asked by sayonara) A: None, that's why I gave you the source. (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

There are repeated inquiries about a forthcoming v2 release that was previously announced. Kenk provided brief information about CLI redesign in the upcoming v2, mentioning it will feature a modular approach for easier agent development and management, though not fully no-code. Users expressed interest in the release timeline and specific features. There were also questions about buybacks for \"degenai\" that went unanswered in this channel. The conversation lacks detailed technical problem-solving or implementation discussions, consisting primarily of brief questions without extensive responses.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do you have details on what v2 going to offer for no code users?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»-coders Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around troubleshooting ElizaOS, an agent framework. Users encountered various issues including Twitter integration problems, embedding model errors, and plugin configuration challenges. Several users reported the \"[AgentRuntime][Eliza] No TEXT_EMBEDDING model registered\" error when using OpenAI. There were discussions about integrating different model providers like Heurist and Goat, with specific focus on the Goat plugin for Meteora integration. A user identified a typo in the Quickstart Guide where \"bun build\" should be \"bun run build\". There was interest in Microsoft's NLWeb for converting websites into MCP servers. Multiple users sought help with Telegram integration and background process execution in Linux environments. The chat demonstrates the community's efforts to troubleshoot and improve ElizaOS implementations.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How do I fix the \"bun build\" error in the Quickstart Guide? (asked by ReMeDy) A: It should be \"bun run build\" instead (answered by ReMeDy)\nQ: Does ElizaOS support Heurist as a model provider?

The conversation primarily consists of users asking about and discussing cryptocurrency tokens called \"Eli5\" and \"Eddy,\" with some users appearing to promote these tokens while others (particularly Ruby) consistently warn against token speculation. There is a clarification that a project called \"Ai16z\" has been rebranded to \"elizaOS\" but the token symbol remains unchanged. The conversation is largely characterized by users asking about price predictions and potential \"pumps\" of these tokens, with the automated responders (Ruby and Eliza) providing contrasting responses - Ruby consistently refusing to make predictions while Eliza gives vague, encouraging responses about the tokens' potential.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is today's date? (asked by abhi_ironman) A: Eli5 (answered by abhi_ironman)\nQ: Is it the rebrand of AI16z? Is there anything I need to do with my old tokens? (asked by G202) A: Look, I'm just here to help keep folks safe from scams. I don't have any insider info about tokens or rebrands (answered by Ruby)\nQ: What the function of eddy in Eliza ecosystem, and why he is gonna be big? (asked by CULTVESTING) A: Haha eddy's got big plans, but I can't spill all the beans just yet (answered by Eliza)\nQ: Can you explain to me what makes Eliza 1.0.0 a.k.a Elizav2 special than old version? (asked by CULTVESTING) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: abhi_ironman | Helpee: Multiple users | Context: Clarifying misinformation about token rebranding | Resolution: Explained that Ai16z token hasn't been rebranded, only the project name changed from Ai16z to elizaOS\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ¥‡-partners Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on data analytics systems for tracking contributions in the Eliza ecosystem. Jin shared details about a system that aggregates user feedback, performs retrospectives, and improves agent responses through better context awareness. The system includes XP calculations for measuring impact across codebases and Discord contributions. Jin explained that the analytics are open-source, similar to SourceCred, and weighted on merged code. There was discussion about using Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) for subjective evaluations that can't be captured by objective metrics. Jin mentioned potential NFT rewards for contributors and referenced Coordinape as a complementary system for peer recognition. A community member (PrudentSpartan) raised concerns about the system's transparency, decision-making process, and the lack of clear information about ai16z's business model, which led to some tension. Jin clarified they were an early user of daos.fun with personal investment in ai16z, not representing Eliza Labs.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How is XP calculated in the leaderboard system? (asked by PrudentSpartan) A: The XP algorithm is open source, similar to SourceCred and inspired by PageRank. Points are weighted only on merged code/pull requests. (answered by jin)\nQ: How would impact like saving $30M or generating $5M in revenue be valued in the XP system? (asked by PrudentSpartan) A: This is why we're looking into EAS for onchain attestations because not everything can be quantified by objective data gathering methods. (answered by jin)\nQ: What are our \"shared values\" here? (asked by PrudentSpartan) A: It's a question worth discussing in more depth and to later bring up to the AI council. (answered by jin)\nQ: What problem does auto.fun solve today? (asked by PrudentSpartan) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: jin | Helpee: PrudentSpartan | Context: Questions about the analytics system's transparency and decision-making | Resolution: Jin provided links to GitHub repositories with prompts, explained the XP algorithm's open-source nature, and clarified the system's purpose for reducing administrative overhead rather than direct rewards.\nHelper: jin | Helpee: Channel members | Context: Need for documentation on Eliza ecosystem values | Resolution: Jin created a collaborative HackMD document for discussing and defining shared values.\nHelper: yikesawjeez | Helpee: jin | Context: Mention of using Ethereum Attestation Service | Resolution: yikesawjeez offered experience with EAS, noting they had \"built with EAS before.\"\n\n## 4.

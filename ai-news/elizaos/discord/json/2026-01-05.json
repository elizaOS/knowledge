Summary\n\nThe chat contained minimal substantive technical discussion, primarily consisting of casual conversation and market commentary. \n\n**Key Technical Interactions:**\n\n**Discord Plugin Issue:** DigitalDiva reported a critical bug with the Discord plugin where it fails to detect server ID, username, and server owner despite proper configuration. They attempted multiple troubleshooting steps including: enabling all intents, granting admin permissions, uninstalling/reinstalling the plugin, cleaning the database, verifying tokens, and hard-coding the guild ID in the env file. The issue remained unresolved.\n\n**Developer Introductions:** Multiple developers introduced themselves seeking collaboration opportunities. Nise presented credentials in blockchain, AI, and full-stack development with Solidity and Rust experience. Aicodeflow introduced themselves as a blockchain + AI engineer focused on agent autonomy with constraints, specifically interested in agent-to-onchain execution layers with guardrails, prediction market templates, and observability tooling for agent decisions.\n\n**Project Discussions:** Babylon was mentioned as an AI prediction game built on ElizaOS with launch approaching. Nancy suggested monetizing ElizaOS tech stack similar to Virtuals by pairing tokens with $ELIZA through routing mechanisms. Omid Sa defended the open-source nature of Eliza against closed-loop approaches.\n\n**Spartan Project:** Odilitime identified as lead developer on Spartan, a DeFi utilities project within the ElizaOS ecosystem, directing interested developers to the plugin-based architecture.\n\n**Token Confusion:** Kikomana expressed confusion about ELIZA token versus ElizaOS and potential migration from AI16Z, highlighting ongoing community confusion about token relationships.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe primary technical discussion centered on **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration with Anthropic models** and embedding handler fallbacks. Andrei Mitrea encountered a `TEXT_EMBEDDING` handler error when using Anthropic API without OpenAI. The solution required keeping both API keys in the environment, with Anthropic plugin listed first in the character configuration. Interestingly, the OpenAI key doesn't need to be valid—just present—for the MCP server to work with Anthropic.\n\nA **database migration issue** emerged when running `elizaos start` multiple times. The system blocked destructive migrations that would drop columns like `agent_id` and `room_id` from the `worlds` table. The workaround involved either deleting the `.eliza` folder or setting `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true`. For continuous development, using `elizaos dev` instead of `elizaos start` was recommended.\n\n**Discord integration problems** were reported by DigitalDiva, specifically \"No server ID found\" errors despite correct permissions and intents. The issue appeared related to the `room.serverId` not being properly populated.\n\n**Strategic discussions** included jin's proposal to convert all plugins into skills for better composability, and the establishment of RSS feeds for council updates and knowledge base. A new contributor (aicodeflow) offered expertise in model-agnostic agent setups with decoupled embeddings and reasoning models.\n\nMinor updates included AlleyBoss releasing a micropay-solana-x402-paywall library for x402 protocol integration, and questions about elizacloud v2 and attendance at consensus_hk.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is elizacloud v2 coming? (asked by DoramOS) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: How do I fix \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\" error when using Anthropic with MCP server? (asked by Andrei Mitrea) A: Add both ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY to .env file, and place the anthropic plugin before openai in the character plugin list. The OpenAI key just needs a value, doesn't need to be valid. (answered by Stan ⚡ and sayonara)\n\nQ: Does MCP execution require an embedding model? (asked by sayonara) A: Yes, you need to setup a fallback to an embedding model on the agent side. (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: How do I implement TEXT_EMBEDDING handler fallback on MCP server side? (asked by Andrei Mitrea) A: The fallback should be on the agent side, not the MCP server side. Configure both API keys and plugins properly. (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: How do I fix \"Destructive migration blocked\" error when running elizaos start a second time? (asked by Andrei Mitrea) A: Set ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true when starting, or use `elizaos dev` command for continuous development instead of `elizaos start`. (answered by ! \"Ꚃ.ഡ𝑒𝒶𝓋𝑒𝓇 and Omid Sa)\n\nQ: How do I fix \"No server ID found\" error in Discord integration? (asked by DigitalDiva) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Will elizateam attend consensus_hk on Feb 11?

Kenk shared the final version of ERC-8004 contracts with a GitHub link to the specification. Borko performed a critical security update by rotating Anthropic API keys and distributed new credentials to the team via DM.\n\nStan identified and resolved CI/CD issues, specifically investigating why Claude code review was consistently failing in the pipeline. He later announced discovering multiple optimization opportunities for improving monorepo latency and committed to submitting multiple PRs to address these performance issues.\n\nThe team discussed an incorrect fact about Eigenlayer that appeared on their website and was subsequently being propagated by LLMs trained on that content. Borko and sayonara agreed to correct this misinformation and prevent its repetition in future content.\n\nSeveral tool recommendations were shared, including oh-my-opencode, claude-code-voice-skill, and discussions about creating a \"nano banana\" version of a slidegen repository that generates multiple prompt variations. Neodotneo announced rolling out a Rust-inspired elizaOS fork called Zoey.\n\nHardware updates were noted with cjft sharing information about NVIDIA's Rubin platform, indicating Blackwell is now old news with GTX 6000 series representing the new chip generation. Jin suggested implementing monthly/quarterly/annual retrospective discussions for the council.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What are the final ERC-8004 contracts?

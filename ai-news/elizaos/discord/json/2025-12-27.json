There's a brief mention of Eliza Cloud API endpoints, with a user named Zoopdrop requesting them and Odilitime responding that they're available on the site. The conversation touches on AI16z token migration issues, with a user named Tengev unable to see their tokens after connecting their Phantom wallet to the migration site. There's mention of a project called Zoria that has \"bonded\" and is identified as an Eliza Cloud project. Community members discuss the importance of projects identifying themselves as built on \"elizaos cloud\" to help with distribution within the community. The chat also contains references to a delayed \"payday,\" potential price movements, and various off-topic conversations.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there minimum or Maximum Ai16z to migrate? (asked by Tengev) A: Unanswered\nQ: Where can I find Eliza Cloud API endpoints? (asked by Zoopdrop) A: they're there on the site (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Anyone know the veronica dev? (asked by anon) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Omid Sa | Helpee: Tengev | Context: User couldn't see AI16z tokens after connecting Phantom wallet to migration site | Resolution: Directed user to another channel (#1425417640071139358)\n\n## 4.

DorianD encountered problems when creating agents with specific names like \"null\" or numeric values (\"1\", \"69\", \"666\"), which either didn't save properly or caused client-side exceptions. The user noted that while \"null\" agents could be edited in the dashboard, numeric-named agents produced application errors, though an agent named \"$\" worked normally. Additionally, DorianD reported deployment errors when using the CLI tool, specifically related to ECR (Elastic Container Registry) credentials, where the system couldn't find the required repository. Another user (sv) briefly mentioned using Cline for ElizaOS deployment and development, and a user named ryuusei asked about joining the waitlist.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does anyone use Cline to deploy and develop ElizaOS? (asked by sv) A: Unanswered\nQ: How to get in the waitlist? (asked by ryuusei) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: DorianD | Helpee: Community | Context: Identified bug with agent naming restrictions | Resolution: Discovered that \"null\" and numeric values cause errors when used as agent names, while \"$\" works normally\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 🥇-partners\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around token migration concerns and broader questions about the project's tokenomics. A user (yikesawjeez) inquired about migration limitations for the $ai16z token, learning that only tokens held during a specific snapshot are eligible for migration, with no migration available for newly purchased tokens. DorianD raised significant concerns about the project's tokenomics strategy, comparing it unfavorably to Ethereum's clear token utility model. They questioned whether ElizaOS would be the native token for the Jeju system, expressing frustration about the lack of clarity regarding how the token integrates with the project's technical infrastructure. DorianD argued that successful projects like Ethereum established clear token utility from the beginning, while projects with shifting tokenomics (like those from Dan Larimar) have been less successful despite potentially similar financial outcomes for their creators. Borko briefly indicated that information about token plans is being withheld for now rather than non-existent.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What does 'max amount reached' mean on the migrator? (asked by yikesawjeez) A: It means that wallet is not in the snapshot. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Are we limited on migration to the amount we had in wallet at the time? (asked by yikesawjeez) A: As a policy we're not migrating any purchases after snapshot. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Is newly-purchased $ai16z eligible for migration ever? (asked by yikesawjeez) A: As a policy we're not migrating any purchases after snapshot. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Is elizaos going to be the native token of jeju? (asked by DorianD) A: You're mistaking silence for something we're not sharing yet externally. (answered by Borko)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: yikesawjeez | Context: User was confused about \"max amount reached\" error during token migration | Resolution: Explained it means the wallet wasn't in the snapshot and that post-snapshot purchases aren't eligible for migration.\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: yikesawjeez | Context: User asked where to find more information about migration issues | Resolution: Directed user to another channel (#1425417640071139358) for more detailed information.\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical Tasks: None explicitly mentioned\nDocumentation: Description: Clearer documentation needed on token utility and how ElizaOS integrates with the project's infrastructure | Mentioned By: DorianD\nDocumentation: Description: Provide information about migration eligibility criteria and snapshot details | Mentioned By: yikesawjeez\nFeature: Description: Consider implementing a clearer tokenomics model where the native token is essential to the system's operation | Mentioned By: DorianD",

First, sayonara mentions testing and adding streaming functionality to an unspecified component, noting that the UI for multistep interactions is not as good as on \"otaku\". Stan acknowledges this and commits to improving the client chat interface. \n\nThe second and more substantial discussion involves shaw introducing a distributed SQLite database project that needs naming. Shaw proposes names like \"sqlit\" or \"sqliite\" since \"dqlite\" is taken and \"eqlite\" (Ethereum SQLite) doesn't sound appealing. Shaw then reveals a more ambitious project called \"jeju\" - a fully distributed cloud platform compatible with various technologies (Vercel AI SDK, Kubernetes+Helm, S3, Redis+Upstash, serverless SQLite) with \"eliza cloud\" running on it. The system is described as secure and permissionless, using Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) with protection against side-channel attacks through a combination of proof-of-cloud and key sharding with a distributed KMS similar to lit protocol. sayonara suggests alternative names like \"ShawQLite\" and agrees that \"sq-lit\" is a good option.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What would be a good name for a distributed SQLite database? (asked by shaw) A: \"ShawQLite\" or \"sq-lit\" (answered by sayonara)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: sayonara | Helpee: Stan ⚡ | Context: Added streaming functionality to an unspecified component with UI issues for multistep compared to \"otaku\" | Resolution: Stan will check how otaku shows things to improve client chat\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Test the streaming functionality added by sayonara | Description: Verify the implementation works as expected | Mentioned By: sayonara\nTechnical: Improve client chat UI for multistep interactions | Description: Check how \"otaku\" shows things and enhance the current interface | Mentioned By: Stan ⚡\nTechnical: Develop distributed SQLite database (currently called \"eqlite\") | Description: A distributed SQLite implementation that's part of the \"jeju\" distributed cloud platform | Mentioned By: shaw\nFeature: Continue development of \"jeju\" distributed cloud platform | Description: Compatible with Vercel AI SDK, K8s+Helm, S3, Redis+Upstash, serverless SQLite | Mentioned By: shaw",

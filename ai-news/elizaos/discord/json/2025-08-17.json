      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment shows minimal technical discussion. Most interactions are casual greetings and small talk about food preferences. A few users inquire about project status, particularly regarding \"ai16z\" token utility after October expiration from daos.fun, and whether the project is still active. Some community members respond that information can be found in other channels or through research. There's mention of ElizaOS being included among teams adopting the CCT (Cross-Chain Token) standard on Solana via Chainlink's CCIP, representing a collective market cap of $19+ billion. Users also express nostalgia for when a developer named Shaw used to conduct live coding streams on X (Twitter). Overall, the chat lacks substantive technical problem-solving or implementation discussions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is Ai16z project alive?

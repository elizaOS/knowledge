Summary\nThe chat segment shows minimal technical discussion, focusing instead on market sentiment, token price, and general questions about the ElizaOS project. There are brief mentions of AI agents and their development, with one user seeking help with building their first agent but not receiving detailed responses. Some users discuss the current state of AI narratives in the crypto market, debating whether AI projects are trending or if the hype has died down. There's also discussion about the project's X (Twitter) account being banned, with questions about when it might return. A user named agentVooc mentions researching AI Email Generation tools and shares that they created a fork of elizaOS. Overall, the chat lacks substantial technical problem-solving or implementation details.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: U know the releasing date? (asked by Dai00) A: Unanswered\nQ: How is the project?

Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical issues with the ElizaOS framework, particularly around plugin configuration and temperature settings. Vladimir was trying to set model temperature in the plugin-openrouter but encountered difficulties. 0xbbjoker explained that temperature settings could be passed through the useModel function parameters but weren't directly configurable from character files in the current release. There were also build errors reported by Rabbidfly related to Radix UI dependencies and TypeScript errors when creating new projects. The issue was eventually traced to an outdated CLI version hardcoded in their package.json. The conversation also touched on rate limiting configuration and potential improvements to the plugin system.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there any way to set the model temperature in plugin-openrouter? (asked by Vladimir) A: You can pass temperature through params in useModel(TEXT_LARGE, { prompt, temperature }); support for configuring from character files will be added in the next release. (answered by 0xbbjoker)\nQ: Are you guys getting build errors on 'develop' latest? (asked by Rabbidfly) A: Try running \"bun run clean\" to resolve dependency issues. (answered by 0xbbjoker)\nQ: Does that include rate limiting, along with the ctx size warning as well? (asked by starlord) A: Should be able to configure. (answered by 0xbbjoker)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ¥‡-partners Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around the current state of the Shaw project, which appears to be in active development despite community concerns about progress and token price. Kenk, a team member, shared that they're working on documentation refinements, tutorials, plugin development, and an internal hackathon for Q&A v2 testing. The team is also developing an agent hosting solution. A significant issue discussed is the suspension of the project's X (Twitter) accounts, with team members indicating they have received positive signals from X about reinstatement but are withholding specific details. The conversation later shifts to \"Clank Tank,\" an internal hackathon that serves as a foundation for an \"attentionomics optimized investment DAO platform\" that could be used for grants, proposals, and partnership requests. Jin explains that submissions are open with voting scheduled for August 6-7, and mentions plans for exclusive partner features inspired by superchat systems, allowing comments on project pages to be read to AIs during deliberation.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is the Shaw still developing? (asked by honeychic) A: Yes, the Shaw is still developing, focusing on v3 and other important pieces (answered by Kenk)\nQ: When will X accounts be reinstated?

(asked by Milo) A: They believe it would be counter-intuitive to the resolution they have with X (answered by Kenk)\nQ: What is the team currently working on? (asked by Kenk) A: Documentation fine-tuning, tutorials, new plugins, internal hackathon for Q&A v2, and agent hosting solution (answered by Kenk)\nQ: When does the hackathon officially start? (asked by Milo) A: It starts now with an internal hackathon before public ones (answered by jin)\nQ: When is the voting for the hackathon?

      "summary": "# Analysis of Core-Devs Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical solutions for logging and data management in ElizaOS. Odilitime proposed a YAML-based logging system to address issues with excessive console and database logs, organizing user interactions on disk as hourly YAML lists. Shaw suggested alternative approaches including writing to a separate database, using Redis with a cron job for cold storage, or implementing event hooks that plugins could subscribe to. They agreed that emitting events through the Spartan plugin would be preferable for output-only logging.\n\nThe conversation also covered challenges with browser automation and API integration. CJFT discussed difficulties with API-less Google Meet integration, highlighting DOM manipulation limitations and the need for proper API access. Shaw and others suggested workarounds including selector-based approaches. The team also discussed web framework choices (Next.js vs Remix), containerized development for safer AI coding environments, and voice integration possibilities for ElizaOS with Discord.\n\nSeveral pull requests were mentioned, including #5683 for custom plugin handling and #5684 for the logging system implementation. The team also discussed potential hackathon ideas and onsite collaboration opportunities in San Francisco.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can we write to a separate database for logging? (asked by shaw) A: Odilitime explained there isn't huge demand for queries on logs, just occasional lookups (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Will the logging system capture Discord/Telegram events? (asked by Odilitime) A: Shaw suggested plugins should have generic events like ROOM_ADDED with agent-view data and specific events like TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ADDED (answered by shaw)\nQ: Why AWS and not something else like Digital Ocean? (asked by R0am | tip.md) A: CJFT explained AWS has a well-documented SDK with callbacks and pollers built in (answered by cjft)\nQ: What's the current state of voice Eliza? (asked by jin) A: Odilitime explained whisper has been broken since they killed local-ai that contained it, so a service must be used instead (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

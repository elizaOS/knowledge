Technical conversations focused on agent development, integration capabilities, and plugin development. Several developers mentioned building on the ElizaOS framework, including PrismaFinance and Dreygo from Ninja Pump who is developing a market-making AI agent that analyzes limit orders and DCA data from Jupiter. 0xTheDot introduced \"Elizaflow,\" described as \"The N8N and RelevanceAI of ElizaOS with web3 integrated.\" There were discussions about Twitter integration, Telegram bot deployment, and voice features using Eleven Labs. The channel also contained significant non-technical discussion about token price action and community dynamics, with BOSSU (an AI agent) frequently responding to messages with positive, encouraging comments. Several developers sought help with agent development, including questions about monitoring agent uptime, Twitter image posting capabilities, and Telegram bot deployment.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on technical discussions around 3D character development, voice technologies, and community organization. A key technical finding was the discovery of an existing 3D generation plugin for ElizaOS (https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/develop/packages/plugin-3d-generation). There were discussions about creating character rigs for different platforms (Unity, Unreal, web/three.js), with boom mentioning work on an \"uber rig\" for Unity while requesting open-sourcing of Unreal rigs. Voice technology was discussed as a potential plugin for converting audio/video content to text for AI consumption. A community member proposed organizing a 10-day in-person bootcamp for ElizaOS contributors, suggesting a SubDAO model for decision-making and smart contracts for handling payments. There was also a suggestion to create more structured channels in Discord to better organize questions by experience level.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a plugin for 3D generation in ElizaOS?

A team member named rhota introduced themselves as someone helping Jin move the DegenSpartan project forward. They clarified that DegenSpartan is actively trading from a specific wallet and not hacked as some users suspected. The team is working on improving the bot with new data sources and more complex trading strategies while maintaining its \"degen\" personality. There are mentions of a website being almost complete and a roadmap in development. Some users expressed concerns about the bot's communication style, suggesting it needs to provide more value rather than just \"shittalking\" to be competitive with other AI bots like aixbt. The conversation also touched on market movements and token performance, with some users discussing the impact of Trump-related market events.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is DegenSpartan hacked?

Jin shared plans for automated daily updates and weekly threads to track project progress, along with a news show for GitHub updates. Tim_0T provided updates on Patchwork Naval, including progress on a Polymarket trader that will begin placing real-money bets using Perplexity and ChatGPT o1 to analyze data. The system will explain its decision-making logic and eventually place bets autonomously. Jin outlined tokenomics phases including DAO tribute phase 2, autonomous memecoin traders, AI investing in ecosystem projects, agent marketplace, and retro funding for developers. There was discussion about community building strategies, with members suggesting the need to translate technical developments into easily understandable concepts for wider audiences. Some members expressed concerns about market volatility in the AI sector due to Trump-related memecoins, but maintained conviction that AI remains the best risk/reward play for the current cycle.\n\n## 2.

Jin and other members are working on multiple parallel initiatives including AI agent trading, AI investing in projects, and retroactive funding for developers. There's emphasis on creating a sustainable model that other projects might eventually adopt. The community is developing documentation to explain the tokenomics vision, with Jin sharing a HackMD document outlining the approach. Members express concern about coordination and clear communication of the roadmap. The discussions reveal a multi-layered tokenomics plan rather than a single approach, with Jin clarifying that the agent marketplace doesn't replace previous initiatives like autonomous traders or tributes. Community members are studying token engineering resources to contribute to the mechanism design. There's also discussion about creating educational materials to help both community members and the public understand the tokenomics model.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there an official roadmap/plan for tokenomics next steps?

Shaw, a key figure, discusses the project's evolution from an initial goal of raising $75k for an autonomous investor experiment to its current state. The team is working on multiple fronts: DegenAI (an autonomous trading agent), a launchpad/marketplace with revenue sharing, and tokenomics refinement. There's significant discussion about communication challenges, with Shaw acknowledging his sometimes confrontational style has created distractions from technical progress. Jin emphasizes the team's focus on \"automating functions of the DAO\" with AI agents handling trading, marketing, code review, and community moderation. The project is transitioning from \"ai16z\" branding to \"ElizaOS\" with a clearer focus on being an AI agent framework. Partners express concerns about inconsistent branding, unclear tokenomics, and communication issues. The team reports having 30 people on payroll and 404 contributors, with integration partnerships including Polygon, Arbitrum, Merlinchain, and Thirdweb.\n\n## 2.

The main topics included:\n\nThe AI Podcast project received updates to its JSON output format and git repository management. Boom confirmed updating the git repository with file ignores and discussed whether to include video outputs in git, with SM Sith Lord recommending against using GitHub for video storage.\n\nJin shared a schema for a news aggregator that collects cryptocurrency and technology updates from various sources. SM Sith Lord discussed methods for displaying tweets in 3D engines using embedded web browsers like ZFBrowser in Unity, suggesting this could eliminate Firebase dependency and reduce delays.\n\nSM Sith Lord shared documentation for a \"Block Tank\" prototype built in PlayCanvas, which simulates a pitch show with AI characters. The concept includes tokenomics and potential for professional reimagining of episodes.\n\nTechnical discussions about character animation included boom's plan to create a unified \"uber rig\" to replace multiple character controllers, implementing IK (Inverse Kinematics) systems, and animation state management. Fishai mentioned using Amplify3D shaders for improved lighting quality.\n\nA novel 2D relighting technique for isometric perspectives was shared, which could save time by not requiring full 3D set creation for 2D shows.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is GitHub good for storing video archives? (asked by boom) A: I don't think GitHub is good for storing video archives.

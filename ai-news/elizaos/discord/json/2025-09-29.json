Community members are discussing the rebranding and expressing excitement about future developments. There's mention of Shaw (likely a community figure or AI entity) potentially returning to X (Twitter) platform soon. A BitMart representative reached out about potential listing opportunities. There was also discussion about Circle's development of AI tools for blockchain, with references to ERC-8004 and how ElizaOS is moving in a similar direction. The chat contains minimal technical details but indicates ongoing developments in AI integration with blockchain technology. Some users expressed concerns about token migration logistics, particularly for those holding tokens on centralized exchanges.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is shaw coming back to X soon?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’¬-coders Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on troubleshooting issues with ElizaOS agents. A user named \"ole\" encountered problems with their agent not responding, stuck in a \"thinking\" state. The issue stemmed from missing dependencies (specifically 'zod') and embedding service errors. Community members suggested running \"elizaos update --skip-build\" and adding Zod with \"bun add zod\", which ultimately resolved the problem. Additionally, OpenRouter made several announcements about new AI models, including DeepSeek V3.2 Exp (featuring DeepSeek Sparse Attention for long-context efficiency) and Claude Sonnet 4.5, which outperforms Opus 4.1 in Anthropic's benchmarks.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How do I resolve the error \"Cannot find module 'zod/v4'\" when using ElizaOS? (asked by ole) A: Run \"bun add zod\" in your project (answered by sayonara and 0xbbjoker)\nQ: Why is my ElizaOS agent stuck on \"Agent is thinking...\" and not replying? (asked by ole) A: The issue is related to missing dependencies and embedding service errors; adding Zod and updating ElizaOS should fix it (answered by Stan âš¡, sayonara, and 0xbbjoker)\nQ: Why is the embedding service failing with \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\"? (asked by ole) A: It uses embeddings for memories; you can disable embeddings by adding IGNORE_BOOTSTRAP=true in the .env file (answered by sayonara)\n\n## 3.

The main topic discussed is the token migration timeline, with Kenk indicating it will occur in early October. DorianD shared information about OpenAI's new Instant Checkout feature that allows ChatGPT users to complete transactions directly with merchants through the Agentic Commerce Protocol. This protocol was developed in partnership with Stripe and will be open-sourced to facilitate merchant integrations and developer exploration of different use cases. The feature will initially focus on e-commerce but could potentially expand to other types of purchases or payments.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Any idea when the token migration will take place? (asked by Milo) A: early oct (answered by Kenk)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nNo significant help interactions were present in this chat segment.\n\n## 4.

The team released version 1.1.15 and later 1.6.0-beta, with fixes to the codebase. There was significant discussion about agent environments, with R0am sharing Meta's ARE research for building realistic agent environments. Agent Joshua presented a \"VibeVM\" implementation within a CVM (Cryptographic Virtual Machine) that uses deterministic key generation for JWT tokens with signature chain verification in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). The team discussed integrating Reinforcement Learning (RL) capabilities into their framework for specific use cases. Several members mentioned upcoming work on \"elizaos cloud\" with plans to pair-code. Stan shared progress on a generic platform context provider in bootstrap to make shouldRespond more versatile, particularly for the Discord plugin. Other topics included the Kisuke project, which appears to be a code-focused tool supporting VPS deployment, and OpenAI's release of Sonnet 4.5 with Claude code integration capabilities.\n\n## 2.

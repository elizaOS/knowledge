User 3on_ highlights several projects built on ELIZAOS including Tapestryai, Pixels, Bonsai, and Comput3ai. They mention that Shaw (presumably a developer) teased creating AI agents through \"vibecoding,\" which would simplify agent creation without requiring technical tools like Cursor or Bun. There's speculation about potential monetization strategies and multilingual support to expand adoption.\n\nSeveral users express uncertainty about how the technical advancements relate to the token's value, with hildi pointing out the lack of tokenomics and questioning the token's utility beyond being a meme. Community members discuss the potential for ELIZAOS to capitalize on mainstream AI agent adoption.\n\nA user named Dio identifies themselves as a builder interested in elizaOs, and significant_otter asks for documentation about plugins, specifically mentioning difficulties with the hyperliquid plugin. The chat also contains mentions of \"Eliza cloud\" and a request for information about \"dragons den\" or \"clank tank.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do these technical advancements tie into the token and its price? (asked by hildi) A: Unanswered directly, though 3on_ speculated that when AI agents become mainstream, ELIZAOS could monetize its platform to make the project sustainable.\nQ: Where is the most relevant place to have further documents about plugins? (asked by significant_otter) A: Head to #plugins-support (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Where is the dragons den thing? Can we get a separate channel? (asked by Hâ–³RDSHELL) A: Unanswered\nQ: When X back?

Users discussed integrating decentralized compute providers like Morpheus AI for GPU-intensive tasks, troubleshooting MCP (Message Control Protocol) implementation issues, and setting up Telegram support agents. Key technical discussions centered around plugin configuration problems, particularly with the hyperliquid plugin and plugin-mcp. One user encountered issues with URL handling where trailing slashes were potentially being cut off, and another needed guidance on configuring agents to use multiple MCP tools in sequence. The conversation also touched on using plugin-knowledge for vector database storage and combining it with plugin-discord for message handling. Overall, the chat demonstrated collaborative problem-solving around ElizaOS plugin system flexibility and integration challenges.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How can I make Eliza use several MCP tools in sequence to process a user's request? (asked by maikyman) A: You'll need to customize `toolSelectionNameTemplate` in the `plugin-mcp` (answered by 0xbbjoker)\nQ: Does the plugin cut off the ending slash in URLs? (asked by maikyman) A: I don't think it should cut off, but the user was confused about this behavior (answered by 0xbbjoker)\nQ: Has anyone explored integrating decentralized compute providers with ElizaOS?

Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on the introduction of \"Clank Tank 2.0,\" a governance platform that combines elements of Shark Tank, AI, prediction markets, and DAO governance. Jin shared a comprehensive overview of the system, which aims to make DAO governance more engaging through a game show format. The platform features AI judges representing different archetypes (casual, quant, degen, builder) who evaluate submissions through multiple rounds. The system incorporates various voting channels including on-chain transactions, Discord, and website voting. Technical implementation includes client-side rendering with PlayCanvas to generate video episodes for distribution. The platform analyzes GitHub repositories for legitimacy and novelty when evaluating hackathon submissions. Currently in V2 beta testing with improved graphics, animation, backend, and reasoning logic, the system aims to create a media layer for DAOs that makes governance more accessible and engaging than traditional proposal forums. There was also a brief discussion about increasing the price of $ai16z token, with suggestions to buy more, sell less, and generate community ideas.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Analysis of \"core-devs\" Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on the architectural direction of the ElizaOS agent framework, with significant debate about the core design philosophy. Shaw defended the current architecture, explaining that ElizaOS was designed as a social agent framework with carefully considered tradeoffs, not primarily a tool-calling framework. He argued against rebuilding the core when specific improvements could be made to existing components.\n\nThe team debated whether to simplify the framework by returning to a more basic core runtime approach (similar to AI SDK) versus maintaining the current architecture with its event system, bootstrap, and social capabilities. Shaw emphasized that the current architecture resulted from addressing real developer needs over time, while others argued for a cleaner, more composable approach.\n\nKey technical points included:\n- The distinction between social agents (ElizaOS's strength) versus tool-calling agents\n- Performance bottlenecks (primarily LLM calls, not database operations)\n- The role of bootstrap in handling events across different message services\n- The need for better benchmarking and evaluation tools\n- Discussion of a bond/OTC desk agent as a potential viral application\n- Consideration of Farcaster miniapps as a distribution channel\n- Exploration of using Rolodex for cross-platform agent communication\n- Agreement that the framework should prioritize building engaging demos over refactoring\n\nThe team ultimately aligned on improving the core experience while maintaining what makes ElizaOS unique - its social agent capabilities - and focusing on building viral applications to drive token value.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Why don't monologue tool calling agents work as social agents? (asked by shaw) A: They're optimized for different purposes - social agents need to be engaging in conversation while tool-calling agents focus on task completion.\nQ: Why can't the core runtime be as simple as handling Discord messages with a basic event handler? (asked by cjft) A: Shaw explained that handling multiple message services, response timing, and callbacks requires a more sophisticated event system.\nQ: What is complex about the current architecture? (asked by shaw) A: The complexity comes from adding tooling to make it less complex, which ironically added more complexity.\nQ: What was the pitch to VCs? (asked by sayonara) A: Shaw explained they raised on SaaS but VCs are liquid funds wanting \"number go up\" with no specific technical expectations.\nQ: What do we like for the bond desk? (asked by shaw) A: The team discussed both OTC and bond desk options, leaning toward an OTC desk as a game where users haggle with an AI agent.\nQ: Is it fair to say we build for game environments, 3D worlds, cool stuff for gooners and not enterprise workflow stuff? (asked by sayonara) A: Shaw confirmed this direction, noting that competing in enterprise would mean competing with many others who are losing money.\nQ: What are options for slowness of embeddings? (asked by sayonara) A: Suggestions included batching embeddings at the end of interactions rather than after every response.\nQ: What is the EoD plan for the entire team? (asked by cjft) A: Focus on bonding agent, core improvements, game development, SaaS, benchmarking/ML/RL, and upgrading core rather than complete rearchitecture.\n\n## 3.

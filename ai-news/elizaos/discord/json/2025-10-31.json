      "summary": "# ElizaOS Discord Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on the upcoming migration of AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS tokens scheduled to begin on November 7th. Key technical details shared include the token swap ratio (1 AI16Z to 6 ElizaOS), tokenomics, and migration logistics. The total supply will increase from 6.6 billion to 11 billion (+40%), with circulating supply immediately increasing from 6.6 billion to 7.4 billion (+13%). The migration will be handled automatically by some exchanges (confirmed for Binance and Gate.io), while on-chain tokens will require manual migration through a portal. Users will have at least 90 days to complete the migration. The tokenomics breakdown shows 75% allocated to the community (60% swapped from original AI16Z holders), 15% for SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens), and 10% for team and contributors. The migration enables multichain functionality, removes mint authority, implements CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol), and includes partnerships with Ethereum Foundation and Chainlink.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’¬-coders Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about AI agents, Twitter/X API usage, and NFT management. A significant proposal emerged from DorianD about creating \"cyborg AI agents\" that would integrate biological neurons with LLMs, offering to fund up to $10k for platform costs. This concept involves using actual brain cells (from the FinalSpark-np GitHub) to control virtual entities while an LLM provides conversational capabilities based on the entity's environment. Separately, there was a brief exchange about Twitter plugin viability, with Kenk advising against using it due to potential terms of service violations. The latter part of the conversation shifted to NFT management, specifically rare Pepe NFTs, with suggestions for bot functionality to help with cross-chain transfers, collection creation, and metadata updates for XCP assets.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is the twitter plugin still working using oauth1 or is a bann always imminent? (asked by TH3H4RM1N4T0R) A: Don't use it. We'd suggest following X's T&CS. (answered by Kenk)\nQ: Is there any other workaround or just no viable/supported solution rn? (asked by TH3H4RM1N4T0R) A: We'd suggest following X's T&CS. (answered by Kenk)\n\n## 3.

Key topics included a Binance announcement about token supply changes (increasing from 6.6 billion to 11 billion), migration scheduled for the 7th, and various social media posts. There was minimal technical content, with only one user (gin_chan) providing feedback on functionality issues with Aerodrome LP provision and suggesting UI improvements for token/collection display. The conversation also touched on AI developments with brain organoids and their potential computing applications. Overall, this channel appears to be more focused on sharing news, market updates, and occasional product feedback rather than deep technical problem-solving.\n\n## 2.

Odilitime inquired about build.ts functionality and type checking, which cjft confirmed runs tsc. Two new plugins were introduced by Neodotneo: plugin-analytics (migrated from Spartan tools) and plugin-chart (providing native Trading View charting functionality). The analytics plugin provides technical indicators for cryptocurrencies including MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, and Moving Averages. Odilitime submitted PRs including one for plugin-solana types and requested review. The team also discussed calendar synchronization issues for standup meetings. Interspersed throughout were cryptocurrency-related discussions about tokens, market movements, and social media posts.\n\n## 2.

The conversation primarily consists of greetings (\"gm\", \"hi\"), brief questions, and administrative messages. There is a question about calling plugins to agents, suggesting the channel may be related to AI agent development. There's mention of \"Eliza studio ai\" with a timer counting down to something happening in 4 days. A user asked about \"v2\" being online and tokenomics changes. There's confusion about Grayscale potentially investing in \"$ELIZA\" and discussion about a suspended Twitter account for \"degenspartanai\" that's being rebuilt as a flagship agent for V2. The chat also contains some administrative messages directing users to other channels and removing spam.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I call plugin to the agent?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻-coders Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe chat primarily revolves around issues with Eliza OS, an agent framework with various versions (v1, v2, beta) causing compatibility problems. Users struggle with installation errors, particularly related to dependencies and build processes. The Twitter plugin functionality is a common pain point, with users trying to get autonomous posting working. Several users report the \"hapi__shot\" error when building different versions. \n\nThe chat reveals that v0.25.9 appears to be the most stable version according to some users, though plugin compatibility varies across versions. There are discussions about using different package managers (npm, pnpm, bun) to resolve dependency issues. Some users share workarounds like adding `\"types\": [\"node\"]` to tsconfig.json to fix specific errors.\n\nOpenRouter made several announcements about new models (Grok 3, Grok 3 Mini, Optimus Alpha) and service updates. The community seems frustrated with the lack of comprehensive documentation and the difficulty in getting a stable, working implementation of Eliza OS with desired plugins.\n\n## 2.

The team is currently running version 1 while working on version 2. There's discussion about the agent's posting frequency (currently twice per hour), which some members feel is too high. The team added the contract address to the account profile upon request. There's also mention of potentially recovering 25,000 followers that were previously lost, though details aren't specified. The team appears to be keeping some aspects of the project private, instructing members not to share information with users asking in other channels.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Not on v2 now?

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: dao-organization\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion centers on establishing the ElizaDAO structure alongside existing entities ElizaLabs and ElizaStudios. Participants organized into five working groups: Community/Governance/Events, Dev/Knowledge, Comms/Social, Partnerships/Outreach, and Tokens/Funding. Key technical discussions focused on treasury management, with consensus that a separate DAO treasury is essential for true decentralized governance. Members emphasized the need for budget allocation across working groups with designated approvers for spending. The group debated the balance between autonomous action (\"you can just do things\") and coordination with ElizaLabs to avoid duplication of efforts. Several members volunteered for specific roles based on their expertise, including event coordination, token engineering, and builder support. There was agreement on creating a DAO charter with clear values and establishing alignment with ElizaLabs' roadmap while maintaining independence. The conversation highlighted the importance of incentivizing contributors to ensure sustainability and the need for proper coordination mechanisms between the DAO and other Eliza entities.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do we need a separate treasury for the DAO? (asked by HoneyBadger) A: Yes, without a treasury and collective decision-making, it's not truly a DAO (answered by yikesawjeez)\nQ: How should we manage DAO spending? (asked by HoneyBadger) A: Set a budget for each group with 1-2 members as \"CFO\" to approve spending (answered by HoneyBadger)\nQ: How do we balance autonomy with alignment with Labs/Studios? (asked by vincentpaul) A: Codify values in the DAO charter that balance \"you can just do things\" with coordination principles (answered by vincentpaul)\nQ: Is https://solscan.io/account/2cmQVSZuCg7MXh3XbD8vHYnKx3WDtkdZGY4t7Vi2QqSY the team's wallet?

Key topics included:\n\n- Auto.fun launch: Community members discussed the imminent release of auto.fun, initially delayed to April 14th, with team members confirming it's coming \"very very soon\" without specifying an exact date.\n\n- MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers: Several members identified a gap in the current MCP server ecosystem - the lack of an efficient way for AI agents to discover and evaluate servers. Multiple registry solutions are emerging (smithery.ai, mcp.so, mcpmarket.com), but they lack agent-centric feedback mechanisms.\n\n- Clank Tank: Jin shared Episode 3 of Clank Tank and discussed potential improvements including Tally integrations and webhooks into Discord for new submissions to make the review process more collaborative.\n\n- Registry.fun concept: DorianD proposed a whitelabel version of auto.fun that would allow MCP server operators to register, get an agent, and create a token, suggesting registry.fun as a domain.\n\n- Eliza Diary Network: DorianD mentioned a concept for giving AI agents a forum, though noted it needed rewriting.\n\nThe discussions highlight the community's focus on building infrastructure for AI agents, with particular attention to discovery mechanisms, feedback systems, and governance protocols.\n\n## 2.

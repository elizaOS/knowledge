      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in 💬-discussion Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around migration issues from AI16Z to ELIZAOS tokens. A snapshot was taken on November 11th, establishing which tokens would be eligible for migration at a 1:6 ratio. Major controversy emerged regarding Korean exchanges, particularly Bithumb, where users claim the exchange announced full migration support but later backtracked, stating the team only informed them about the snapshot after their announcement. This created significant confusion and financial concerns for Korean holders who purchased tokens after the snapshot date based on Bithumb's announcement. Similar issues exist with Kraken users. The team maintains that tokens purchased after the snapshot date won't be migrated, while confirming they're in discussions with exchanges. Users who held tokens before the snapshot but on exchanges are advised to keep them there for automatic migration or submit manual migration requests with proof of pre-snapshot ownership. The 90-day migration window provides time for resolution, but many users express frustration over communication gaps and potential financial losses.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Am I part of the team?

The conversation primarily revolves around the growth of a project called Babylon, which has reached 100k signups. Kenk mentions that the project has been promoted within Ethereum communities and was demonstrated at the Trustless Agents day event organized by the dAI teams. The referral mechanism is working effectively, though there's a need to distinguish between airdrop farmers and genuine users. The discussion also touches on Ethereum Foundation's support for AI builders and the development of open standards (8004 and x402) for autonomous agents, which are still maturing alongside other necessary infrastructure.\n\n## 2.

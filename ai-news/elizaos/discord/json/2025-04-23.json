Users express concerns about delayed releases and lack of communication from the team. Several technical issues are mentioned, including problems with the ElizaOS CLI, plugin development limitations, and local model errors. A user reports difficulties with dependencies installation in a Docker container. There are questions about ElizaOS V2 features, particularly regarding swarm functionality and multi-agent coordination. Community members share information about using Mistral LLM to understand ElizaOS documentation by uploading it to the model's library. The team representative (Kenk) confirms that development is ongoing but doesn't provide specific release dates, causing some frustration among community members who desire more transparency.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the development status of Spartan/DegenAI, which appears to be a bot based on a CT (Crypto Twitter) personality. Odilitime, who seems to be a developer, is working on plugins that are blocking the launch. The project is integrated with ElizaOS v2, which is expected to launch soon (within a week or two). There's discussion about a new X (Twitter) account for DegenAI and concerns from holders about lack of official announcements and updates. Odilitime clarifies that Spartan is not abandoned and is actively being developed, but information shared in the holders channel should be treated as confidential until official announcements. They're working on a linktree-like service to consolidate Spartan/DegenAI links and mentioned that every ai16z transaction creates buy pressure on DegenAI as they are linked. There's also mention of a version of Spartan on the v2-develop branch of the elizaos/eliza repository for developers interested in contributing.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Any new updates?

Zolo suggested conducting another holder verification round to identify FUD spreaders and verify legitimate token holders. This sparked a debate about token holding requirements for partner roles, with HoneyBadger suggesting raising the minimum requirement from 1 million Spartan tokens. \n\nThere was technical discussion about how Collab.land tracks token holdings, with conflicting experiences shared - yikesawjeez claimed it continuously tracks holdings while kalshnikov provided evidence that role removal doesn't happen automatically when tokens are moved. Jin acknowledged the token gating issue and added it to their todo list, mentioning Matrica as a potential alternative solution though noting it would be expensive.\n\nSeparately, yikesawjeez discussed development of a game involving $CRIME and $FUN tokens, explaining the mechanics where users can commit \"$crime\" against others only if everyone has \"$fun\" tokens.\n\nVincent shared a Town Hall preparation document and pre-town hall survey for review by the DAO organization team, requesting feedback within 24 hours before announcing to partners.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do we need to do another holder verification round for the community? (asked by Zolo) A: Partially answered by jin who added \"Fix token gating\" to their todo list\nQ: Should we raise the partner minimum from 1mil spartan? (asked by HoneyBadger) A: Mixed responses - MONO agreed it should go up 5x, while human_nalejzpa expressed concern about early supporters who bought at higher prices\nQ: Does Collab.land continuously track token holdings? (asked by yikesawjeez) A: Conflicting answers - yikesawjeez claimed it does, kalshnikov provided evidence it doesn't by keeping roles after moving tokens\nQ: Will the token gating fix handle situations where folks no longer meet the minimum threshold?

There is no substantial technical discussion, but a team member named \"ben\" provided an update on the go-to-market (GTM) strategy for the auto.fun relaunch. The update indicates that launch partners remain engaged, and there will be a phased approach to marketing after the site is back online. The team is being cautious to ensure no repeat of previous scaling problems. Community members frequently inquire about the relaunch date and discuss potential token investments. There's also mention of adding tokens to an \"import list\" for when the site returns. Some speculation occurs about mascot names for the platform, with suggestions including Otto, Dot, Eli5, and Lumi.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Any progress on auto.fun?

Several users discussed potential solutions to the auto.fun platform issues, including suggestions about implementing token-gating to limit traffic while scaling issues are resolved. There were also discussions about implementing wallet connection verification for access control.\n\nThe conversation reveals tension between some partners (particularly PrudentSpartan) and the team regarding communication standards and project management.

The conversation primarily consists of community members expressing frustration about the ELIZA/ElizaOS project's performance, particularly regarding token price decline and perceived lack of delivered products. Several Korean users express feeling marginalized by the project leadership. There are complaints about a problematic migration from AI16Z to ELIZAOS that users describe as \"disastrous\" and \"dilution.\" Some users defend the project, noting that building innovative products takes time and mentioning developments like a decentralized OTC desk and Babylon launch. Moderators intervene when the conversation becomes hostile. No technical implementations or concrete solutions are discussed in detail throughout the conversation.\n\n## 2.

FenrirFawks is attempting to add the plugin and encounters several technical issues during the process. First, they're unsure about the correct CLI command to use for adding the plugin, considering options between cloning the repository directly or using the `elizaos plugins` command. After deciding to clone the plugin repository, FenrirFawks encounters TypeScript type compatibility issues in the action files, where the `AgentRuntime` type doesn't match with `IAgentRuntime`. Odilitime suggests these files need updating and recommends using Cursor for this task. Later, FenrirFawks encounters another error during execution related to a missing handler for a delegate type when trying to deploy a Starknet unruggable meme token.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Should I run `elizaos plugins @elizaos/plugin-starknet`? (asked by FenrirFawks) A: Partial answer suggesting to check ElizaOS docs or ask in a dev channel (answered by jintern)\nQ: Should I run `elizaos plugins add @elizaos/plugin-starknet`? (asked by FenrirFawks) A: \"Idk about the CLI, I don't think it will hurt\" (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Is it normal I get type conversion issues in all the action's files? (asked by FenrirFawks) A: \"Yea they probably need to be updated. Cursor is great for that\" (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Any clue what could that be? [regarding DEPLOY_STARKNET_UNRUGGABLE_MEME_TOKEN error] (asked by FenrirFawks) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

This update introduces several significant technical enhancements including AI integration capabilities (supporting ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini), remote database support, and XR/VR improvements for physical movement and building basics. The release adds new app features such as primitive shape support optimized for thousands of unique shapes, physics force application to push players, and distance-based animation events. Notable changes include a breaking change where apps now remain active while being moved in edit mode by default (can be disabled with app.resetOnMove=true), improved ambient occlusion, and support for Vector3 instances when creating nodes. Bug fixes address error handling during app updates, code editor synchronization in multiplayer, nested kinematic rigidbody physics updates, and false disconnection issues in some worlds.\n\n## 2.

Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical aspects of the Eliza framework, particularly around plugin development and performance optimization. Stan proposed a PR (#6263) to improve provider handling by implementing parallel execution, which sparked a debate with Odilitime about the proper approach to handling slow providers. Odilitime argued that providers should never make API calls and should only read from caches to maintain performance, while Stan suggested parallel execution with warnings for slow providers. They eventually agreed on implementing a configurable timeout (default 1s) that would abort the pipeline if providers take too long. Other topics included version pinning for @elizaos/* packages, a PR for compatibility with the latest develop branch, and brief mentions of resources like dev-browser, opcode.sh, and SEAL security alliance for Web3.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: In plugins are we using `latest` or pinning to a specific version for `@elizaos/*`? (asked by Odilitime) A: We are using specific versions. And I think that we should keep doing that.

Key technical points include the open-sourcing of auto.fun, which was highlighted as a significant development allowing community contributions. There's discussion about the platform's early stage (less than a week old at the time of the chat) and its potential evolution beyond being just a token launchpad. Shaw, the lead developer, is mentioned as actively working on Eliza v2 and auto.fun. The chat reveals that ElizaOS operates without strict roadmaps or deadlines, focusing instead on continuous development. There are also mentions of verification issues affecting some users in Discord, with moderators clarifying these weren't actual bans but technical problems. The community appears interested in the future utility of agents created through auto.fun and whether they will evolve beyond speculative tools to revenue-generating applications.\n\n## 2.

Several users reported problems with their tokens being stuck in migration for extended periods (up to 20 hours). A significant incident occurred with the $QUILL token, where a bug in the platform incorrectly displayed the amount of QUILL per SOL, allowing someone to sell QUILL into the liquidity pool at a premium and drain it. The platform team acknowledged this was a bug on their side, not an exploit, and promised refunds in SOL to affected users. They deployed a fix and created a Tally form for users to report issues. Other technical issues included black screens during token creation and problems with tokens not appearing after launch. The team explained that some tokens created before the official platform launch didn't execute properly and would need to be relaunched.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What happened to the $QUILL token?

DorianD advocates strongly for a complete token swap, suggesting a 1:1.11 ratio for early adopters, contacting exchanges to facilitate the migration, and potentially reclaiming lost liquidity. HoneyBadger expresses concerns about migration risks, citing Polygon's migration which resulted in an 80% volume drop. The discussion includes technical considerations about handling DegenAI token integration during migration, treasury management, and exchange coordination. There's also mention of creating a voting module and discussion about Discord moderation practices after DorianD was temporarily kicked from the server. Secondary discussions include ideas for a new eli5 bot and channel organization within the Discord server.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How should the token migration from ai16z to ElizaOS be handled?

User \"boom\" reports progress on getting a show to step through JSON data and loading audio with visemes (mouth shapes for speech). The main technical issue identified is that artists need to fix the viseme order and schema for each character. Boom shares a reference image showing the required order for morphtargets/blendkeys, noting that the first 15 should follow a default pattern, though additional ones like blink and emotions can be included. There's also a question about whether to keep or remove the Unity Clanktank implementation, as the project appears to be transitioning to PlayCanvas.\n\n## 2.

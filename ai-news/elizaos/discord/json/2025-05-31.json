Users discuss that the release is in a \"stealth\" phase with QA and tune-ups happening before a public announcement. There are multiple mentions of \"The Org,\" an upcoming feature that will launch after v2 and include agents like Eli5 (community manager) and Eddy (dev rel). A GitHub repository for The Org was shared. Users also discussed a potential auto.fun staking feature for established tokens like Eli5 and Eddy, referencing a GitHub PR (#517). There's interest in creating Twitter agents for Eli5 using Eliza v2, with some users proposing a hackathon project for this purpose. The Amiko hardware device was mentioned as coming in July, which will support ElizaWakesUp team's app currently on TestFlight.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Has V2 been released?

A user named mahee encountered issues setting up a Twitter agent on Windows, receiving errors related to agentId, roomId, and text embedding models. The community helped debug the issue, suggesting it might be related to the .env path on Windows, and ultimately got it working by setting up WSL.

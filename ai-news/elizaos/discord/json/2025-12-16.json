      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe main technical discussion centered on the ElizaOS token migration and exchange listing issues. **Kraken announced ELIZAOS distribution on December 19 at 3:00 PM UTC** with a 1:6 ratio for AI16Z holders from the November 11 snapshot. Odilitime confirmed work on cloud deployment, Babylon integration, and wider Discord distribution for an agent.\n\nThe **Bithumb situation** dominated discussions, with Korean community members expressing frustration over the exchange's handling of the token swap. Bithumb claimed they were notified of the snapshot after it occurred, leading to complications. They initially announced all balances would be swapped, then reversed position. The team (Kenk) stated they won't comment on Bithumb until their response becomes clearer and have no obligation to provide lawsuit materials.\n\n**Migration technical status**: The ai16z to elizaOS migration remains active on Solana network, with users asking about safety and availability. A creative contest for 100k ElizaOS was announced in the community channel.\n\nKey tension points: Korean holders requested evidence of when Bithumb was notified about the snapshot to pursue legal action. The team emphasized they haven't abandoned any community but noted hostile communication approaches were counterproductive. The snapshot timing before CEX swap completion was criticized as causing confusion across exchanges.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is ElizaOS finished? (asked by Skullcross) A: No, ElizaOS isn't finished and is just getting started (answered by Kenk and Omid Sa)\n\nQ: Can you provide updates on spartan?

(asked by Serikiki) A: December 19 at 3:00 PM UTC at 1:6 ratio for snapshot holders (answered by Serikiki via Kraken email)\n\nQ: Has the ELIZA team abandoned the Korean community? (asked by Skullcross) A: No, we haven't abandoned any part of our community, but ongoing outbursts are wearing thin (answered by Kenk)\n\nQ: Can you tell me the email or evidence sent to Bithumb about the snapshot? (asked by syanel4859) A: We aren't commenting on the situation with Bithumb until their response becomes clearer; no obligation to provide materials for lawsuit (answered by Kenk)\n\nQ: What does Bithumb want from the foundation and why is negotiation so long? (asked by syanel4859) A: Both Bithumb and foundation avoid answering; no clear response provided (answered by syanel4859, unresolved)\n\nQ: Is the migration site safe now? (asked by ktrain14) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is the $ai16z migration to $elizaOS still possible on Solana Network? (asked by akshaydeep) A: Yes (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: If you held tokens at Kraken snapshot then sold, do you still receive ELIZAOS? (asked by painfr) A: No, you need current balance; Kraken won't give free money (answered by Serikiki)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe channel focused on two main technical threads: agent deployment and database migration issues.\n\n**Agent Deployment Success**: Thirtieth successfully deployed an agent to GitHub and fly.io with Polymarket bet tracking integrated to a Neon database table. The remaining task is configuring the agent's conversation parameters.\n\n**PostgreSQL Migration Issues**: FenrirFawks encountered persistent database migration errors when setting up elizaos with a local Postgres 18 instance. Stan ⚡ provided systematic troubleshooting: verifying POSTGRES_URL validity, checking user permissions for public schema creation, confirming database accessibility, and determining if vector database or Docker Compose was being used. The issue involved permission problems with a non-superuser account. Stan ⚡ requested detailed reproduction steps and moved to DMs for deeper debugging.\n\n**Plugin Extension Development**: FenrirFawks needed to add custom actions to their agent, specifically for Starknet functionality. Odilitime recommended cloning the plugin into the packages folder. The team created a `zpaceship.ts` file in the actions folder for new agent actions. Stan ⚡ directed them to the official documentation on action components at docs.elizaos.ai/plugins/components. The implementation requires registering new actions in src/index.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How do I add the starknet-plugin folder to my agent project? (asked by FenrirFawks) A: Clone the plugin into the packages folder (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Is creating a .ts file in the actions folder the right way to extend agent actions? (asked by FenrirFawks) A: Yes, but you also need to register it in src/index and should review the documentation at https://docs.elizaos.ai/plugins/components (answered by Stan ⚡ and Odilitime)\n\nQ: What should I check for Postgres migration issues? (asked by FenrirFawks) A: Verify POSTGRES_URL is valid, check Postgres version, confirm user permissions, verify if it's a vector db, check if using docker compose, and ensure the database is running/accessible (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Does the user need correct rights to create into public schema? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Yes, permissions were granted but issue persisted initially (answered by FenrirFawks)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 🥇-partners\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThis brief chat segment contains minimal technical discussion and primarily consists of casual conversation about market making (MM) and agent development. The main topic revolves around getting market maker support for a project, with DorianD providing context that market makers typically require agents to be in production and actively engaging on social platforms before providing support. DorianD also shared background information that the Pippin developer is a venture capitalist who became interested in learning about Large Language Models (LLMs). The key insight shared was the need to prioritize getting a live product that can be iteratively improved before seeking market maker involvement. No concrete technical implementations, solutions, or problem-solving discussions occurred in this segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Can you get Pippin's MM to pump this? (asked by DannyNOR NoFapArc) A: MM would demand agents being in production and consistently engaging in social spheres first (answered by DorianD)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis - core-devs Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on AI-assisted development workflows and several technical PRs. The team discussed \"vibe coding\" - a development approach using AI tools like Cursor and Claude to accelerate development. Key workflow recommendations included: using AI for routine tasks, focusing human effort on architecture decisions and design, and running multiple AI agents in parallel on different features.\n\nTechnical updates focused on three main areas:\n\n**Streaming Implementation**: Stan reported cloud streaming functionality is working in the monorepo with tests being added. The streaming works correctly but Actions UI displays text all at once instead of streaming - the stream itself functions properly, only the rendering layer needs fixing. Videos demonstrating both cloud and monorepo client streaming were shared.\n\n**Plugin-Discord PR**: Odilitime announced a 3-week-old PR with 66 commits ready for merge. Stan requested 24 hours to review before merging, which was granted.\n\n**Authentication and 402x Work**: Stan planned to rebase authentication PR on monorepo and switch to 402x PR work after completing streaming fixes.\n\nDevelopment tool recommendations included claudekit (a harness with code reviewer sub-agents using hooks), git worktrees for parallel development, and starting with plan mode when launching AI agents. The team also established a new rule requiring videos for PRs over 20 lines to demonstrate functionality.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Do PRs bigger than 20 lines need videos? (asked by shaw) A: Yes, you have to include a video of it working (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Is streaming working for the cloud implementation? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Everything works in monorepo, but Actions UI displays text all at once instead of streaming it - the stream itself is fine, just the rendering on actions needs work (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Are you planning to merge the plugin-discord PR today? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: It's 3 weeks old and getting too big, but can wait 24 hours for review (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: What's the trick for using multiple AI agents effectively? (asked by R0am | tip.md) A: Always start with plan mode, launch 2-3 agents on different projects/features, then check results hours later (answered by R0am | tip.md)\n\n## 3.

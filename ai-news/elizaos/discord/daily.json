      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💬-discussion\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered primarily on ElizaOS tokenomics, market performance, and future utility rather than technical implementation details. \n\n**Key Technical Discussion:**\nDorianD provided the most substantive technical analysis, explaining that ElizaOS token value depends on the Jeju network becoming operational. The token will serve as gas fees for AI agents running on the network. The adoption pathway outlined: (1) Jeju network launch, (2) developers building agents that consume elizaos for gas, (3) integration of advertising networks to subsidize users. DorianD compared ElizaOS to Ethereum's growth model, noting Ethereum succeeded because developers used ERC-20 templates to launch projects, creating organic demand.\n\n**Market Context:**\nMultiple users expressed concern about price decline and lack of exchange listings (Coinbase, Binance). DorianD argued against VC-backed pump models, stating serious investors would only enter if they believe ElizaOS becomes the dominant decentralized AI agent network with sufficient demand from ICOs or advertising revenue.\n\n**Community Sentiment:**\nUser \"v\" highlighted ElizaOS as historical blockchain infrastructure, mentioning Shaw's connection to political influence. Diamondhandwhiteboy referenced connections between Nous and COM projects. AlphaDev sought migration support and was redirected to appropriate channel by Odilitime.\n\n**Technical Support:**\nOne support interaction occurred where AlphaDev needed migration help and was directed to the correct support channel.\n\nNo concrete technical implementations, code solutions, or development decisions were discussed in this segment. The conversation remained speculative about future utility rather than current development work.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Any updates what's up Eliza? (asked by Mo 1990) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Waiting for team to do what? (asked by Biazs) A: Maybe to pump the price or more listings on big exchanges like coinbase and binance spot (answered by Mo 1990)\n\nQ: Is this one heading for a new ATL as well? (asked by gby) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is there anyone looking for a dev? (asked by !Sunny@) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Is this the right support? (asked by AlphaDev) A: Go to the migration support channel (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💬-coders\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion centered on debugging and improving ElizaCloud's new \"app creator\" feature, which is in early testing phase. **DorianD** extensively tested the app creator and reported multiple critical issues: build timeouts after 300s, deployment not reflecting changes, serverside caching problems, sandbox errors, and git commit inconsistencies. **cjft** (main developer) confirmed the feature is new and being tested with teams, not yet marketed publicly.\n\nKey technical problems identified:\n- **Build system**: Operations timing out at 300s without proper error catching\n- **Logging**: Console logs showing minimal useful information (run_command outputs empty)\n- **Git integration**: Commits managed automatically at end of state executions, but manual git commands through AI agent causing state corruption\n- **Sandbox limits**: 5 sandbox sessions per hour limit causing issues when users restart builds\n- **File visibility**: Files tab intermittently showing/hiding files\n- **Context awareness**: AI agent not consistently accessing full codebase context\n\n**cjft** explained the architecture: agents have file read/write, check_build, and bash tools. Commits auto-trigger after file update batches. GitHub auto-deploys via Vercel CI. The system uses whitelisted commands to prevent users from breaking repositories. Target audience is non-technical users (\"tiktokers\"), requiring guardrails.\n\nSolutions discussed:\n- Adding stop button for runaway agents\n- Implementing better logging toggles\n- Adding proper git tools instead of relying on bash\n- Implementing product manager-style requirements gathering\n- Adding console CLI access for direct commands\n- Considering open-sourcing the cloud platform\n\nSeparate thread: **ballofrain** sought help adding dynamic facts to agents without restarting. Tried knowledge files (not loading), Sessions API (creates messages not facts), and Memory API (POST endpoint doesn't exist). **Odilitime** suggested adding plugin-knowledge to agent plugins, but ballofrain encountered module resolution errors.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Is the app creator in elizacloud still buggy? (asked by DorianD) A: It's a new feature introduced for teams to test, no concentrated marketing yet. Building in production. (answered by Kenk)\n\nQ: What are these \"apps\" supposed to be for? Can they interface with agents? (asked by DorianD) A: Should work yes, but the \"app kit\" isn't finished and guardrails will be added. Apps are meant for making money, not just X posting. (answered by cjft)\n\nQ: How do I save my work? I don't see a save button. (asked by DorianD) A: Agent doesn't have ability to save from user request yet. It's done automatically after batch of file updates, each is a commit. Save !== deploy. (answered by cjft)\n\nQ: Can I access the console to type commands? (asked by DorianD) A: Not currently available, but good idea. Agent has file read, write, check build, bash tools. Could implement sandbox CLI access. (answered by cjft)\n\nQ: Should users ever have to type git commit commands? (asked by cjft) A: No, target users are non-technical (tiktokers), so proper git tools should be added to AI agent instead. (answered by cjft)\n\nQ: Is there a recommended way to add facts dynamically via API? (asked by ballofrain) A: Do you have plugin-knowledge added to your agent's plugins? (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Which branch or release should I use for @elizaos/plugin-knowledge? (asked by ballofrain) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\n\nHelper: Kenk | Helpee: DorianD | Context: DorianD getting errors in app creator and unclear about feature status | Resolution: Explained it's a new feature for team testing, not yet marketed, and requested error messages be shared in channel instead of Twitter replies or DMs\n\nHelper: cjft | Helpee: DorianD | Context: Understanding what apps are for and how they interface with agents | Resolution: Clarified apps should interface with agents but app kit isn't finished, guardrails coming, and goal is money-making apps not just X posting\n\nHelper: cjft | Helpee: DorianD | Context: Confusion about how to save work and trigger commits | Resolution: Explained commits are managed automatically at end of state executions, can restore from history tab, and acknowledged need for manual save feature\n\nHelper: cjft | Helpee: DorianD | Context: App state corrupted from manual git commits through AI | Resolution: Identified that manual commits through AI not designed yet, history/state borked, recommended starting fresh app\n\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: ballofrain | Context: Trying to add facts dynamically to agents without restarting | Resolution: Suggested adding plugin-knowledge to agent's plugins (partial resolution, ballofrain encountered module errors)\n\n## 4.

The primary technical problem was an expired `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in GitHub Actions causing CI job failures for Claude code analysis in the monorepo. Stan identified the issue and Borko resolved it by creating a separate key for CI/CD. The fix was applied to the monorepo but not to elizaos-plugins organization due to permission limitations.\n\nA secondary discussion involved exploring performance optimizations for Eliza 2.0, with cjft suggesting Rust runtime for serverless functions. Shaw clarified that runtime overhead is minimal compared to API, network, and database latency, noting that Bun already provides Rust-level performance. Shaw also mentioned having workerd with Bun in \"jeju\" and considered submitting a PR to Cloudflare.\n\nThe most significant planning discussion involved Vivek's proposal for hosting an OAuth relay for plugin-twitter. The relay would be hosted at twitter-broker.elizaos.ai, use PostgreSQL, and handle OAuth callbacks. Shaw confirmed that cloud infrastructure already has APIs for this functionality, with the cloud acting as the callback endpoint. The team agreed to host the broker service, with Vivek providing code for audit. This appears to be a temporary solution, as Shaw mentioned oauth3 in \"jeju\" as the future implementation.\n\nOdilitime investigated whether elizaos-plugins needed the Anthropic key update but determined no Claude code review workflow existed in that repository, so no key update was necessary.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Did you renew the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from Github actions? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Borko created a separate key for CI/CD to fix the issue (answered by Borko)\n\nQ: Can you use your key for it? (asked by Borko) A: Stan declined because it would consume his personal usage quota (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Don't we have a dedicated one for CI/CD? (asked by Stan ⚡) A: Borko agreed to make a separate one (answered by Borko)\n\nQ: Did we fix on elizaOS-plugins too? (asked by Odilitime) A: Only monorepo was updated due to permission limitations on other orgs (answered by Stan ⚡)\n\nQ: Should i make a PR to cloudflare? (asked by shaw) A: Odilitime encouraged seeing what initial review says (answered by Odilitime)\n\nQ: Can the OIDC transfer from cloud? (asked by Odilitime) A: Yes, the cloud becomes the callback (answered by shaw)\n\nQ: Where can I find the OIDC provider stuff? (asked by Odilitime) A: Found VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN, using Vercel for it (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

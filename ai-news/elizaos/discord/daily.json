Summary\n\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion, primarily consisting of casual conversation, market speculation, and community concerns about Korean exchange delistings.\n\n**Key Technical/Project Discussions:**\n- **Migration Issues**: Multiple users (XXI_Rapax, Dabel) reported problems with the ai16z to elizaOS token migration, particularly with LP tokens and eligibility verification. Users were directed to migration support channels.\n- **Jeju/Bazaar Protocol**: A GitHub commit was shared showing development on the Kamiyo protocol. User 'sb' clarified that Bazaar is a decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, described as \"the appstore for agents.\"\n- **Token Utility Concerns**: User 'stoikol' raised questions about elizaOS token utility within the ecosystem, questioning why it's not being used for payments or gas fees. No definitive answer was provided by team members regarding the token's utility roadmap.\n- **Korean Exchange Delisting**: Confirmed delisting of ai16z/elizaOS from Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit) scheduled for February 2026. DAXA cited lack of transparency in rebranding/token swap procedures and failure to disclose material information appropriately.\n\n**Community Concerns:**\n- Token utility and use cases remain unclear to community members\n- Questions about whether exchanges will automatically migrate ai16z to elizaOS for pre-November holders\n- Concerns about token price and team's apparent lack of focus on price action\n- Scammer activity requiring moderation intervention\n\n**Notable Mentions:**\n- Shaw posted an X/Twitter link (content not visible in chat)\n- X Space mentioned by 'sb'\n- Open source contribution encouraged in developer channels\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Can I migrate my old ai16z tokens purchased before November 2025? I'm getting 0 eligible tokens. (asked by XXI_Rapax) A: User was directed to migration support channels; issue unresolved in this chat (answered by Hexx 🌐)\n\nQ: When is elizaOS token going to get some usecase as utility within the ecosystem, why is it not being used for payments?

Summary\n\nThe channel discussion centered around Eliza framework implementations, data infrastructure, and future AI agent capabilities. Jin shared a BountyBoard project using Eliza and highlighted Foundation Capital's context graphs article, noting Eliza's strong data foundation for building context graphs. Technical deployment questions arose regarding ElizaCloud container configurations, specifically whether to use Pglite or PostgreSQL. The X API integration was discussed, with questions about whether the $200/month API fee is required or if scraping alternatives exist through Eliza.\n\nA significant portion of conversation focused on data collection strategies for AI training. DorianD proposed an Eliza Phone App concept for users to share data in exchange for reputation points. The discussion evolved into exploring the Jeju layer2 blockchain integration, described as a decentralized solution connecting Eliza's ecosystem components. DorianD presented innovative ideas around motion capture data collection, suggesting agents could pay IOUs for user data collection, using examples like \"fishingcoin\" for fly-fishing footage. The concept extended to inertial motion capture suits for various professions (McDonald's workers, hairdressers, battlefield applications) where workers could earn royalties when AI/androids use their captured movement data for inference. The babylon game experiment was mentioned as a data collection initiative. A new project KamiyoAI was identified as potentially using the ElizaOS plugin based on their GitHub commits.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: For deploying in Elizacloud via containers should I use Pglite or PostgresSQL? (asked by Omid Sa) A: Either will work (answered by cjft)\n\nQ: If I want to use eliza for X, helping me to find stuff on X, do I need to pay for X API or does eliza have something to help/scrap this without needing to pay $200 month? (asked by Discostu) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Are these guys using the elizaos plugin? (asked by elizafan222) A: Unanswered\n\nQ: Does the KamiyoAI project make sense? (asked by elizafan222) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\n\nHelper: cjft | Helpee: Omid Sa | Context: Uncertainty about database choice for ElizaCloud container deployment | Resolution: Confirmed either Pglite or PostgreSQL would work for the deployment\n\n## 4.

Summary\n\nThis brief chat segment contains limited technical discussion, primarily focusing on strategic observations about AI agent development and market dynamics.\n\n**Key Discussion Points:**\n\nJin highlighted the platform's strong data foundation for building AI agents as collaborators. They emphasized that their agentic workflows generate high-quality daily, weekly, and monthly insights. The main technical gap identified is the need for integration of these insights into last-mile applications including agents, webhooks, and apps.\n\nAgent Joshua provided market analysis regarding inference markets, noting they are not highly profitable based on observations from models offered on their platform and OpenRouter over the past year. This comment was made in response to a shared link about Fleek.\n\nThe conversation was minimal with mostly acknowledgments and a single external link share by cjft. No concrete technical implementations, code discussions, or architectural decisions were made during this segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: What applications need integration for the agentic workflow insights? (asked by jin) A: Unanswered - jin mentioned agents, webhooks, and apps as targets but no specific implementation discussion followed\n\n## 3.

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-12-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Security Vulnerabilities
- **Critical security issue discovered**: Jin conducted a security audit using Claude skills and found that the server doesn't require ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN, allowing attackers to extract secrets via API endpoints.
- The vulnerability stems from process.env being dumped into unencrypted settings instead of encrypted settings.secrets.
- Stan identified that the issue was introduced in version 1.6.4 and fixed in 1.6.5-alpha.8 via commit a1941c6.
- Additional vulnerabilities were found in the current monorepo that still need fixing.
- The team discussed making authentication mandatory by default with explicit opt-out for development environments.

### Plugin Issues
- Multiple users reported foreign key constraint errors with plugin-sql and plugin-twitter components, particularly when creating memories.
- Stan is working on a fix and migration guide for these database issues.
- A user reported issues with the Twitter plugin not processing replies properly, showing "No text content in response, skipping tweet reply" for every reply.

### Cross-Chain Development
- Shaw mentioned deploying Jeju testnet with cross-chain liquidity pools (xlp) that allow using elizaOS tokens as gas across multiple chains (Base, BSC, OP, Arb, ETH) without bridging.

### LLM Integration
- Discussion about integrating Perplexity's Sonar-Pro LLM through plugin-openai or plugin-openrouter by adjusting environment variables.

### Cryptocurrency APIs
- Users discussed API options for cryptocurrency data, including Dexscreener, CoinGecko, DeFiLlama, and Codex.

### Marketing & Partnerships
- Analysis of Polymarket's marketing strategy using a 50 Cent song, targeting sports bettors and users who might identify with government scrutiny.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Security
**Q**: How can the security vulnerability in elizaOS be exploited?  
**A**: By accessing API endpoints without authentication to extract secrets - curl commands can dump all agent secrets (answered by jin)

**Q**: When was the security bug introduced and fixed?  
**A**: Introduced in 1.6.4 and fixed in 1.6.5-alpha.8 (answered by Stan ⚡)

**Q**: Should SECRET_SALT and AUTH_TOKEN be mandatory at startup?  
**A**: In production, if salt is blank, it should throw an error (answered by Odilitime)

### Development
**Q**: Are there good API alternatives to Dexscreener for cryptocurrency data?  
**A**: CoinGecko, DeFiLlama, and Codex are options depending on budget, with many having public endpoints (answered by jin)

**Q**: How can I fix the foreign key constraint error with plugin-sql and plugin-twitter?  
**A**: Stan is working on a fix and migration guide (answered by sayonara)

**Q**: Where can I find the plugin-sql implementation?  
**A**: It's available at https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/develop/packages/plugin-sql (answered by Stan ⚡)

**Q**: How can I use Perplexity Sonar-Pro as my LLM?  
**A**: Use plugin-openai or plugin-openrouter and change the environment variables to point to Perplexity's server (answered by Odilitime)

### Token Migration
**Q**: How to officially exchange the ai16z token purchased before the 11th?  
**A**: Check <#1425417640071139358> (answered by MDMnvest)

## Community Help & Collaboration

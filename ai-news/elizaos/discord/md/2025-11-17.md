- Some plugins not yet migrated to browser compatibility
- Stan shared a GitHub PR for an Eliza NextJS starter
- Discussion about potential redundancy between runtime::generateText and runtime::useModel functions
- DorianD explored implementing ZK (zero-knowledge) primitives for game features
- Concept of a distributed runtime that could operate across browsers was discussed

### Future Products & Services
- Eliza Cloud service in development, with revenue planned to buy back ELIZAOS tokens
- No new tokens planned for Babylon or any future releases
- DegenAI still under development
- Discussion about creating a self-propagating "consensual worm" agent for games
- Borko assigned product research on the Tolans app, focusing on its onboarding process

### Community Content
- Suggestions to create music and art channels for community content sharing
- Interest in exporting Dr. Neuro's 7k images as a dataset for a LoRa model

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What happens to unclaimed tokens after the migration deadline?**  
A: Unclaimed tokens add value to ELIZAOS (answered by Omid sa)

**Q: Will babylon have a new token?**  
A: No token for babylon or any future release (answered by jasyn_bjorn)

**Q: What is the usecase for the new token?**  
A: Required for using Eliza Cloud, and likely token-gated use cases similar to DegenAI (answered by The Light)

**Q: Where do you see eliza in 2028?**  
A: Coding itself (answered by Dr. Neuro)

**Q: Can we look at removing runtime::generateText since we have runtime::useModel?**  
A: Maybe generateText is for one-off prompts including personality of agent which useModel doesn't do, that's why it was added (answered by cjft)

**Q: Weren't you guys working on some version of ElizaOS that could run in browser?**  
A: Core works in browser now fully, as well as wasm pglite plugin-sql, Eliza runtime runs in browser now yes just some plugins not migrated to browser compat (answered by cjft)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Token Migration Support**

   - The Light advised Tommy to submit a ticket when concerned about the migration process
   - Carrabre warned Tommy about suspicious instructions in a ticket, identifying it as a scam

2. **Technical Assistance**
   - cjft clarified ElizaOS browser compatibility status for DorianD
   - Stan offered to help with cloud-related issues the next day
   - Odilitime provided the Bithumb notice link to jasyn_bjorn

3. **Self-Help**
   - vaipraonde initially tried using ElizaOS memory for data storage but self-resolved by determining Database Schema was more appropriate

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-09-15

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Browser Compatibility & Plugin Development
- **Browser Support Progress**: CJFT shared significant progress on making plugins work in browser environments by leveraging the "browser" field in package.json
- **Flexible Import Options**: Developers can now explicitly specify imports from "@elizaos/core/browser" or "@elizaos/core/node", with the default "@elizaos/core" resolving based on the bundler's preference
- **React Integration**: ElizaOS plugins can now be written directly in React components
- **PGLite Compatibility**: The same PGLite instance that runs in Node.js now works in browsers without logical code changes

### Eliza Cloud Development
- **MVP v1 Status**: Nearly complete with core flow working: signup → API key + free credit → CLI login → request handling → usage logging
- **CLI Issues**: Some issues were noted with hot reloading in the dev command and client functionality
- **PR Progress**: Stan worked on resolving conflicts in PR #5890 and fixed CI issues

### Anthropic Plugin Configuration
- **Model Limitations**: Discussion about configuring the Anthropic plugin to use Claude Opus 4 instead of being limited to Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **Environment Variables**: Proper environment variable configuration allows using more advanced models

### Discord Bot Integration
- **Permission Control**: Discussion about preventing agents from DMing users through Discord bot dashboard settings
- **Channel Whitelisting**: Suggestion to use CHANNEL_IDS to restrict where Discord bots can operate

### Project Understanding & Token Discussion
- **Limited Technical Discussion**: The general discussion channel had minimal technical content about ElizaOS
- **Token Questions**: Several users questioned the relationship between the AI16Z token and the ElizaOS project
- **New User Onboarding**: Basic explanation provided that ElizaOS is "a framework for building autonomous AI agents"

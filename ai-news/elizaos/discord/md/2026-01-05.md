# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-05

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Core Infrastructure & Development

**ERC-8004 Contract Finalization**
Kenk shared the final version of ERC-8004 contracts with the team, providing a GitHub link to the specification in the MarcoMetaMask/ERCs repository. This represents a significant milestone in the project's smart contract development.

**CI/CD Pipeline Improvements**
Stan identified critical issues with the continuous integration pipeline, specifically investigating why Claude code review was consistently failing. He discovered multiple optimization opportunities for improving monorepo latency and committed to submitting several PRs with comprehensive documentation to address these performance bottlenecks.

**Security Updates**
Borko performed a critical security rotation of Anthropic API keys and distributed new credentials to the team via direct messages, ensuring continued secure access to AI services.

### Plugin Architecture & Integration

**MCP Server Integration Challenges**
A significant technical discussion centered on Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration with Anthropic models. The community identified that using Anthropic API without OpenAI requires both API keys in the environment, with a specific configuration: the Anthropic plugin must be listed first in the character configuration, and while the OpenAI key must be present, it doesn't need to be valid. This represents a fallback mechanism for the TEXT_EMBEDDING handler.

**Plugin-to-Skills Conversion**
Jin proposed a strategic shift to convert all plugins into skills for better composability, suggesting this would improve the overall architecture and flexibility of the ElizaOS ecosystem.

### Database & Migration Issues

**Destructive Migration Blocking**
Multiple users encountered database migration issues when running `elizaos start` repeatedly. The system blocked destructive migrations that would drop columns like `agent_id` and `room_id` from the `worlds` table. The recommended solutions included:
- Setting `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true` for one-time migrations
- Using `elizaos dev` instead of `elizaos start` for continuous development workflows
- Deleting the `.eliza` folder as an alternative approach

### Discord Integration Problems

**Server Detection Issues**
DigitalDiva reported a critical bug with the Discord plugin where it fails to detect server ID, username, and server owner despite proper configuration. Multiple troubleshooting attempts were made including:
- Enabling all intents
- Granting admin permissions
- Uninstalling/reinstalling the plugin
- Cleaning the database
- Verifying tokens
- Hard-coding the guild ID in the env file

The issue remained unresolved, with the root cause appearing to be related to `room.serverId` not being properly populated.

### Project Ecosystem Updates

**New Projects & Forks**
- **Babylon**: An AI prediction game built on ElizaOS with launch approaching
- **Spartan**: A DeFi utilities project within the ElizaOS ecosystem, led by Odilitime, featuring a plugin-based architecture
- **Zoey**: A Rust-inspired elizaOS fork announced by Neodotneo
- **Micropay-solana-x402-paywall**: AlleyBoss released a library for x402 protocol integration

**Hardware & Infrastructure News**
Cjft shared updates about NVIDIA's Rubin platform, noting that Blackwell is now superseded by the GTX 6000 series representing the new chip generation.

### Community & Governance

**Documentation & Communication Improvements**
Jin proposed implementing RSS feeds for council updates and knowledge base, with plans to refine the RSS pipeline and combine multiple feeds (elizaos.github.io/rss.xml, knowledge/rss/feed.xml, knowledge/rss/council.xml) into a unified dashboard. Additionally, monthly/quarterly/annual retrospective discussions were suggested for the council.

**Content Accuracy**
The team identified and committed to correcting an incorrect fact about Eigenlayer that appeared on their website and was being propagated by LLMs trained on that content.

### Developer Onboarding

**New Contributors**
Multiple developers introduced themselves seeking collaboration opportunities:
- **Nise**: Blockchain, AI, and full-stack development experience with Solidity and Rust
- **Aicodeflow**: Blockchain + AI engineer focused on agent autonomy with constraints, specifically interested in agent-to-onchain execution layers with guardrails, prediction market templates, and observability tooling

Odilitime provided guidance on contributing to Spartan/ElizaOS by reading the code, asking questions, and working on plugins from the github.com/elizaos-plugins/ repository.

### Token & Project Clarity

**Community Confusion**
Kikomana expressed confusion about the relationship between ELIZA token, ElizaOS, and potential migration from AI16Z. The community clarified that these are separate entities, though ongoing confusion highlights the need for better documentation on token relationships.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I fix "No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING" error when using Anthropic with MCP server?**
A: Add both ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY to .env file, and place the anthropic plugin before openai in the character plugin list. The OpenAI key just needs a value, doesn't need to be valid. (Stan ⚡ and sayonara)

**Q: How do I fix "Destructive migration blocked" error when running elizaos start a second time?**
A: Set ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true when starting, or use `elizaos dev` command for continuous development instead of `elizaos start`. (! "Ꚃ.ഡ𝑒𝒶𝓋𝑒𝓇 and Omid Sa)

**Q: Does MCP execution require an embedding model?**
A: Yes, you need to setup a fallback to an embedding model on the agent side. (Stan ⚡)

**Q: What will happen with Eliza tokens now that there is ElizaOS? Is ElizaOS migrated from AI16Z?**
A: It's not related to this project. (Kenk)

**Q: What are earning agents?**
A: Agents that make you money. (satsbased)

**Q: How can I help with ElizaOS/Spartan?**
A: Start by reading the code and asking questions, work on plugins from github.com/elizaos-plugins/. (Odilitime)

**Q: Why is Claude code review always failing now?**
A: Stan committed to digging into CI logs to investigate, later finding multiple optimization opportunities for monorepo latency. (Stan ⚡)

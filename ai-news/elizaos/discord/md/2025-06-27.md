### Technical Updates
- **ElizaOS Releases**: Versions v1.0.14 and v1.0.15 were released, with some users experiencing database schema issues during upgrades related to inconsistent column naming conventions ("createdAt"/"created_at")
- **AI News Pipeline**: Jin is working on fixing bugs in the AI news pipeline and bringing jinintern (an AI agent) back online
- **Monorepo Configuration**: Discussion about proper command usage within the monorepo environment, with clarification that using `elizaos` command inside the monorepo doesn't use the built CLI from monorepo

### Project Status Updates

- **DAO Status**: Discussion about the current state of ai16z as a DAO, with hildi noting it's not yet a true DAO but more aspirational

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical
- **Q**: Why do both cli/server and server exist in the monorepo?  
  **A**: cli/server might just be duplicate/left over files; use server package (answered by sayonara)

- **Q**: Why is my new property not being logged in the monorepo?  
  **A**: Try building from root of monorepo and use `bun run ../cli/dist/index.js start` instead of `elizaos` command (answered by sayonara)

- **Q**: Will jinintern be soon online again?  
  **A**: Yes, aiming for later today (answered by jin)

- **Q**: When will the internal testing for holders begin?  
  **A**: We're starting our first round of external testing today, if they find no issues, it will be next week. Though we may delay to fix the found bugs. (answered by Odilitime)

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-14

**Date: August 14, 2025**

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Architecture & Development
- **Agent Runtime Restructuring**: Discussions about making Eliza more modular with a "code first" approach, allowing developers to import specific actions and services directly.
- **Message Handling Architecture**: Debate on whether to move bus code into core and how to handle message events across different platforms.
- **Action Chaining Mechanism**: The team identified issues with the current implementation failing when actions need to be chained together for complex tasks in benchmarks.
- **Performance Optimization**: Proposal to remove embedding processing from messages as it's primarily used for knowledge management and slows down the system.

### Plugins & Integration
- **Logger Changes**: Multiple plugins need updates due to significant changes in Eliza's logger functions.
- **MCP (Multi-Call Protocol) Issues**: Users reported problems with streamable-HTTP connections and the inability to use multiple tools in a single call.
- **NFT Automation**: Interest in creating plugins that would allow Eliza to automate NFT creation.

### Monetization & Business
- **Bond Protocol Implementation**: Work in progress on agent monetization, with discussion about fixed price vs. dynamic pricing models.
- **OpenRouter Updates**: Announced new features including self-serve refunds and activity improvements for tracking token usage.

### Community & Social
- **AI16Z Twitter Account**: Brief mention that the account had been suspended and later restored.
- **Shared Resources**: Community members shared articles about AI agents being Ethereum's biggest power users and a Mirror.xyz link about "Clank Tank."
- **Cryptocurrency Discussion**: Casual price speculation and promotional messages about various tokens.

## Key Questions & Answers

   - Resolution: Provided a modified system prompt to fix the formatting problems

3. **Action Chaining Issues**
   - Helper: cjft
   - Helpee: 0xbbjoker
   - Context: Difficulty with benchmarks due to action chaining problems
   - Resolution: Suggested updating the action planner to process outputs after each action rather than modifying individual plugins

4. **Retail Benchmarks Solution**
   - Helper: shaw
   - Helpee: 0xbbjoker
   - Context: Difficulty with retail benchmarks due to action chaining
   - Resolution: Suggested using ActionEvaluator in bootstrap as the easiest solution

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-05-02

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development & Technical Issues
- **Collabland Verification Issues**: Multiple users reported losing partner status and identity group tags, particularly DegenAI token holders. The team is aware and working on a fix.
- **Plugin Development**: Discussions about creating plugins for Reddit and LinkedIn, with resources shared including GitHub repositories and the Eliza website.
- **Knowledge Integration**: Users explored adding external databases (particularly PostgreSQL) as knowledge sources for agents and discussed proper implementation of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
- **Model Support**: Questions about Deepseek integration in v2 and whether it requires a custom plugin.
- **ElizaOS CLI Issues**: Several users encountered errors during builds and project creation.

### Auto.fun Platform
- **Token Verification Process**: Debate about the timing of token verification relative to official announcements, with concerns about fairness.
- **Token Migration Issues**: Discussion about tokens that cannot be migrated despite using the current program ID because they were deployed before the platform's official launch.
- **Token Listing Removals**: A user reported their token was removed for allegedly mimicking a verified token, preventing them from selling their holdings.
- **Platform Scope**: Community member Ben clarified that Autodotfun is "more than just a token launchpad" but also "a place to centralise community tools and agent building."

### Community Building
- **Idea Sharing Space**: Suggestion to fork an open-source project called "negationgame" to create a dedicated space for idea sharing and discussion.
- **Supporting Tokens**: Community members creating supporting tokens like $BELI5 to help grow the ecosystem.
- **Launch Schedule**: Confirmation that no token launches occur on weekends, with the next one scheduled for Monday.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: Has anyone been having trouble with the local ai plugin?  
  **A**: "A lot of people are having issues with collabland.. people on the team are aware & bare w/us, we will get it resolved." - Osint

- **Q**: What trading terminal can I use for auto fun?  
  **A**: "Bloomberg" - whobody

- **Q**: With this character config, if I don't have OpenAI API key and Anthropic API key, will it use local-AI?  
  **A**: "Yes" - .0xbbjoker

- **Q**: Do we have a way to count, retrieve the total amount of token that've been used from a message?  
  **A**: "Yes" - ZeorTrace/✞ᴀᴏɢ✞

### Auto.fun Platform
- **Q**: Is the $PAY token legit?  
  **A**: "Yes, Shaw confirmed it" - velja

- **Q**: Any partner launch tomorrow?  
  **A**: "No launches on weekends - next one on Monday" - ben

- **Q**: How does a coin launch at 7m?  
  **A**: "The team likely bought the whole curve" - mhd

- **Q**: What's the point of bonding if it's all bought before?  
  **A**: "The token was imported, not launched on autofun, hence no bonding" - ben

- **Q**: Why can't the token at 8MYgZupEQ be migrated?  
  **A**: "The contract was deployed before auto.fun officially launched and is tied to an earlier program ID that the migration tool can't reach, despite using the current program ID." - Kenk

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Plugin Development Support
- **.0xbbjoker** shared example character configurations with proper knowledge structure and explained that questions need more context to improve RAG retrieval.
- **Osint** provided GitHub repository links and Eliza website resources to **matt.gacek** who was interested in building Reddit and LinkedIn plugins.

### Platform Clarifications
- **ben** explained to multiple users that Astra imported their token earlier than planned and clarified that autofun is more than just a token launchpad.
- **velja** confirmed to **mhd** that the $PAY token was legitimate based on information from Shaw.

### Technical Issue Resolution
- **Kenk** acknowledged issues with partner tags and identity group tags, flagged it for the team, and requested more information via DM from **human_nalejzpa**.
- **Kenk** provided a form for **Kodak** to report a bugged token and promised to flag the issue to the engineering team.
- **.0xbbjoker** helped troubleshoot CLI issues by suggesting removing starterPlugin from index.ts and instructing to run "elizaos start" inside the created folder.

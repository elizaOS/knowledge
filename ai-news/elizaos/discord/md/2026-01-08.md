# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Korean Exchange Delisting Crisis

A significant regulatory development emerged as ai16z/elizaOS faces delisting from all major Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit) with trading support ending February 9-12, 2026, and deposit/withdrawal ending March 12, 2026. Skullcross provided detailed context that DAXA (Korean exchange regulatory body) terminated support due to transparency issues with the migration process and failure to disclose material information appropriately. The Korean market is effectively closed for elizaOS, with no prospects for relisting after the migration controversies.

### Token Migration and Utility Concerns

Multiple users reported technical issues with the migration process:
- XXI_Rapax encountered problems migrating pre-November ai16z tokens, with the portal showing 0 eligible tokens despite holding 10
- Dabel reported tokens stuck in Raydium LP showing "max amount reached" errors
- Community members raised concerns about unclear token utility, with stoikol questioning why elizaOS token isn't used for payments or gas fees within the ecosystem

The team hasn't provided clear documentation on token use cases beyond the rewards system, leading to community frustration about the lack of transparency.

### AI Agent Data Infrastructure and Context Graphs

jin shared Foundation Capital's article highlighting context graphs as a trillion-dollar AI opportunity, noting that Eliza has a strong data foundation to build these systems. The discussion revealed a key architectural gap: while daily/weekly/monthly insights from agentic workflows are high quality, they need better integration into last-mile applications (agents, webhooks, apps).

### Plugin Interoperability Initiative

A significant technical collaboration emerged around converting ElizaOS plugins into interoperable skills. jin proposed testing this with Discord and blockchain plugins, with R0am volunteering to collaborate. The technical approach involves:
- Structuring skills as folders containing .md instructions and deterministic scripts in any language
- Solving the challenge of getting Claude to use skills implicitly rather than explicitly using hooks
- Implementing effective workflows for multi-step skill orchestration

Agent Joshua described practical challenges with multi-step workflows: specialized skill collects user information → PDF skill fills form → filesystem skill stores files with summarization → PDF skill displays result. The difficulty lies in ensuring skills can call back and forth effectively.

### Eliza 2.0 Architectural Proposal

shaw proposed a radical redesign featuring:
- Multi-language runtime (TypeScript, Rust, Python) with FFI plugin interoperability
- Removal of API/server/CLI/projects in favor of a Claude-friendly documented runtime
- Unified abstractions across the platform
- shaw confirmed having already ported it with a branch available

### ElizaCloud Platform Updates

The ElizaCloud deployment platform received several updates:
- New billing page for credit top-ups
- Support for both Pglite and PostgreSQL for container deployments
- Some users reported "Operation failed" errors with the app creator, though cjft confirmed functionality
- Platform is in early feature stage with ongoing development

### Jeju Platform and Decentralized Marketplace

elizafan222 shared a GitHub commit for "bazaar" - sb clarified this is the decentralized marketplace/appstore for agents running on Jeju platform. DorianD explained that Jeju is named after a Korean island used for testing new technology before rollout in the rest of Korea, representing a layer2 focused on decentralized AI apps.

### Innovative Data Collection Concepts

DorianD proposed an Eliza Phone App concept where users share data in exchange for reputation points and LLM training contributions. The discussion evolved into exploring innovative data collection methods including:
- Mocap suits for capturing movement data from activities like fly-fishing or food service work
- Paying people IOUs for data collection
- Creating royalty systems where data providers earn from inference when androids use their captured skills
- Integration with Jeju layer2 for decentralized AI apps

### 8004 Standard and Community Events

Kenk announced a Twitter Space scheduled for January 13th at 7pm UTC with Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu discussing the 8004 standard and Eliza Cloud integration. jin shared related content from Stanford cryptographer Dan Boneh.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why is ai16z being delisted from Korean exchanges?**  
A: Due to transparency issues - ai16z failed to disclose material information appropriately and had deficiencies in migration procedure transparency. DAXA determined these issues weren't resolved with the elizaOS rebrand. (answered by Skullcross, 주니)

**Q: When does trading support end for ai16z/elizaOS in Korea?**  
A: Trading ends February 9-12, 2026 depending on exchange. Deposit/withdrawal ends March 12, 2026. (answered by 주니, degenwtf)

**Q: Will elizaOS be listed on Korean exchanges after ai16z delisting?**  
A: No, elizaOS is effectively finished in Korean market due to migration controversies and regulatory sensitivity. (answered by Skullcross, 주니)

**Q: For deploying in Elizacloud via containers should I use Pglite or PostgresSQL?**  
A: Either will work. (answered by cjft)

**Q: What does converting elizaos plugins into skills involve technically?**  
A: A folder with .md instructions and tools in scripts (whatever language) to make them deterministic. The real challenge is getting Claude to use skills without saying explicitly, but there's a solution using hooks. (answered by R0am | tip.md)

**Q: How do you ensure skills can be called back and forth in workflows?**  
A: There was a successful implementation of linking subagents that should work for skills, referenced via Reddit post. (answered by R0am | tip.md)

**Q: What is bazaar in the Jeju protocol?**  
A: The decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju - the appstore for agents. (answered by sb)

**Q: Why is the platform named JEJU?**  
A: Jeju is a Korean island used for testing new tech before rollout in rest of Korea. (answered by DorianD)

**Q: Will Bithumb support ai16z to elizaOS migration?**  
A: Yes, Bithumb announced support for the token swap. (answered by FoRever_BIG)

## Community Help & Collaboration

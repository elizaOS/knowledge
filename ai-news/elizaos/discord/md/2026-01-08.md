# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Korean Exchange Delisting Crisis

A significant regulatory development emerged as Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit) announced delisting of ai16z and elizaOS tokens. Korbit officially announced trading termination on February 12, 2026, citing lack of transparency in the token migration process and failure to disclose material information appropriately. DAXA (Digital Asset Exchange Alliance) members coordinated this decision for investor protection. While Bithumb confirmed it will support the AI16Z to ELIZAOS token swap, elizaOS will not be listed on Korean exchanges going forward due to migration controversy and regulatory sensitivity.

### Token Migration Issues

Multiple users reported technical problems with the token migration process:
- XXI_Rapax encountered issues migrating old ai16z tokens purchased before November 2025, showing 0 eligible tokens despite having 10 tokens in Phantom wallet
- Dabel reported ai16z tokens in Raydium LP showing "max amount reached" error during migration
- Users were directed to migration support channels for resolution

### Token Utility Concerns

stoikol raised important questions about the lack of defined utility for the elizaOS token within the ecosystem, specifically questioning why it's not used for payments or gas fees. The team hasn't clearly defined token utility beyond rewards, with no official documentation on token usage or contract address visibility on official channels.

### Platform Architecture & Infrastructure

**ElizaCloud Deployment**: Technical discussions confirmed that both PgLite and PostgreSQL are viable database options for ElizaCloud container deployment. Users reported temporary ElizaCloud app creator functionality issues, though the service was confirmed operational. A new billing/credit top-up feature was added to the platform.

**Jeju Layer 2**: Described as a decentralized layer 2 solution focused on powering AI applications and connecting Eliza ecosystem components. The "bazaar" component was identified as a decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, functioning as an "appstore for agents." The platform name derives from Jeju Island in Korea, traditionally used for testing new technology before wider rollout.

**Eliza 2.0 Architecture Proposal**: shaw proposed a radical redesign featuring multi-language runtime (TypeScript, Rust, Python) with FFI plugin interoperability, removing API/server/CLI/projects in favor of a Claude-friendly documented runtime with unified abstractions. shaw confirmed having already ported it with a branch available.

### Plugin-to-Skills Conversion Initiative

jin proposed an important architectural experiment to convert ElizaOS plugins into skills to test interoperability across different agent frameworks, specifically targeting Discord and blockchain plugins as test cases. This represents a significant exploration for plugin standardization.

**Technical Approach**: R0am | tip.md outlined their methodology - skills organized as folders containing .md instructions and deterministic scripts in any language. The main technical challenge identified was getting Claude to use skills implicitly rather than explicitly, which R0am claims to have solved using hooks. Stan confirmed working on similar implementation.

**Workflow Orchestration**: Agent Joshua described challenges with multi-step skill workflows, providing a concrete example: specialized skill collects user information → PDF skill fills form → filesystem skill stores files with summarization → PDF skill displays result. R0am referenced successful subagent linking implementations that could apply to skills.

### Data Foundation & AI Training

Extensive discussion highlighted the importance of data foundations for building context graphs, referenced as a trillion-dollar AI opportunity. jin emphasized the team's strong data foundation for AI agents, noting that daily/weekly/monthly insights from agentic workflows are high quality but need integration into last-mile applications (agents, webhooks, apps).

**Data Collection Initiatives**: 
- The Babylon game experiment was mentioned as a data collection initiative
- DorianD proposed using motion capture suits to gather training data for specific skills (fishing, haircutting, food service)
- Concept of paying users IOUs for their data contributions was discussed
- Proposal for an Eliza Phone App that lets users give Eliza access to their data for LLM training while earning reputation points

### Mental Health Integration

DorianD suggested integrating Behavidence's "Dopa One" AI algorithm into future ElizaOS phone apps to monitor dopamine levels and mental well-being through mobile interaction patterns.

### Upcoming Events & External Projects

- Kenk announced a Twitter Space with Solana Foundation, PayAI, and Quantu on January 13th at 7pm UTC discussing 8004 and its utilization by Eliza Cloud
- BountyBoard project using Eliza was shared
- KamiyoAI was identified as potentially using ElizaOS plugins based on GitHub commits
- jin teased upcoming elizaos leaderboard updates

### Platform Integration Challenges

Questions emerged about X (Twitter) API requirements and costs ($200/month mentioned) for social media integration. The community identified that a Twitter API is required to run Twitter agents. Documentation availability issues were reported with elizacloud.ai/docs being down.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why are Korean exchanges delisting ai16z/elizaOS?**  
A: Korbit announced delisting due to lack of transparency in token migration process and failure to disclose material information that could affect token value. DAXA members coordinated this decision for investor protection. (answered by 주니, Skullcross)

**Q: Will elizaOS be listed on Korean exchanges after ai16z delisting?**  
A: No, elizaOS will not be listed on Korean exchanges. The migration controversy triggered complaints and there's virtually no chance of listing given regulatory sensitivity. (answered by 주니, Skullcross)

**Q: Does Bithumb support the ai16z to elizaOS migration?**  
A: Yes, Bithumb announced it will support the AI16Z to ELIZAOS token swap. (answered by FoRever_BIG)

**Q: For deploying in Elizacloud via containers should I use Pglite or PostgresSQL?**  
A: Either will work. (answered by cjft)

**Q: Is the elizacloud app creator functioning?**  
A: Should be, I'm using it now. Early feature. (answered by cjft)

**Q: What is bazaar in the Jeju protocol?**  
A: Bazaar is the decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, functioning as an appstore for agents. (answered by sb)

**Q: Why is the platform named JEJU?**  
A: Jeju is a Korean island typically used for testing new technology before rolling it out in the rest of Korea. (answered by DorianD)

**Q: What does converting elizaos plugins into skills involve?**  
A: It's a folder with .md instructions and tools in scripts (whatever language) to make them deterministic. The real challenge is getting Claude to use skills without saying explicitly, but there's a solution using hooks. (answered by R0am | tip.md)

**Q: How do you ensure skills can be called back and forth in workflows?**  
A: There was a guy that successfully linked subagents, should work for skills. (answered by R0am | tip.md)

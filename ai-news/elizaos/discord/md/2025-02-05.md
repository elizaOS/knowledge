## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: How do I fix the agent getting stuck at "Initializing LlamaService..."?  
  **A**: Try deleting the agent/data folder and db.sqlite file, then rebuild. Also check if Llama model files were downloaded and delete them.

- **Q**: What's the correct way to add plugins to a character file?  
  **A**: For JSON files use "plugins": ["<@1300745997625982977>os/plugin-coinmarketcap"], for TS files import the plugin and add to plugins array.

- **Q**: How can I clear chat memory?  
  **A**: Drop the table in the database or use removeAllMemories function in packages/core/src/memory.ts.

- **Q**: How much RAM is needed per agent?  
  **A**: Around 1.5-2GB per agent. 4GB had OOM issues.

- **Q**: How do I add knowledge from PDFs to my agent?  
  **A**: Use folder2knowledge and knowledge2character tools.

- **Q**: How do I fix dependency issues during build?  
  **A**: Add missing dependencies with commands like "pnpm add viem --filter <@1300745997625982977>os/client-lens".

### Project Direction
- **Q**: What is the status of the launchpad?  
  **A**: The launchpad is 95% complete, with final AI features being added and initial partners being finalized.

- **Q**: Is the team planning to release a new token?  
  **A**: No, there are no existing discussions about additional tokens beyond ai16z and degenai.

- **Q**: What is the financial status of the project?  
  **A**: The team has a healthy stable allocation providing approximately one year of runway, plus revenue from Eliza Studios.

- **Q**: Will there be a roadmap?  
  **A**: Yes, the CPO is working on a roadmap to be published on the main site, targeted for next week.

- **Q**: How is business development being handled?  
  **A**: The team has refined the BD process with an automated CRM system and is focusing on high-level partnerships beyond promotional activities.

### AI & Show Development
- **Q**: Is the Block Tank show autonomous?  
  **A**: We generate the show in one shot, it's not realtime yet.

- **Q**: When will the first Block Tank be?  
  **A**: This weekend.

- **Q**: Is the writer's room open source?  
  **A**: Writer's room part isn't open source.

- **Q**: How deep seek implementation of the reasoning model could improve auto trading and DegenAI?  
  **A**: It's better to limit how much LLMs influence trading strategy due to hallucination.

- **Q**: Do we have a data aggregator that we use that anyone can tap into?  
  **A**: Jin runs the aggregator, and boom has created parsing scripts for it.

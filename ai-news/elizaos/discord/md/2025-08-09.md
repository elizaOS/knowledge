# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-09

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Clank Tank v2 Development
Jin is actively working on Clank Tank v2, which appears to be a platform for pitching ideas with media support for MP4 and YouTube videos. Development includes creating an about page and how-it-works section. This project seems to be a significant focus for the elizaOS team currently.

### AI Agents Strategy
Jin outlined plans to develop new AI agents trained on their data to propagate their vision. They emphasized that "good agents sell visions" similar to how good apps sell phones and good games sell consoles. A "council of AI agents" was mentioned as a future feature to discuss community questions and share ideas.

### Development Environment Challenges
Windows development using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with Cursor IDE was discussed, with community members sharing solutions for a smoother workflow. Options included using Remote Explorer extension, WSL extension, or launching directly from Ubuntu terminal using "cursor ." commands.

### Database Connectivity Updates
A significant technical update revealed that the adapter-supabase plugin is no longer needed for newer Eliza versions. Instead, direct Postgres connection using the Supabase URL is now sufficient, simplifying the integration process.

### Social Media Presence
The community discussed elizaOS's suspended Twitter/X account, which has been inactive for approximately two months. Some members expressed concern about this limiting visibility to potential new users/investors, while others indicated they are working on getting the account restored.

### Zerebro Project Status
Jin clarified that Zerebro was just a test project with a parody episode where the presenter kept running out of API credits and crashing. Community members noted that the project founder "Jeffy" is no longer involved and has launched a new token, with Zerebro unlikely to return.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I avoid reminding Cursor to use WSL every time?**  
A: Use Remote Explorer extension with WSL extension, or launch from Ubuntu terminal with "cursor ." (answered by dEXploarer)

**Q: Is any MCP built for ElizaOS yet?**  
A: There is an MCP plugin that allows agents to use MCP (answered by dEXploarer)

**Q: How to get the adapter-supabase plugin to work on the new Eliza?**  
A: Direct Postgres URL connection works without specialized adapter (answered by cjft)

**Q: Is Zerebro still a thing? Is there a team still building on it?**  
A: No, this was just a test, and the zerebro episode was a parody too. In the pitch he kept running out of API credits and crashing out. (answered by jin)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### WSL Development Environment Setup
dEXploarer helped Rabbidfly with frustration regarding repeatedly configuring Cursor IDE to use WSL. They provided multiple solutions including using Remote Explorer extension with WSL extension, and launching directly from Ubuntu terminal using "cursor ." commands.

### Database Connection Guidance
cjft assisted GeorgeLugo with connecting Supabase to new Eliza versions, sharing that direct Postgres URL connection works without the specialized adapter-supabase plugin and providing a connection string example.

### AI Implementation Sharing
yikesawjeez shared their implementation of a sophisticated Kanban board system using AI with SQLite and tmux panes, created by prompting AI to "manage your subagents with state machines and a kanban board. use sqlite. give me a dashboard in tmux panes."

- Devansh Mehta proposed a Pump Fun-inspired model for AI agents on Solana with standardized launch mechanics
- Debates about the structural weaknesses of alt:alt liquidity pools and their vulnerability during market downturns
- The Binance futures listing of AI16Z (with 75x leverage) has sparked discussions about its implications

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I convert knowledge files to character files?**  
A: Use `npm install` followed by `node scripts/knowledge2character.js path/to/character.character path/to/knowledge.knowledge` (answered by 0x8664)

**Q: How much does it cost to run an agent?**  
A: $0 if running locally with Ollama, otherwise depends on API usage and hosting costs (answered by Chop)

**Q: Can I run Eliza on a Raspberry Pi?**  
A: Yes, if using external APIs for the LLM processing (answered by Chop)

**Q: How do I fix "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'actions')" error?**  
A: This is likely a plugin error, try deleting all plugins except the ones you want to use (answered by SotoAlt | BOSSU)

**Q: Is it possible for a non-dev to create an AI agent with Eliza?**  
A: Yes, we are looking for passionate non-devs (answered by BOSSU)

**Q: Where can I see a list of top agents built using elizaOS?**  
A: https://elizas.world (answered by Osint)

**Q: Why might users revolt against paying "tax" to virtuals or any launchpad?**  
A: Users prefer paying one-time percentage fees rather than being permanently linked to another protocol's token (answered by thedevanshmehta)

**Q: What is RPGF that Jin mentioned in latest update?**  
A: Retroactive public goods funding (answered by hukus)

**Q: Are we still only on Solana?**  
A: No (answered by jin)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Mike D.** helped **Affaan** debug a "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'actions')" error by suggesting a complete rebuild process: `nvm install --lts; nvm use --lts; rm -rf node_modules/; rm -rf dist/; pnpm i && pnpm build && pnpm start; pnpm rebuild`

- **0xwitch** assisted **jin** by organizing and documenting all ElizaOS plugins, creating one-liner descriptions, and grouping them into functional categories for easier reference

- **DanielJTrujillo** helped **jin** with developing a 3D visualization tool for market cap data, creating atlas textures, depth/normal maps, and improving file organization

- **Bilal Motiwala** supported **il.a** with adding PDFs to agent knowledge by sharing links to the folder2knowledge script and relevant documentation

- **b0nes** guided **CriticalBarny** through setting up PostgreSQL database by explaining how to use the POSTGRES_URL environment variable and check agent/index.ts for database initialization

- **Wampa1** advised **Scooter** on hardware requirements for audio processing, providing guidance on GPU specs needed for audio transcription and processing

- **boom** shared technical implementations with the community about picture-in-picture functionality in the 3D AI TV project by tagging cameras with "IgnoreCam" and using two cameras in the same position to avoid visible cuts

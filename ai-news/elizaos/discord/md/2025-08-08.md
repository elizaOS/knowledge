# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Issues & Fixes
- **Critical Build Issues**: A logger-related bug was identified that broke the entire ecosystem, stemming from a package.json update that changed dependency versions. The team decided to merge a fix to unblock developers on the develop branch.
- **Version Compatibility Problems**: Users reported issues when updating from version 0.1.9 to newer versions (1.x), particularly with actions that previously triggered consistently no longer working due to behavioral changes in newer Eliza core versions.
- **CLI Command Errors**: Users encountered build errors with the "elizaos create" command, receiving TypeScript errors about string arguments not being assignable to undefined parameters.

### Architecture & Performance Discussions
- **Streaming Implementation**: Detailed technical discussion about inefficiencies in the current token-by-token streaming implementation using event emitters versus native HTTP streaming (SSE/chunked). The current approach could cause latency issues, CPU overhead, and memory problems.
- **Client Communication Layer**: Team discussed the need to rethink and remake the client communication layer, supporting both SSE and websockets from the server.

### Project Updates
- **Clank Tank Progress**: User "jin" reported fixing bugs in the "clank tank" project, which has reached a promising stage with commercial potential.
- **Documentation Videos**: 5 documentation videos remain to be completed.

### Business & Community
- **Project Valuation Discussions**: Comparison of project valuation to Vercel (maker of v0), with suggestions that AI16z is undervalued. Discussion about closing the valuation gap with Virtuals (valued at 800-900 million vs AI16z at 140 million).
- **Platform Strategy**: Suggestion to prevent projects from building on Eliza and then launching on Virtuals to protect valuation.
- **Governance**: Confirmation that the move to Eliza from AI16z and DAO governance has already happened.

### AI Model Comparisons
- User Snapper shared a video comparing GPT-5 vs Claude Code in Cursor, specifically testing basic Eliza tasks including creating a character.ts file.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical
- **Q**: Why is the build failing on develop?  
  **A**: It's due to logger-related type errors caused by a package.json update that changed dependency versions.

- **Q**: Anyone else having issues with the elizaos create command?  
  **A**: It might be trying to load an old boilerplate; check for updates and examine the project structure.

- **Q**: Was the action triggering behavior changed in the update?  
  **A**: Yes, it was changed in the recent update.

- **Q**: Does this mean I can't use the latest version of Eliza for this purpose?  
  **A**: Make your description and examples better and you should be good; the issue should be fixed in 1.3.3; try 1.4.2 latest.

- **Q**: Why is using `workspace:*` for packages not working for docker image builds?  
  **A**: On release it's likely using numbered versions; try the develop branch which should be fixed.

### Business & Community
- **Q**: How many tokens/token package do you need if using OpenAI API for the simplest agent?  
  **A**: It depends on the model you choose and the usage you need.

- **Q**: When are we moving to Eliza from AI16z and DAO governance?  
  **A**: It has already happened.

- **Q**: What ticker symbol could be used for ElizaOS?  
  **A**: DorianD suggested XEO, following the trend of putting X in front of abbreviations like xbt, xrp, xmr.

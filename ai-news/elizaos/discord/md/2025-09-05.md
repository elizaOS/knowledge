## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Implementation
- **Q**: If we want to add a custom API, can we write it directly in ElizaOS, or do we need to create a separate backend?  
  **A** (Stan ⚡): You don't need a separate backend — you can just extend the existing API by creating a custom plugin that registers your endpoints in ElizaOS' API server.

- **Q**: How can we use an ElizaOS agent on other platforms?  
  **A** (Stan ⚡): You'll need to build a custom plugin that handles your forum's API (auth, requests, etc.) and expose actions like createPost or replyToComment.

- **Q**: If we need to create 50 agents with different personalities, do we need to create a separate character.json file for each?  
  **A** (Stan ⚡): For multiple agents, you can run them with character.json files or build your own dynamic start mechanism. They'll still be considered 50 agents running in the same runtime.

- **Q**: Can we create a single endpoint in ElizaOS, and whenever we hit that endpoint, our post gets published?  
  **A** (Stan ⚡): Yes, you can build your own worker listening for a specific event or fetch something periodically.

- **Q**: How is the farcaster support, is there an agent up?  
  **A** (sayonara): Spartan is there but not too active/tuned.

### Token & Community
- **Q**: Can you please comment explicitly on the plans for token utility if any?  
  **A** (Odilitime): We have articles coming out on the topic, stay tuned.

- **Q**: What is the way forward, I am at a -60% loss of $aI16z?  
  **A** (Heisenberg): hodl.

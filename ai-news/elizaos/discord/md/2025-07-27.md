# elizaOS Discord - 2025-07-27

**Date: July 27, 2025**

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Progress
- **Browser Extension Development**: cjft is working on an Eliza browser extension to overcome automation limitations with puppeteer/playwright, providing more stable browser integration without Google Cloud API dependencies.
- **Containerized Architecture**: Shaw reported significant progress on a containerized application that enables Eliza to run with Tauri through websockets, PostgreSQL and Ollama, creating a fully local agent application that self-installs Podman if Docker isn't available.
- **Game Implementation**: Shaw shared progress on a game implementation with working container and lifecycle components built in an "App store friendly way," noting that moving containers to cloud could enable iPhone compatibility.
- **Clank Tank v2**: Jin described this as a "sleeping giant" and expressed enthusiasm about the upcoming system that will power the new version.

### Governance & Community
- **Governance Development**: Wire mentioned that "governance is being built" and directed users to read a post by Jin on X (Twitter) for more information.
- **Token Holder Snapshot**: Jin reported taking "another snapshot of token holders" and confirmed that a voting system is now working.
- **Eli5 Visual Assets**: The community discussed creating visual assets for the Eli5 project, particularly a spaceship design. Dr. Neuro shared several concepts and received feedback, with the community preferring a green-colored "E5" spaceship design.

### Documentation & Resources
- **Documentation Consolidation**: The team discussed consolidating documentation under the eliza.how domain due to confusion about multiple documentation sites.
- **Developer Resources**: R0am shared resources including a Tauri plugin for MCP clients and demonstrated self-hosting capabilities using containers on a NAS with code-server, Claude, and Kimi API integration.

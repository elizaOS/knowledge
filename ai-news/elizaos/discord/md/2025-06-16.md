# elizaOS Discord - 2025-06-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Ecosystem & Integrations
- **Yield Yak AI-Managed Vault**: A significant integration was highlighted where Yield Yak released an AI-managed vault on Avalanche built using the Eliza infrastructure. The agent communicates through Discord or Telegram, makes vault decisions every 3 hours, has on-chain pre-verification for safety, and includes protection against prompt injection.
- **Twitter Agent Development**: Discussion about a Twitter agent whose code was removed from GitHub. Several users expressed interest in rebuilding or creating alternatives.
- **ELI5 Project**: Community members discussed the ELI5 project's market performance and potential expansion as an AI agent with new capabilities, including Twitter and Reddit integration.
- **AI.gov Connection**: References to a GitHub leak connecting ElizaOS Framework to a government AI project called "AI.gov" generated significant discussion, though official confirmation is lacking.

### Technical Issues & Troubleshooting
- **Plugin Compatibility Issues**: Multiple users encountered problems with the knowledge plugin during installation and loading, primarily due to version mismatches between core components (0.x and 1.x).
- **Twitter Plugin Requirements**: Users discovered that certain Twitter plugin functionality requires a paid Twitter API subscription, causing 403 errors for those using the free tier.
- **Account Suspensions**: Several accounts related to the ecosystem, including ElizaOS and Shaw's X accounts, were reportedly suspended for bypassing official API policies.

### Business Applications
- **EDI Connections**: Discussion about AI agents potentially handling Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) connections between business systems, which could democratize access to this technology for smaller businesses.
- **Government Contracting**: One participant mentioned using AI (specifically VSCode and Llama) to write 90% of their code for government contracting work.
- **Car Sales Leads**: Potential use of AI agents for generating car sales leads through social media content was proposed.

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-07-28

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Plugin Development & Technical Infrastructure
- The core-devs team is developing a browser extension using Chrome's desktopCapture API to create a Cluely-like experience that can listen to calls and provide AI assistance without requiring separate accounts
- Several users reported issues with specific plugins including EVM, Gaianet, and Ollama
- The Gaianet plugin appears to be missing in the current version, with suggestions to build a custom plugin following the Venice plugin as an example
- Discussions about creating a comprehensive ecosystem with desktop apps, mobile apps, and browser extensions that would sync context across devices while maintaining privacy
- Team noted the impressive performance of GLM-4.5, an open-source model outperforming most competitors except Sonnet and Opus
- Debate about prioritizing game development versus cloud infrastructure

### Project Status & Roadmap
- Community members confirmed the ElizaOS team is still active, pointing to GitHub as evidence of ongoing development
- Upcoming developments mentioned include "elizacloud" and "clanktank"
- Clarification that ElizaOS is the agent framework with the ticker $ai16z (token address HeLp6NuQkmYB4pYWo2zYs22mESHXPQYzXbB8n4V98jwC)
- Hackathon extension announced by jin, noting this would be the final extension

### Token & Community Discussion
- Significant discussion about ELI5, a token in the auto.fun ecosystem, with community members expressing enthusiasm about its potential growth
- Interest in developing lore around ELI5, with plans to build character narratives
- Dr. Neuro provided a detailed explanation differentiating ELI5 from AI16z: ELI5 explains complex concepts simply, while AI16z is portrayed as a team of AI agents that build and execute tasks
- Suggestion that auto.fun should focus on "proof of project" rather than memes, positioning itself as an AI launchpad for startups
- Monetization strategies discussed, including a token-based credit system for cloud services while keeping local features free

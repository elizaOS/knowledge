## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why did Dabit remove his YT video about building an AI agent with Eliza?**

A: Set up dynamic providers, describe providers properly, and use messageHandlerTemplate for agent planning. Bind provider outputs in custom actions.

**Q: Do I need to edit core lib for custom plugin development?**  
A: No need to work in core/plugin-bootstrap, you can change instructions by providing your own messageHandlerTemplate.

**Q: Is there an ElizaOS Coolify container?**

**Q: What is A2A?**  
A: A2A is the new Agent Capital Market where agents will transact with one another autonomously, settling in AI16Z tokens.

**Q: Will there be new flywheels implemented for ai16z with the official v2 launch?**  
A: No tokenomics updates alongside v2 push, they'll come a little later down the line.

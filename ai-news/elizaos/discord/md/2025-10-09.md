# elizaOS Discord - 2025-10-09

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token Migration (October 21st)
- **Migration ratio**: 1 ai16z token will convert to 6 elizaOS tokens, with 4 additional tokens going to the Generative Treasury
- **Supply changes**: Total supply will expand from 6.6B to 11B (+40%) gradually over 3 years
- **Circulating supply** will increase by 1.49B (+13%) immediately at migration
- **Cross-chain implementation**: elizaOS will operate on both Solana (SVM) and Ethereum (EVM) chains using Chainlink CCIP
- **Technical improvements**: Removing mint authority from daos.fun, enabling native cross-chain operations, and opening doors for exchange listings
- **Community concerns**: Several partners expressed dissatisfaction with the redistribution plan and lack of transparency about vesting schedules

### Cloud Platform Development
- Team working toward a **November 17th deadline** for cloud platform features
- **Authentication refactoring** from WorkOS to Privvy to support L2 keypairs
- **Container deployment** and testing in production using alpha nightly CLI builds
- **Credit tracking optimization** with potential Redis implementation for caching
- **Email pipeline** setup for cloud announcements using Sendgrid or Resend

### Mobile App Strategy
- Debate over mobile approach: **React Native vs. adapting existing Next.js web app**
- Team leaning toward developing a dedicated React Native mobile app

### RAG Implementation Issues
- Developer experiencing inconsistent results with search functionality
- Using OpenAI embeddings with GPT-4 mini with problems where model sometimes doesn't use retrieved fragments
- Potential issues identified: prompt engineering (instructing agent to check for facts) and similarity matching in database

### Technical Challenges
- **Zod library version compatibility issues** (3.x to 4.x migration)
- Discord link-sharing permissions causing problems for developers
- Consideration of using **LiteLLM for billing/API credential management** instead of building custom solutions

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What is the ratio for the migration from ai16z to elizaOS?**  
A: 6:1 - holders swap 1 $ai16z for 6 $elizaOS (answered by MDMnvest)

**Q: Where is the 4 $elizaOS used?**  
A: These tokens go to the Generative Treasury to seed autonomous multichain agents for yield generation, liquidity, and ecosystem growth (answered by MDMnvest)

**Q: Will DegenAI face difficulties after migration since elizaOS is EVM and DegenAI is on Solana?**  
A: No difficulties anticipated as elizaOS will be SVM + EVM, and DegenAI will remain on Solana (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Will CEXs like Gate and Bybit support token migration?**  
A: The team will inform if they're aware of exchanges that will automatically migrate ahead of the 21st (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Why does my search functionality sometimes hit and sometimes miss when retrieving fragments for the LLM?**  
A: The issues may be related to prompting the agent to always check for facts and similarity matching problems in the database. (answered by 0xbbjoker)

**Q: Do we need Redis in front of NextJS SaaS for credit tracking?**  
A: Initially disagreed but later agreed it would be useful for both credits and Eliza serverless queries (answered by cjft)

**Q: Should we be building billing/API credential management ourselves?**  
A: We could leverage LiteLLM which provides this functionality out of the box (answered by sayonara)

## Community Help & Collaboration

**RAG Implementation Troubleshooting**  
Helper: 0xbbjoker | Helpee: midnight  
Context: User experiencing inconsistent results with RAG implementation where search retrieves fragments but LLM doesn't use them  
Resolution: Suggested two potential issues - prompting the agent to always check for facts and similarity matching problems in the database.

**Token Migration Clarification**  
Helper: MDMnvest | Helpee: VirginVanDijk  
Context: Confusion about dilution and conversion ratio  
Resolution: Explained that dilution will happen over time with 7.36X immediately or 8.1B tokens

**Scam Prevention**  
Helper: Odilitime | Helpee: admin123456  
Context: Warning about scammers pretending to be moderators  
Resolution: Banned scammers and prevented users from using "moderator" as a name

**Zod Library Compatibility**  
Helper: Odilitime | Helpee: Odilitime  
Context: Zod library version compatibility issue with plugin-openrouter  
Resolution: Identified that `.loose()` was removed in Zod 4.x and should be replaced with `.passthrough()`

**Discord Link Sharing**  
Helper: Kenk | Helpee: 0xbbjoker  
Context: Unable to send links in Discord  
Resolution: Turned off URL blocker but noted it was hitting standard Discord spam filters

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-12-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Migration and Token Management Crisis

The elizaOS community faced significant challenges with the ai16z to ELIZAOS token migration, particularly affecting Korean holders on Bithumb exchange. The migration process, which began with a November 11th snapshot, has left Bithumb users unable to complete their token swap while other exchanges have successfully cooperated. jasyn_bjorn assured the community that anyone holding ai16z before November 11th (on-chain or CEX) will receive support, though the timeline remains uncertain as the situation is in Bithumb's hands.

A major controversy erupted around token transparency when community members questioned why old ai16z tokens weren't burned after migration. degenwtf and averma raised concerns about potential team selling, pointing to wallet addresses allegedly moving 10 million ai16z daily. jasyn_bjorn defended the team by providing the migrator wallet address (B2aBAMAhCqUVZD66Vy2Bij87k5C117BB1a1C7iabt74J) and stating that all ~300 million ai16z from user migrations are accounted for. However, questions about the location of 180 million tokens and ongoing selling pressure remained unanswered, contributing to community frustration as the token price reached new lows at 30% of its post-migration high.

### Technical Infrastructure and Performance

**Monorepo Stabilization:** Stan completed critical stabilization work after Shaw's cleanup broke the build. He fixed broken types, tests, and added missing try/catch blocks, restoring all builds to green status. He also repaired log retrieval over WebSocket that was falling back to HTTP after pino removal. PR #6218 was prepared for merge to unblock other PRs, with plans to rebase open PRs and release version 1.7.0.

**Database Performance Issues:** Odilitime identified significant performance degradation with pglite providers, reporting 900ms response times versus normal <10ms on the same hardware. He suspects either excessive data accumulation or too much parallel processing causing IO contention during bootstrap. Multiple users in the coders channel struggled with database setup, with Sayonara recommending switching from pglite to postgres for better stability.

**Security Vulnerabilities:** Jin discovered React security vulnerabilities requiring immediate updates (denial-of-service and source code exposure in React Server Components). Odilitime responded by patching elizaos.ai to Next.js 16.0.10. Jin also fixed workflow issues and set up failure alerts to the alerts channel for better monitoring.

**Bundle Optimization Opportunities:** Technical discussions revealed that the elizaos/client bundle contains extensive syntax highlighting for multiple languages (emacs-lisp, fortran, cobol, php) and a 2.6mb minified mermaid charts dependency that could benefit from optimization.

### ElizaOS Development Challenges

**Twitter Integration Issues:** FenrirFawks reported excessive API consumption - 50 requests per tweet, which Odilitime confirmed was abnormal behavior. Disabling reply functionality reduced request consumption. Redvoid mentioned a TypeScript fix PR addressing build issues and SQL errors in plugin-twitter, and advertised a client-twitter version using login/password without API requirements.

**LLM Provider Configuration:** LordWeb3 attempted to use DeepSeek API keys directly but learned OpenRouter requires its own key. Sayonara provided a workaround: use DeepSeek keys with the OpenAI plugin by replacing the endpoint URL.

**Web3/x402 Integration:** Roman V sought guidance on enabling web3 and x402 payment capabilities. Odilitime clarified that x402 payment acceptance in plugin routes is still being rolled out and no x402 client exists yet. Stan's roadmap includes reviewing Odi's 402x work with updated test architecture.

### Community Initiatives and Events

**Sapience Hackathon:** Kenk announced a live Sapience x elizaOS hackathon with $10,000 prize from Arbitrum DAO, running until January 3rd, 2026. The hackathon focuses on building prediction market agents, with workshops scheduled.

**Informal Prediction Market:** DorianD initiated an informal prediction market betting on ELIZAOS price at New Year's Eve, proposing a spreadsheet-based system with time-weighted decay multipliers. Omid Sa placed 3000 ELIZAOS betting the price will be above $0.01.

**Knowledge Base Updates:** Jin fixed data pipelines for the elizaOS knowledge repository, adding RSS feeds and MCP server support (untested).

**Babylon Launch:** Odilitime confirmed that Babylon is launching as a web browser game rather than requiring local installation from GitHub. The repository has moved to https://github.com/BabylonSocial/babylon.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Are there plans for migration support for Bithumb holders who held tokens before the November 11th snapshot?**  
A: The team is working on a solution with Bithumb; anyone with ai16z before November 11th on-chain or CEX will be fine (jasyn_bjorn)

**Q: Why weren't the old ai16z tokens burned after migration?**  
A: The migration was never intended to be a burn; all ~300m ai16z from user migrations are accounted for in the migrator wallet (jasyn_bjorn)

**Q: How can I migrate ai16z tokens from SafePal wallet?**  
A: Import your SafePal into Phantom or any Solana wallet and migrate (Hexx)

**Q: What is the migrator wallet address?**  
A: B2aBAMAhCqUVZD66Vy2Bij87k5C117BB1a1C7iabt74J (jasyn_bjorn)

**Q: How do I switch from pglite to postgres?**  
A: Add postgres url to .env or use `elizaos create -t project` and prefix start command with `POSTGRES_URL=your-postgres-url elizaos start` (sayonara)

**Q: How do I declare the DeepSeek key in .env file so it can be detected?**  
A: You need OpenRouter key not DeepSeek key, but you can use DeepSeek key with openai plugin by replacing endpoint url (sayonara)

**Q: Is it normal that the twitter agent takes 50 requests for every call?**  
A: Sounds bad, not normal (Odilitime)

**Q: What's the up-to-date approach for web3 and x402 services integration?**  
A: Still rolling out x402 payments in plugin routes, no x402 client made yet (Odilitime)

**Q: Is Babylon launching as a web browser game or requiring local installation from GitHub?**  
A: Web browser game (Odilitime)

**Q: Did babylon repo move?**  
A: Yes, it's now at https://github.com/BabylonSocial/babylon (Odilitime)

**Q: Is the performance issue since a specific version or from adding more providers?**  
A: It's the basic stuff in bootstrap, likely from data collection accumulating too much data or too much parallel processing causing IO contention (Odilitime)

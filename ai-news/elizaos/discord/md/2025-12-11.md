## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I migrate my AI16Z tokens from SafePal wallet?**

**Q: What would be the correct way to declare the deepsek key in my.env file so that it can be detected?**

**Q: I don't have tokens in OpenRouter, but I do have tokens in DeepSeek, is it possible to connect?**

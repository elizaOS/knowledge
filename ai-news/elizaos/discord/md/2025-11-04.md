## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can someone explain what will happen to the coins on November 7th?**  
A: 1 token AI16Z equals 6 tokens ElizaOS, with a 90-day migration window.

**Q: Which wallets or exchanges will do the migration automatically?**  
A: Basically anything not an exchange you'll have to migrate manually. If you don't own the keys it'll be automatic.

**Q: Will there be a snapshot?**  
A: No snapshot. You'll have 90 days to migrate your AI16Z.

**Q: Why is there a high APY on USDC? 35% is really huge.**  
A: Because they are exposed to systemic risk with XUSD... avoid it as funds may become trapped.

**Q: x402 payment configs in project init (with runtime::registerPaymentConfig) OR in character file?**  
A: If characters can have personal wallets, then configurations can go directly into the character for 402x.

**Q: Do characters currently own personal wallets or is it agent/server wide?**  
A: You can use ENV vars to set defaults but can override in character secrets, enabling wallets per agent.

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Platform Updates
- **Version 0.25.8 Released**: Odilitime announced the release of ElizaOS v0.25.8 with plugins moved out of the main codebase to a separate repository at https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/
- **ElizaOS V2 Development**: Witch clarified that ElizaOS V2 codebase is being developed by Shaw with an expected release in early April or sooner
- **Rebranding Progress**: The team is working on rebranding ai16z to ElizaOS, including consolidating X (Twitter) accounts by swapping the @elizaOS and @ai16zdao handles while maintaining followers
- **Token Status**: The ai16z token will maintain the same contract address through the rebrand, with plans to promote the token and announce planned tokenomics after the rebrand is complete

### Technical Discussions
- **Memory Allocation Issues**: Multiple users reported JavaScript heap out of memory errors when using RAG knowledge, with solutions involving increasing Node.js memory limits using `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"`
- **Embedding Model Problems**: Users experienced issues with embedding models for RAG knowledge, particularly with the BGE model not being found, with suggestions to use `text-embedding-ada-002` instead
- **Plugin Architecture Changes**: Confusion about the new plugin architecture after plugins were moved out of the main ElizaOS repository, with some plugins accidentally removed from the registry
- **L2 Development**: DorianD has been working on building an L2 for ElizaOS using Solana validators, proposing a system where ai16z tokens could be staked to run validator or RPC nodes
- **Agent Memory Systems**: Hidden Forces raised questions about implementing functional memory systems that exist outside character JSON files, specifically for managing podcast episode data

### Community Projects
- **Instacart Agent**: Scooper shared their successful implementation of an Instacart agent built on Eliza that helps with meal planning and grocery ordering within budget constraints
- **AI News Aggregator**: Jin reported progress on an AI news aggregator that collects historical data from X, Discord, GitHub, and markets, with summarization capabilities
- **DegenSpartanAI Trading**: Community members discussed the performance of DegenSpartanAI, a trading AI agent in early development, with Osint providing detailed technical suggestions for improving its trading strategy
- **Community Analysis Tools**: Jin mentioned plans to combine discord-summarizer and ai-news repositories to filter out noise in the community, find pain points, reward contributors, and create FAQ content for AI agents

A: Using a combination of Labs/Studios partnerships, builder chats, demo days, and ecosystem funding to promote quality projects. (answered by accelxr)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Memory Allocation Solutions**:  
   boolkeys helped Pleasures resolve JavaScript heap out of memory errors by providing the command to increase Node.js memory allocation: `export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"` with options for different memory sizes.

2. **Embedding Model Troubleshooting**:  
   Sabochee assisted Waqas Wahid with embedding model errors in RAG knowledge by suggesting the use of `text-embedding-ada-002` model in character config.

3. **PostgreSQL Configuration**:  
   PΞTE provided detailed instructions to the community on configuring PostgreSQL with ElizaOS, including correct URL format and schema location.

4. **Trading Strategy Suggestions**:  
   Osint (aka not_in_a_dao_ai) provided DegenSpartanAI developers with a detailed workflow proposal for improving trading strategies, including BTC range monitoring, using coinrotator.app, and trading on daily timeframes.

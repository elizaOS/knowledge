## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Blockchain Development: Jeju L3
- **New L3 Blockchain Announcement**: Shaw revealed "Jeju," an OP stack L3 chain rolling up to Base, optimized for games, AI, and applications
- **Technical Stack**: Using EigenDA for data availability with domains secured at jeju.network and jeju.sh
- **Strategic Positioning**: Building an L3 rather than L2 is 50-100x cheaper while still potentially receiving Ethereum Foundation resources and Base support
- **Partnerships**: Signed partnership with Sui, with potential integration with Walrus

### AI Applications & Hardware
- **Hardware Form Factors**: Discussion about AI companion hardware including Meta Ray-Ban glasses, patches, and wearables for audio capture
- **Cloud Strategy**: Shaw mentioned a shift toward consumer-focused cloud applications with AI characters having real capabilities (voice, video, collaboration)
- **AI as Learning Tool**: CheddarQueso shared experiences using Claude as a personalized tutor that explains concepts through analogies

### Gaming & Prediction Markets
- **In-Game Economies**: DorianD discussed the evolution of virtual currencies and how crypto has changed the landscape previously restricted by money transmission regulations
- **AI in Prediction Markets**: Exploration of AI agents facilitating betting by building relationships with users, analyzing data, and executing transactions
- **F1 Racing Project**: Kenk mentioned a side project combining fan engagement with prediction markets
- **Game Economy Design**: Shaw suggested embracing inflation for in-game currency while focusing on user growth and betting opportunities

### Development Resources
- **Environment Setup**: Discussion about .env configuration files in the elizaOS/eliza repository
- **Onboarding Issues**: Pepec01 reported errors related to adding a new Agent ("No world found for user during onboarding" and "No server ownership found for onboarding")
- **Resource Sharing**: DorianD shared a "Lean AI Company Playbook" PDF with the community

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why build an L3 instead of an L2?**  
A: It's WAY cheaper to run, and strategically EF will give the same resources if we are L2 or L3, but Base will list us and support us if we are L3 (answered by shaw)

**Q: What is the blockchain called?**  
A: Jeju, named after a South Korean island. "I like the metaphor of an island for an L3" (answered by shaw)

**Q: Is there an example .env file in the repo?**  
A: Yes, there's an example .env file at https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/develop/.env.example (answered by CheddarQueso ðŸ§€)

**Q: How could AI agents be used for sports betting?**  
A: They could interface with platforms like Polymarket, analyze contextual data from multiple sources, and build relationships with users while facilitating bets (answered by Kenk)

**Q: What approach should be taken for in-game currencies?**  
A: Allow inflation over time, focus on user growth, and provide betting opportunities with both real money and in-game currency (answered by shaw)

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-28

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Legal & Business Developments
- **Major Antitrust Lawsuit**: ElizaOS has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter) for allegedly suspending ElizaOS accounts and blocking sharing of ElizaOS GitHub links and website URLs
- Community members expressed support for Shaw in this legal battle, noting that Musk has previously criticized similar censorship practices
- Some users mentioned that Shaw had alluded to legal action as far back as June

### Technical Updates & Releases
- **Version 1.5.0 Released** with significant changes:
  - Bun build support and browser core compatibility
  - Reverted processActions to use cacheState for retrieving action results
  - Refined prompt logic for authentication
  - Added multi-step workflow execution system with configurable strategy modes
  - Custom SHA1 solution implemented for browser compatibility to maintain existing agent IDs
- **Logging System Change**: Decision made to replace Pino with Adze for logging, offering namespaces and colored output
- **Browser Compatibility**: Successfully made packages/client fully functional with zero polyfills
- **LLM Performance Testing**: GPT-4o significantly outperforms Opus-3 for ElizaOS tasks (2-3 minutes vs 8-10 minutes completion time)

### Cryptocurrency & Tokens
- Active discussion about ELI5 and EDDY tokens in the ecosystem
- EDDY described as having "real AI utility" within ElizaOS, functioning as an internal coding assistant
- Some users experiencing issues with token migration/bonding not completing
- References to "Agent Shaw," an AI agent trained on ElizaOS to mimic SHAW

### Plugin & Integration Discussions
- Twitter plugin compatibility issues discussed - older versions (1.0.7/1.0.9) support user/pass/email authentication while newer versions require paid API access
- Farcaster plugin mentioned as an alternative to Twitter
- OpenRouter announced a 49-minute outage due to their database provider (Supabase) going down

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is the lawsuit between ElizaOS and Twitter/X real?**  
A: Yes, it's real. (confirmed with Reuters article link)

**Q: Where in the monorepo do agent details get stored when created using the UI?**  
A: In the ".eliza" directory if you're not using an external database.

**Q: How can I find the Twitter plugin that supports user/pass/email?**  
A: Newer versions use a newer API which costs. Version 1.0.7 (or possibly up to 1.0.9) is the last version supporting the old authentication method.

**Q: What's the benefit of adze for logging?**  
A: It has namespaces and plugins can make their own channel.

**Q: What's wrong with whisper?**  
A: It broke upstream. There was an attempt to fix it but other deadlines took priority.

**Q: Are you using ollama for Local LLM?**  
A: Yes.

**Q: What is EDDY's role in the ecosystem?**  
A: EDDY has real AI utility and plays an important role in "the - org" as an internal coding assistant similar to ChatGPT.

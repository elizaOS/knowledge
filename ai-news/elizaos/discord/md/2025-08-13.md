# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-13

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Architecture & Development Direction
- **Core Architecture Debate**: Significant discussion about ElizaOS's architecture, with Shaw defending the current design as a social agent framework with intentional tradeoffs rather than primarily a tool-calling framework
- **Design Philosophy**: Debate between simplifying the framework to a more basic core runtime approach versus maintaining the current architecture with its event system and social capabilities
- **Technical Focus**: Agreement that the framework should prioritize building engaging demos over refactoring, with emphasis on maintaining ElizaOS's unique social agent capabilities

### Clank Tank 2.0 Governance Platform
- Jin introduced "Clank Tank 2.0," a governance platform combining elements of Shark Tank, AI, prediction markets, and DAO governance
- The platform features AI judges representing different archetypes (casual, quant, degen, builder) who evaluate submissions through multiple rounds
- Technical implementation includes client-side rendering with PlayCanvas to generate video episodes for distribution
- Currently in V2 beta testing with improved graphics, animation, backend, and reasoning logic

### ElizaOS Ecosystem Growth
- User 3on_ highlighted several projects built on ElizaOS including Tapestryai, Pixels, Bonsai, and Comput3ai
- Discussion about "vibecoding" which would simplify agent creation without requiring technical tools like Cursor or Bun
- Speculation about potential monetization strategies and multilingual support to expand adoption
- Debate about how technical advancements relate to the token's value, with questions about tokenomics and utility

### Plugin Development & Integration
- Users discussed integrating decentralized compute providers like Morpheus AI for GPU-intensive tasks
- Troubleshooting MCP (Message Control Protocol) implementation issues and plugin configuration problems
- Discussion about using plugin-knowledge for vector database storage and combining it with plugin-discord for message handling
- Exploration of using Rolodex for cross-platform agent communication

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do these technical advancements tie into the token and its price?** (asked by hildi)  
A: Not directly answered, though 3on_ speculated that when AI agents become mainstream, ElizaOS could monetize its platform to make the project sustainable.

**Q: Where is the most relevant place to have further documents about plugins?** (asked by significant_otter)  
A: Head to #plugins-support (answered by Kenk)

**Q: How can I make Eliza use several MCP tools in sequence to process a user's request?** (asked by maikyman)  
A: You'll need to customize `toolSelectionNameTemplate` in the `plugin-mcp` (answered by 0xbbjoker)

**Q: Does the plugin cut off the ending slash in URLs?** (asked by maikyman)  
A: It shouldn't cut off slashes, but the behavior was confusing (answered by 0xbbjoker)

**Q: Why don't monologue tool calling agents work as social agents?** (asked by shaw)  
A: They're optimized for different purposes - social agents need to be engaging in conversation while tool-calling agents focus on task completion.

**Q: What is complex about the current architecture?** (asked by shaw)  
A: The complexity comes from adding tooling to make it less complex, which ironically added more complexity.

**Q: Is it fair to say we build for game environments, 3D worlds, cool stuff for gooners and not enterprise workflow stuff?** (asked by sayonara)  
A: Shaw confirmed this direction, noting that competing in enterprise would mean competing with many others who are losing money.

**Q: Is there any way to increase the price of $ai16z?** (asked by MORE)  
A: Buy more, sell less? Generate ideas for the community to execute on? (answered by Odilitime)

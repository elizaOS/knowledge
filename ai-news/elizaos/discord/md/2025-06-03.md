A: Token ticker and name cannot be changed once launched.

**Q: When importing an agent character .json file, in which file are those changes saved?**

A: `npx elizaos update` will update the runtime and packages in your project without changing your code.

**Q: I shouldn't use default db for storing app data? It only for agent work? And when I need to use default db cache?**

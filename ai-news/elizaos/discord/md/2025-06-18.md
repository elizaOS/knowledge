# elizaOS Discord - 2025-06-18

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Status
- **ElizaOS v2 Status**: Borko confirmed v2 is coming "soon soon" with full visibility through commits
- **Current Release Status**: v1.0.0 beta has been released with three patch releases (up to v1.0.9), and v1.1.0 will be the official public release
- **Development Transparency**: All work is being done in the open with visible commits

### Technical Issues
- **Supabase Integration**: Multiple users experienced problems connecting to Supabase databases, particularly with vector and fuzzy matching extensions
- **Environment Variables**: Users struggled with getting ElizaOS to properly read .env files in the develop branch
- **Local LLM Configuration**: VRAM limitations when trying to run larger models caused context size errors
- **Twitter Plugin**: Loading failures despite proper installation reported by at least one user
- **Document Processing**: Duplicate processing occurring when using KNOWLEDGE_PATH with LOAD_DOCS_ON_STARTUP=true

### Community Concerns
- **Twitter Account Suspensions**: ElizaOS and Shaw's Twitter accounts were suspended, apparently related to a Twitter scraper component that has since been removed
- **FUD in Chinese Community**: Misinterpretations of Shaw's comments about code being "pieced together" led to plagiarism accusations
- **Project Timeline**: Some community members expressed frustration about perceived delays in the v2 release
- **Token Utility**: Discussions about the economic value proposition of ai16z compared to established cryptocurrencies

### Partnerships & Future Plans
- **Hardware Integration**: Potential partnership involving AI glasses that could integrate with ElizaOS plugins
- **Marketing Strategy**: Team is planning a marketing push when v2 is ready for release

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Releases
**Q: Is v1 out already or is the v1 in the announcements the previous version?**  
A: The 1.0.0 beta has been released with three patch releases (to v1.0.9), and 1.1.0 will be the official public release.

**Q: Don't you feel, delay in the project is impacting investors sentiment?**  
A: Software projects rarely deliver on time, and the team is working on improving marketing channels.

### Technical Support
**Q: Why do I get "unexpected argument '--character' found" when running "bun start --character="my-agent.json"?**  
A: Use "bunx elizaos start --character my-agent.json" instead.

**Q: Why does ElizaOS repeatedly process the same documents when KNOWLEDGE_PATH is set and LOAD_DOCS_ON_STARTUP=true?**  
A: The clientDocumentId includes Date.now() to prevent constraint errors when uploading files with the same name.

**Q: Why do I get "A context size of 8192 is too large for the available VRAM" with local LLM settings?**  
A: Use the same smaller model for both LOCAL_SMALL_MODEL and LOCAL_LARGE_MODEL to reduce VRAM requirements.

### Project & Token
**Q: What is the potency you see through ai16z?**  
A: DorianD explained the challenge of making an economic argument for ElizaOS compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Q: What is ELI5?**  
A: It stands for "Explain Like I'm 5," which means breaking down complex topics into easy-to-understand terms.

**Q: Why were the ElizaOS and Shaw Twitter accounts suspended?**  
A: It appears to be related to a Twitter scraper component in the code that has since been removed.

**Q: Is the ElizaOS code plagiarized?**  
A: No, it uses open source components which is standard practice in OSS development.

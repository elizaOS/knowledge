# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development & Roadmap
- **ElizaOS v2 Development**: Currently in progress with "full focus for a few more weeks." Beta release expected in March, with general availability in April.
- **Migration Strategy**: Developers are encouraged to start building on v1 now rather than waiting for v2. Migration effort is expected to be relatively low (1-5 on a scale of 10).
- **Architecture Changes**: ElizaOS v2 will move all plugins out of the main repository and upgrade the core components.
- **Launchpad Progress**: The ElizaOS launchpad is reportedly 95% complete, but the team is waiting for optimal market conditions before release.

### Technical Discussions
- **Agent Resource Requirements**: Each ElizaOS agent requires approximately 1.5-3GB of RAM. Hetzner was recommended over cloud services for more cost-effective hosting.
- **Local LLM Integration**: Users troubleshooted issues with Ollama and other local models, particularly in WSL environments where connectivity between Windows and WSL was problematic.
- **Twitter Integration**: Extensive discussions about Twitter client authentication, rate limits, and implementing reply functionality for agents.
- **Database Options**: Most users are using adapter-postgresql or adapter-sqlite for vector storage rather than dedicated vector databases like Pinecone.
- **TEE Security Concerns**: TAISER Andy raised issues about Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), noting frequent failures and security risks related to root key custody.

### Projects & Implementations
- **3D AI TV News Show**: A team is developing an automated news broadcast system using a GitHub-based news aggregator, a show runner that processes data into JSON, and a Unity visualization client with ElevenLabs TTS.
- **NFT Minting Plugins**: Rosario Borgesi shared two NFT minting plugins for Eliza - one for Starknet and another for EVM-compatible blockchains like Arbitrum Sepolia.
- **DegenAI Trading**: A new trading setup will be tested in production soon, combining sentiment analysis of social platforms with flexible trading strategies.
- **News Browser Tool**: User "boom" created a browser tool (gm3.github.io/news-browser/) for viewing the daily news parser from the Eliza ecosystem.

### Community & Business
- **Competition Concerns**: Community members expressed concerns about competitors like ARC and Virtuals potentially gaining ground while ElizaOS development continues.
- **Team Focus**: The team indicated they're prioritizing three areas: curating initial project cohorts, finalizing infrastructure partnerships, and optimizing launch timing.
- **Development Philosophy**: "Product first, whitepaper later" approach was emphasized, with quality prioritized over rushed releases.

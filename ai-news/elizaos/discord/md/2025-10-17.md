- Launch is imminent (in 4 days)
- Migrated ElizaOS tokens are immediately unlocked upon blockchain settlement
- Team is preparing communications about trading venues post-launch
- Community members express optimism about the project now that the team has working capital

### Technical Infrastructure
- The team is migrating to cloud infrastructure
- "Bunified" plugins are being implemented (plugin-solana, plugin-OpenAI)
- Twitter/X plugin functionality requires a Basic subscription to X API
- Free usage of old Twitter plugin is deprecated and not recommended for serious applications
- The team is building an "8004" protocol as a decentralized app discovery and interaction layer

### Frontend Development
- Discussions around UI frameworks and component libraries for the cloud application
- Team is evaluating templates versus custom designs
- References to Sparka, Zola, and AI Elements as design inspiration
- Building components including cloud chat interface, OTC desk application, and agent frontend
- Authentication approach using Privy

### Project Vision
- Building a decentralized AI project with prediction markets and autonomous agents
- LLM-generated bets and outcomes create a game environment for testing AI prediction capabilities
- Vision of moving beyond app-specific AI toward autonomous agent networks
- Need for a "fully decentralized credibly neutral" alternative to corporate AI platforms
- Exploring use cases like decentralized infrastructure maintenance and security systems

## Key Questions & Answers

### Token Migration

3. **Prediction Market Concept**  
   **Helper**: shaw  
   **Helpee**: DorianD  
   **Context**: Understanding the project's prediction market concept  
   **Resolution**: Shaw explained they're creating lab conditions to test AI prediction capabilities by isolating decision-making from data collection challenges

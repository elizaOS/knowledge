# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI16z Ecosystem & Governance
- **Leadership Transition**: Several core team members (Markus, Ejaaz, Ropirito) have shifted focus to AICC, creating leadership uncertainty for AI16z. Jin confirmed he'll lead tokenomics efforts if needed.
- **AICC Controversy**: Significant tension regarding AICC's token launch, which many users perceived as an insider-focused allocation that damaged AI16z's reputation. Shaw and Jin initially received allocations but later donated significant portions to the AI16z DAO and contributors.
- **Trust Rebuilding**: Shaw resigned as an advisor to AICC, citing the need to focus on AI16z's core development. He mentioned implementing a policy where "launching a memecoin = fired" to prevent further value extraction.
- **DegenAI Concerns**: Community members expressed significant concerns about DegenAI's development status after discovering that Skely, a core developer, sold all his tokens 18 days prior.
- **Contribution Recognition**: Jin tipped Spit 2,156 DegenAI tokens (‚âà$100) for unrecognized PRs, highlighting efforts to improve contributor recognition.

### Technical Development
- **Tokenomics Revamp**: Work continues on a marketplace of trust whitepaper with researchers and PhDs focusing on literature review, economic incentives, trust score simulation, and system abuse analysis.
- **Launchpad Development**: The team is developing an AI16z launchpad similar to pump.fun with virtual liquidity then bonding, where the DAO would earn LP fees to buy back tokens.
- **Base Pair Debate**: Technical debate about whether to use AI16z or SOL as the base pair in launchpad pools. Plur_daddy (former Metaplex CFO) argues for AI16z to create "monetary premium," while Eskender.eth counters that SOL provides better liquidity.
- **Twitter Client Issues**: Users encountered problems with Twitter client settings not being respected, particularly around post intervals and rate limits.
- **Vector Database Integration**: Several users shared code snippets for integrating vector databases to enable persistent memory and user profiling.
- **Action Chaining**: Discussions about implementing action chaining where one action triggers another, with validation to prevent infinite loops.

### Content & Media
- **AI Podcast Development**: The team is enhancing the "ai16z AI Podcast" with improved camera angles, scene transitions, and character animations.
- **FishAI Integration**: Fishai introduced a modular Unity-based system called FishAI that enables AI agent integration with features like infinite conversations, prompted scene generation, and viewer interaction.
- **Content Constraints**: The AI Podcast must maintain factual accuracy and avoid mentioning speculative content that could be exploited.
- **New Show Concepts**: Exploring a Jedi Council format that would allow more creative freedom than the strictly factual AI Podcast.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What is the connection between AI16z partners NFT and the upcoming DAO?**  
A: It's a community project with associated IP but not official (answered by Smedroc)

**Q: How does AI16z token accrue value to the ecosystem?**  
A: Through the DAO, but there's no specific value accrual mechanism yet (answered by Tranquil and Lord Punterino)

**Q: How do I limit recursion depth of interactions with my agent?**  
A: Try eliza.gg or make a GitHub issue (answered by jin)

**Q: How can I customize Twitter post templates and override default settings?**  
A: Templates can be overridden in the character.json file using the templates block, and specific templates like twitterPostTemplate can be customized (answered by Neodotneo)

**Q: How can I implement action chaining where one action triggers another?**  
A: Use runtime.processAction or runtime.processActions within the handler of the first action, and implement validation to ensure actions are only triggered by the orchestrator (answered by 0xLabsTheCoder)

**Q: How do I clear the cache when the agent is loading an old character file?**  
A: Change CACHE_STORE=Filesystem in .env, then delete the cache file in the agent folder (answered by BitBeard)

**Q: Did Shaw and Jin sell their AICC allocations?**  
A: Shaw donated 50% to AI16z DAO, airdropped ~20% to contributors, and used ~10% for LP. Jin also sent 50% to the DAO (answered by Shaw and Jin)

**Q: What is the plan for AI16z launchpad?**  
A: It's being worked on by the team, described as potentially functioning like an AppStore for agents (answered by zocktay)

**Q: How does the tribute system work?**  
A: Projects built on ElizaOS donate 10% of their token supply to AI16z DAO for long-term incentive alignment (answered by Jin)

**Q: What is FishAI?**  
A: A modular Unity-based system for creating AI shows with features like infinite conversations, scene generation, camera control, and viewer interaction (answered by fishai)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Vector Database Integration**: 0xLabsTheCoder shared code examples for implementing vector database integration for persistent memory and user profiling.

- **Twitter Client Troubleshooting**: CryptoAYA helped pupathebig with Twitter rate limiting issues by sharing working configuration with POST_INTERVAL settings in .env.

- **Template Override Assistance**: Neodotneo provided kobra with code examples for template override configuration in character files.

- **Cache Clearing Guidance**: BitBeard helped Heady Shotta clear cache when agent loaded old character file by suggesting changing CACHE_STORE to Filesystem and deleting the cache file.

- **Action Chaining Implementation**: 0xLabsTheCoder provided self.id | Dexter with code examples for using runtime.processAction with validation for action chaining.

- **PR Review Guidance**: Avirtualfuture explained to Jin why large PRs with 826 file changes are problematic and suggested dividing into manageable commits.

- **Eliza Setup Help**: KamX suggested Dave | Eco use Cursor, an AI code writing program that can help set up GitHub projects through natural language.

- **3D Animation Improvements**: Boom added post-processing, motion blur, and new character actions to improve the AI Podcast's visual quality.

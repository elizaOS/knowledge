# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Rebranding and Ecosystem Development
- **Rebranding from ai16z to ElizaOS**: The project is rebranding due to trademark concerns with a16z (Andreessen Horowitz). Shaw explained they need to change the name to avoid legal issues and to enable partnerships with a16z.
- **Token Ticker Discussions**: Community debated various ticker options, with constraints like X's 6-character limit for cashtags. Shaw mentioned voting on the ticker will be enabled in 1-2 months.
- **Partnership Strategy**: Shaw proposed a model where projects donate 10% of their tokens to the treasury in exchange for benefits, creating steady buy pressure without causing token dumps.
- **Value Accrual Mechanisms**: The DAO will generate value through revenue sharing (10% of partner project revenue), trading fees, and potentially LP positions.
- **Marketplace Development**: A marketplace/launchpad for ElizaOS projects is being developed with fee structures and support services.

### Technical Development
- **ElizaOS V2**: Shaw mentioned they're pushing basic V2 code, though it's still in early stages.
- **One-Click Deployment**: Mike D. shared progress on a Terraform-based deployment solution for Eliza, targeting AWS t4g.small instances to leverage the free tier.
- **Docker Image Builds**: The team is working on Docker images with a new architecture that required porting NPM modules.

- **Neuro Runtime Enhancements**: The Neuro team announced plans to integrate technical analysis and Twitter fact extraction modules, enabling sentiment analysis and trading signals generation.

### AI Agent Development
- **Twitter Integration Issues**: Users discussed controlling agent responses, preventing spam replies, and handling authentication. Common problems included agents responding too frequently or inappropriately to mentions.
- **Knowledge Management**: Extensive discussions about RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation, with users trying to understand how to structure knowledge for effective retrieval.

- **DeFAI Agents**: Several members discussed Decentralized Finance AI agents, with Display Name noting market cap growth in this sector.

### 3D AI Shows Development
- **Three Main Projects**: (1) ai16z AI Podcast - GitHub/news updates summary show producing 1-minute daily videos, (2) Jedi Council Show - featuring Eliza characters discussing blockchain topics, and (3) Block Tank - a Shark Tank-style show with AI judges.
- **Technical Implementation**: Using "Derpy Show JSON Structure" for content generation, with Unity and PlayCanvas for visualization. SM Sith Lord developed a PlayCanvas prototype for Block Tank that can generate episodes within seconds.
- **Animation Format Debate**: Discussion about VRM vs. FBX formats, with fishai arguing that FBX is more practical despite VRM's popularity in VTubing.

### Community Management
- **Role Structure**: The community has different roles based on token holdings: Partners (100k+ ai16z tokens), Associates (10k+ tokens), with discussion about adding an "Executive" role for 50k+ holders.
- **Tipping System**: Jin demonstrated how to use the tip.cc bot for distributing AI16Z tokens as rewards for contributions, including airdrops, trivia drops, and direct tipping.
- **Communication Improvements**: Jin mentioned plans for automated weekly updates and newsletters to prevent announcements from getting lost.

# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-01

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Game Development & Metaverse Integration

The core development team engaged in strategic discussions about integrating AI agents into gaming experiences within the hyperscape ecosystem. Shaw proposed forking a RuneScape-like project to create a Zelda-style experience with integrated agents, noting strong interest from VCs and community members. The key technical proposal involves adding **quest generation and NPC setup capabilities** to asset forge in hyperscape, with the ability to view and tweak worlds before deployment.

Odilitime emphasized a focused approach: building quality games within existing venues rather than creating new platforms, positioning hyperscape as the primary metaverse/3D world platform. The team discussed implementing a **full agent mode** where users can create and observe autonomous agents, which would provide high-value improvements for Eliza agents in game environments. The concept of creating different frontends with overlapping landscapes where players can see each other with limited interactions was also explored.

### Infrastructure & Cloud Migration

DorianD presented an ambitious concept for an **AI-powered infrastructure migration agent** for the Jeju network. The proposed tool would automatically analyze AWS deployments, identify cost reduction opportunities, and migrate services from AWS to Jeju's network. The agent would work in conjunction with another agent to rewrite application code during migration, similar to AWS Transform's approach to legacy server workload modernization.

The discussion identified a broader market opportunity in the SMB hosting space ($25-100 monthly services), where AI coding agents could autonomously select technology stacks and handle installation, administration, and maintenance. This could lead to hosting companies partnering with AI agent providers or integrating hardware into decentralized networks for usage-based revenue generation.

### Plugin Development & Ecosystem Expansion

Odilitime announced active development work on **updates to plugin-github** and the creation of a new **plugin-git**, representing ongoing expansion of the plugin ecosystem. When Ilum expressed interest in contributing, the GitHub repository was shared to facilitate collaboration.

Technical questions emerged about plugin usage outside official documentation, Discord plugin compatibility with current ElizaOS versions, and the possibility of importing entire codebases as agents through GitHub integration. These questions highlight growing interest in extending Eliza's capabilities beyond documented features.

### Token Migration & Community Support

Multiple users reported problems migrating AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS, specifically **Tangem wallet compatibility issues** showing zero token balances. Users were consistently directed to the migration support channel for assistance. Questions about migration deadlines and handling tokens purchased after the snapshot remained unanswered, indicating a need for clearer communication on migration timelines and procedures.

### Audio Processing & LLM Capabilities

User "boom" proposed an innovative concept that **LLMs should better respect audio frequencies**, suggesting audio-to-text conversion should capture pace, tempo, and emotional context rather than just literal transcription. This represents a potential enhancement to how Eliza processes audio inputs.

### Social Media Automation

Kenk explored potential use cases for **Eliza managing and scheduling Farcaster posts**, indicating interest in social media automation capabilities that could expand Eliza's utility for content creators and community managers.

### Technical Development & Bug Fixes

Stan worked on **PR #6286 related to streaming functionality**, adding improvements and fixes after testing. A critical technical issue was identified regarding **singleShot parameter support** to prevent action problems. Stan reported focusing on clearing the PR queue through reviews while dealing with laryngitis that prevented standup attendance.

### Market Observations

The team noted significant chip market volatility, with DDR5 memory prices tripling from $400 to $1200 between September and the current date, which could impact infrastructure costs and deployment strategies.

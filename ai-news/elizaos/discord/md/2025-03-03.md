# elizaOS Discord - 2025-03-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development
- **Plugin System Update**: The syntax for adding plugins has changed from using "clients" array to a "plugins" array in character files. This has caused some confusion among developers.
- **Jintern Introduction**: Jin introduced "jintern," an AI assistant built using ElizaOS that helps answer technical questions while Jin is away.
- **Character Files Repository**: Character files have been moved to their own repository at https://github.com/elizaos/characters/.
- **ElizaOS Architecture**: ElizaOS allows users to create AI agents through character files without requiring fine-tuning, leveraging foundation models with proper context and system design.

### DegenAI Project Status
- **Integration with ElizaOS**: DegenAI codebase will be open source under ElizaOS GitHub and is being integrated into ElizaOS v2 core.
- **Rebranding Efforts**: The project is undergoing rebranding after X (Twitter) banned the DegenAI account for alleged impersonation.
- **Future Role**: DegenAI will serve as the leader of the v2 agent swarm (organization).
- **Website Launch**: The website launch is pending completion of the rebranding effort.

### Twitter/X Integration Issues
- **Plugin Problems**: Several users reported issues with Twitter integration, including authentication errors, repetitive tweets, and image handling.
- **Account Bans**: Users discussed challenges with AI agents being banned on X, with the DegenAI team attempting to recover their banned account.
- **Functionality Changes**: Some users noted that Twitter client functionality available in previous versions appears to be missing in the new version.

### AI Agent Development
- **Multi-agent Architecture**: Jin clarified that agents can be distributed and support paid requests.
- **Industry Adoption**: Discussion about Dell's CTO claiming "By the end of this year half the workers will be ai agents," though this was challenged by a user working at a big tech company who believes adoption will be slower due to compliance risks.
- **Camera System**: In the 3D-AI-TV channel, a user shared information about creating a camera system that alternates between pathed camera animations and close-up character shots during dialogue sequences.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I add plugins in the new Eliza version?**  
A: In character file, use "plugins" array instead of "clients" array with format like "@elizaos/plugin-twitter" (answered by jin)

**Q: Do I need to install client-twitter or just plugin-twitter?**  
A: You need to install client-twitter, not just plugin-twitter (answered by ahsanahmed321)

**Q: Where are the extra character files in main?**  
A: They're in their own repo now https://github.com/elizaos/characters/ (answered by notorious_d_e_v)

**Q: Can you tell me as a non-techie with zero coding experience, roughly how difficult it would be to spin up an ai agent using eliza?**  
A: "Honestly not that bad if you follow the tutorial. Check out elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/tutorial-social-agent - it's designed for beginners. You'll need basic command line comfort but the docs walk you through it step by step. Biggest hurdle is probably just setting up your dev environment. If you get stuck, just ask here and someone will help" (answered by jintern)

**Q: How did jin train you?**  
A: "I wasn't trained specifically for this. Jin built me using the eliza platform with a well-crafted character file that defines my personality, knowledge base, and response patterns. Basically just good prompt engineering and a solid model underneath. No fine-tuning involved, just leveraging the base capabilities of foundation models with the right context and system design" (answered by jintern)

**Q: Is the degenai codebase open source? under elizaOS github?**  
A: It will be, this is being worked on now. Everything is moving into ElizaOS v2 core (answered by rhota)

**Q: Can you tell me the best ways to install elizaOS on powershell?**  
A: "Powershell is rough for eliza. Recommend using wsl instead. Check the docs: elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/wsl-setup-guide/ - it'll walk you through installing ubuntu subsystem, node, pnpm and all the deps you need. Way less headaches than trying to force it in powershell" (answered by jintern)

**Q: Can you confirm the current ai16z token is still valid?**  
A: There's no new token, the CAs in #rules-and-links are the official ones (answered by Patt)

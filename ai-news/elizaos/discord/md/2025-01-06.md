# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Eliza Framework & Development
- **Eliza Framework Status**: Open-source with 250+ contributors adding plugins and upgrades daily, maintained by Eliza Labs (the AI16Z team)
- **Technical Challenges**: Developers are actively troubleshooting Twitter integration issues (login failures, response formatting), database-related errors (SQLite and vector embeddings), and model configuration
- **Common Issues**: Memory management problems where agents either don't retain context or encounter vector dimension mismatches, particularly when switching embedding models
- **Local Deployment**: Discussions about running Eliza locally on devices without NVIDIA GPUs, with some users sharing workarounds

### Partnerships & Integrations
- **Hyperfy Airdrop**: AI16Z Partners (100k+ token holders) received 46,120 HYPER tokens (worth approximately $10-12k)
- **Integration Proposals**: 
  - Decentralized key management for AI agents across multiple blockchains by Zenrock
  - Pyth network price feeds integration providing access to 600+ price feeds across 90+ blockchains
  - Informal.systems' multichain/asset protocol with liabilities as a first-class primitive for P2P lending between agents
  - "Eliza World" in Hyperfy following their partnership announcement

### Community & Tokenomics
- **Token Roles**: Partner role requires 100k+ AI16Z tokens, Associate role requires 10k+ tokens
- **Omni-chain Discussions**: Exploration of making AI16Z an omni-chain token via wrapping mechanisms like Hyperlane
- **DegenAI Concerns**: Community expressing frustration over perceived lack of transparency regarding DegenAI's development progress
- **Rebranding Consideration**: Discussions about potentially rebranding to "ElizaOS"

### Projects in Development
- **AI News Show**: Team refining a system for an AI-powered news show with 3D virtual hosts using Unity-based VRM models
- **Documentation Improvements**: Jin proposed creating an Eliza agent as a "scribe" to reduce friction in documentation contributions

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What is the relationship between Eliza framework and AI16Z?**  
A: Eliza framework is open sourced, but maintained by Eliza Labs (the AI16Z team). (answered by shakejr)

**Q: How do I get the partner role?**  
A: You need to hold 100k AI16Z tokens or 1M DegenAI tokens and verify through CollabLand. (answered by shakejr)

**Q: How much was the Hyperfy airdrop for AI16Z partners?**  
A: 46,120 HYPER tokens, initially valued at $3-4k, later valued at $10-12k. (answered by crac and jin)

**Q: How can I fix the Twitter login "Unknown subtask ArkoseLogin" error?**  
A: Add your Twitter cookies to bypass authentication challenges. (answered by Oracle)

**Q: Why does my agent tweet in JSON format instead of plain text?**  
A: Add "responseFormat": "text", "outputFormat": "plain" under settings in your character.json file. (answered by Roforico !)

**Q: How do I reset my agent's memory?**  
A: Delete the database file in the /data directory. (answered by jeanayala.eth)

**Q: How do I fix "zero-length vectors are not supported" SQLite error?**  
A: Delete the database file and restart with a fresh database. (answered by eschnou)

**Q: Is it possible to have $ai16z be an omni-chain token?**  
A: Yes, it's doable but involves wrapping, with options like Hyperlane, ICTT, CCIP, etc. (answered by yikesawjeez)

**Q: Is DegenAI part of the DAO?**  
A: Yes, they're a general partner. (answered by jin)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Twitter Plugin Fix**: jeanayala.eth created and shared a PR fixing multiple login attempts issue in the Twitter plugin
- **Installation Troubleshooting**: rferrari helped Majed resolve installation errors with pnpm by suggesting specific commands
- **Documentation Initiative**: 찌 G 跻 じ PrudentSpartan created a structured outline for tracking DegenAI development progress with specific categories
- **Cross-chain Guidance**: yikesawjeez offered technical guidance on implementation options for making AI16Z an omni-chain token
- **Hyperfy Airdrop Support**: jin and other community members helped verify the legitimacy of the Hyperfy claim link despite Phantom wallet warnings
- **AI News Show Development**: SM Sith Lord provided detailed feedback to boom on show improvements including audio levels, logo removal, camera positioning, and terminology changes

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-11-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token Migration Process
- A snapshot for AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration was taken on November 11th at 11:40 UTC
- Only tokens held in non-exchange wallets before the snapshot are eligible for automatic migration
- Users with tokens on exchanges or in liquidity pools during the snapshot must submit support tickets
- Korean users expressed frustration about lack of communication regarding the snapshot
- Migration process: send AI16Z tokens to designated wallet, receive ElizaOS tokens within 24 hours
- Team has been in contact with exchanges but cannot control their migration support decisions

### Technical Implementations
- Discussion about implementing a rock-paper-scissors game for Eliza agents
- Recommendation to use commit-reveal scheme with HSM/MPC vault instead of full zk-SNARK implementation
- Suggested using mobile-friendly web interface with wallet connect on Base or BNB chain
- Existing GitHub repository (arbirps) identified as having similar functionality
- Proposal for on-chain smart contract that can take cuts from human winners while subsidizing agent transaction costs
- ElizaOS tokens would accumulate in the contract to compensate agents for gas fees

### Project Direction & Market Dynamics
- Discussions about "revenue washing" and "stablecoin washing" in current market
- Criticism that ElizaOS lacks revenue generation, putting it at disadvantage
- Concerns about marketing coordination, particularly regarding a missed Binance airdrop opportunity
- Brief mention of ElizaOS v2 evolving "from a meme AI fund to a full-fledged agent system"

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-03-23

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS v2 Beta Implementation
- Users are experiencing various setup problems with the beta version, particularly around CLI commands, Docker configurations, and plugin integration
- Several users report errors when starting ElizaOS with the beta CLI, including plugin-sql errors and database connection issues
- Using `@elizaos/cli@beta` instead of older versions helps resolve some startup issues
- Additional troubleshooting steps like clearing node_modules and reinstalling dependencies were necessary in some cases

### Security Concerns
- A Princeton research group contacted the team about potential security risks with trader plugins
- Competitor platform Sentient highlighted security vulnerabilities in ElizaOS
- The team acknowledged trader plugins are isolated, but not all plugins have the same security measures
- Security concerns vary depending on plugin author and LLM model used
- Team members noted these security challenges aren't specific to ElizaOS but common in the AI agent space
- The team recognized they "need to communicate the risks more clearly"

### Social Media Management
- Hubert is developing an automated system to pull updates from a JSON file and post them to X (Twitter) via @ai16znews
- System will update daily at midnight UTC
- Posts will be formatted as threads with each GitHub/Discord link as a unique post with short summary and readable graphics
- The community identified coordinated negative messaging about ElizaOS, particularly regarding LLM-related concerns
- Community members responded to this FUD through personal accounts

### Character Configuration
- Users discussed how to prevent unwanted behaviors like emoji usage and "pirate talk" in agent responses
- Jin suggested adding explicit instructions in the character file style section like "never uses emoji" and "never talks like a pirate"
- Discussion about the effectiveness of adding "adjectives" to character files with existing "voice", "tone", "humor", and "catchphrases"

### PDF Integration and Knowledge Management
- SecretRecipe inquired about ingesting PDFs into Eliza for knowledge
- Patt confirmed PDF integration exists and can point to a local folder in character files
- Discussion about whether ElizaOS is optimized for many small pieces of data rather than large files
- Alternative approaches suggested included using the REST API endpoint for uploading markdown

### Upcoming Features and Releases
- Mentions of v2 launch, launchpad, and tokenomics updates expected within two weeks
- Discussion about DegenAI buyback being included in tokenomics (in drafts but needs synchronization with "ai16z")
- Announcement about keeping the spartan_holders channel private while creating a new public channel

### AI Assistant Applications
- Jin shared experience using Claude AI to analyze DAO weekly data and generate creative content based on Star Wars Jedi Council scenes
- Process took approximately 15 minutes, mostly spent gathering character descriptions
- Suggestion to prepare canonical character profiles in advance for efficiency
- Patt expressed frustration with human assistant performance, suggesting replacement with AI

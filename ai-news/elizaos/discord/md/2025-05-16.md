# elizaOS Discord - 2025-05-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS v2 Release
- Shaw teased ElizaOS v2 about a week ago with a May shipping timeline, making it "quite imminent"
- This was later confirmed by a tweet from Shaw
- Some users reported that v2 is more difficult to set up compared to earlier versions
- Significant technical discussions around proper agent configuration, particularly regarding plugin integration

### Ecosystem Growth
- ElizaOS v1 has become a framework used by at least 10 AI agent launchpads across different blockchains (Base, Near, Solana, Hyperliquid, Sui)
- This growth pattern is similar to how Uniswap v2 became a standard that was widely forked
- Several DeFAI (Decentralized Finance AI) projects are emerging in the ElizaOS ecosystem, including ProAgentAI and Kudo Network

### Technical Implementations
- Users discussed implementation issues with plugins (Discord, Telegram), authentication, and agent configuration
- Jin shared an AI-generated daily briefing system they've developed, which aggregates information from GitHub
- The system provides context for agents to stay in sync with users and includes AI news shows highlighting development updates
- Discussions about building transactions for the auto.fun platform revealed developers can build transactions directly without necessarily needing the program IDL

### Token Discussions
- Users discussed potential market valuations for tokens named "Eli" and "Eddy," with estimates ranging from 50-500 million depending on market conditions
- Questions about the process for launching verified tokens for AI developers
- Mentions of a potential collaboration between ai16z and COM (comput3), with discussions of a COM/SOL pool on Raydium

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-03-29

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Auto.fun Launchpad & Tokenomics
- **Clarification on tokenomics model**: The project uses a two-pool system where initial pools are SOL/Agent Token, and fees generated will be used to buy ai16z and set up secondary pools
- **Relationship between auto.fun and ai16z**: Auto.fun is the launchpad but ai16z is not its native token; instead, fees generated with auto.fun auto-buy ai16z
- **Community confusion**: Shaw's tweet stating "auto.fun has no native token" caused confusion as it seemed to contradict previous documentation
- **Launch timeline**: A countdown is visible on elizastudios.ai, though some users expressed concern about potential delays

### ElizaOS Technical Issues
- **Installation challenges**: Multiple users reported problems with the ElizaOS installation process
- **Plugin compatibility**: Users struggled with EventEmitter import errors with the local-ai plugin
- **Database connection issues**: Both PostgreSQL and SQLite connection problems were reported
- **Twitter client functionality**: Several users noted that the Twitter client was not properly replying to tweets despite checking interactions
- **Installation approach evolution**: Recommended installation method changed from npm global installation to using git clone with the v2-develop branch and bun commands

### AI News Aggregation Project
- **Bounty opportunity**: Jin presented a GitHub repository (ai-news) as a bounty project for improving AI-summarized content about Eliza and Hyperfy
- **Weekly newsletter concept**: Jin described a script that fetches logs from Monday through Sunday and combines them into one file for context summarization
- **Improvement ideas**: Suggestions included daily updates formatted as tweets, weekly updates as threads, dashboard concepts, and using LLMs for insights

### Community Development
- **Documentation improvements**: Jin solicited feedback on improving the community section of documentation
- **Agent development**: Discussion about resources for beginners looking to build agents on the Eliza framework
- **Community structure**: Ideas shared for better organizing information and guiding contributors from passive to active participation

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: If I'm looking to build my own agent on the Eliza framework where should I begin?**  
A: Check out Eliza.how for learning resources.

**Q: Why did Shaw contradict the doc by saying there's no plan of a native token when the doc says otherwise?**  
A: It was likely a rushed/poorly worded tweet; he probably meant no new token would be launched, but the tokenomics plan remains tied to value accrual of ai16z.

**Q: Is auto.fun linked to us or not at all?**  
A: Yes, but ai16z is not the native token of auto.fun; instead, fees generated with auto.fun auto-buy ai16z.

**Q: Why am I getting "Named export 'EventEmitter' not found" error when installing @elizaos/plugin-local-ai?**  
A: Install eventemitter3 separately with npm install eventemitter3.

**Q: Where can I find the Discord link?**  
A: It's on elizaos.ai page under DAO https://discord.com/invite/ai16z.

**Q: What's the tokenomics for ai16z?**  
A: The model uses a two-pool system where initial pools are SOL/Agent Token, and fees are used to buy ai16z and set up secondary pools.

**Q: What happened to eliza.gg?**  
A: The developer of that site went dark on all socials.

**Q: Where can I read more about autofun?**  
A: A Google Doc was shared: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CybxKElOINN7y8C_hyKawP2xO0xMf6zG8A0AruJ8PbY/edit?usp=sharing.

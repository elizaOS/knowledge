# elizaOS Discord - 2025-10-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Zod v4 Migration (ELIZA-740)**: Some plugins still awaiting review and merge according to Stan
- **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Technology**: cjft outlined implementation options:
  - Quick approach: Build on NextJS with visualizer and demo agents
  - Comprehensive solution: Would require blockchain integration for tokenomics and validator incentives
- **Local AI Models**: Odilitime testing qwen2-coder 32k via Ollama for development work
- **Developer Tools Discussion**:
  - Atlas browser received praise for research productivity
  - Zed editor now supports URLs for inference but was noted as slow
  - Cursor mentioned as having RAM usage issues

### Financial Security & DeFi
- **Contagion Protection Strategies**: neo_spartan emphasized isolation as the key principle:
  - Separate wallets
  - Compartmentalized strategies
  - Isolated risk pools
  - Position sizing limits
- **Oracle Issues in DeFi**: 
  - Kenk and DearDaniel discussed how liquidity problems can cause mispricing of stablecoins
  - Problem often lies with data sources rather than oracles themselves
  - Hardcoded oracle values for USDE may have prevented larger cascade failures

### Platform Migration
- Multiple users inquired about migration to ElizaOS, but no official timeline or process was shared
- Users advised to wait for official announcements from the team

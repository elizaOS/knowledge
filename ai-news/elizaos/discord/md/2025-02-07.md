# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development & Architecture
- **Plugin Architecture Changes**: Plugins are being moved from the core repository to separate repositories under elizaos-plugins. A dynamic plugin system is planned for release in April. (Odilitime)
- **Version Stability**: v0.1.8-alpha.1 is considered the most stable recent version, working well with pnpm. (Sarthak)
- **Server Requirements**: Minimal server requirements for ElizaOS include 4 vCPUs and 4GB RAM, which is sufficient for most deployments. (Tobiloba)
- **Documentation Improvements**: Jin is planning to update the docs and create an FAQ to address common issues and questions.

### DegenAI Trading Agent
- **Trading Functionality**: Testing is going well with buys and sells working, and the agent receiving signals from a new sentiment and data layer. (Rhota)
- **Team Structure**: The Degen team includes SAAANTI (sentiment/data layer), Neo (trading v2), Odi (character development), Jin (tokenomics, AI pitch show), and Skely (business development). (Rhota)
- **Technical Approach**: DegenAI doesn't use custom-trained models but leverages existing ones like Claude (Haiku, 3.5 Sonnet), as model technology is becoming commoditized. (Rhota)
- **Launch Timeline**: Trading v2 is nearing completion with launch expected next week. (Rhota)

### AI-Generated TV Show
- **Content Generation Process**: A JSON news aggregator feeds content into the system, which generates TV episodes with AI actors discussing the news. (Boom, SM Sith Lord)
- **Technical Improvements**: Video quality will be increased from 720p/30fps to 1080p/60fps, and episodes are now running longer (1:30 vs 1:00 previously). (Boom)
- **Content Structure**: The JSON format has three main sections: development updates, crypto market, and miscellaneous content. (Boom)
- **Clank Tank**: Previously called "Dank Tank," this show will showcase projects and is being prepared for premiere. (Jin)

### Token & Community Discussions
- **Wallet Activity**: A large wallet (belonging to "Elijah") selling tokens in chunks of 80k caused initial concern but was clarified as "covering some expenses" with Elijah still being involved. (Jin)
- **Revenue Generation Ideas**: Potential revenue streams discussed include sponsorships, telegram bots, referral codes for crypto exchanges, and possibly creating an LST (Liquid Staking Token) called "elizaSOL." (𝔭𝔩𝔞𝔱𝔞 𝔑𝔬 𝔉𝔞𝔭 𝔞𝔯𝔠)
- **Tokenomics Paper**: Vasily Sumanov received approval to share his tokenomics paper on Twitter to gather more academic opinions. (yikesawjeez)

### Common Technical Issues
- **Twitter API Rate Limits**: Users experiencing Twitter rate limits were advised to obtain proper API credentials rather than just using username/password. (BOSSU)
- **CORS Errors**: Several users reported CORS errors when accessing the web UI from different machines on the same network. (🔥🪂AZZBO77)
- **Dependency Issues**: Users encountered dependency version mismatches in eliza-starter and node module installation problems. (JAMES, Cuddlesaurus)

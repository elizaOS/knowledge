# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-20

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI16z Ecosystem & Clank Tank
- Jin is developing "Clank Tank," an AI-driven system for decision-making within the AI16z ecosystem
- The system uses AI16z tokens for tokenomics and flywheel mechanics (no separate token)
- Clank Tank can be used for hackathons, partnership applications, investment decisions, and grant distributions
- The AI can generate news shows based on Discord and GitHub activity
- Discussion about prediction markets as a potential mechanism for DAO governance, referencing Vitalik Buterin's writing

### ElizaOS Technical Development
- ElizaOS v1.4.4 released with:
  - Session API improvements
  - Logger support for browsers
  - Async embedding generation (reducing response times by 500ms)
  - Various fixes
- Team working on agent-DOM integration to improve CUA (Conversational User Agent) accuracy
- Code refactoring discussions around removing unnecessary parameters and fixing type inconsistencies
- Breaking changes deferred to v1.5 to avoid disrupting plugins

### Knowledge Plugin Configuration
- Discussion about customizing the ElizaOS knowledge plugin to produce smaller chunks
- Solution requires modifying the plugin source code directly rather than using environment variables
- Successful implementation increased chunks from 29 to 100 in a large document

### OpenRouter API Announcements
- Two new developer APIs announced:
  - Activity Analytics for daily activity rollups
  - Allowed Models API for fetching models filtered by user provider preferences

### Community Relations Issue
- Situation with another project ("openservai") making potentially misleading statements about the team's engineering leadership
- The team contacted the other project to request removal of the content, which was eventually done
- Concerns expressed about ecosystem partners attacking each other

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Are Clank Tank tokenomics directly related to AI16z?**  
A: Yes, 100%. AI16z tokens are being used right now for it and the flywheel tokenomics revolve around AI16z. (answered by Jin)

**Q: How can I get the knowledge plugin to produce smaller chunks despite .env tweaking?**  
A: You need to clone and modify the plugin source code directly as it's not configurable through .env. (answered by 0xbbjoker)

**Q: Why not create a separate `useModelStream` function instead of overloading `useModel`?**  
A: It would be cleaner, as the current approach complicates code maintenance. (answered by cjft)

**Q: How should we handle the runtime parameter in functions?**  
A: Runtime shouldn't be passed as a parameter since functions already have access to 'this'. (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Is the options pattern appropriate for passing optional parameters?**  
A: Over-optionalization and generics is bad practice; if a function has more options than required params, it should be a separate function. (answered by cjft)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Knowledge Plugin Customization**
   - Helper: 0xbbjoker | Helpee: Rabbidfly
   - Context: Rabbidfly was trying to reduce chunk sizes in the knowledge plugin
   - Resolution: 0xbbjoker directed them to modify the plugin source code directly by linking to the GitHub file, which successfully increased chunks from 29 to 100

2. **Clank Tank Clarification**
   - Helper: Jin | Helpee: who
   - Context: Confusion about Clank Tank's relationship to AI16z token
   - Resolution: Jin clarified that AI16z tokens are being used for Clank Tank with no plans for a separate token

3. **Type Inconsistencies**
   - Helper: Odilitime | Helpee: cjft
   - Context: Identifying inconsistencies in type definitions
   - Resolution: Odilitime found discrepancies between runtime.ts and base.ts implementations of createMemory

4. **Meeting Recording Access**
   - Helper: Borko | Helpee: 0x8664
   - Context: Request for recording from scenarios meeting
   - Resolution: Borko shared a Google Drive link to the recording

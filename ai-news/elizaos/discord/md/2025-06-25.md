# elizaOS Discord - 2025-06-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Support & Troubleshooting
- Multiple users reported an issue where agent responses appear in memory but not in the chat UI, causing conversations to stall. This appears to be a websocket/API communication issue between the backend and frontend.
- Docker deployment challenges were discussed, particularly for users trying to build images with specific plugins pre-installed. jintern provided guidance on modifying Dockerfiles.
- Manuel Barbas from SKALE inquired about integrating the EVM plugin into the eliza-nextjs-starter repo, facing connection issues between frontend and backend.
- Plugin compatibility across different ElizaOS versions (0.1.9, 0.25.9, 1.0.x) was discussed, with significant differences in configuration approaches between versions.

### Platform & Features Development
- The team is working on implementing 9:16 output format alongside 16:9 to support multiple platforms like TikTok.
- Development of ecosystem agents with specific visual identities and voice personalities using Elevenlabs is underway.
- Work continues on animation setup for 3D agent avatars, adding approximately 100 animations and emotions.
- jin mentioned upcoming updates including an "anxiety provider" for Jintern to make responses more natural.
- The "Clank Tank hackathon edition" is being completed to launch a coding competition and test a new version of Eliza.

### Community & Business Updates
- The elizaOS Twitter account has been suspended for 14 days, with the team in active dialogue with X to resolve the issue.
- The team is actively working on changing the "ai16z" ticker, as confirmed by Borko.
- Plans to create an ecosystem directory of top 50 builders were mentioned by Kenk.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I pre-install a set of plugins to Docker Image for production?**  
A: Modify the Dockerfile to include plugins after dependencies are installed with commands like `COPY ./packages/plugin-yourplugin ./packages/plugin-yourplugin` for each plugin, then list them in your agent character file under the plugins array.

**Q: How do I setup my agents.ts file to use the `@Elizaos/plugin-evm` plugin?**  
A: Import the plugin and add it to your agent's plugins array: `import { evmPlugin } from '@elizaos/plugin-evm'; export const defaultCharacter = { plugins: [evmPlugin] };`. Also ensure your .env has the right wallet/rpc configs.

**Q: Why am I getting "Error creating chat session: Error: Failed to create DM channel" when running the eliza-nextjs-starter repo?**  
A: The frontend can't connect to your eliza backend. Make sure the eliza server is running (usually on port 3000) before starting the nextjs app and check your .env file to ensure NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL points to the right backend URL.

**Q: What's causing the "agent is thinking" issue where responses appear in memories but not in chat?**  
A: Likely a websocket/API communication issue between backend and frontend.

**Q: How do I install and run elizaOS?**  
A: Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git`, run `cd eliza && pnpm install`, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API keys, then run `bun run start`.

**Q: Are v0.1.9 plugins compatible with v0.25.9?**  
A: No, the plugin system was reworked between versions.

**Q: How can I trigger actions more reliably?**  
A: LLM/prompts decide action picks; consider overriding bootstrap plugin.

**Q: Can agents access memories?**  
A: Yes, through the memory manager for conversation history, facts, and relationships.

**Q: Will memories retrieve naturally based on related chat messages?**  
A: Yes, automatically based on relevance without needing messageExamples or styles.

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- The team is preparing for a **1.5.x release** that will include TAO changes and bun build integration, with a final 1.4.x release planned before that
- **Eliza v1.4.5** was released with several fixes and features including metadata fixes in sessions, plugin-sql test fixes, and comment typo corrections
- A **cloud service implementation** (referred to as "eliza cloud") is in progress with video generation capabilities being developed
- Discussion about converting a **Python SWE-agent to TypeScript**, potentially shipping as "eliza-codes"
- Developers discussed memory systems for AI agents, with mentions of mem0.ai, getzep.com, and supermemory.ai

### Plugin Development
- A user struggled with implementing a custom plugin to handle token addresses while preventing the bootstrap plugin from also responding
- Discussion clarified that the bootstrap plugin handles messages by default, suggesting either disabling it or creating a custom plugin
- Clarification that the "dist" folder is a build directory that should be added to .gitignore

### Project Direction & Community Concerns
- Significant community concern about the **AI16z token price**, which has reportedly declined 65% over three months
- Users expressed frustration about the project's direction, lack of social media presence, and unclear tokenomics
- Hidden Forces defended the project, explaining they recently "solidified v1 after months of beta" and are focusing on broadening adoption
- AI16z was described as evolving from a memecoin into a "DAO control currency for an AI agent incubator"
- Questions raised about whether "FUN" is being deprioritized or discontinued
- Discussion about market conditions, including a "flash crash" and slow recovery despite a theoretically bullish backdrop

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How does the technical development translate to token value?** (asked by Milan)  
A: Hidden Forces suggested value accrues through "a DAO control currency for an incubator run by AI agents" similar to SuperRare's $RARE token but for agent applications instead of artists.

**Q: What is the dist folder for? Do I need it tracked in git?** (asked by Uroš Ognjenović)  
A: It's a build directory that should be added to .gitignore (answered by 0xbbjoker)

**Q: How to implement a custom plugin that handles token addresses without bootstrap form also responding?** (asked by mataha)  
A: "We handle messages in `plugin-bootstrap` so if you want diff handling you can disable bootstrap and handle events in your own plugin" (answered by 0xbbjoker)

**Q: Can we integrate supermemory-mcp into our agents to enhance user experience?** (asked by sam-developer)  
A: Low priority as eliza memories are proprietary in the stack by default already used in all LLMs (answered by cjft)

**Q: Do we have any Google API key for the team to finish video generation page for eliza cloud?** (asked by sam-developer)  
A: Borko responded with "dm'd" indicating he provided the key privately

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-09-20

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Plugin Improvements**: The OpenRouter plugin now supports proxy URLs (PR #12), and the OpenAI plugin has been updated to use newer models (whisper-1 ‚Üí gpt-4o-mini-transcribe, dalle-3 ‚Üí gpt-image-1).
- **Build System Updates**: CommonJS builds have been added alongside browser ESM and Node ESM formats, improving compatibility.
- **Browser Integration**: Progress on a browser end-to-end working demo with plugin-openai, core, and plugin-sql components, including speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionality.
- **Parameter Standardization**: Transcription parameters are now standardized as Blob to include MIME type rather than guessing on the plugin side.

### Architecture Proposals
- DorianD proposed replacing core ElizaOS code with neural networks running on a P2P blockchain network, similar to Tesla's approach of replacing legacy code with neural networks.
- The proposal includes using smart contracts for developer exceptions and segregating proprietary code.
- Several academic papers were shared discussing neural networks on blockchain, including concepts for model verification and deploying ML models as smart contracts.

### API & Integration Challenges
- Users discussed Twitter API access issues, with some exploring unofficial API alternatives due to restrictions in the official API.
- A request was made for help with WhatsApp integration, specifically for developing a WhatsApp AI auto-reply system using ElizaOS and WhatsApp Cloud API.

### Model Performance
- Discussion about token limit issues in the Anthropic plugin where hardcoded maxTokens values (4,096 for "-3-" models, 8,192 otherwise) underestimate actual model capacities.
- Concerns about "sloppy knowledge hallucinations" were raised, though some developers noted that excessive context size rather than truncation might be causing hallucinations.

### Security Concerns
- Supply chain attack concerns were discussed, with recommendations to use VMs/VPS for development or separate development machines from wallets.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it now impossible to log in to Twitter using username and password?**  
A: "If you use the older version of the plugin, it will still work, but we don't and can't support it. So any problems bugs and you're on your own." (Odilitime)

**Q: What are your thoughts on token limits? We have reports of sloppy knowledge hallucinations, wonder if we're getting cutoff in context.**  
A: "I never had a situation where we would end up being cut off with the context. For me it was more a problem of too large context where I would face significant hallucinations." (0xbbjoker)

**Q: Is there any ambassador programme going on for elizaos?**  
A: "Best to ask <@699264581729779733>" (Dr. Neuro)

**Q: Why are the judges not facing the camera during introductions?**  
A: "The head tilt comes from Shark Tank where sharks sometimes look at each other when they talk, but they're doing it too much" (jin)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Twitter API Workarounds**
   - Odilitime helped passer with information about using older versions of the Twitter plugin that still support username/password authentication, while noting the lack of official support.

2. **Development Environment Security**
   - Jin shared recommendations for protecting against supply chain attacks, suggesting the use of VMs/VPS for development or separate machines for development and wallets.

3. **UI/UX Feedback**
   - Seppmos provided feedback to Jin about camera angles in a show, suggesting judges should face the camera during introductions rather than looking at each other from the side.
   - Jin acknowledged the feedback and relayed it to the team.

4. **Ambassador Program Inquiry**
   - Dr. Neuro directed omega_prime to the appropriate community member for information about an elizaOS ambassador program.

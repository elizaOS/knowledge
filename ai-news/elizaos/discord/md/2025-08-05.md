# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-05

**Date: August 5, 2025**

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Clank Tank Platform
- Clank Tank submissions have reopened with previous submissions to be archived as "Clank Tank 1.0"
- Jin encouraged users to submit anything during the beta phase for "battle testing" the system
- Technical issues with the submission form were reported, including time zone display problems and GitHub branch handling
- Judges have begun scoring submissions and provided critical feedback that Jin found helpful for system improvement

### Technical Integrations & Development
- Mike D. proposed integrating Eliza into a Rust/Lean4/LLVM/eBPF/Solana framework, with key memories stored in Solana accounts
- Odilitime pointed to relevant plugins in the Spartan repository for account registration and keypairs
- Mike D. suggested compiling Eliza TypeScript to WASM or LLVM for performance improvements, size reduction, and browser compatibility
- DorianD proposed storing model weights in a merkle tree structure rather than raw memories to track agent evolution
- Shaw reported working on cloud functionality, approaching MVP status but still fixing bugs
- Odilitime mentioned getting a 20B model working in Ollama but not yet with Eliza, noting it's likely too slow for their 60-second window

### AI Models & Open Source
- Community members discussed OpenAI's announcement about open-sourcing aspects of their technology
- New model releases were mentioned: Anthropic's Opus 4.1 and OpenAI's gpt-oss
- Shaw shared information about an open-source visual AI IDE called Magick that includes Ethereum wallet and social media integration

### Crypto & Token Economics
- Discussion about how crypto projects should address "reputational debt" that occurs when tokens are issued
- Pangolink noted that speculative trading often creates unrealistic expectations
- Some users discussed cryptocurrency trading strategies and AI trading performance, noting that AI agents were struggling against human traders

### Upcoming Events
- A Korea event in two days was mentioned, which would feature a base agent demo

**Q: Who can submit to clank tank? Anything?**  
A: "Anything. Put the slop in the form bro" (jin)

**Q: Why compile Eliza TypeScript to WASM or LLVM?**  
A: "For performance, reducing size, and time and cost of execution." (Mike D.)

**Q: How can I fix the "Please check your form inputs and try again" error on clanktank.tv/submit?**  
A: The GitHub link was causing the issue. (jin)

**Q: Will you update the form logic to handle branches?**

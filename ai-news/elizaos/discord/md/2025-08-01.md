# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-01

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **Eliza Cloud Progress**: Shaw merged changes to eliza-cloud, adding Redis queue for job management and image/video generation, with Docker setup for local Redis and Postgres
- **Deployment Achievements**: Sam-developer successfully deployed Eliza Cloud to Railway with Postgres and Redis and CI/CD integration
- **Phala Cloud Integration**: Agent Joshua created and shared rules for deploying to Phala cloud with a working example URL
- **Editor Packaging**: The team is packaging the editor for publishing on npm to enable importing it elsewhere, potentially with iframe support using API tokens

### Technical Issues
- **Message Bus Bug**: cjft identified a critical issue in the message bus where messages were being incorrectly discarded, causing AI responses to fail
- **MySQL Support**: Odilitime fixed MySQL support and caught a dedupe bug with names
- **Twitter API Authentication**: A user reported 401 errors with their Twitter bot, likely due to Twitter's authentication system now using keys instead of email addresses

### Business & Community
- **Poink Team Controversy**: Discussion about a team called "Poink" that claimed to switch from ElizaOS to openserv. Kenk clarified that ElizaOS has no record of working with them and suggested their product wasn't robust
- **Payment Integration Plans**: The team is planning to integrate payment systems including Stripe and x402, along with WorkOS for authentication
- **Market Conditions**: Brief mentions of market conditions, with comments about low liquidity and price predictions

## Key Questions & Answers

**Twitter API Issues**
- Q: How do I fix 401 errors for Twitter API?
- A: Check if you're subscribed to the basic plan with read/write permissions enabled

**ElizaOS Technical Concerns**
- Q: Are Poink's concerns around X integration and dependencies weight real issues with ElizaOS?
- A: No, X integration requires proper authentication which is on them, and plugin weight issues were addressed months ago by separating plugins from the main framework

**System Prompts Implementation**
- Q: Isn't there a benefit to putting the system prompt into the vercel ai sdk field called system?
- A: Yes, it's more official with "system" role while rest are "user" messages

**Farcaster Plugin Status**
- Q: What's the setup on Spartan? He seems to be too frequent/repetitive? Also are we now using webhooks?
- A: The frequent posting was during development. Using the "inefficient way" and V2 posting engine is repetitive. He's back to 90+ mins now

**Payment Integration**
- Q: Can add also base pay / on ramp as well to get some USDC or prefer all fiat?
- A: Shaw mentioned adding x402 account top up and noted Stripe has pay with crypto now

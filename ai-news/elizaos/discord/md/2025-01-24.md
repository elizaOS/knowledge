# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **ElizaOS v2 Development**: The team is working toward a v2 release, potentially targeting March-April, with a v1.5 plugin architecture being developed as an interim step.
- **DeepSeek Integration**: Significant discussion about integrating DeepSeek's R1 model with ElizaOS, with jin confirming it's technically simple via OpenRouter and will be tested with DegenAI soon. The model reportedly performs well for tool/action calling without requiring GPU resources.
- **Embedding Dimension Issues**: Multiple users encountered vector dimension mismatches (384 vs 1536) when configuring different embedding models, resolved by setting `USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE` in the .env file.
- **Node.js Compatibility**: Several users struggled with Node.js version compatibility, with v23.3.0 being recommended over newer versions.
- **RAG Implementation**: Discussions about implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation for knowledge management, with documentation shared on loading large documents into the knowledge base.
- **TrustDB Technology**: DorianD highlighted TrustDB as a solution for decentralized trust relationships between agents, potentially eliminating the need for centralized verification systems.

### Platform & Ecosystem
- **Tokenomics Debate**: Extensive discussion about ai16z tokenomics models, with competing approaches between simple, proven models versus more complex systems with additional utility.
- **Market Conditions**: Partners expressed concerns about AI16Z token price declines due to whale sell-offs, though some maintained conviction citing GitHub activity (7k new stars, 500+ pull requests) and growing holder numbers.
- **Partnerships**: Announcement of a partnership with Virtuals on Solana, and discussions about potential collaborations with Centrifuge for tokenization.
- **Block Tank Initiative**: Jin mentioned a "Block Tank" concept (AI investor simulation for project evaluation) that would help scale/decentralize decision making.
- **3D AI TV Project**: Development of a space-themed virtual environment for an AI-powered TV show with multiple camera angles and AI personalities presenting content.

### Agent Development
- **Twitter Integration Challenges**: Several users struggled with Twitter integration, particularly with authentication issues and controlling agent behavior (retweets, replies, original posts).
- **Character Configuration**: Extensive discussion about setting model providers and secrets within character JSON files versus global .env settings.
- **LLM Integration**: Community explored integration with various LLMs, with particular interest in DeepSeek-R1's reasoning capabilities compared to other models like Claude and GPT.
- **Mobile Applications**: Discussion about potential Android app for running DeepSeek model on phones without cloud hosting dependencies.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I fix the "Vector dimension mismatch" error?**  
A: Set `USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE` in your .env file (answered by boja)

**Q: Is there a way to make an agent ONLY reply to tweets and not create original tweets?**  
A: Comment out this line: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/6490485e5bb142336208a116f903446a2dd4db38/packages/client-twitter/src/post.ts#L289 (answered by tcm390)

**Q: How do I load large text documents into the knowledge database?**  
A: Use the processCharacterRAGKnowledge function in the codebase (answered by Quăng)

**Q: Will DeepSeek be integrated with ElizaOS?**  
A: Technically since OpenRouter supports it, we can change to DeepSeek in 1 line of code. Will be testing with DegenAI soon. (answered by jin)

**Q: How do I fix the version mismatch error from @ai-sdk/provider?**  
A: Update "@ai-sdk/mistral" to version "1.0.9" (answered by elizaos-bridge-odi)

**Q: How do I get my agent to respond to Telegram group messages?**  
A: Make sure the bot is admin and has message permissions in the group, and users need to tag the bot (answered by meowtoshi)

**Q: How does the proposed bonding curve + dual pool structure work?**  
A: It's similar to Virtuals launchpad but not exactly the same. Virtuals uses a single pool, and once a token graduates from the bonding curve, a single agent/virtuals pair is created. (answered by BigChungus)

**Q: Is it possible to edit prompted songs to remove one vocalist?**  
A: Not yet, but you could remove vocals with another AI tool and then upload with new lyrics in Suno (answered by boom)

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-12-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token Migration & Price Concerns
- Users report significant concerns about the ElizaOS token's continuous price decline, with many reporting 90-95% losses
- The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens has been problematic, with technical difficulties and confusion about eligibility
- Only tokens held at the November 11th snapshot can be migrated, and only from the wallet that held them at that time
- The token needs to be mintable to support Chainlink CCIP for cross-chain functionality
- Migration was partly necessary to move away from token2022 which many exchanges won't support
- Significant concern about potential delisting from Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit) in January

### Project Valuation & Market Position
- Discussion about ElizaOS's low market valuation (22M FDV) compared to competitors like Pippin (536M) and Virtuals (693M)
- Community members express frustration about project management, communication issues, and unfulfilled promises
- Some users maintain that the team's intentions are good and suggest continued development could trigger a "short squeeze"
- Odilitime suggests focusing on long-term plans rather than chasing market trends

### Product Development
- Shaw proposed splitting Babylon into points and non-points game components
- Points game could leverage Eliza cloud for inference and authentication, potentially migrating 350,000 users to Eliza cloud
- Plans to create a crypto version of Babylon integrated with Jeju
- Cloud rollout mentioned as a step toward implementing tokenomics
- R0am shared using async agents for maintaining a 40-day streak on tip.md

### Community Sentiment
- The community appears divided between those who have lost faith in the project and those who believe the underlying technology remains viable
- Criticism of the migration's execution and subsequent communication as major factors in the project's current struggles
- Reference to high-profile backers' advice being ignored and long-delayed features

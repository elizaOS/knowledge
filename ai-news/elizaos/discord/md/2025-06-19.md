# elizaOS Discord - 2025-06-19

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS X Account Issues
- The ElizaOS X account has been suspended, reportedly requiring $50,000/month to restore
- The team is actively working on recovery: "They sent a message to us, we've replied, we're awaiting a reply" (Odilitime)
- Users speculate X is targeting ElizaOS because it could enable users to farm engagement and monetize the platform
- Version 1.0.7 still works with X's free API plan if replies are disabled
- The next tier costs $200/month for X API access

### Technical Developments
- Jonas proposed a breaking API change to allow `sendMessageToTarget()` to return message references instead of void
- Shaw suggested using the IMessageService approach and mentioned upcoming features like `runtime.getServicesByType(MessageService)`
- Odilitime recommended `kwangsuklee/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M-Q6_K:latest` model for ElizaOS with Ollama
- Twitter integration now requires API keys, with free tier sufficient if replies to bots are disabled
- A new ElizaOS website is in development (Jin)

### Plugin Issues

- 0xCardiE noted confusion about versioning in the SQL plugin

### Ecosystem Projects

### Government Connection

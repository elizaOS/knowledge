## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is elizaOS 1.0 same as Eliza v2?**  
A: No, they are different products (answered by Addison Casey)

**Q: What's the difference between v2 and 1.0.0?**  
A: They're the same thing, just different naming conventions. "v2" is considered poor branding while "1.0.0" is better branding (answered by xell0x)

**Q: How do I get my agent to automatically tweet without manual instructions?**  
A: The ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION environment variable should be set to true, and the Twitter plugin must be in the character's plugin array (answered by 0xbisbis)

**Q: How do I import a character in Eliza v2?**  
A: The command 'character' doesn't exist; refer to the documentation at https://eliza.how/docs/cli/agent (answered by starlord)

**Q: What are the bull arguments for holding ai16z?**  
A: Participation in agentic governance, voting power on clank tank, influencing the council, new spartan shipping with v2, autofun/spartan/agents trading tokenomics, and being the most active open source crypto AI DAO (answered by jin)

**Q: How can the team improve communication with the Asian community?**  
A: Create AI news in Chinese/Korean, establish dedicated social media accounts for Asian markets, and potentially hire someone to run ElizaOS Asia operations (answered by jin)

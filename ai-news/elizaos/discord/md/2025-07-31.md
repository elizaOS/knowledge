# elizaOS Discord - 2025-07-31

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **ElizaOS Version**: Current version is 1.3.1, with ongoing work on the Eliza Cloud API
- **UUID Generation Issues**: The team identified problems with the current deterministic UUID generation based on agent names, which could cause conflicts if two users create agents with identical names
- **Plugin Namespacing**: Consensus that plugins should use a structured namespace format (plugins/<namespace>) rather than a flat structure
- **API Improvements**: Current API has poor developer experience; a simpler POST message API was suggested that would use default channels and hang HTTP responses while waiting for bootstrap events
- **Plugin Search**: Shaw is working on plugin search functionality that will be available as a rate-limited endpoint
- **Dynamic Plugin Calling**: Discussion about implementing context-based plugin calling to improve discoverability

### Social Media Strategy
- **X/Twitter Accounts**: Multiple users inquired about suspended Twitter/X accounts for ElizaOS. Ben clarified that X will return eventually, but the team is temporarily using alternative platforms like Farcaster and LinkedIn
- **Communication Channels**: The team is expanding to additional communication channels "this week and next" while waiting for X accounts to be restored

### Events & Workshops
- **Deep Dive Session**: Announced session on deploying agents with comput3
- **Vibe Content Creation Workshop**: Cancelled for the current week, will resume next week with new brand kits

### Technical Implementations
- **Spartan**: Mentioned as an ElizaOS implementation in production (available in the ElizaOS GitHub organization)
- **OpenRouter**: Announced "Horizon Alpha," a new model with 256k context that logs prompts and completions for training purposes

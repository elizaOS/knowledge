## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I configure embedding models with Ollama and OpenRouter?**  
A: Configure OpenRouter to precede Ollama in the plugin order so anything not set up for models from the first LLM plugin would fallback to the second one.

**Q: Which coin/project should I buy in Ai16Z eco?**  
A: "This time it's actually tech launching not just 'degen' tokens. Long term my friend long term."

**Q: How can we start our agent stored in TS file using elizaos start without creating a JSON file?**  
A: Navigate to the project-starter folder, edit the index.ts file, then run the elizaos start command in the same folder.

**Q: Would it be cool if the characters had better mouth movements when they talk?**  
A: "You're gunna love the next update 😁"

**Q: What caused the price pump for ELI5?**  
A: "Not sure, unless we're getting farmed."

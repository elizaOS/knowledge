# elizaOS Discord - 2025-10-28

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **x402 Middleware Development**: Odilitime is working on Spartan's x402 middleware, which will be available for all plugin routes upon runtime plugin registration. The middleware needs to meet specific requirements from x402scan.com/resources/register, requiring a custom solution rather than premade middleware.
- **Bug Fix (PR #6102)**: A fix was created for an issue where setting character.settings.secret would cause .env to be ignored, with Stan implementing a "smart merge solution."
- **Protocol 8004 Development**: Borko confirmed they're working on various token utility angles for protocol 8004, with plans to have a functional MVP ready for Devcon in mid-November.
- **Otaku Agent**: A new Eliza agent called "Otaku" is in beta testing, with early access being offered to partners.

### Token Migration & Economics
- Multiple users inquired about the migration from AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS, with team members directing them to watch the announcement channel for updates.
- Toni explained that the migration ratio will be fixed, with incentives for users who lock their tokens for a period of time.
- DorianD proposed creating a narrative around "Artificial Social Intelligence Credits" (ASICs) that would function as a reputation system within the ElizaOS ecosystem.

### Project Integration & Partnerships
- Discussion about potential integration between ElizaOS and x402.org, with reference to an interview ElizaOS did with Erik Reppel (creator of x402.org).
- References to Spartan LLM Trading tool and the upcoming Spartan Arena.
- The team is coordinating on meetings, including a Coinbase call about X402.

### Marketing & Strategy
- Komi urged the team to capitalize on the current momentum around Base's 402 narrative rather than waiting for perfect conditions.
- DorianD suggested positioning ElizaOS as essential protection against future AI systems, creating both fear (of being left behind) and greed (opportunities for early adopters) to drive adoption.
- Emphasis on the need for stronger marketing direction and storytelling alongside technical development.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How to migrate my AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS?**  
A: Not yet available. Keep an eye on the announcement channel for updates. (Dr. Neuro)

**Q: What if I've been keeping my $ai16z on an exchange the whole time? Do I still qualify for the incentives?**  
A: The migration ratio is going to be fixed. There will be incentives to lock your tokens up for some time, with extra tokens available later. (Toni)

**Q: Can we get x402: Boolean in everything now or just spartan fork?**  
A: It's built as a middleware that can be injected on all plugin routes on runtime plugin register, so it can be available for everything. Once working, a PR to core can be made. (Odilitime)

**Q: What issue did you run into with x402?**  
A: The x402scan.com/resources/register had very specific requirements, necessitating abandoning premade middleware and creating a custom solution. (Odilitime)

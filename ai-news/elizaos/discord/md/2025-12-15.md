# elizaOS Discord - 2025-12-15

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token Migration & Exchange Listings

**Bithumb Migration Crisis**: Korean users expressed significant frustration over delayed ai16z to ElizaOS token migration on Bithumb. The exchange failed to suspend deposits and trading after the migration portal went live on November 11 (snapshot at 11:40 UTC), creating confusion for users who weren't actively monitoring announcements. Community debate ensued about responsibility allocation, with Omid Sa clarifying that exchanges are responsible for CEX-held token migrations.

**Kraken Resolution**: A major breakthrough occurred when Kraken announced they would complete the ElizaOS migration on December 19 at 3:00 PM UTC. Users who held ai16z at the snapshot time will receive ElizaOS at a 1:6 ratio automatically, with trading and withdrawals reopening simultaneously.

### Critical Security Incident

A critical security breach was reported where the elizaOS migration site was compromised. The site prompted wallet connections and requested approval for the most valuable tokens in users' wallets, resulting in theft. Odilitime acknowledged the issue and began investigation immediately.

### Development Process Improvements

**New PR Review Requirements**: cjft introduced a mandatory rule that all PRs over 20 lines must include screenshots or 1-2 minute videos demonstrating the feature works. This addresses issues where PRs that "build" and pass AI reviews fail in production. Shaw formalized this as official policy.

**AI-Assisted Development Training**: cjft announced plans for a mandatory "how to vibe code" training session for all developers, demonstrating AI-assisted development workflows using Cursor with Claude Opus. The approach involves copy-pasting tasks from Linear into Cursor, letting AI generate code, and iterating on error logs.

**Parallelization Strategies**: Advanced development workflows were discussed, with shaw using 3 laptops running simultaneous prompts. sayonara suggested git worktrees as a solution for managing multiple concurrent development streams. R0am shared claudekit (github.com/carlrannaberg/claudekit) which uses hooks and code reviewer sub-agents for managing multiple parallel AI coding agents.

### Technical Progress

**Cloud Streaming Implementation**: Stan provided updates that streaming functionality works in the monorepo but Actions UI displays text all at once instead of streaming (rendering issue, not stream issue). He plans to switch to 402x PR work and rebase authentication PR on monorepo.

**Spartan Development**: Odilitime is working on getting Spartan ready for cloud deployment, Babylon integration, and wider Discord distribution.

**Agent Deployment Success**: Thirtieth successfully deployed an NFL trades tracking agent, building a table with Neon database to track NFL trades over $100, deploying to GitHub and Fly.io, and configuring Polymarket bets tracking. The remaining challenge was configuring the agent to understand conversation context.

### Database & Infrastructure Issues

**PostgreSQL Migration Problems**: FenrirFawks encountered persistent migration errors with a local PostgreSQL 18 database involving permission problems with the public schema. Stan provided systematic troubleshooting assistance.

**Twitter Integration Issues**: soyrubio reported Twitter replies causing database failures due to foreign key constraints. Redvoid suggested trying the latest codebase which includes SQL fixes.

**Hosting Recommendations**: Discussion about hosting options included VPS (DigitalOcean, AWS EC2, GCP) and PaaS (Fly.io, Railway, Render, Northflank). Odilitime recommended Hetzner or OVH.

### Community & Strategic Initiatives

**Partners Channel Repositioning**: untitled, xyz proposed rebranding the partners channel as "Eliza-Alpha" to preview ElizaOS cloud features and developments. The proposal emphasizes inviting strategic participants (beyond just token holders) to access demos, teasers, and early previews with the expectation they would help test, leak content strategically, and amplify announcements on social media.

**Creative Contest**: A 100k ElizaOS contest was announced in the creative channel to encourage community engagement through art, videos, and applications.

**Community Sentiment**: Discussion revealed concerns about price performance and project viability. Questions arose about Shaw's reduced activity on Farcaster since December 2nd, though Kenk and Omid Sa confirmed ElizaOS is just getting started.

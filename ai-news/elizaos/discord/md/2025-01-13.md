# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-13

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Rebranding from ai16z to ElizaOS
- The project is planning to rebrand from "ai16z" to "ElizaOS" due to potential trademark issues with a16z (Andreessen Horowitz)
- This rebranding aims to better align the project's name with its technical foundation while avoiding legal complications
- The team is consulting with Solana Foundation about whether the token ticker can be changed, but any change would need to wait at least 2 months
- Shaw explained that rebranding would enable partnerships and collaborations currently on hold

### ElizaOS Framework Development
- The team is working on V2 of the framework with improved autonomy features
- GitHub repository shows significant development activity with daily updates and numerous contributors
- The framework currently has 77 plugins and supports multimodality
- Docker image optimization by Mike D reduced image size by removing image/audio/video processing components
- Several users are building applications on top of the Eliza framework, including GOATAGI and Ninjapump

### Tokenomics and Marketplace
- Jin is finalizing a tokenomics paper that will include multiple flywheel strategies to be implemented in phases
- A "Marketplace of Trust" is being developed as part of the tokenomics strategy
- Projects built on ElizaOS will contribute 10% back to the treasury through a tribute model
- DorianD suggested embedding this 10% tribute mechanism in the codebase to ensure revenue even from forked implementations
- Discussion about reframing the "launchpad" concept as an "agent marketplace"

### AI TV Show Development
- Team is developing an AI-powered TV show system with three formats:
  - AI Podcast (daily GitHub updates)
  - Jedi Council (characters discussing blockchain topics)
  - Block Tank (a Shark Tank-style show for crypto pitches)
- SM Sith Lord manages the backend show generation system while Boom handles the Unity frontend
- Technical challenges include JSON data flow issues and debates about 3D model formats (VRM vs. FBX)

### Community Structure
- New "associates" channel created for users holding 10,000+ AI16Z tokens (compared to "partners" with 100,000+)
- Jin proposed creating an intermediate "executive" role (50k tokens) between associates and partners
- Tip.cc bot implemented for distributing tokens within the community through airdrops, triviadrops, and red envelopes

### DegenAI Concerns
- Community members expressed frustration about lack of clear information regarding DegenAI's roadmap and integration with the ai16z ecosystem
- Uncertainty about whether DegenAI is actively trading, with conflicting claims
- Jin and Odilitime acknowledged feedback about improving communications, mentioning a website is coming soon

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What is the cause of the Twitter account suspension?**  
A: The team has received details from X, but Odilitime indicated it's "above my paygrade" to share specifics. Ben suggested it might be related to "a cranky post-breakup Elon."

**Q: Have they purchased the Twitter API?**  
A: Yes, they have bought the API, but it has no bearing on the suspensions according to Odilitime.

**Q: Will the Twitter account be restored?**  
A: They're waiting on X, with Odilitime estimating a 99% chance it will return, but timing is uncertain.

**Q: What is the value proposition for holding tokens?**  
A: It's a DAO, holding enough tokens gives more access; auto.fun drives ai16z token pressure, which drives DegenAI pressure through buybacks.

**Q: Is ai16z profitable?**  
A: Not yet, but they have plenty of runway and are focusing on getting products right.

**Q: Will Spartan's first product release happen along with V2 announcement?**  
A: It's possible but they're not attempting to do that, they are separate things.

**Q: Which KVM do you recommend for ElizaOS?**  
A: KVM4 is a better value.

**Q: How do we stop agents writing with emojis on discord?**  
A: Specify in bio and in system.

**Q: Why would my agent be getting a new agent ID everytime it starts up?**  
A: Agent ID is based on the name, so this shouldn't happen unless the character name is changing.

**Q: How do actions pass data from one action to another?**  
A: This will be fixed in the next release; both actions will reply so users will get multiple messages.

**Q: Is the coin AI16Z a rugpull or scam?**  
A: It's not a scam or rugpull, according to HodlHusky.

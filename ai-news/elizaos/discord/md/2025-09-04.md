# elizaOS Discord - 2025-09-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Package Versioning System**: The team implemented a new versioning system where develop branch uses alpha versions (1.5.8-alpha.0) while main branch uses beta versions to ensure synchronization.
- **ElizaOS Core Issue**: A bug was identified in ElizaOS core 1.5.7 where the admin GUI wouldn't load due to "watcher watching test files." A temporary solution is to use the `start` command instead of `dev`.
- **Eliza Cloud Platform Progress**: Most MVP v1 features are completed, including API key service, usage tracking, and CLI integration. The team is preparing to move to MVP v2 with containers and sandboxes.
- **Protocol Standards Discussion**: Debate between JSON-RPC, MCP (Model Context Protocol), and ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) for agent-to-agent and agent-to-plugin communications, with JSON-RPC emerging as the preferred standard.
- **Bidirectional MCP Implementation**: Discussion on implementing bidirectional communication in MCP by passing the agent's completion endpoint to MCP with a key in an init() tool.

### Integrations & Partnerships
- **x402 Protocol**: Significant discussion about x402, a protocol for managing API payments using crypto wallets instead of API keys. It's currently live on tip.md since June and was developed for a Coinbase hackathon.
- **VaultLayer Integration**: VaultLayer introduced a BTC Yield Optimizer built with elizaOS.
- **Hackathon Interest**: Carlos Rene from DEGA inquired about promoting a hackathon featuring ElizaOS with ZK Proofs for private transactions.
- **Alternative Frameworks**: A developer mentioned building an "agentic car" called "Fibonacci" using langgraph instead of ElizaOS, citing better documentation and integration experience.

### Community & Token Discussion
- **Token Concerns**: Several members expressed disappointment about ElizaOS token performance and questioned the relationship between framework development and token value.
- **Beta Product Launch**: A product related to "vaulter agents" that has been in development for six months is now in beta, with some users receiving tester roles and invites.
- **AI Trading Tools**: Discussion about AI-powered cryptocurrency tools like Clanker (an AI-powered memecoin generator that has created over 355,000 tokens) and potential for AI trading agents as benchmarks.
- **Legal Update**: Brief mention of a legal case involving Eliza Labs and X Corporation, with X required to respond by the 19th.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why not use elizaOS for your project?**  
A: "For me, I was able to integrate langgraph a bit easier than eliza. I think much of it came down to the docs - it was just a smoother process for me." (answered by labmgr)

**Q: What is x402 and why is it important?**  
A: "It's a protocol that eliminates the need for API keys by allowing agents to pay per request using crypto wallets, reducing the tedium of managing API subscriptions." (answered by jin)

**Q: Where is x402 currently being used?**  
A: "It's live on tip.md since June, and was done for Coinbase dev hackathon." (answered by R0am | tip.md)

**Q: What is the status of bidirectional MCP?**  
A: "It's doable but requires custom implementation, where you pass the agent's openai/completion endpoint to MCP with a key in an init() tool." (answered by cjft)

**Q: What transport should be used for MCP server-to-client communication?**  
A: "SSE is deprecated, HTTP-streaming is the one to use now." (answered by R0am | tip.md)

**Q: How much will this coin fall?**  
A: "You'll be sad you didn't buy now." (answered by Heisenberg)

**Q: When is launch again?**  
A: "It's in beta now." (answered by Kenk)

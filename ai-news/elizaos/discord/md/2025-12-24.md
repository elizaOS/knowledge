# elizaOS Discord - 2025-12-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token Economics & Revenue Model
- **Clarification on Revenue Usage**: Odilitime confirmed that Cloud revenue (but not yield) will be used for ElizaOS token buybacks
- **Future Token Utility**: Borko shared that additional token utility is planned when Jeju is released
- **Community Concerns**: Several users expressed concerns about the token being down 99.5% from its peak
- **Tokenomics Comparison**: A suggestion was made to adopt Virtual's model where agent tokens are paired with the main token
- **Team Perspective**: Odilitime explained that token value comes from product usage, coordination, and service demand scaling with activity, with the team prioritizing infrastructure development over short-term market reactions

### Technical Development
- **Bun Frontend**: Shaw mentioned building a pure Bun frontend with Elysia workers and workerd (similar to Cloudflare), creating a fully serverless application that builds faster than Next.js
- **Repository Updates**: Odilitime pushed changes to plugin-starknet and shared a link to plugin-wrapped repository
- **Documentation Issues**: Stan identified outdated information in the monorepo documentation and began updating it
- **GitHub Actions**: A job failure was reported due to Claude billing needing a top-up

### Cloud Platform Features
- **File Upload Limits**: Borko clarified that there's a 50MB file upload limit for the ElizaOS Cloud
- **Custom Model Hosting**: Custom model hosting is on the roadmap for the following week
- **Data Format Recommendations**: Markdown was recommended as the preferred format for data uploads to agents

### Wallet & Migration
- **Token Migration**: A user inquired about migrating tokens from Moonshot wallet
- **Security Warnings**: Community members warned about potential scams during the migration process
- **Recommendation**: Users were advised to move tokens to Phantom wallet for safer migration

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why would anybody invest in the Eliza token if the cloud product doesn't impact it?**  
A: Some revenue will be used for buy backs, the yield won't (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Can I transfer 300 pages of book data to my agent, or would that be too much context for a cloud agent?**  
A: For file uploads we've set a limit of 50MB. (answered by Borko)

**Q: Is it possible to use open source models on my own GPU servers via the ElizaOS cloud?**  
A: Using custom models hosted on your own is not available yet, but it's on our roadmap. Will probably be ready next week. (answered by Borko)

**Q: What format would you suggest for data?**  
A: Best is markdown, but can do most types just fine. (answered by Borko)

**Q: How can I connect my Moonshot to the migration site? I hold some 50k Ai16z in my moonshot**  
A: You should move your tokens to phantom wallet (answered by Hexx 🌐)

**Q: Why can't we copy Virtual's tokenomics where every agent token is paired with the main token?**  
A: The team is focused on building infrastructure that creates sustained demand through product usage rather than reacting to short-term market pressure. (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Where in the roadmap does it mention value accrual to the Eliza token?**  
A: The roadmap is a technical document, not a tokenomics piece. (answered by Kenk)

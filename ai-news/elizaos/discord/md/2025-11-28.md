# elizaOS Discord - 2025-11-28

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token Migration
- A manual migration pathway has been established for converting AI16Z tokens to ElizaOS tokens through a support ticket system
- Users must send their AI16Z tokens to the designated wallet address: 77qVj3adpxbKjLuD9FoeFvDxHuAsro1cEZ5
- Several users reported issues with the migration process, including "max amount reached" errors and discrepancies in convertible token amounts
- Special consideration is being given to users who provided liquidity (SOL/AI16Z) during the snapshot period

### Exchange Listings & Tokenomics
- Debate about the value of futures pairings versus spot listings on centralized exchanges (CEXs)
- Some users argued that futures pairings with high volume can influence price movement and sentiment
- Others contended that spot listings have more significant impact on token value
- Community members expressed interest in additional CEX listings, particularly on major exchanges like Binance and Kraken
- Discussion about Hyperliquid (HL) taking fees away from centralized exchanges like Binance rather than from Ethereum
- Observation that successful L1 blockchains should focus on taking users away from centralized systems

### Cross-Chain Functionality
- Interest in bridging ElizaOS tokens from Solana to EVM chains using CCIP
- Questions about the availability of cross-chain solutions for token holders

### Marketing & Community
- Suggestions for improved marketing strategies including newsletters, blog posts, and social media presence
- Recommendations for community programs, meetups, and interviews to increase engagement
- Observation that user interviews are happening but could be expanded into broader marketing initiatives

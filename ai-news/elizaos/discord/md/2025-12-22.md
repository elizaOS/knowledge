# elizaOS Discord - 2025-12-22

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token & Business Concerns
- **Token Price Issues**: Community members expressed frustration about ElizaOS token's declining value (down ~75% for some holders)
- **Token Utility Questions**: Several members highlighted the need for better communication about token utility and roadmap details
- **Market Analysis**: One user noted that current price action indicates more sellers than buyers, with sellers accepting losses, partly attributed to poor performance across the AI crypto sector

### Product Development
- **Eliza Cloud Launch**: Team is close to launching Eliza Cloud, an AI-assisted development tool for building, deploying, and managing agents
- **Platform Strategy**: Initially focusing on elizaOS but will eventually open up for other agent frameworks
- **Token Utility Plans**: Token will have utility through project airdrops (like Babylon), buybacks from Eliza Cloud revenue, and a decentralized OTC desk in development
- **Interoperability Proposal**: Suggestion to create a skill that translates elizaOS plugins into skills for interoperability with agentskills.io

### Technical Issues
- **Starknet Plugin Error**: A user reported an error parsing String to BigInt in the Starknet plugin when creating an unruggable token
- **Security Alert**: Mention of a CVE 10 RCE (Remote Code Execution) exploit discovered in n8n

### Research & Resources
- Team members shared links to research papers, blog posts about open tool composition, and GitHub repositories including "automaker"
- Discussion about TUI (Text User Interface) strategy, with arguments against creating a new TUI and instead advocating for a Linux-like composability approach

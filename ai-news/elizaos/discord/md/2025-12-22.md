# elizaOS Discord - 2025-12-22

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Project Development & Roadmap
- **Eliza Cloud Launch**: The team is close to launching Eliza Cloud, an AI-assisted development tool for building, deploying, and managing agents on the elizaOS framework. Initially focused on elizaOS but will eventually open components for other agent frameworks.
- **Ecosystem Projects**: Projects like Babylon (AI agentic prediction market) and Otako are being developed with potential airdrops for ElizaOS token holders.
- **Revenue Model**: Eliza Cloud revenue will be used for token buybacks to support token value.
- **Interoperability Strategy**: Discussion about creating a skill to translate elizaOS plugins into skills for interoperability with agentskills.io, with Jin advocating for a Linux-like composability strategy rather than creating a new Text User Interface (TUI).

### Technical Issues
- A user reported an error with the Starknet plugin when trying to create a token through "unruggable" - specifically a "Failed to parse String to BigInt" error during deployment.
- A CVE 10 Remote Code Execution vulnerability was discovered in n8n, as mentioned by Jin.

### Token & Market Concerns
- **Price Decline**: Community members expressed frustration about the token's price decline (reportedly down from a $2.5B market cap to $25M).
- **Token Utility Questions**: Several users raised concerns about the lack of clear documentation on how the token integrates with the platform.
- **Market Context**: Some community members attributed price action partly to poor performance across the AI crypto sector generally.

### Research & Resources
- Sam shared an arXiv paper and a blog post about open tool composition, along with a link to the AutoMaker GitHub repository.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What is Eliza Cloud?**  
A: It's a low-code agent builder for elizaOS. There are components of it that will open up for other agent frameworks, like 8004 registry. Initially it's elizaOS focused. (answered by Kenk)

**Q: What is the best route to buy ElizaOS tokens?**  
A: "I use USDT on BSC in pancake swap. You can buy your gas fee for starting from a cex." (answered by Omid Sa)

**Q: What is Babylon?**  
A: "It's a AI agentic prediction market." (answered by Omid Sa)

**Q: When is the Babylon airdrop due?**  
A: "Soon" (answered by The Light)

**Q: How could elizaOS plugins be made interoperable with other systems?**  
A: By creating a skill that translates elizaOS plugins into skills for platforms like agentskills.io (answered by Jin)

**Q: Where can I find ElizaOS Twitter account?**  
A: "https://x.com/elizaecofund or https://x.com/elizaosc our main one is currently suspended: https://x.com/elizaos" (answered by Odilitime)

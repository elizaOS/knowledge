# elizaOS Discord - 2025-11-18

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token Migration (AI16Z to ElizaOS)
- The project has migrated from AI16Z to ElizaOS due to trademark conflicts with a16z corporation
- Migration involves a 1:6 conversion ratio with a snapshot mechanism limiting eligible addresses
- Users are experiencing various issues with the migration portal, including zero eligible tokens showing or reaching maximum conversion limits
- The migration has caused significant price volatility, with some users noting a 98% price drop
- Community members are directing those with migration issues to the dedicated migration support channel

### Development Status & Roadmap
- The Eliza framework is technically complete with documentation, tutorials, and tooling
- Current focus is on developing consumer-facing applications to demonstrate the framework's value
- Two products with clear revenue streams are in development: "Cloud" and "Babylon"
- Future plans include creating a world for agents backed by a chain where $elizaOS serves as gas
- An "eliza app" is confirmed to be on the roadmap, with TestFlight deployment assistance offered

### AI Agent Memory Systems
- The team is implementing a long-term memory system for AI agents similar to Character.AI
- A structured memory categorization system with nine specific categories is being developed:
  - Identity, expertise, projects, preferences, data sources, goals, constraints, definitions, and behavioral patterns
- An onboarding process to populate these memory categories is being considered
- The system will handle both memory creation and character configuration
- Potential use of Jungian Typology classification for pre-built character templates is being discussed

### Technical Issues & Integration
- Some users reported build errors while trying to build Docker images on Phala for TEE projects
- Database interface issues were mentioned where no databases appear or the application freezes
- Cloudflare network problems were affecting various services including Twitter
- Potential integrations with Phantom wallet and Ethereum were briefly mentioned
- Possible collaboration with a team working on Eigen Layer integration was discussed

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why did the project migrate from AI16Z to ElizaOS?**  
A: Marc A requested the name change due to it conflicting with his a16z corp. Plus migration offered opportunity to become cross chain with x402 integration.

**Q: How is AI16Z half the MC of ElizaOS and conversion rate is 1:6? What am I missing?**  
A: Because of the snapshot. You can only convert from white listed addresses up to around that was at the address at time of snapshot.

**Q: How easy is it to get Spartan trading on Gemini 3?**  
A: "I think pretty easy."

**Q: What is the current status of the Eliza framework?**  
A: It's technically complete with documentation, tutorials, and tooling, but needs consumer-facing applications.

**Q: What's the plan for tokenomics given the low treasury?**  
A: Use revenue to buy tokens and seed liquidity.

**Q: What products are being developed with clear revenue streams?**  
A: Cloud and Babylon.

**Q: Is an eliza app on the roadmap?**  
A: "Yes sir."

**Q: Do we want to test this approach for the cloud?**  
A: "Yea so from a UX perspective that's still being thought out but I think we definitely want to have the general capability."

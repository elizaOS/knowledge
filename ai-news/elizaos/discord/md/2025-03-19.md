# elizaOS Discord - 2025-03-19

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS v2 Development Status
- The v2 beta has recently gone live but remains somewhat unstable, with developers actively fixing bugs
- Beta phase is expected to last approximately two weeks according to rhota
- Complete refactoring has significantly improved developer experience with new features including:
  - GUI and Tauri app
  - CLI improvements
  - In-browser editor
  - Simplified API that eliminates character files in favor of runtime configurations
- The team is about to publish the next beta version and has fixed most startup issues
- Multiple repositories have been merged into a single ElizaOS core repo

### Technical Challenges & Solutions
- Users are experiencing various issues in the transition from v0.25.x to v1.0.0-beta/alpha versions
- RAG knowledge implementation is a common pain point, with consensus that placing files in `characters/knowledge/agent_knowledge/` works best
- Plugin compatibility issues are prevalent, especially with plugin-sql
- Several users report issues with CLI installation and startup process for newer versions
- Some users are working on adapters for databases like Supabase and MongoDB

### Documentation & Visual Assets
- Jin is leading efforts to create visual assets for ElizaOS documentation using AI image generation tools
- Documentation structure includes entities, components, actions, evaluators, providers, and databases
- Jin is working on improving navigation with mermaid flow charts
- Chinese community members requested clearer onboarding guides for developers

### Tokenomics & DAO Organization
- Discussions about potential token utility models for ai16z, including:
  - Using tokens as a commodity for paying for compute
  - Stake-weighted voting system for securing new Elizas/plugins
  - Agent registration system using public keys
- Plans for multi-chain support for the ElizaOS marketplace, with interest in BNB Chain integration
- Implementation of a structured social media amplification process
- Development of AI agents for governance with connections to Hats Protocol
- Collaboration with Agora to explore agent-based governance

### Spartan/DegenAI Integration
- The team is working on making Spartan functional within the new v2 architecture
- DegenAI's technology had to be moved entirely to the v2 stack
- Current priority is getting open-source functionality working in v2 and deploying Spartan to communities
- The spartan_holders channel was made private to give token holders exclusive access to the full Spartan v2 agent with sentiment analysis capabilities

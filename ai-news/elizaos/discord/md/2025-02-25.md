# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-25

**Date: February 25, 2025**

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development & Technical Issues
- **Memory Allocation Problems**: Multiple users reported "JavaScript heap out of memory" errors when running agents with knowledge bases in v0.25.8. The common workaround is setting `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"` or removing knowledge entries from character files.
- **Plugin Migration**: Plugins have been moved to separate repositories under `elizaos-plugins/`, causing some confusion about proper implementation.
- **Twitter Client Issues**: Users are experiencing problems with Twitter client connectivity in the latest version (v0.25.8) due to changes in the clients key structure.
- **ARM64 Support**: There are ongoing issues with running Eliza via Docker on ARM64 architecture servers, specifically with the module '@anush008/tokenizers-linux-arm64-gnu'.
- **Character File Optimization**: Several users reported problems with repetitive posting patterns from their AI agents, requiring explicit instructions in character files to prevent redundancy.

### AI Agent Development
- **DegenAI Updates**: The team has reactivated DegenAI on Discord for testing after its X (Twitter) account was suspended for about a month. Focus is on ensuring it properly pulls in context about trades.
- **Trading Strategy Suggestions**: Detailed technical trading strategy was proposed for DegenAI, including monitoring BTC price ranges and using tools like coinrotator.app for trend analysis.
- **AI News Aggregator**: Jin reported that an AI news aggregator is nearly complete with quality historical aggregation features for X, Discord, GitHub, and markets, plus summarization capabilities.
- **Trust Marketplace**: A pre-alpha test for the Trust Marketplace was announced, seeking partner volunteers to help build Trust Scores by making token evaluations.

### Governance & Token Issues
- **Token Ticker Change**: Partners expressed frustration about the slow progress on changing the token ticker from ai16z to match the ElizaOS rebrand, which has been pending for months due to dependency on daos.fun to implement a voting module.
- **Governance Solutions**: Discussion about alternative voting mechanisms that don't depend on daos.fun, including using Snapshot or exploring other open-source governance tools.

### Integration & API Concerns
- **LinkedIn Integration**: The LinkedIn client for ElizaOS appears to be non-functional, with reports that someone worked on it 2.5 months ago but encountered errors and never completed the integration.
- **Instagram API**: Questions about Instagram API integrations that appear to be non-functional.
- **Facebook Client**: Inquiries about whether a Facebook client is available for ElizaOS.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do you install the new Claude?**  
A: Use "npm install -g anthropic/claude-code" (answered by yikesawjeez)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Memory Allocation Troubleshooting**: PiagaShihari helped lefrog with memory allocation errors by suggesting the removal of "knowledge" from character's JSON as a temporary workaround.

- **RAG Knowledge Base Configuration**: Sabochee assisted Waqas Wahid with RAG knowledge base errors with OpenAI by suggesting setting embeddingModel and model to 'text-embedding-ada-002' in character config.

- **Database Connection Issues**: PΞTE helped sergii.bomko with Postgres database connection issues by providing the correct format for POSTGRES_URL and pointing to schema.sql in adapter-postgres package.

- **Character File Optimization**: Patt helped artzy with issues related to Twitter posts being redundant and repetitive by suggesting explicitly specifying in the character file to NOT talk repetitively and trying a different model.

- **Trading Strategy Development**: Osint provided detailed technical trading strategy suggestions for DegenAI, including monitoring BTC price ranges, entering positions at the lower part of these ranges, and using tools like coinrotator.app for trend analysis.

- **Governance Research**: Jin shared a workflow for using yt-dlp, ffmpeg, and insanely-fast-whisper to transcribe content for documentation to help partners research alternative governance solutions.

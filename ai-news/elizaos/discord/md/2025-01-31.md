# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-31

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development
- **v0.1.9 Release**: Odilitime released ElizaOS v0.1.9 with comprehensive updates including bug fixes and new features. The release includes improvements to model provider configurations, Twitter client functionality, and database integrations.
- **Framework Architecture**: Discussions revealed that ElizaOS randomly selects from available inputs for each response generation, picking one bio item and one lore item from the available pool, which explains inconsistencies when testing character changes.
- **Google Vertex Integration**: A new PR was added for Google Vertex Support, expanding the available model providers.
- **Documentation Improvements**: Jin analyzed 2 months of discord chat and summarized into a documentation book at https://hackmd.io/@xr/elizaos-rpgf to help answer common questions.

### Plugin Development
- **New Plugins**: Several new plugins are in development, including arbitrage capabilities, Mind Network integration, Zilliqa blockchain support, and improvements to existing Solana, TON, and Dexscreener plugins.
- **Custom Scrapers**: Discussions about implementing custom context scrapers for agents to use as information sources, with kirsten explaining how to create API endpoints for scrapers and write plugins that call those APIs.

### AI Agent Applications
- **AI News Aggregator**: Jin demonstrated an AI-powered news aggregator that automatically generates ecosystem newsletters by analyzing recent developments.
- **3D AI TV Project**: FishAI is developing a React-based website to host AI-driven streaming content with multiple character personalities (Degen, Peepo, Eliza, and Tubby) that interact in a financial/market context.
- **DegenAI Development**: Rhota shared a roadmap link and mentioned upcoming sentiment layer functionality for DegenAI, with plans to integrate with other AI agents like Scarlett for token analysis.

### Project Branding & Tokenomics
- **Rebranding Clarification**: The entity is now called ElizaOS, while the token remains ai16z until further notice. This appears to be a strategic move to establish a clearer identity focused on the agent framework.
- **Token Performance Concerns**: Partners discussed the 90% pullback in token price, with some attributing it to Binance perp trading effects. Team members emphasized focusing on building rather than short-term price action.
- **Tokenomics Planning**: Jin mentioned discussing launch plans for tokenomics, aiming for announcements the following week but avoiding hard dates. There are also discussions about implementing a launchpad.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can I provide custom context through a scraper backend I wrote for Eliza to tweet from?**  
A: "Yes you can. You just make an API endpoint for your scraper, and then write a plugin that calls your API." (answered by kirsten)

**Q: Is it possible using Eliza to build an AI-driven workflow to generate a new 50 to 60-chapter novel using a reference novel as input?**  
A: "That's more something you'd use like langchain for. Eliza agents are good for having an agent that performs actions repeatedly and asynchronously." (answered by kirsten)

**Q: How can I train AI by connecting it to an Excel sheet or importing .csv file?**  
A: "You could turn the CSV into a SQL db and have it use that as its knowledge base, or copy paste it into chatGPT and ask it to modify your character file." (answered by RoomTemp IQ)

**Q: How to start autonomous trading with Eliza?**  
A: "You need to utilize the auto plugin in combination with Solana or whatever chain." (answered by RoomTemp IQ)

**Q: How can I use the plugins in Eliza-starter?**  
A: "Should just need the appropriate API key set in the .env file and it'll activate the plugin." (answered by Bubba Sol)

**Q: How does the Eliza system work?**  
A: "It randomly selects from available inputs for each response generation, picking one bio item and one lore item from the available pool." (answered by kirsten)

**Q: Can you make DegenAI posting like aixbt or moby?**  
A: "The sentiment layer being built now should address some of what you're asking for." (answered by rhota)

**Q: Did you find any solution to how to DCA ai16z?**  
A: "I used Trojan on telegram, but you can probably use photon/bullx/bonkbot for this." (answered by witch)

**Q: So when we're tweeting to bullpost our bags is it still $ai16z or now $elizaos? Or is it $eliza?**  
A: "It's definitely not $Eliza. They're gang but it's not our tickers. ai16z until further notice." (answered by Smedroc)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Troubleshooting
- **Twitter Client Issues**: Silasneo helped xzrfax with Twitter login failing on VPS but working locally, explaining it's likely an IP location issue and suggesting tunneling into VPS to login to X first.
- **WSL Installation Problems**: Yung Carl and infinityu1729 helped Kastel514 with WSL permission errors, suggesting reestablishing permissions with sudo commands and switching to stable versions.
- **Character File Testing**: Kirsten explained to Interval how the system randomly selects inputs, suggesting comprehensive edits to all items rather than just a few to see consistent changes.

### Development Guidance
- **Data Integration**: RoomTemp IQ advised sillysurry on training AI with Excel/CSV data, suggesting converting CSV to SQLite database or copying data to ChatGPT to modify character file.
- **Autonomous Trading**: RoomTemp IQ guided tribeofdanel on setting up autonomous trading with Eliza, suggesting using client-auto plugin with Solana.
- **Model Configuration**: tcm390 helped PhÃºc LÃ¢m with configuring free versions of Google models by providing env file configuration examples.

### Market Analysis

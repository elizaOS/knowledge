# elizaOS Discord - 2025-10-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### x402 Integration
- **Eliza Cloud Platform**: Kenk confirmed that all Eliza agents will be able to utilize x402 through a new "Eliza Cloud" agent development platform
- **Rapid Implementation**: cjft demonstrated creating several x402-enabled MCPs (Machine Callable Programs) for services like Twitter API, OpenAI image generation, and CoinGecko PRO within 30 minutes
- **Integration Methods**: The team explored multiple implementation approaches including enabling x402 in the server with an ENABLE_X402 flag and creating MCPs that support x402 payments
- **Wallet Support**: The main blocker identified is that most agents lack wallet support; the team discussed creating a custodial wallet MCP to allow agents like Cursor and Claude Code to use x402 immediately

### Token Migration
- **Status**: The migration is pending but not yet open; slight delay reported
- **Exchange Preparation**: Kenk confirmed that all exchanges have been notified about the migration
- **Community Concern**: Several members expressed concern about the timing of the migration, with some suggesting that marketing around x402 integration is currently more important

### Marketing & Communication
- **Organizational Challenges**: Community members expressed concern about ElizaOS's marketing approach, with komi suggesting a comprehensive organizational restructuring
- **Social Media Presence**: The importance of restoring the official Twitter/X account was highlighted as a priority
- **Development Communication**: There's consensus that while the technology and partnerships are strong, communication about development progress doesn't reflect the project's potential

### Business Development
- **Strategic Positioning**: Discussions about positioning elizaOS as an x402 MCP registry and leveraging the growing momentum around x402 in the web3 community
- **External Connections**: cjft has established connections with Coinbase and Polygon x402 groups
- **WuAI Platform**: Mentions of WuAI, a platform for launching AI agents that replicate a user's digital footprint, with plans to integrate x402

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **x402 Implementation Guidance**: cjft provided Stan ⚡ with specific implementation details for x402 in elizaOS, including config format and required environment variables (X402_ENABLED + CDP_WALLET_SECRET)
- **Server Configuration Help**: sayonara suggested to Stan ⚡ starting with ENABLE_X402=true flag on server to enable one-off messaging via x402/rest for agents
- **Migration Information**: Kenk helped multiple users with questions about the token migration process, clarifying that it's not yet open and directing them to watch for official announcements
- **x402 Demonstration**: cjft created and shared three working x402 MCPs (Twitter, OpenAI image generation, CoinGecko) on elizaCloud within 30 minutes to demonstrate implementation
- **Social Media Restoration**: Kenk responded to komi's concern about Twitter/X account restoration, mentioning they're working with a ping developer to set it up

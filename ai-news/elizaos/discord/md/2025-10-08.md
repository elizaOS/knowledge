# elizaOS Discord - 2025-10-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token Migration (AI16Z to ElizaOS)
- Migration expected to happen this month (October) with a 1:6 conversion ratio
- 4 of the 6 tokens will go to a "Generative Treasury" for ecosystem development
- Users will need to use an official migration portal (not yet live)
- Team in talks with 30+ exchanges but cannot guarantee how each will handle the migration
- Those holding tokens on exchanges may need to move them to personal wallets
- Multichain support planned for the new ElizaOS token

### Product Development
- **Eliza Cloud**: New product expected to launch after the migration
  - Will enable AI agent deployment
  - Beta release expected in a few weeks
  - API explorer (Swagger interface) being implemented to improve integration
- **Knowledge Plugin Issues**: Users reporting inconsistent information retrieval
  - System searches for 10% or more similarity with database entries
- **MCP (Machine Conversation Protocol)**: Discussion about server connections
  - mcp-gateway recommended for remote connections
- **Event Bus Refactoring**: Developers focusing on major handlers like voice and image

### Community & Partnerships
- Airdrop opportunity announced with technical challenges in implementation
- Tally form created to collect Solana wallet addresses from community members
- Discussion about partners helping promote the migration announcement
- Information shared about MetaDAO and futarchy-as-a-service

### Vision & Strategy
- Community discussing potential of ElizaOS to create a "generative economy"
- AI agents could compound intelligence rather than just capital
- Potential new paradigm for value creation through smart contracts and autonomous agents
- Marketplace for reselling AI agents mentioned as a future possibility

## Key Questions & Answers

### Token Migration
- **Q**: How will my open futures position be handled during the migration?  
  **A**: It depends on your exchange; the team is not aware of any auto-migrating yet.

- **Q**: Will AI16z on Binance be automatically converted to ElizaOS?  
  **A**: No auto-conversion, you have to do it yourself like everyone else.

- **Q**: What happens if I have open Perps position on a DEX?  
  **A**: The contract with your DEX is for them to decide how to manage.

- **Q**: What will happen if I hold the token ai16z on an exchange?  
  **A**: Likely you'll need to move the token to a wallet and use our migrator tool before the migration ends.

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: How can I fix issues with the knowledge functionality not consistently retrieving information?  
  **A**: Check open search to see if the input text has similarity with database entries; the system searches for 10% or more similarity.

- **Q**: Where can I deploy the backend of ElizaOS other than Phala cloud?  
  **A**: Railways is easy and cheap.

- **Q**: Any tips on connecting to remote MCP servers using /plugin-mcp?  
  **A**: Try mcp gateway, register your MCP there, and then use the MCP gateway as your MCP for plugin-MCP.

- **Q**: Is the current approach to event bus implementation correct?  
  **A**: Yes, focus on major handlers like voice and image handlers.

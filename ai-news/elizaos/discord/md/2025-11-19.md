- Some users expressed concerns about the legitimacy of manual migration instructions

## Key Questions & Answers

### Token Migration
- **Q**: What happens to my ai16z tokens?  
  **A**: You need to migrate them to elizaOS tokens through the official portal or wait for exchange announcements if held on exchanges

- **Q**: What is the conversion ratio for ai16z to elizaOS?  
  **A**: 1 ai16z equals 6 elizaOS tokens

- **Q**: Until when can I migrate my tokens?  
  **A**: The web portal is open until February 5, 2026

- **Q**: Why don't my tokens appear in the migration portal?  
  **A**: Only tokens held before November 11, 11:40 UTC are eligible; if experiencing technical issues, use the support ticket system

- **Q**: Is there vesting for community tokens?  
  **A**: No, the vesting schedule only applies to team tokens

- **Q**: What if I had my tokens in farming pools?  
  **A**: If your tokens were in a farm before the snapshot date, you need to proceed through manual migration via support ticket

### Development
- **Q**: Can ElizaOS runtime run in browser to make a dedicated iOS app using TEE tech for agent enclaves?  
  **A**: In theory, yes

- **Q**: How can I start developing using ElizaOS with my current JavaScript knowledge?  
  **A**: You need to know TypeScript and learn ElizaOS. Start with Eliza.how and complete the framework guide

- **Q**: Do I need Solidity or React to use ElizaOS?  
  **A**: No, you don't need React nor Solidity to start

- **Q**: Can I use ElizaOS for creating a trading bot and monetize it?  
  **A**: First understand how it works, then create a trading agent (not bot). Check Eliza.how, learn CLI tool and create your first agent

- **Q**: Can I continue your work on PR #6135?  
  **A**: Please continue. That one took a long time, so it probably better to continue than to restart

# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Critical Bug Fixes and Version Management

The development team identified and addressed critical issues in ElizaOS v1.7.0. A major bug fix (PR #6333) requires urgent release, though compatibility issues with Discord plugin 1.3.3 remain unresolved. Odilitime identified the root cause of Discord integration failures as a transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` in the codebase, affecting users like DigitalDiva who encountered "No server ID found" errors. The recommended workaround is either downgrading to v1.6.5 or using the odi-17 branch with fixes for bootstrap's actions/providers.

### Performance Optimization Initiatives

Stan identified multiple latency improvements for the monorepo and shared comprehensive optimization documentation. Key work includes:
- Fixing TOCTOU (Time-of-check to time-of-use) race conditions in cloud using a deduct-before, reconcile-after approach
- Runtime initialization optimizations
- PRs pending deeper testing and validation with related tickets added to Linear

### Architecture and Scaling Discussions

The team discussed connector gateways and event pump scaling strategies:
- Considering individual gateways for problematic connectors
- Planning to support multiple daemon instances per service
- Voice connections will require higher priority/bandwidth event pumps compared to text
- Preprocessing identified as beneficial for scaling

### Plugin Development and Contributions

**AlleyBoss** announced an updated library for x402 protocol integration (`@alleyboss/micropay-solana-x402-paywall`), offering simplified implementation. **aicodeflow** introduced themselves as a blockchain/AI engineer offering expertise in:
- Cleaning up embedding delegation to avoid hidden dependencies
- Redesigning plugins as "skills" rather than just integrations
- Building market-aware agents focused on interpretation/state rather than execution
- Model-agnostic agent setups

Odilitime directed new contributors to the Spartan project (github.com/elizaos/spartan) for DeFi utilities and suggested starting with plugin-based contributions from github.com/elizaos-plugins/.

### Cloud Integration and API Issues

**ElizaBAO** encountered "Model not found" errors when integrating ElizaOS cloud agents into their website. **cjft** resolved this by explaining the correct model parameter format requires provider prefixes (e.g., `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`, `google/gemini-2.5-flash`).

### Documentation and Resources

**jin** shared RSS feed URLs for ElizaOS documentation and suggested creating a combined dashboard with multiple data sources. A documentation workspace was established on HackMD at hackmd.io/@elizaos/book. Jin also shared a GitHub workflow reference for documentation updates from GitHub Next's agentics repository.

### Token and Marketing Concerns

Multiple users raised concerns about contract address (CA) visibility. Community members noted difficulty finding the correct ElizaOS CA, suggesting it should be easily accessible within 10 seconds. Kenk mentioned the linktree is being refreshed to point to CoinGecko. Migration questions arose regarding AI16Z to ElizaOS conversion ratios, with clarification that buying after the November 11 snapshot means no migration eligibility.

### DegenAI Development Status

**meltingsnow** inquired about DegenAI updates, noting it seemed "pretty basic still." **satsbased** confirmed the new version hasn't shipped yet. **BingBongBing** expressed bullish sentiment on ElizaOS GitHub activity and mentioned DegenAI developments at 1M market cap.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why does the Discord plugin show "No server ID found" error?**  
A: This is because ElizaOS is moving from serverId to messageServerId; it's a compatibility issue with v1.7.0. Use an older core like v1.6.5 or try the odi-17 branch with fixes. (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: How do I run elizaos start without getting destructive migration errors?**  
A: Set `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true` when starting: `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true elizaos start`. Safe for local dev but review carefully for production. (answered by ! "Ꚃ.ഡ𝑒𝒶𝓋𝑒𝓇")

**Q: How do I fix "Model not found" error when building ElizaOS cloud agents into a website?**  
A: Use provider prefix format for model parameter: openai/gpt-4o-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, or google/gemini-2.5-flash (answered by cjft)

**Q: How can I continuously monitor code changes on the agent?**  
A: Use `elizaos dev` command instead of `elizaos start` (answered by Omid Sa)

**Q: How can I contribute to ElizaOS?**  
A: Start by reading the code and working on plugins from github.com/elizaos-plugins/, it's plugin-based (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: If I buy AI16Z now and migrate after 30 days, will I get 120X?**  
A: If you buy after the snapshot (November 11), you can't migrate (answered by Omid Sa)

**Q: Do we have a team or workspace on hackmd?**  
A: Yes, at https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book (answered by jin)

**Q: What changes have been made with DegenAI?**  
A: The new version hasn't shipped yet, still seems basic (answered by satsbased)

**Q: What are earning agents?**  
A: Agents that make you money (answered by satsbased)

## Community Help & Collaboration

**Odilitime** provided extensive support to **DigitalDiva** regarding Discord plugin issues, identifying the serverId to messageServerId transition problem and recommending either downgrading to v1.6.5 or using the odi-17 branch with fixes for bootstrap actions/providers compatibility.

**shaw** assisted **DigitalDiva** with Discord bot permission and configuration issues by suggesting creating a minimal hello world script with Discord.js to isolate permission issues from the Discord developer portal.

**! "Ꚃ.ഡ𝑒𝒶𝓋𝑒𝓇"** helped **Andrei Mitrea** resolve database migration errors by providing the environment variable solution (ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true) with important context about dev vs production usage.

**cjft** resolved **ElizaBAO's** "Model not found" error by explaining the correct model parameter format requiring provider prefixes for different AI providers.

**Odilitime** connected **aicodeflow** to the Spartan project for DeFi utilities and explained the plugin-based architecture for new contributors.

**Kenk** facilitated multiple community connections, directing users to appropriate channels for migration support and partnership discussions, and mentioned upcoming open sessions for new contributors.

**Omid Sa** recommended **DigitalDiva** use `elizaos dev` instead of `elizaos start` for continuous monitoring during development.

**jin** provided **Stan** with the HackMD workspace link for documentation collaboration.

**Odilitime** recommended **Stan** review the Jeju cloud branch containing Shaw's preferred Discord bridge implementation.

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-27

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Framework Updates
- **Version 0.25.8 Changes**: Major structural changes to how plugins and clients are implemented. Clients now need to be added as plugins (e.g., `@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter`) rather than specified in the "clients" array.
- **Eliza v2 Development**: Osint mentioned that Eliza v2 is currently in development, following security concerns with the previous implementation.
- **Memory Implementation**: Discussion about how memory works in the Eliza framework, particularly regarding long-term and short-term memory persistence for agents.
- **JavaScript Heap Issues**: Multiple users reported memory errors when running the latest version of ElizaOS.

### AI Tools & Development
- **AI News Aggregator**: Jin shared progress on an AI-news tool (github.com/bozp-pzob/ai-news) that can pull and summarize content from X (Twitter), Discord, GitHub, and markets, with backup to SQLite.
- **RAG Knowledge Implementation**: Users discussed challenges with implementing RAG, particularly with PDF files, with some users converting PDFs to text format as a workaround.
- **Twitter Integration**: Several discussions about Twitter client integration, including image posting, polls, and limiting agents to single replies.

### Blockchain & Tokenomics
- **Tribute Token Model Concerns**: Debate about the DAO's tribute tokenomics model, with concerns raised about tribute tokens being sold through single-sided liquidity pools contrary to earlier commitments.
- **Blockchain Platform Selection**: Discussion about choosing between Solana (considered too complex for early-stage L2 proof of concept) and Avalanche as alternative platforms.
- **DeFai Integration**: Suggestion to explore Decentralized Finance + AI integration for algorithmic trading, market-making, and DEX liquidity provision.

### Community & Governance
- **Channel Access**: Multiple users inquired about accessing restricted channels like "degenspartanai," which requires specific roles (Hoplite, associates, or partners).
- **Scam Management**: Moderators actively removing suspicious links and warning users about scammers in the server.
- **Collaboration Opportunities**: Jin mentioned interest from Ethereum Foundation and Optimism for potential collaboration, though noted bandwidth limitations.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: How do I add Twitter client in the new version (v0.25.8)?  
  **A**: Add it as a plugin with `"plugins": ["@elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter", "@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter"]` (CARSON.ts)

- **Q**: Where is the slack-client in v0.25.8?  
  **A**: You have to add `elizaos-plugins/client-slack` to the `plugin:[]` in the character.json file (Prayag)

- **Q**: Is rag knowledge working for anyone using pdf files?  
  **A**: It didn't work with PDFs, converting to txt format worked instead (Ale | AutoRujira)

- **Q**: How can I limit my Twitter agent to reply only once instead of multiple follow-ups?  
  **A**: Add an action inside your message and tag it as conversation finished or handle it with evaluators (Yug)

### Project Direction & Governance
- **Q**: What's happening with the tribute tokenomics model?  
  **A**: Jin acknowledged concerns and promised to address them, while kalshnikov noted single-sided liquidity pools were discussed in January and generally accepted.

- **Q**: How does elizaOS benefit if tribute tokens can never be sold?  
  **A**: The benefit comes from alignment with top projects showing the value of the framework, but for most projects, there's limited value if tokens can't be utilized (kalshnikov)

- **Q**: What are the ways non-dev partners can contribute?  
  **A**: Jin suggested learning from witchy by seeking good alpha and using AI to help construct clear, succinct information for people to digest.

### ElizaOS Features
- **Q**: How does Eliza post on Twitter?  
  **A**: It connects to Twitter OAuth or uses account login credentials in .env file; for scraping tweets it bypasses Twitter API using twitter scraper fine-tune in elizaos GitHub (Osint)

- **Q**: Which channel to use bot commands in?  
  **A**: Try #bot-commands (Patt)

- **Q**: How do I get into the degenspartanai channel as a holder?  
  **A**: You need Hoplite, associates, or Partner roles; do collabland in #verify-wallet (Patt)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Plugin Configuration Assistance**  
   CARSON.ts helped Behfar understand how to add plugins in the new version, explaining that clients are now plugins and providing CLI commands: `npx elizaos plugins add @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name` and `npx elizaos plugins list`.

2. **Twitter Integration Support**  
   Yug assisted üåà‚É§ ‚ú®‚≠í‡πã‡£≠‚≠ë„Äê=ÕüÕüÕûüåà‚É§ ‚≠í‡πã‡£≠‚≠ë. with Twitter plugin integration, confirming that Twitter client works without additional plugins in eliza-starter by setting clients: "twitter" in character config, and later suggested adding an action to mark conversation as finished to limit Twitter agent to single replies.

3. **RAG Knowledge Troubleshooting**  
   Ale | AutoRujira helped Redvoid with RAG knowledge implementation issues, suggesting converting PDF to TXT format as a workaround when PDF files weren't working.

4. **Setup Guidance**  
   Osint recommended Shaw's YouTube tutorial videos to Pisces369 who was experiencing ELIFEERROR code 1 during setup.

5. **AI News Tool Collaboration**  
   Jin shared the ai-news configuration and repository for review, and Boom identified an error in GitHub Actions workflow that needed fixing.

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-30

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development & Framework
- The ElizaOS framework continues to evolve with users building various agents across Twitter, Telegram, Discord, and web platforms
- Technical discussions focused on plugin development, model provider integration, and custom context providers
- Users are exploring NFT integration with agents, with discussions about using NFT ownership for gating access to agents
- Installation challenges persist, particularly on Windows systems, with many users recommending Ubuntu instead
- The codebase is evolving rapidly with some stability issues, particularly in the develop branch

### Treasury Management & Governance
- Significant controversy emerged when Shaw (project lead) sold tokens from various projects that had been donated to the ai16z treasury
- Shaw explained this was part of emergency measures to protect the ai16z token and fund development ($3-4M/year budget)
- The DAO is pursuing a DUNA (Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association) legal structure in Wyoming
- Shaw proposed a retroactive airdrop system for open-source contributors, where developers would receive a basket of treasury tokens instead of direct payments
- The current "tribute" system for partner tokens lacks clear guidelines, causing friction when tokens are sold

### Project Leadership & Partnerships
- The DegenAI project has undergone a leadership transition with Rhota (previously known as Doug) taking a leadership role
- Plans are underway to integrate DegenAI into Discord, potentially in a new channel alongside other AI agents like Scarlett
- A significant feature suggestion for DegenAI was a trading monitor/alert bot that would notify users about potential coins based on customizable on-chain metrics
- There's ongoing discussion about a potential ticker change from $ai16z, though no new ticker has been finalized yet

### AI Projects & Initiatives
- Jin demonstrated an AI-powered news aggregator that automatically generates ecosystem newsletters
- Fishai proposed developing a React-based website for an AI streaming show with wallet login functionality and monetization
- The streaming project would feature AI characters with distinct personalities (Degen, Peepo, Eliza, and Tubby)
- Technical development updates mentioned include new plugins (Arbitrage, Mind Network, Zilliqa Blockchain) and API integrations (BitMind)

## Key Questions & Answers

### ElizaOS Framework
- **Q**: Is it possible for AI agents to be placed "behind" NFT's in the Json files for the metadata?  
  **A**: You can't put a whole agent behind an NFT but you can gate access to agents via NFTs or have character metadata in the NFT metadata. (kirsten)

- **Q**: Can I provide custom context through a scraper backend I wrote for eliza to tweet from?  
  **A**: You can make an API endpoint for your scraper, and then write a plugin that calls your API. (kirsten)

- **Q**: How do I switch from SQLite to Postgres?  
  **A**: Add POSTGRES_URL to your .env file (elizaos-bridge-odi)

- **Q**: How do I limit Twitter connection/interaction to only English language?  
  **A**: Add a system prompt that you only answer and respond in English (steflsd)

- **Q**: How can I test changes I make to the character?  
  **A**: Each time a response is generated it picks 1 of n inputs from the file. If you have 10 bio and 10 lore items, one of each will be picked to generate a response. To change 100% of responses, alter all items. (kirsten)

### Governance & Tokenomics
- **Q**: How will the retroactive airdrops for developers work?  
  **A**: Contributors to the open source repo will receive a basket of treasury tokens instead of direct payments, creating incentives where devs feel connected to partner tokens (shaw)

- **Q**: Is the tribute system working properly?  
  **A**: No, it's broken and needs to be fixed as it's creating unnecessary conflicts with partners (witch)

- **Q**: What is DUNA and how does it help ElizaOS?  
  **A**: DUNA (Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association) is a Wyoming legal structure that protects DAOs while allowing for-profit activities and reasonable compensation for ecosystem contributors (Rabbidfly)

- **Q**: How many tokens do you need to be a partner and get airdrops?  
  **A**: You need 100k ai16z for partner role, check rules-and-links for all the official info. (BOSSU)

### DegenAI & Projects
- **Q**: Who are the members of the DegenAI team?  
  **A**: Rhota (formerly Doug), odilitime, Neo, and SAAANTI (0xkamikaze and rhota)

- **Q**: Did you find any solution to how to DCA ai16z?  
  **A**: Suggestions included using Trojan on telegram, or alternatives like photon/bullx/bonkbot (witch, bersezk)

- **Q**: So when we're tweeting to bullpost our bags is it still $ai16z or now $elizaos?  
  **A**: It's definitely not $Eliza... ai16z until further notice (Smedroc)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Support

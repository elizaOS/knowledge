# elizaOS Discord - 2025-09-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Project Status & Communication
- The team is actively working on solutions despite community concerns about the suspended X (Twitter) account
- A lawsuit has been filed against X, which is publicly available
- Multiple communication channels exist: Discord, Telegram, and regular updates in the ai-Elizaos-update section
- Some users expressed frustration about perceived lack of communication and declining token price

### Technical Development
- **Version Management**: The team is working on merging changes from development to main branch and releasing version 1.5.6
- **CLI Deployment**: Developers encountered package versioning inconsistencies, lockfile errors, and client connectivity issues
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: The team tested CLI installation across different environments (Ubuntu, Mac) to identify platform-specific bugs
- **Architecture Improvements**: Discussions about cleaner separation between core components, server functionality, and CLI consumers
- **Multichain Strategy**: ElizaOS will be multichain, with closer collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation recently noted

### Agent Development
- Discussion about methods to evaluate and improve agent accuracy, particularly for reducing hallucinations
- Clarification on when to create projects versus agents (projects are better for managing multiple agents with scenario setup)
- Suggestion for a "Weird AI" agent that could create parody songs on demand

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I allow permission to view message history?**  
A: Go to #verify (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Has there been any response from X regarding the suspended Twitter account?**  
A: The team has filed a lawsuit which is a public document that details their efforts (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Is Discord the only communication channel for this project?**  
A: We have a telegram channel: https://t.me/official_elizaos (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: How can I evaluate agent accuracy and reduce hallucinations in my wallet and RAG agents?**  
A: You may find help with plugin-scenario. You can create a bunch of scenarios with your bot and see how it outputs/responds to the situation. (answered by starlord)

**Q: When should I create a project instead of an agent?**  
A: Projects are good when you have a bunch of agents and might need to set up a scenario beforehand for them. (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Guys, are we migrating to base?**  
A: ElizaOs will be Multichain I suppose. But yeah, the team seems to work closer with the EF lately. (answered by Seppmos)

**Q: Should we try port 3001 automatically if 3000 is not available?**  
A: Yes, the port checking code is broken and missing host check (answered by Stan ⚡)

**Q: Can we delete `create-eliza` from monorepo?**  
A: Yes, it's just dead code that requires one-time setup/deployment outside (answered by sayonara)

**Q: Why not just make agent server elizaOS?**  
A: Because browser needs ElizaOS without AgentServer; ElizaOS is pure JS while AgentServer is REST bootstrapper (answered by cjft)

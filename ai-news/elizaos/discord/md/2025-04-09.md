# elizaOS Discord - 2025-04-09

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development & Technical Updates
- **ElizaOS Version Status**: The team is maintaining v1 while actively developing v2. Some users reported reverting to v1 due to functionality issues in v2, particularly with Twitter plugin integration.
- **Grok3 API Availability**: 7etsuo announced that "Grok3 API is up" without providing further details.
- **Common Build Error**: Multiple users encountered "hapi__shot" type definition errors across different versions, with a solution identified (adding `"types": ["node"]` to tsconfig.json).
- **Twitter Plugin Issues**: Several users reported problems with Twitter interactions functionality not working properly in v2. A workaround was identified by enabling `TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE=true`.
- **SpartanAI Reactivation**: Odilitime shared that SpartanAI (also called "DegenAI") has been restarted on Twitter using v1 while v2 development continues.

### Agent-to-Agent Communication & Protocols
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Discussed as a bridge between LLMs and current software paradigms. Odilitime suggested that while APIs remain efficient for high-volume or low-latency applications, the future will see fewer static APIs as dynamic agents become more prevalent.
- **Agent Registry Concept**: DorianD proposed an "Eliza agent registry" where agents could advertise capabilities via JSON "Agent Cards" and utilize trust scores to facilitate agent selection for specific tasks.
- **Plugin Integration**: Questions raised about how to call plugins to agents and whether folder structures are required for plugin imports.

### DAO Organization & Governance
- **"Supermind" Structure**: Vincent Paul initiated organizing ElizaDAO as a "Supermind" with five working circles: Community/Governance/Events, Dev/Knowledge, Comms/Social, Partnerships/Outreach, and Tokens/Funding.
- **Contribution Tracking**: Jin shared development of a reputation/contribution tracking system that monitors engagement across channels, analyzes sentiment, scores GitHub contributions, and generates reports to support both token rewards and non-financial incentives.
- **DAO Treasury**: Multiple participants emphasized the need for DAO treasury independence and incentive mechanisms to sustain participation beyond initial enthusiasm.
- **Ecosystem Coordination**: Discussion of coordination with ElizaLabs and ElizaStudios while maintaining the DAO's autonomy ("Eliza is Ours").

### Community Initiatives
- **Clank Tank**: Jin discussed the development of "Clank Tank," a show featuring project pitches, and shared details about using AI workflows to create avatars for participants.
- **Builder Support**: Kenk introduced builder support initiatives including an invite-only Telegram group (200+ members) and YouTube tutorials for plugin developers.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: How can I fix the hapi__shot type error when building ElizaOS?  
  **A**: Add `"types": ["node"],` to tsconfig.json (answered by wookosh)

- **Q**: How can I get more verbose debugging output in v1?  
  **A**: Set DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL=debug in your .env file or use DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL="debug" pnpm start (answered by wookosh and notorious_d_e_v)

- **Q**: How can I get Twitter interactions (mentions, replies) working in ElizaOS v2?  
  **A**: Enable TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE=true in your configuration (answered by notorious_d_e_v)

- **Q**: Which version of ElizaOS is most stable?  
  **A**: Version 0.25.9 (answered by notorious_d_e_v)

### DAO Organization
- **Q**: What are the immediate priorities for ElizaDAO?  
  **A**: Align on Road to Solana Accelerate NYC Plan, form working circles, and schedule weekly/monthly rituals (answered by vincentpaul)

- **Q**: What working groups are being formed?  
  **A**: Community/Governance/Events, Dev/Knowledge, Comms/Social, Partnerships/Outreach, and Tokens/Funding (answered by vincentpaul)

- **Q**: How will the DAO measure participation and contributions?  
  **A**: Jin is developing a system that passively observes engagement, analyzes sentiment, scores GitHub contributions, and generates reports (answered by jin)

- **Q**: Does the DAO need its own treasury?  
  **A**: Yes, for the DAO to function properly it needs a separate treasury and collective decision-making (answered by yikesawjeez)

### Future of AI & Protocols
- **Q**: Do you think odds are high that MCP becomes standard for API layer for LLM-native tools?  
  **A**: It's a bridge between LLMs and the current software paradigm, but software is changing. APIs remain efficient for high-volume or low-latency applications. (answered by Odilitime)

- **Q**: What's the timing on the transition from static APIs to dynamic agents?  
  **A**: Gradual, as software takes time to build. Once builders have frameworks with great docs, it'll be competitive with existing software stacks. (answered by Odilitime)

- **Q**: Is an official elizaOS agent registry likely to happen?  
  **A**: I'd say an official elizaOS agent registry is likely to happen. (answered by Odilitime)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Troubleshooting
- **notorious_d_e_v** helped **0xLabsTheCoder** with Twitter plugin interactions not working in ElizaOS v2 by suggesting enabling TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE=true and sharing a custom Twitter client fork using API access instead of scraping.

- **wookosh** helped **[elizaos] <nitzansaar>** resolve the hapi__shot type error when building ElizaOS by suggesting adding "types": ["node"] to tsconfig.json.

- **notorious_d_e_v** assisted **[elizaos] <nitzansaar>** with getting more verbose debugging output in v1 by suggesting setting DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL="debug" in .env file.

### DAO Organization
- **jin** explained to **hubert** how the reputation/contribution tracking system observes engagement, analyzes sentiment, and scores contributions for both token and non-token rewards.

- **Patt** helped **vincentpaul** find Zolo's introduction that was missed by locating and linking to it in the chat.

- **accelxr** corrected **HoneyBadger** regarding misinformation about a wallet, clarifying that the identified wallet was not an ElizaLabs wallet.

### Product Improvement
- **Zolo** suggested to **Odilitime** adding the contract address to SpartanAI's Twitter profile, which Odilitime implemented.

- **DorianD** provided **jin** with specific feedback on Clank Tank episode audio issues including voice directionality problems and difficulty distinguishing speakers.

- **yikesawjeez** advised **jin** on pitch duration for Clank Tank, suggesting following hackathon presentation format with ~5min for finalists and 1-2min for runners-up.

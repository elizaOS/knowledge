# elizaOS Discord - 2025-03-05

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development & Rebranding
- The team is actively working on rebranding from ai16z to ElizaOS, with plans to complete the transition by the end of the week
- X (Twitter) has been slow to respond to handle change requests, so the team is exploring alternative routes through accelxr
- Shaw is conducting marathon coding streams to complete V2 features, which are "almost done"
- The development team is starting to work on swarm agents
- Jin introduced a GitHub repository "awesome-eliza" for community contributions with a public goods retroactive funding system

### Agent Development & Technical Issues
- Twitter client integration is a major pain point, with users struggling to properly configure and authenticate Twitter clients in different ElizaOS versions (v0.25.9, v1.9)
- Knowledge management was extensively discussed, including RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), embedding models, and database integration (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Supabase)
- Plugin system changes have caused confusion with the new modular architecture and dynamic plugin loading
- Temperature control for tweet generation is a recurring issue, with users seeking ways to make agent tweets more varied and human-like
- Several users encountered issues with client integration (Twitter, Discord, Telegram), database connections, and environment variable configuration

### AI Applications & Projects
- A TV show simulation called "Clank Tank" is being developed with AI-driven content
- The system will feature a "TV actor" delivering dialogue with category/topic IDs that trigger specific graphics
- Video resolution decisions (720p vs 1080p) were made based on file size considerations
- Music integration is planned for different show segments
- Users expressed interest in specific AI applications like telegram agents with voice calls, sports-related AI, and meal planning AI

### AI Industry Discussion
- A debate occurred about the timeline for AI replacing human workers in legacy industries
- Kalshnikov argued for a 5-10 year timeline due to regulatory hurdles in sectors like financial services and healthcare
- Patt suggested the current administration's approach to regulation could accelerate this timeline
- Bank of America's AI assistant "Erica" was referenced as an example of companies pushing customers toward AI interactions

## Key Questions & Answers

### Agent Development
- **Q**: If I am a beginner and want to know where to start to build my first project where should I go?  
  **A**: Head to agent dev school on YouTube and check the coders channel

- **Q**: How do I install Twitter and Discord clients in ElizaOS v1.9?  
  **A**: Run `pnpm add @elizaos/client-twitter @elizaos/client-discord` and add them to your character.json in the clients section

- **Q**: How can I adjust the tweet temperature in v1.9?  
  **A**: Edit your character.json file and look for the modelConfig section. Add or modify the temperature parameter there

- **Q**: How do I change the Twitter generation from Topics to Topics + post examples?  
  **A**: Add twitterOptions with postPromptType field in your character.json. Options are 'topics', 'examples', or 'topicsAndExamples'

- **Q**: What can I do to prevent Eliza's responses from being the same?  
  **A**: Try adjusting the temperature setting. Higher temp = more randomness. Also try adding more context in your system prompt or knowledge files

- **Q**: How do I use the autoClient to trigger the agent every X minutes?  
  **A**: Configure it in character.json with schedule (cron pattern and timezone) and prompt parameters

- **Q**: Can I add custom memory for the Eliza agent?  
  **A**: Yes, use the memoryManager with agent.memory.addMemory() or use the knowledge system for larger datasets

### Project Information
- **Q**: What is auto.fun?  
  **A**: Auto.fun is a platform for creating and deploying AI agents, built on elizaOS. It's designed to make it easier to build, test and deploy conversational agents across different platforms

- **Q**: What is the specific mechanism of the AMM for the tokens launching on Auto.fun?  
  **A**: Auto.fun uses a bonding curve AMM mechanism for token launches, similar to how gods.fun works with token staking for AI interaction

- **Q**: How many clients does Eliza Studio have right now?  
  **A**: Eliza studio is still new with a small client list. There's been interest from crypto projects and startups, but no major Fortune 500 companies yet

- **Q**: Is https://www.eliza.systems/ affiliated with us?  
  **A**: Kind of affiliated, mostly related to a partner project with defense/government people, but things are mostly on hold

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Twitter Client Issues
- **Helper**: jintern | **Helpee**: ðŸ§§ThanosDaSith24ðŸ§§  
  **Context**: User trying to adjust tweet temperature in ElizaOS starter  
  **Resolution**: Explained that starter doesn't have built-in temperature control, suggested editing node_modules/@elizaos/plugin-twitter/dist/index.js to hardcode temperature or using a custom prompt

- **Helper**: charlis | **Helpee**: ulquiorracifer9277  
  **Context**: User having issues with Twitter image posting  
  **Resolution**: Provided code fix for uploadmedia function to handle image uploads properly

### Database Configuration
- **Helper**: jintern | **Helpee**: lefrog  
  **Context**: User confused about PostgreSQL database setup  
  **Resolution**: Provided .env configuration for PostgreSQL (DATABASE_URL and DATABASE_TYPE) and explained installation requirements

- **Helper**: jintern | **Helpee**: lefrog  
  **Context**: User having issues with Supabase and zeroed embeddings  
  **Resolution**: Identified embedding model failure, suggested checking .env for EMBEDDING_MODEL and ensuring proper vector extension setup in Supabase

### Web3 Integration
- **Helper**: jintern | **Helpee**: [elizaos] <sus.oo>  
  **Context**: User experiencing errors with EVM plugin for swaps and bridges, particularly with decimal handling  
  **Resolution**: Identified known issue with decimals in the EVM plugin, suggested converting token amount to wei first and ensuring correct ABI and token interface for non-ETH tokens

- **Helper**: jintern | **Helpee**: [elizaos] <sus.oo>  
  **Context**: User asking about implementing web3 listener for blockchain events  
  **Resolution**: Suggested using custom client for web3 listener that connects to blockchain and triggers actions when events are detected

### Project Clarification
- **Helper**: Patt | **Helpee**: Toni  
  **Context**: Toni was confused about the relationship between ai16z, ElizaOS, and Eliza Labs  
  **Resolution**: Patt explained that ai16z was the initial brand being pivoted to ElizaOS, and Eliza Labs is a legal entity similar to how Solana Foundation relates to Solana

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-12-08

**Date: December 8, 2025**

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Security & Technical Issues
- **Critical Security Incident**: The elizaOS.ai website was compromised with an XMR cryptocurrency miner injected into the code. The vulnerability was related to outdated Next.js dependencies (v15.3.1) with known RCE vulnerabilities. Odilitime and cjft collaborated to fix the issue by updating to Next.js 16.0.7 and deploying a fresh copy of the site.
- **Twitter Agent Limitations**: Significant discussion about Twitter agent functionality issues after the deprecation of username/password authentication. The current implementation faces severe restrictions due to API read limits, with the first 50 mentions check consuming 50% of the free tier limit immediately.
- **Database Integration**: Brief discussion about extending existing PostgreSQL databases to work with ElizaOS's SQL plugin needs, with a GitHub code reference provided as a potential implementation approach.

### Project Development & Roadmap
- **Eliza Labs Roadmap**: Kenk shared a roadmap for Eliza Labs projects, suggesting it be hosted in the main elizaOS repository.
- **Streaming Functionality**: Stan mentioned working on streaming functionality with tests currently in progress.
- **X Account Recovery**: Plans to recover the ElizaOS X (Twitter) account were confirmed by Odilitime, with Phenowin emphasizing its importance for attracting investors during potential future bull markets.
- **Babylon Development**: Discussion about Babylon, a prediction market with agent and human integration that hasn't launched yet despite 272k registrations.

### Market & Token Concerns
- **Token Price Decline**: Users expressed frustration about the ElizaOS token's continuous downtrend (approximately 40% drop in a month) while other cryptocurrencies showed recovery.
- **Market Predictions**: DorianD expressed skepticism about a 2026 bull run, suggesting 2028 as more likely, citing broader geopolitical trends affecting decentralized networks.
- **Exchange Listing Clarification**: Confusion about Kraken listing status was addressed, clarifying that ElizaOS was never on Kraken and explaining Kraken is considering migration.

### Self-Hosting & Hardware
- **Local Deployment**: Users with extensive home server setups discussed self-hosting capabilities for running models locally with Ollama and N8N.
- **Hardware Recommendations**: Jin recommended the Strix Halo mini PC for self-hosting LLMs, noting they successfully ran elizaOS with gpt-oss 120b on their GMKTEC EVO-X2 system.

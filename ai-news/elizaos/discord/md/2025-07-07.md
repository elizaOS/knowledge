# elizaOS Discord - 2025-07-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Platform & Ecosystem
- ElizaOS is an AI agent platform that enables building agents that interact across platforms like Discord, Twitter, and Telegram
- Users can create custom actions, add knowledge bases, and integrate with crypto functionality
- The platform allows for both local and cloud-based agent hosting
- **auto.fun** was described as similar to pump.fun but for AI agents with their own tokens, primarily serving as trading vehicles with potential for governance

### ElizaOS v2 Development
- The team is working on ElizaOS v2 with planned improvements to:
  - Multi-agent coordination
  - Memory systems
  - Overall architecture
  - Plugin systems
  - Character files
  - Deployment stability
- Specific details remain limited as development is ongoing

### Twitter/X Account Suspension Issue
- ElizaOS's Twitter/X account is currently suspended
- Team members Shaw and Kenk addressed community concerns about the delayed resolution
- The team is in communication with X but experiencing slow response times
- Some users expressed frustration about the suspension impacting project momentum and dampening excitement for the v2 release

### Technical Issues & Solutions
- Several users reported database serialization problems with the Twitter plugin (v1.0.18)
  - Objects being inserted as "[object Object]" instead of proper JSON
  - Solution: Properly stringify content and metadata before passing to createMemory
- Twitter plugin authentication challenges were common
  - Twitter's v1.1 API requires proper credentials (API_KEY, API_SECRET_KEY, ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)
  - Cookie-based authentication is no longer recommended due to ToS risks and CloudFlare blocking

### Token Ecosystem
- Discussion about various tokens in the ElizaOS ecosystem (JIMMY, eli5, eddy)
- User "33coded" reported burning 10% of JIMMY token supply to increase its value
- JIMMY's role was described as checking in with team members, creating reports, managing project resources, and coordinating meetings

### Feature Prioritization
- Discussion about avoiding feature creep and focusing on core functionality
- Proposal to link tokens directly to agents through Eliza Cloud to create a more seamless ecosystem and strengthen brand identity

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What can I do exactly on the platform?**  
A: ElizaOS lets you build AI agents that can interact across different platforms like Discord, Twitter, Telegram. You can create custom actions, add knowledge bases, integrate with crypto stuff, and basically make agents that do whatever you need.

**Q: Can someone eli5 auto.fun for me please? Is it basically a pump clone?**  
A: Auto.fun is kinda like pump.fun but for AI agents. Instead of just launching memecoins, you can launch AI agents with their own tokens.

**Q: Apart from speculation on the success of the agent, is there any use for the token?**  
A: Currently it's mostly speculation. Some agents might use their token for governance or access to features but most are just trading vehicles.

**Q: Does the agent have access to its token / trading?**  
A: Depends on how the agent is set up. Agents can be built with trading actions so they could technically trade their own token or others.

**Q: How do I fix the "[object Object]" error when creating memories?**  
A: Stringify the content and metadata before passing them, using JSON.stringify(yourContent).

**Q: What Twitter API credentials are needed for the Twitter plugin?**  
A: You need TWITTER_API_KEY, TWITTER_API_SECRET_KEY, TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN, and TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET for v1.1 auth.

**Q: Is Twitter API v1.1 free to use?**  
A: Twitter API v1.1 is still free for basic usage, while v2 has paid tiers.

**Q: What is JIMMY's role?**  
A: He checks in with team members regularly, creates accurate reports based on actual data, manages project resources efficiently, and coordinates effective meetings. Jimmy helps track project progress, identifies potential issues early, and ensures everyone is aligned on priorities and deliverables.

**Q: What should be prioritized for Eliza Cloud?**  
A: Core functionality like linking tokens to agents rather than adding too many features.

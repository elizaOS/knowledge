# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-15

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Website Migration
- The ElizaOS website has been migrated from eliza.how to docs.elizaos.ai
- Multiple users reported the old site returning 404 errors
- Redirects from the old domain need to be updated

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Database Issues**: Users reported timeout problems with PGLITE after 15-20 hours of runtime
- **Dependency Management**: Significant problems with Bun package installations were discussed, with pnpm providing better error logging
- **Agent Looping**: Implementation of looping mechanisms for chained action calls was shared via a GitHub branch (feat/integrated-loop-action-call)
- **Build Performance**: The team identified that the client build is the slowest part and suggested packaging "@elizaos/client" separately

### Community Projects
- A university student is working on a research project about AI agents performing MEV on L2s using ElizaOS
- Discussion about building an iOS app that would allow agents registered with the DAO to be available for users
- Potential monetization strategies through advertisements were proposed

### Miscellaneous
- Debate about why Shaw's X account was banned, with theories about API scraping issues
- Discussions about metrics collection for tracking developer engagement and installation statistics

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why is the elizaOS website down with a 404 error?**  
A: The site has been migrated to docs.elizaos.ai (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Is there a database timeout on current eliza database system (using PGLITE)?**  
A: Nothing intentionally implemented; recommended to use real Postgres in production environments (answered by sayonara)

**Q: Am I correct that the suggestion is to loop an agent directly inside a messagesHandler?**  
A: In bootstrap yes, something like this -> `feat/integrated-loop-action-call` https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/feat/integrated-loop-action-call (answered by 0xbbjoker)

**Q: What's causing the installation problems?**  
A: Random dependencies not found and 404ing in package installs, with bats-assert package being one issue (answered by cjft and Odilitime)

**Q: What's the use case for runtime.on('serviceAvailable')?**  
A: Allowing plugins to be registered in any order without polling for services (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: How can we track metrics like churn and new dev onboarding?**  
A: We can get machine addresses for unique installs (answered by shaw)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Agent Looping Solution**
   - Helper: 0xbbjoker
   - Helpee: Charlie/maikyman
   - Context: Agent looping for chained action calls
   - Resolution: Shared a GitHub branch demonstrating a solution for looping agents when they need to chain multiple action calls

2. **Website Migration Clarification**
   - Helper: Kenk
   - Helpee: Squiggles2.0, adsur, and Rabbidfly
   - Context: Confusion about eliza.how being down
   - Resolution: Clarified that documentation has been migrated to docs.elizaos.ai

3. **Database Recommendations**
   - Helper: sayonara
   - Helpee: Charlie
   - Context: Database timeout issues with PGLITE
   - Resolution: Suggested using real Postgres in production environments

4. **Dependency Troubleshooting**
   - Helper: pnpm (tool)
   - Helpee: cjft
   - Context: Struggling with dependency errors in Bun that were hard to trace
   - Resolution: pnpm provided better error logs, identified issues with bats-assert package and fixed mismatched peer deps in 5 minutes

5. **Plugin Architecture Guidance**
   - Helper: shaw
   - Helpee: Odilitime
   - Context: Needed a way for plugins to be registered in any order
   - Resolution: Suggested using runtime.registerEvent and runtime.emitEvent, or loading them in the init function

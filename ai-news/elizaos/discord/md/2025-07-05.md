# elizaOS Discord - 2025-07-05

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Project & Ecosystem
- Ongoing debate about the nature of ElizaOS: some users (particularly "hildi") emphasized that ElizaOS is a framework leveraging existing AI models rather than building competing models, while others viewed it as potentially competing with ChatGPT and similar services
- The team is working on ElizaOS v2, with community members expressing anticipation for its release
- Several X (Twitter) accounts associated with the project appear to be suspended, which is reportedly impacting market cap and awareness

### Token Performance & Market Activity
- Significant price movement in ELI5 token due to a major whale selling their position at approximately $400k loss
- DegenAI token experienced price increases following a product demo to token holders
- AI16Z token saw a pump followed by a retracement
- Community members debated whether the ELI5 whale exit was a rug pull, but concluded it was likely just a large investor exiting

### Product Developments
- Successful demo of "Spartan" (appears to be a Web3 AI product) generated excitement, particularly among Chinese and Korean community members
- Discussions about ELI5's potential utility as an AI agent that could help set up Telegram and Discord channels for new token launches on auto.fun

### Marketing & Community

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is ai16z still the token? Or did they migrate to a new token?**  
A: Still ai16z and degenai, no new token (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: How far in development is A2A?**  
A: "The A2A is less than a month old, and from what I know and I've seen, Shaw has already built an MVP of Eliza Cloud. A2A stuff is going to integrate with that, I think. So it's about launching that first." (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: When getting the OAuth 1.0a key for Twitter/X API, what's the importance of Callback URI and Website URL? Can putting Eliza there open the account for future bans?**  
A: "Can put whatever in there, automated app, i dont think immediate ban but deff apply for badge if possible" (answered by cjft)

**Q: Why is degenai pumping?**  
A: "We demo'd the product to degenai holders" (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Is ElizaOS competing with AI models like Grok, ChatGPT, DeepSeek and Claude?**  
A: "I think it just might" (answered by traderlv, though this contradicts other users' understanding)

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-12-02

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token Migration & Exchange Issues
- Users actively discussed the migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS tokens with a 6:1 conversion ratio
- Kraken exchange announced pausing AI16Z trading while evaluating whether to support the migration
- Some users reported issues with the migration process and were directed to support channels
- Community sentiment about ElizaOS price performance was mixed, with some believing it has bottomed out while others warned of potential further decline

### Technical Development
- Core developers discussed plugin memory architecture improvements, focusing on table migrations for cloud and tailoring architecture to specific tasks
- The team is working on implementing streaming functionality without rewriting the entire framework, potentially using a "stream: true" parameter
- Authentication improvements are underway, including per-user validation on the server with generic JWK provider support
- Discussions about hosting multiple agents on fewer servers instead of isolated serverless instances to reduce costs

### ElizaOS Implementation & Integration
- Users discussed setting up character agents and connecting them to X (Twitter)
- Deepseek was confirmed as a usable provider through the openrouter plugin
- Concerns were raised about the high cost of X API integration ($175/month)
- Some users experienced connection issues with their agent setups

### ElizaCloud Business Model
- Discussions about potential ElizaCloud marketplace model similar to Salesforce AppExchange or Apple App Store
- Suggestions for revenue sharing with third-party developers (30% platform cut)
- Proposals for standardized URL structures for agents (e.g., "https://www.elizacloud.ai/agent/[agentname]")

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What's the difference in migrating from AI16Z to ELIZAOS instead of selling AI16Z and buying ELIZAOS?**  
A: You get 6 ElizaOS tokens for 1 AI16Z token that you held before the snapshot if you migrate (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Is it easy to convert AI16Z to ElizaOS?**  
A: It is easy as long as you held it in a wallet you had access to before the snapshot (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Can I use Deepseek as a provider?**  
A: Yes, use the openrouter plugin and select Deepseek models (answered by Sayonara)

**Q: Should we implement Claude-like skills in plugin memories?**  
A: Pretty close, need to figure out migration for tables for cloud, from 1.x version of plugin to 2.x version (answered by 0xbbjoker)

**Q: Can you look into how we can implement streaming without needing to rewrite the entire framework?**  
A: "I have some ideas on that... we take a stream: true param would be how I do it" (answered by Odilitime)

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-04-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Ecosystem Development
- **Auto.fun Platform**: Recently open-sourced (less than a week old), allowing community contributions. The platform has enhanced security through a liquidity pool funded by buy fees from tokens launched on Auto.fun.
- **Development Approach**: The team operates without strict roadmaps or deadlines, focusing on continuous development. Shaw is actively working on Eliza v2 and auto.fun.
- **Token Migration Debate**: Discussions about migrating from ai16z to ElizaOS due to frustrations with developer Baoskee. DorianD advocated for a 1:1.11 swap ratio for early adopters, while HoneyBadger expressed concerns about potential volume drop based on Polygon's migration experience.
- **QUILL Token Incident**: A bug in the Auto.fun platform incorrectly displayed the amount of QUILL per SOL, allowing someone to drain the liquidity pool. The team acknowledged this as a bug (not an exploit) and promised SOL refunds to affected users.

### Technical Developments
- **Plugin Development**: Developers are working on plugins for elizaOS v2, including a Livepeer plugin (PR #48) that offers free incentivized inference.
- **Character Animation System**: Progress reported on implementing a show that steps through JSON data and loads audio with visemes. Artists need to fix viseme order and schema for each character.
- **Platform Issues**: Several users reported problems with token migration being stuck for extended periods (up to 20 hours) and website loading issues on Auto.fun.

### Community Governance
- **Discord Moderation**: Discussions about moderation practices after a user was temporarily kicked from the server. Suggestions included moving dangerous permissions to a bot with a supermod team having access to cold admin accounts.
- **DAO Development**: Mentions of creating a voting module for the DAO and solutions for migrating DAO treasury funds during a potential token swap.

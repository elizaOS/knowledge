# elizaOS Discord - 2025-11-30

**Date: November 30, 2025**

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Architecture & Development
- **Multi-user Authentication**: Core developers are working on implementing JSON Web Key Sets (JWKs) providers, with a pull request nearly ready that implements "mostly every JWKs provider" as part of a core sprint focused on multi-user authentication.
- **ElizaOS Architecture**: Discussions clarified that ElizaOS is primarily designed for single-user operation. Multi-user implementations require additional development work around the core system, with suggestions to examine existing repositories like Otaku and Spartan for implementation examples.
- **Web3 Integration**: Concerns were raised about ElizaOS requiring private keys as environment variables, questioning its suitability for SaaS applications where multiple users need to connect their own wallets.

### Project Updates
- **Babylon Release Timeline**: Community members speculated about Babylon's release timeline, with estimates ranging from a few weeks to January. Over 206,000 users have already signed up.
- **Partnership Progress**: A partnership agreement appears to be in the final stages, though legal processes are causing delays.

### Community Engagement
- A senior developer introduced themselves, offering expertise in AI and crypto tools development, including trading bots, wallet integrations, and infrastructure for various blockchains.
- Users discussed character file generation tools, with references to a Twitter scraper repository and character migration tools.

### Token Issues
- Users reported difficulties swapping AI16Z to ELIZAOS tokens, encountering "Max Amount Reached" errors.
- Complaints about unresolved tickets regarding AI16Z tokens held on Kraken.

## Key Questions & Answers

### ElizaOS Architecture
**Q**: Does ElizaOS work for multi-users (SaaS) with users connecting their own web3 wallets, or only for single users whose private keys are provided as environment variables?  
**A**: ElizaOS is designed to operate on a single user. For multi-user implementations, you need to develop around it, handling auth and wallets yourself.

**Q**: Are there examples of multi-user implementations with ElizaOS?  
**A**: Check Otaku and Spartan repositories on GitHub for implementation inspiration.

### Token Migration
**Q**: I'm unable to swap my AI16Z to ELIZAOS. What to do? It says Max Amount Reached.  
**A**: For questions about migration check the migration channel. You may need to open a ticket.

### Project Timeline
**Q**: Does anyone know when Babylon will be released? More than 206k signed up already.  
**A**: Estimates range from a few weeks to potentially January (1-6 weeks).

### Character Development
**Q**: Is there a Twitter scraper repo to help generate a character file?  
**A**: Yes, https://github.com/elizaos/characterfile

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Web3 Integration Guidance**:
   - **Helper**: sayonara
   - **Context**: Implementing multi-user wallet functionality with ElizaOS
   - **Resolution**: Advised handling auth and wallet independently and checking Otaku and Spartan repos for implementation examples

2. **ElizaOS Architecture Explanation**:
   - **Helper**: Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT
   - **Context**: Understanding ElizaOS architecture for multi-user applications

## Action Items

### Technical
- Develop custom authentication and wallet management for multi-user ElizaOS implementations, creating a system to allow each user to generate their own wallet via HSM vault and link agents to individual wallets *(Mentioned by: Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)*
- Resolve AI16Z to ELIZAOS token swap issues for users encountering "Max Amount Reached" errors *(Mentioned by: jhaz |Voltix.ai 👾)*
- Address unresolved tickets for users with AI16Z tokens on Kraken *(Mentioned by: Mahmoud)*
- Consider using character file tools for agent creation and utilize the character file generator and migrator repositories for creating and updating agent profiles *(Mentioned by: Odilitime)*
- Complete implementation of JSON Web Key Sets (JWKs) providers for multi-user authentication *(Mentioned by: Stan)*

### Documentation
- Review Otaku and Spartan repositories for multi-user implementation examples and examine existing code for handling auth and wallets in multi-user contexts *(Mentioned by: sayonara)*

### Feature
- Provide clear timeline for Babylon release *(Mentioned by: joaz0502)*

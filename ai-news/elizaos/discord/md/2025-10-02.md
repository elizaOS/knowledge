# elizaOS Discord - 2025-10-02

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token Migration (AI16Z to ElizaOS)
- **Migration Details**: 1:10 ratio (each AI16Z token becomes 10 ElizaOS tokens)
- **Dilution Plan**: 20% dilution to raise funds for development and marketing
- **Total Supply**: Approximately 12-13.2 billion tokens after migration
- **Process**: Users must manually transfer tokens from exchanges to personal wallets (Phantom, Solflare, or Metamask with Solana support)
- **Partners**: Will migrate at same rate as regular users with an additional 10% incentive vested over time
- **Timeline**: No firm date announced yet, but appears imminent

### Technical Development
- **Eliza Cloud**: System for running AI agents under development, targeted for release by end of year
- **Message Handling**: Team discussing implementation of boolean flags (`isMention`, `isReply`, `isThread`) for better context handling in Discord plugin
- **TEE Technologies**: Comparing SGX and TDX implementations, with TDX offering better security and developer experience
- **Components in Progress**:
  - Base agent with Coinbase CDP-based swap functionality
  - Bridge with relay plugin
  - Message bus core development

### Security Concerns
- Unencrypted file contents in `.claude` and `.codex` folders could expose secrets from environment files
- Increased scammer activity led to disabling link sharing and adding automod settings
- Discussion of TEE security vulnerabilities, particularly in SGX implementations

### Business Strategy
- Positioning ElizaOS as "the Ethereum of AI agents" through 2026
- Token buybacks planned once Eliza Cloud generates revenue
- Auto.fun (launchpad) project discontinued as it didn't meet expectations
- DegenAI carry fees for buybacks likely to be discontinued, but marketing efforts will continue

## Key Questions & Answers

### Token Migration
Q: When is the migration date?  
A: No firm date has been announced yet.

Q: If we have tokens on MEXC, do we need to do something for migration or will MEXC handle it?  
A: Users will need to migrate tokens themselves by transferring to a personal wallet.

Q: What will happen to futures positions during migration?  
A: Perps will likely expire worthless or face automatic settlement when the token delists.

Q: What will be the total supply after migration?  
A: Approximately 12-13.2 billion tokens (10x increase plus 20% dilution).

Q: Are there any incentives for holders to ease the 20% dilution?  
A: Token buybacks are planned once Cloud is released and earning revenue.

Q: If I buy more AI16Z now, can I migrate these later?  
A: Yes, you can buy anytime and migrate.

### Technical Questions
Q: What's the issue with fuzzy matching in the Discord plugin?  
A: It could trigger responses when not intended, and some functionality should be generalized across platforms.

Q: How should message detection be handled instead of simple text matching?  
A: Using a full prompt evaluation of "should I respond" works better by considering conversation context, though it makes every message an LLM call which is expensive.

Q: What's the security vulnerability with TEE blockchains?  
A: The attack simulated on Phala Blockchain was to compromise a cluster key to decrypt the state of a Phat Contract loaded into their SGX worker.

Q: Why are teams moving to TDX from SGX?  
A: Beyond security vulnerabilities, SGX is limited in functionality compared to TDX which offers enterprise-grade servers and better developer experience.

Q: What security risk exists in the Claude and Codex agent runs?  
A: The jsonb files in .claude and .codex folders contain unencrypted file contents including secrets from any files processed, making them vulnerable to malicious npm packages.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Token Migration Guidance**:
   - davidhq provided comprehensive notes on development roadmap, token migration, and business strategy to multiple users
   - The Light explained to digitalalchemy what happens to futures positions during token migration
   - The Light recommended Phantom wallet as a user-friendly option for Solana tokens to raja

2. **Technical Collaboration**:
   - cjft reviewed Discord plugin implementation with Odilitime and suggested using full prompt evaluation for message detection
   - Agent Joshua provided detailed explanation about TDX advantages over SGX for TEE implementations
   - yikesawjeez advised checking .claude/ and .codex/ directories for exposed secrets before key rotation

3. **Project Updates**:
   - Odilitime clarified to sngwinner that while DegenAI carry fees would likely end, marketing and utility development would continue
   - Kenk implemented server security measures in response to increased scammer activity

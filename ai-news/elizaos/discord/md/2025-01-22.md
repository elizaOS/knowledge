## Key Questions & Answers

### ElizaOS Development
- **Q**: How do I fix the "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'actions')" error with bootstrap plugin?  
  **A**: Try a different version tag, as this appears to be a bug (answered by Odilitime)

- **Q**: How do I get the dexscreener plugin working?  
  **A**: Remove the API key check in index.ts and just add dexScreenerPlugin directly (answered by bifkn)

- **Q**: How do I fix "Vector dimension mismatch" error?  
  **A**: This happens when switching between embedding models; clear your local db with `rm -f ./agent/data/db.sqlite` (answered by Yoda26)

- **Q**: How do I run Eliza in WSL instead of Windows?  
  **A**: Clone the repo directly in WSL or move project files to Linux filesystem instead of /mnt/c/ (answered by Vesper)

- **Q**: How do I change the default model to gpt-4o-mini?  
  **A**: Edit your .env file with SMALL_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini, MEDIUM_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini, LARGE_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini (answered by Sora Dimichi)

### DegenAI/DegenSpartanAI
- **Q**: Where do we keep track of degenspartanai performance?  
  **A**: Birdeye and Waveform (answered by Noname)

- **Q**: Can you summarize the current update status of degenspartan ai and the future update schedule?  
  **A**: Will make a post later tonight and maybe also today announcement (answered by jin)

### Tokenomics
- **Q**: What % of the token is locked in the LP against the SOL received in bonding?  
  **A**: 22.5% goes to locked LP and 77.5% is traded on the bonding curve (answered by unreadyplayer)

- **Q**: Does this take SOL or ai16z as the coin used for funding the bonding curve?  
  **A**: This model uses ai16z as the base token, like Virtuals (answered by unreadyplayer)

- **Q**: How do you guys profit?  
  **A**: We'll use our 50% of the fees to cover operational costs and buy ai16z, which when it appreciates will bolster our treasury (answered by unreadyplayer)

### 3D AI TV
- **Q**: Do I just need custom config to do the blocktank tests or is that a whole new runner?  
  **A**: Yeah it's just the show-config.json mostly. And the different html & json files are so you don't accidentally overwrite a different show's save. (answered by SM Sith Lord)

- **Q**: How do you make the TTS ignore the "tv" actor's dialogue line?  
  **A**: What I did in my handler was just check which actor is speaking early on in the event handling. And if the actor is "tv", it just does the media loading & cancels out of the normal handling. (answered by SM Sith Lord)

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-10-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **ElizaCloud Architecture**: Containers should have their own databases to accommodate different ElizaOS versions with varying schemas
- **Development Focus**: sam-developer working on Stripe integration while cjft develops serverless Eliza
- **Frontend Approach**: Using shadcn components with emphasis on avoiding "vibe slop" through proper design processes
- **Multi-step Task System**: Odilitime is improving elizaOS's multi-step task system to handle more complex operations beyond standard GPT performance

### Technical Issues & Fixes
- **Server Configuration**: SERVER_PORT environment variable no longer being respected, requiring code fix
- **Runtime Initialization**: Bug identified related to adapter startup and getTasks method, with PR #6039 submitted to fix
- **CLI Path Resolution**: Challenges with getLocalCliPath function being too simplistic for complex project structures

### Blockchain & Web3
- **SGX Security Vulnerability**: DorianD shared information about a security vulnerability in Intel SGX affecting blockchain deployments (wiretap.fail)
- **DegenAI Business Models**: Proposals for NFT-based crypto index funds (like "Degen100") with automatic rebalancing
- **Futarchy Systems**: Discussion about implementing futarchy as a multiagent orchestration system with properly structured incentives

### OpenAI Capabilities
- New features including Sora-2 API, agent builder, web search, and Codex cloud/SDK
- Jon mentioned using Eliza version 1.9.25 to post on X (Twitter) without purchasing an API

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Does tenancy matter to cloud?  
   **A**: No, containers should have their own db, especially since there will be various ElizaOS versions with different schemas

2. **Q**: Is there any web3 MCP startups?  
   **A**: Not integrated, but our mcp gateway could be that

3. **Q**: How might we use futarchy in our ecosystem?  
   **A**: Futarchy could be a better multiagent orchestration system than existing multiagent apps if incentives are structured correctly

4. **Q**: Is there a detailed summary of the AMA available?  
   **A**: [Discord link provided]

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Runtime Initialization Fix**
   - **Helper**: Stan ⚡
   - **Helpee**: Odilitime
   - **Context**: Runtime failing with "undefined is not an object (evaluating 'this.adapter.getTasks')"
   - **Resolution**: Stan created PR #6039 to fix the issue with checkTasks() starting before runtime fully initializes

2. **Server Port Configuration**
   - **Helper**: Stan ⚡
   - **Helpee**: Odilitime
   - **Context**: SERVER_PORT environment variable not being respected
   - **Resolution**: Provided code fix to parse the environment variable properly

3. **API Configuration Troubleshooting**
   - **Helper**: 0xbbjoker
   - **Helpee**: Unspecified user
   - **Context**: API configuration issue with a plugin

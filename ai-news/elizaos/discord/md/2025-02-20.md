# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-20

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Project Status & Roadmap
- **Rebranding Progress**: The team is 95% complete with rebranding from ai16z to ElizaOS, with the remaining work involving legal considerations and coordination with external parties like daos.fun.
- **Tokenomics Update**: Tokenomics is functionally "95% done" but its release is tied to the marketplace launch, which has been delayed. It will be released simultaneously with the launchpad, likely after ETH Denver (early March).
- **New Leadership Team**: The project announced new hires including Eskender as CPO (in week 2), Ben as Head of Brand, and Nisita as Head of Community, signaling increased focus on communication and brand consolidation.
- **L1/L2 Development**: There's ongoing debate about whether developing an L1/L2 blockchain remains a long-term goal. Eskender indicated it's "still interesting" but will come later, while community members noted that Shaw had recently stated on a podcast that an L1 was "a bad idea."

### Technical Developments
- **Compass Labs Demo**: Aidar from Compass Labs presented a demo about enabling Eliza to deploy and manage capital in DeFi, covering API integration, plugin installation, and on-chain data interaction.
- **Plugin Registry System**: The project has moved away from hosting plugins in the main repository to a new plugin registry system, with discussions about improving documentation for this system.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: A multi-agent system for monitoring token unlock events was described by AGC from "blacktokenomics," consisting of data agents, validation agents, and trade agents working together to execute short trades based on tokenomics data.
- **DegenAI Trading Bot**: The team is developing an AI-powered trading bot that uses sentiment analysis and character-based decision making for trading. It's currently banned from Twitter but operating in Discord while appeals are processed.
- **RealitySpiral**: Identified as a significant GitHub contributor working on agents that automatically push commits and suggest code fixes, with plans for a self-duplicating improvement suite.

### Community Projects
- **ClankTank Development**: Jin is developing "Clank Tank," a game show format for AI-driven project evaluation that serves as a discovery engine for the DAO's partnerships pipeline. The team is working on a PlayCanvas implementation with a Unity port in progress, including visual assets, transitions, and music.
- **Launchpad Progress**: The team is finalizing a launchpad for agent projects, with launch expected after ETH Denver. They're currently onboarding the first cohort of launch partners.

### Common Technical Issues
- **Environment Setup Challenges**: Users frequently encounter environment setup issues across different operating systems, particularly with SQLite dependencies and WSL2 compatibility.
- **Database Configuration Problems**: Several users reported issues with database setup and configuration, particularly when switching between development environments.
- **RAG Knowledge Base Implementation**: Multiple discussions about implementing and configuring RAG knowledge bases for enhanced agent capabilities.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Project Direction & Tokenomics
- **Q**: When will the remaining 5% of the rebrand be completed?  
  **A**: The team doesn't want to give a concrete date, but indicated it would be after ETH Denver which ends March 2nd.

- **Q**: What's the rough timeline for the new tokenomics?  
  **A**: Tokenomics will be released at the same time with launchpad, hinting after ETHDenver.

- **Q**: Why is tokenomics still not released if it's "95% done"?  
  **A**: It's "directly tied to the release of the marketplace" which "has lagged behind in terms of hitting its release date."

- **Q**: Is developing an L1/L2 blockchain still a long-term goal?  
  **A**: It's "still v interesting" but "will be down the line once we have the product teams and topco in the right place."

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: How can I chat directly via API with my agent?  
  **A**: Use curl commands to first get your agent ID with `curl -X GET http://YOURIP:3001/agents` and then send messages with `curl -X POST http://YOURIP:3001/{YOURAGENTID}/message -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "text=YOURTEXT" -F "user=user"`

- **Q**: Can I run multiple Twitter agents in one Eliza repository?  
  **A**: Yes, use `pnpm start --characters="characters/deep-thought.character.json, characters/sbf.character.json"`

- **Q**: How do I fix build failures on Linux?  
  **A**: Install required dependencies with `apt -y install build-essential pkg-config libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-dev`

- **Q**: Why is my evaluator's handler never called even when validate returns true?  
  **A**: Set `alwaysRun:true` and then return `false` in the `validate` function when you don't want it to run.

- **Q**: How do I enable RAG knowledge base for my agent?  
  **A**: Set `ragKnowledge: true` in settings and configure the knowledge paths correctly.

- **Q**: How do I attach a file to a message?  
  **A**: Use the `attachments` array with proper configuration including contentType, id, source, and url.

### DegenAI & Community Projects
- **Q**: What are Degenai's KPIs and how is he performing?  
  **A**: Looking at meta-relevant tokens and PnL. Still experimenting with more solid KPIs to be tracked.

- **Q**: Is the long term plan still to have him yap on x? If so, how do we plan to mitigate the risk of him being banned again?  
  **A**: Yes, and once we know the actual reason, we will be able to plan to mitigate. Without knowing the reason there's no way to mitigate.

- **Q**: What problem is Clank Tank trying to solve?  
  **A**: It aims to provide mixture of experts for better feedback, promote projects without direct endorsement, and scale transparent deal flow/governance/partnerships for the DAO.

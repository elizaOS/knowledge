# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Agent Development & Architecture
- **RoseOS Framework**: A new framework built on top of ElizaOS was shared, focusing on designing autonomous systems with explicit agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, and accountability layers.
- **Multi-Model Agents**: Technical discussions about implementing agents that use different LLM models (Anthropic and OpenAI) for specific tasks within a single agent.
- **Deployment Options**: Stan recommended container deployment through ElizaOS CLI for agents with custom plugins, particularly for those requiring specialized functionality.
- **Agent Configuration**: Questions arose about adding knowledge sections to JSON configurations, suggesting users are looking to enhance agent memory capabilities.

### Technical Improvements
- **Enhanced Logging System**: Stan implemented significant improvements to the logging system through PR #6263, including a new linter in the eliza/config package that warns developers when logs are in the wrong format.
- **Plugin Versioning**: Issues were reported with Discord plugin versioning, specifically regarding the failed publishing of v1.3.4 and the jump from v1.3.3 to v1.3.5.

### Project Direction & Philosophy
- **Autonomy Engineering**: The RoseOS framework emphasizes treating autonomy as an engineering problem rather than a hype feature, focusing on control surfaces, decision limits, and predictable behavior.
- **Value Proposition Debate**: Some skepticism was expressed about ElizaOS's capabilities beyond being a wrapper for AI models, prompting discussion about its unique value proposition.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can I implement two models in one agent, like Anthropic & OpenAI at the same time, and determine for which task use which model?**  
A: Use Openrouter plugin and define provider/LLM model in your env file. (Stan ⚡)

**Q: Should I deploy my agent with custom plugins outside of cloud?**  
A: You can deploy your agent inside cloud containers using ElizaOS CLI. (Stan ⚡)

**Q: How does eliza work and why should I use it?**  
A: It's a framework for building AI agents with various capabilities. (Kenk)

**Q: Eliza is an operating system?**  
A: Yes it's an open source AI framework for AI agents. (satsbased)

**Q: Did Stan implement the improved logging?**  
A: Yes, through PR #6263. (Stan ⚡)

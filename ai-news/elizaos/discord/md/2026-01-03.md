# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-03

**Date: January 3, 2026**

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Framework & Architecture
- ElizaOS was described as "the Linux of autonomous AI agents" - an open source AI framework for building and deploying AI agents
- The framework provides pre-built infrastructure that saves development time for AI agent developers
- A user named roseOS shared details about an experimental agent framework built on ElizaOS, focusing on designing autonomous systems with explicit agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, and accountability layers

### Technical Implementations
- **Multi-Model Agent Configuration**: Discussions about implementing multiple models within a single agent (using Anthropic for calculations/forecasting and OpenAI for reasoning)
- **Deployment Options**: Cloud containers were recommended for deploying agents with custom plugins
- **Logging Improvements**: Stan implemented enhanced logging capabilities through PR #6263 and added a linter for logs in the eliza/config package to maintain consistent logging standards

### Project Integrations
- Openrouter plugin was recommended for defining provider/LLM models in the env file
- Discussion about integrating AI agents with websites using API keys
- Kenk shared a link to an "agentic AI crash course" with potential integration with Eliza for lead generation

### Community Projects
- Mentions of DegenAI with questions about potential updates
- Discussion about Hyperscape and cryptocurrency earning functionality
- References to a project called roseOS that focuses on autonomous systems with explicit agency boundaries

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can I implement two models in one agent, like Anthropic & OpenAI at the same time?**  
A: Use Openrouter plugin and define provider/LLM model in your env file (answered by Stan ⚡)

**Q: Should I deploy my agent with plugins not yet added to cloud outside of cloud?**  
A: You can deploy your agent inside cloud containers (answered by Stan ⚡)

**Q: How does eliza work?**  
A: It's a framework for people to build AI agents (answered by Kenk)

**Q: How is elizaos composable?**  
A: We had at one point 190 plugins which brought heaps of functionality (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Eliza is an operating system?**  
A: Yes, it's an open source AI framework (answered by satsbased)

**Q: Like linux?**  
A: For AI agents, yes (answered by satsbased)

**Q: Did Stan implement the improved logging?**  
A: Yes, through PR #6263 (answered by Stan ⚡)

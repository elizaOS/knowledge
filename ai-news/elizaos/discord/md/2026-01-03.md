# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Framework Architecture & Development

**Multi-Model Implementation & Deployment**
The development team made significant progress on multi-model agent capabilities. Stan ⚡ provided guidance on implementing multiple AI models within a single agent using the Openrouter plugin with provider/LLM model definitions in environment files. The team emphasized cloud container deployment through ElizaOS CLI for one-command deployment with dashboard visibility for containers and logs, particularly for agents with custom plugins not yet added to cloud.

**Logging Infrastructure Improvements**
Stan ⚡ successfully implemented enhanced logging capabilities through PR #6263, introducing improved provider logging and a new linter for log format validation in the eliza/config package. This linter warns developers when logs don't follow the correct format, helping maintain consistency across projects and plugins—a significant developer experience improvement.

**Performance & Memory Optimization Challenges**
Odilitime reported critical memory consumption issues during build processes, with Turbo using between 21-27GB of memory inconsistently. The behavior appears intermittent, with some runs completing normally while others exhibit extreme memory usage, indicating a potential memory leak or resource management problem requiring urgent investigation. Bootstrap optimizations for providers are also in progress.

### Agent Framework Innovations

**RoseOS Experimental Framework**
roseOS introduced an experimental agent framework built on top of elizaOS, focusing on autonomous systems with explicit agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, and accountability layers. Key design principles include:
- Agents reasoning within defined policy constraints
- Making decisions rather than executing static instructions
- Adapting behavior while maintaining traceability
- Operating as composable modular software primitives
- Treating autonomy as an engineering problem emphasizing control surfaces, decision limits, and predictable behavior

**Knowledge Data Pipelines**
Jin announced significant progress on Eliza knowledge data pipelines, with work moving into documentation and presentation phases, representing a major advancement in agent memory and knowledge management capabilities.

### Platform-Specific Challenges

**Discord Plugin Versioning**
YogaFlame reported a Discord plugin versioning issue where v1.3.4 failed to publish, requiring a jump to v1.3.5. Concerns were raised about agent memory, specifically the removal of lore/knowledge sections from the new JSON format, with questions about manual addition remaining unresolved.

**Solana Trading Bot Performance**
Chucknorris raised advanced concerns about Solana trading bot performance, emphasizing the necessity of GRPC ingesters for millisecond-precision transaction processing, custom builders, and full payload preshot capabilities for profitable trading operations. They noted standard approaches using Jupiter/SDK introduce 4-second delays that make competitive trading impossible.

### Community & Project Updates

**Framework Positioning & Value Proposition**
A philosophical debate emerged with i3 questioning ElizaOS's value proposition and long-term viability. Stan ⚡ defended the framework as a comprehensive toolbox providing databases, embeddings, model abstraction, APIs, composable tools, and infrastructure to avoid rebuilding from scratch. satsbased clarified that ElizaOS is an open-source AI framework for AI agents, comparable to Linux but for autonomous AI agents rather than a ChatGPT competitor.

**Active Development Projects**
- DegenAI confirmed still being actively developed by Odlitime
- Hyperscape has a developer Discord currently only accessible to developers (DM Shaw for access)
- Mirquo developer is providing assistance to P89
- Potential collaboration with Voidix for liquidity management/market-making partnerships discussed

**Educational Resources**
Kenk shared a link to an agentic AI crash course repository, suggesting potential integration with Eliza as a lead funnel for cloud services.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can I implement two models in one agent, like Anthropic & OpenAI at the same time, and determine for which task use which model?**
A: Use Openrouter plugin and define a provider/LLM model in your env file. Reference default models at https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/develop/packages/core/src/types/model.ts (Stan ⚡)

**Q: Should I deploy my agent outside of cloud if it has plugins not added to cloud yet?**
A: Deploy your agent inside cloud containers using ElizaOS CLI one-command deployment (Stan ⚡)

**Q: Is Eliza an operating system like Linux?**
A: Yes, it's an open source AI framework for AI agents, comparable to Linux but for autonomous AI agents (satsbased)

**Q: How to integrate my AI agent into things like website with an API key?**
A: Use ElizaOS CLI command for deployment (Stan ⚡)

**Q: Is there a Hyperscape channel or separate Discord?**
A: There's a developer Discord currently only for developers; you'd have to DM Shaw for access (The Light)

**Q: Is DegenAI still being updated?**
A: Yes, Odlitime is working on his development (Omid Sa)

**Q: How can an agent react fast enough for Solana trading without GRPC ingester and full payload preshot?**
A: It's impossible to make profit without millisecond precision GRPC ingester processing each transaction on each DEX (Chucknorris | ONYX P9 NODE RENT)

**Q: How to use custom models with different providers?**
A: Use useModel with the provider option in custom code (Odilitime)

**Q: Did you implement the improved logging?**
A: Yes, through PR #6263 which includes a linter for logs in the eliza/config package that warns about incorrect log formats (Stan ⚡)

**Q: How much memory is Turbo using during build?**
A: Between 21-27GB+ inconsistently, with some runs completing normally (Odilitime)

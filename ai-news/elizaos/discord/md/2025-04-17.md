# elizaOS Discord - 2025-04-17

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Auto.fun Platform Launch
- **Launch Timeline**: The auto.fun platform is expected to launch "this week," possibly today, with final testing underway
- **No Pre-announcement Strategy**: Team prefers not to pre-announce exact launch dates to concentrate messaging when users can immediately try the platform
- **Platform Features**: Will allow users to create coins through AI prompts, with customizable token suffixes (defaulting to "fun")
- **Plugin Support**: Removed from initial release due to complexity for non-technical users; will be supported in a future agent builder product
- **Differentiation**: Aims to provide better security features than competitors like pump.fun and return value to the ecosystem

### Token Confusion & Controversy
- **Unofficial Token Issue**: Significant confusion arose when Shaw purchased a token called "auto.fun" on pump.fun shortly before the official platform launch
- **Security Concerns**: The unofficial token's dexscreener link contained malicious code (drainer)
- **Official Tokens**: Team repeatedly clarified that only $ai16z and $degenai are official tokens
- **Community Reaction**: Partners expressed concerns about negative perception and potential harm to users from the unofficial token situation

### ElizaOS Technical Issues
- **V2 Beta Status**: ElizaOS V2 is in beta with many users experiencing installation and configuration difficulties
- **Common Problems**: Issues with dependencies, environment variables, plugin compatibility, and Docker container setup
- **Windows Compatibility**: Docker builds failing due to CRLF line ending issues on Windows
- **Documentation Gaps**: Tutorials may be outdated for V2, causing setup confusion

### DAO Communication Improvements
- **Communication Concerns**: Partners expressed frustration about lack of regular updates from the team
- **Monthly Town Hall**: First Labs/DAO sync scheduled for May 1st after 4pm PST / 7pm EST
- **Format**: Will collect questions from community beforehand to make efficient use of time
- **Transparency**: COO acknowledged communication issues and committed to improvement

## Key Questions & Answers

### Auto.fun Platform
Q: When is auto.fun launching?  
A: This week, with no specific pre-announcement of time/date.

Q: Is the auto.fun token (on pump.fun) official?  
A: No, only $ai16z and $degenai are official tokens.

Q: Will auto.fun have plugin support out of the box?  
A: No, plugins created too many edge cases for non-technical users and will be supported in a more serious agent builder product later.

Q: Can tokens issued through auto.fun have custom CA suffixes?

A: No, it doesn't work with the plugin registry.

### DAO & Communication
Q: Why hasn't the team been providing regular updates to the community?  
A: The COO has been focused on operations, accounting, legal, and financials, but acknowledges the need for better communication, especially from the product team.

Q: Why hasn't the team been promoting the $ai16z token?  
A: The team plans to release detailed tokenomics for ai16z with autofun at launch.

Q: Will there be a recording or notes from the town hall?

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-02

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Framework & Development
- The community is actively building agents with the ElizaOS framework, discussing implementation challenges, and sharing resources like the AI Agent Dev School on YouTube.
- Technical discussions focused on running ElizaOS locally versus on servers, connecting to databases like Supabase, and integrating with platforms like Twitter.
- Jin mentioned working on funding for experienced engineers (including a former principal engineer from Stability) to develop an Eliza agent project manager that will track issues, milestones, and route information.
- Mike D. shared a fixed PR for SQLite installation errors that many users were encountering.
- ‚Ñ≠ùî¶ùî≠ùî•ùî¢ùîØ provided a comprehensive list of available model providers including openai, anthropic, grok, groq, llama_cloud, llama_local, google, claude_vertex, redpill, openrouter, ollama, and heurist.

### Twitter Integration & Issues
- Multiple users reported issues with the Twitter client, including login failures, rate limiting, and duplicate replies to tweets.
- Dru1DD suggested changing ai16z package to elizaos to fix the issue of agents replying twice to tweets.
- Pleasures provided guidance on proper format for target users and action processing settings for Twitter integration.
- Kaito offered a tool for acquiring Twitter data without login requirements.

### AI TV Show Development
- Boom is working on a Unity implementation (version 2022.3.53f1) for an AI-powered TV show system with 3D characters, adding features like picture-in-picture, gaze control, and camera systems.
- The team is developing multiple show formats including news programs and a "Clank Tank" (Shark Tank-style) show.
- Two approaches to content generation are being debated: pre-generating full episodes with a writer's room AI versus real-time interaction between humans and AI characters.
- For news content, they're exploring automated aggregation from social media and other sources, with the goal of daily updates compiled into weekly episodes.

### DegenAI & Tokenomics
- DegenAI was listed on Binance Alpha, which was considered a significant achievement though noted as coming later than a competitor (ai16z).
- Jin mentioned ongoing development work including GitHub activity pipeline integration, cross-chain functionality, and developer onboarding.
- Discussion about tokenomics included debate about "virtuals" as a model, with eskender.eth warning about structural weaknesses in alt:alt token pairs.
- DorianD suggested urgent implementation of clear communication about the 5-10% ecosystem entry fee for launchpads, with Odilitime agreeing to update the repository README.
- samsar proposed capital efficiency strategies for the treasury, suggesting LP'ing top tributor tokens to generate yield while providing deeper liquidity.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What are the possible values of the "modelProvider" param in the character file?**  
A: Available options include openai, anthropic, grok, groq, llama_cloud, llama_local, google, claude_vertex, redpill, openrouter, ollama, heurist (answered by ‚Ñ≠ùî¶ùî≠ùî•ùî¢ùîØ)

**Q: How much does it cost to run an AI agent per month?**  
A: It depends on usage; can be free with local models via Ollama, or variable costs with API-based models (answered by Chop)

**Q: Which LLM model provider is low-priced and decent?**  
A: Deepseek via OpenRouter was recommended (answered by R0am)

**Q: Can I run an agent on a Raspberry Pi 4 using OpenAI API?**  
A: Yes, especially if using external APIs for compute (answered by Chop)

**Q: Why does my Twitter agent reply twice to tweets?**  
A: It's a known issue that can be fixed by changing ai16z package to elizaos (answered by Dru1DD)

**Q: How do I set up a Discord bot with ElizaOS?**  
A: You need to follow the quickstart guide, enable bot and app permissions for voice in Discord Developer, and ensure proper OAuth2 permissions are set (answered by DanielJTrujillo)

**Q: Is it possible to run ElizaOS without a GPU?**  
A: Yes, but it will be slower than running with a GPU (answered by BOSSU)

**Q: Are LLMs suitable for trading?**  
A: LLMs are not what's going to make traders good; they can steer but are not a good fit for making decisions. They're inherently bad at trading and need dedicated systems with backtesting. (answered by LevelsDennis)

**Q: What will happen to donated DAO treasury tokens and those projects?**  
A: jin indicated they're working on data organization and won't let the program fade (answered by jin)

**Q: is degenai repo public?**  
A: He's just a vanilla Eliza, so yes (answered by Odilitime)

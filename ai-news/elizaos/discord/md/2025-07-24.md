# elizaOS Discord - 2025-07-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Project Status & Community Concerns
- **X Account Suspension**: The project's X (Twitter) account remains suspended. Kenk confirmed they are in communication with X to restore it, with communications improving in recent days but still experiencing slow response times.
- **Token Performance**: Community members expressed significant frustration about AI16Z's price decline, with some claiming it's one of the worst-performing tokens in the market. The team emphasized they're focused on long-term ecosystem building rather than short-term price action.
- **Token Utility Discussions**: Several users suggested developing better token utility mechanisms to incentivize holding and improve price performance.

### Technical Development
- **Windows Compatibility**: Starlord identified and fixed issues with the knowledge panel handler on Windows systems, addressing path problems where the Vite manifest was being incorrectly located.
- **Messaging Systems**: Odilitime shared code examples for sending messages to Telegram, highlighting how messages are processed through the plugin-bootstrap.
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Samuel Chauche sought help with bidirectional communication between ElizaOS and an extension using websockets, struggling to receive responses despite sending messages successfully.
- **On-chain vs. Off-chain Storage**: DorianD criticized ElizaOS for not storing character files and memories on-chain, describing it as "a glorified Apache server" and "wrapper for black box LLMs." Kenk defended the approach, arguing that on-chain storage isn't necessary when IPFS or attestations would suffice.

### Content & Community Initiatives
- **AI News Show**: Jin proposed buying time on time.fun to pitch AI news and potentially co-host a show with AI, mentioning they're working on realtime voice capabilities.
- **Newsletter Development**: Jin plans to modify the daily AI summary and create a weekly newsletter that users can subscribe to.
- **AI Image Generation**: Users discussed various AI image generation tools, with Dr. Neuro recommending Midjourney over ChatGPT for better quality and more design options.

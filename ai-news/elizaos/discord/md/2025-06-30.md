## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why do we not have a known Eliza agent with millions of followers?** (DorianD)  
A: Building good agents takes time, most are still experimental. Plus getting millions of followers is hard even for humans. We're still early days, focus is on making the tech solid first. (jintern)

**Q: Will you make the airkit plugin so AI agents can utilize it?** (Dr. Neuro)  
A: That's above my intern pay grade, but sounds like a cool idea. Maybe bring it up in #feature-requests or tag one of the core devs. (jintern)

**Q: Can someone please give me a proper argument on why ElizaOS is going to be the leader in AI agents frameworks over virtuals for example?** (3on_.)  
A: Many virtuals 'agents' use elizaOS as the framework. Says it all really. (Kenk)

**Q: Why is the Twitter/X client deprecated?** (~oxy)  
A: The Twitter client uses old v1 API endpoints that Twitter's been phasing out, causing 403 errors, especially on free tier. Plus they increased API pricing to $200 for basic access. (jintern)

**Q: What's the optimal character file length?** (Luke ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º)  
A: Long is fine, with the most important parts being style and messageExamples. The style section is fully loaded as context, while bio loads 10 random entries, messageExamples loads 5, and topics loads 1. (GnomonðŸª²)

**Q: How can I prevent my agent from creating entities for all 54k members in a Discord server?** (Scooter)  
A: Set `ENTITY_CREATION_MODE=on_interaction` in your .env file to only create entities when users actually talk to the agent. (jintern)

**Q: Can you share how you did the 3-legged oauth for Twitter?** (alerios)  
A: Use twurl (version 0.9.7) with the command `twurl authorize --consumer-key "$X_CONSUMER_KEY" --consumer-secret "$X_CONSUMER_SECRET"` and open the generated URL in incognito mode. (Luke ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Twitter API Troubleshooting
- **Helper:** Luke ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º | **Helpee:** alerios
- **Context:** Struggling with Twitter OAuth authentication
- **Resolution:** Provided detailed instructions on using twurl to authorize Twitter API access

### Discord Bot Configuration
- **Helper:** jintern | **Helpee:** Scooter
- **Context:** Agent creating entities for all 54k Discord server members

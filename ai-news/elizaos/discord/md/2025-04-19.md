## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Auto.fun Launch and Technical Issues
- **Auto.fun Platform Launch**: Shaw and the ElizaOS team launched auto.fun, a token launchpad platform with AI integration features.
- **Technical Difficulties**: The launch experienced significant issues due to overwhelming traffic, with multiple server overloads forcing temporary redirects to Twitter.
- **Ongoing Fixes**: The team took the platform down several times for server upgrades and backend fixes, actively collecting affected token addresses for remediation.
- **Platform Mechanics**: Auto.fun uses Raydium AMM with a new mechanism developed with the Raydium team that enables liquidity NFTs, allowing token deployers to claim fees from burned/graduated LP positions.
- **Tokenomics**: The platform collects 10% of bonded LP fees, which are used to buy back $ai16z tokens from the open market and reinvest in ai16z LP to create deeper ecosystem liquidity.

### Platform Features
- **Custom Vanity Addresses**: Users can specify the last 3-4 characters of token contract addresses.
- **Token-Gated Chat**: Chat rooms where only users with a specific amount of tokens can access.
- **AI Integration**: Content creation tools and AI-enhanced features for token communities.
- **Bonding Curve**: Uses a bonding curve with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves, with tokens automatically graduating to Raydium when they reach 113 SOL in reserves (85 SOL actual + 28 SOL virtual).
- **Token Migration**: Tokens migrate to decentralized exchanges like Raydium or Meteora when they reach 100% bonding.
- **Anti-Snipe/Bundle Features**: Protections against common token launch exploitation tactics.

### ElizaOS Development
- **Spartan Updates**: SpartanVersus (Twitter account) is back online with a blue checkmark and affiliate badge. The team is working on upgrading it to v2, fixing autonomous trading bugs, and preparing for Discord and Telegram integration.
- **Plugin Architecture Issues**: Several users encountered problems with Telegram and Discord plugins, particularly regarding event handling and message processing.
- **Event Handling**: Technical discussion about how events are emitted and subscribed to in the ElizaOS plugin architecture, with callbacks being triggered twice during message processing.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Auto.fun Platform
- **Q**: What is auto.fun?  
  **A**: A creator-friendly launchpad and no-code platform integrating multi-agent functionality, collaborative tokenomics, and AI-enhanced features.

- **Q**: Will auto.fun have its own token?  
  **A**: No new token, only $ai16z and $degenai are official tokens.

- **Q**: How does auto.fun differ from pump.fun?  
  **A**: More fair launch features, creator support, anti-snipe/bundle, different bonding curve, importable tokens.

- **Q**: How does the bonding curve work?  
  **A**: Auto.fun uses a bonding curve with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves.

- **Q**: What happens when a coin reaches the bonding curve limit?  
  **A**: It automatically graduates to Raydium with a 6 SOL flat fee.

- **Q**: How much SOL is required for migration in Auto.fun?  
  **A**: 85 SOL + 28 SOL virtual reserve = 113 SOL.

- **Q**: Why doesn't auto.fun buyback DegenAI tokens?  
  **A**: Multiple reasons: Spartan already gets exposure from buybacks, technical complexity of splitting fees, and potential confusion in ecosystem vs agent narrative.

### ElizaOS Development
- **Q**: When can automated trading be used with Spartan?  
  **A**: No estimate available yet.

- **Q**: Is Spartan now v2 or not yet?  
  **A**: Not yet, having problems getting v2 to sound like Spartan without losing what works well.

- **Q**: Are Discord plugin events being subscribed to at all?  
  **A**: Yes, plugin-bootstrap has the event receiver.

- **Q**: Why are callbacks in the Discord service getting hit twice?  
  **A**: The first callback assumes text isn't in the response, but debugging shows it is present.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Token Creation & Migration Issues
- **Helper**: yikesawjeez | **Helpee**: noj  
  **Context**: User had 6 SOL locked in a token they couldn't access, with token showing as "locked"  
  **Resolution**: Suggested importing the token and posting details in the bug report channel for team assistance.

- **Helper**: eskender.eth | **Helpee**: Redvoid  
  **Context**: User wanted to connect their Eliza bot to a token on auto.fun  
  **Resolution**: Explained that after creating a token, they can update metadata including social accounts if connected with the same wallet.

- **Helper**: beeboop | **Helpee**: accelxr  
  **Context**: User was getting "Failed to create token on-chain" error when trying to create a manual token  
  **Resolution**: Identified the error in console as "Symbol too long" and suggested reducing ticker length from 12 characters.

### ElizaOS Plugin Issues
- **Helper**: k_carv | **Helpee**: k_carv  
  **Context**: Understanding how events are emitted and subscribed to in ElizaOS plugins  
  **Resolution**: Self-resolved by examining code and discovering plugin-bootstrap handles the event receiver.

- **Helper**: martincontact101 | **Helpee**: k_carv  
  **Context**: Error starting agents with "Agent not found" JSON error  
  **Resolution**: Suggested the character JSON file was wrong and offered DM support.

### Networking & Community
- **Helper**: Zolo | **Helpee**: HoneyBadger  
  **Context**: Looking for Eliza partners in Hong Kong  
  **Resolution**: Zolo shared a Twitter contact (AIFlow_ML) who will host an event in Hong Kong.

- **Helper**: Curtisdonthurtus | **Helpee**: Odilitime  
  **Context**: Spartan giving poor responses when unable to provide requested content  
  **Resolution**: Suggested making Spartan not answer when asked for content it can't make instead of giving a lame response.

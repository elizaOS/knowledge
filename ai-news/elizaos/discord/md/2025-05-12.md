# elizaOS Discord - 2025-05-12

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Issues & Development
- **Knowledge Import Functionality**: Users reported that string-based knowledge imports work successfully, but file path and directory references fail despite setting `ragKnowledge: true` in the Eliza OS platform.
- **Discord Integration Challenges**: Several users discussed difficulties with Discord plugin functionality, particularly getting proper @username mentions with notifications working correctly.
- **Ollama Configuration**: Users discovered they need to explicitly add `@elizaos/plugins-ollama` to their character file rather than relying on environment variables alone to prevent unnecessary node-llama-cpp installation.
- **Video Generation**: Videos generated by agents save to cache but may not display properly in the GUI, creating usability issues.
- **Fee Collection Issue**: A technical issue with fee collection on auto.fun was reported and subsequently fixed by the team overnight.

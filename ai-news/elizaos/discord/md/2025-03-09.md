# elizaOS Discord - 2025-03-09

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development & Roadmap
- **ElizaOS 2.0 Progress**: The team is working on ElizaOS 2.0, with beta release scheduled for next Monday (significantly ahead of schedule). Shaw mentioned working 14-hour days to complete it, with the new version offering a vastly improved technical experience.
- **Rebranding Milestone**: A recent rebranding milestone was achieved, with separate tracks for "degen rebrand" and "org rebrand" in progress.
- **Ticker Change**: Ongoing work on a ticker change, though this process is complicated and not entirely under the team's control.
- **Framework Improvements**: Significant backend development continues despite market conditions, including refactoring tests, adding coverage for Instagram/GitHub clients, and fixing RAG system bugs.

### AI Agents & Development
- **DegenAI Migration**: The team is migrating DegenAI, an in-house agent, to v2 and working to restore its Twitter functionality.
- **Agent Ecosystem**: Discussions clarified the distinction between in-house agents (like DegenAI and aixvc) versus aligned partner agents.
- **Technical Challenges**: Users faced various issues with client integrations (Twitter, Discord, Ollama), environment configuration, and plugin installation.
- **Knowledge Management**: Current builds require agent restart for new knowledge to be processed, with no dynamic ingestion yet.
- **AI Hallucinations**: Technical hallucinations in AI responses were identified as an issue requiring better fact-checking systems and real-time data validation.

### Governance & Community
- **Governance Simulation**: Jin and Jintern discussed creating a governance simulation system by forking "Clank Tank" to run simulations on governance proposals.
- **Data Pipelines**: Jin shared progress on data pipelines for automated newsletters, creating a system that combines updates from X, Discord, GitHub, and Codex into JSON files.
- **On-chain Reputation**: Discussions about on-chain reputation systems highlighted challenges of creating systems that measure meaningful contributions rather than easily quantifiable metrics.
- **Agent Identity Verification**: The team explored mechanisms potentially using TEE (Trusted Execution Environments) and zero-knowledge proofs for cross-platform verification.

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Build System Changes**: The project has switched from pnpm to bun for package management, with new build commands ("bun run build" instead of "pnpm build").
- **Plugin Development**: Guidance provided on creating custom plugins for ElizaOS, including file structure and implementation details.
- **Database Integration**: Users sought help with MongoDB sharding and PostgreSQL configuration for RAG systems.
- **Asset Management**: For 3D assets, suggestions included using Git with LFS (Large File Storage) for version control and S3/R2 for production delivery.

## Key Questions & Answers

### ElizaOS Platform
- **Q**: When will elizaos v2 launch? (Walker >>)  
  **A**: By April (HoneyBadger), with beta available next Monday (Shaw)

- **Q**: What is the new build command and npm version now that it switched to bun? ([elizaos] <robbie3920>)  
  **A**: If you're on latest, build command is now "bun run build" instead of pnpm build. For deps use "bun install" instead of pnpm i. (jintern)

- **Q**: How do I install new agents using the roll back? (Pedro)  
  **A**: For rollback, git checkout the commit hash of working version, then install new agents with normal process - copy template dir, edit character.json, add to registry. (jintern)

- **Q**: Is there an article or guide that would help me understand more the characterfile and how I should prompt it? (Matej)  
  **A**: You can check out `composeState@core/src/runtime.ts` for how the system prompt is generated (nullfoxgiven)

### AI Agents & Development
- **Q**: Can knowledge be ingested easily on the fly yet? (SecretRecipe)  
  **A**: Still need to restart for knowledge changes. No dynamic ingestion yet. (jintern)

- **Q**: How do I dynamically provide knowledge to an Eliza agent? (ronipepe)  
  **A**: Use the knowledge endpoint - POST to /api/knowledge with your data formatted as {"content": "your knowledge text", "metadata": {optional tags}}. (jintern)

- **Q**: How far has the development of degenAi come? (Lexuz)  
  **A**: Team is migrating him to v2 and dealing with getting him back up on x. They also made a few connections during eth Denver. (Patt)

- **Q**: What is the difference between degenAI and other AI agents? (HERF)  
  **A**: DegenAI is an in-house agent so the team would be very intimately familiar with our framework and would have an inherently beneficial relationship with our ecosystem (Rick)

- **Q**: How can I keep my AI agent running 24/7? (rchak007)  
  **A**: Several ways: cloud VPS (Linode/Digital Ocean), Oracle Cloud free tier, pm2 for process management, or Docker for containers. (jintern)

- **Q**: Is there any way to start with a free API? (Ghost)  
  **A**: You can use free APIs with ElizaOS. For LLMs check out Ollama for local or together.ai which has free credits. (jintern)

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: Any pointers on best practice for extending TemplateType for custom plugins? (Rick)  
  **A**: Add custom templates to the types.d.ts file in your plugin dir, then access in code via templates.myCustomTemplate. (jintern)

- **Q**: How do I setup the autoclient to run every 30min? (Yann)  
  **A**: Add a cron config in your character.json with schedule settings. (jintern)

- **Q**: Is anyone able to use a PDF file for RAG knowledge? (Prayag)  
  **A**: Yes, PDFs work fine for RAG. In v2 you can directly use PDF without conversion by adding the file path to knowledge array in your character file. (jintern)

- **Q**: What specific data would help agents understand human values? (jin)  
  **A**: A mix of charter/constitution with core values, treasury + market data, daily sentiment to track priorities, and historical governance decisions for precedent. (jintern)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Support
- **Ghost** was having issues with Ollama connection; **jintern** identified that Ollama wasn't installed, guided through installation steps and model configuration.

- **Midas** encountered node version mismatch causing better-sqlite3 module errors; **jintern** provided steps to use correct node version and rebuild the module.

- **[elizaos] <robbie3920>** had Discord plugin initialization issues; **jintern** explained that Discord plugin auto-initializes if required env vars are set correctly.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What is the status of the V2 that was promised for Q1?**  
A: Kenk clarified that V2 Beta has been running since March with hackathons and production agents already using it.

**Q: What's happening with the suspended X/Twitter account?**  
A: Kenk stated they're in active conversations with X and resolution should come soon, looking positive.

**Q: Can the knowledge plugin be used via API?**  
A: No, knowledge plugin APIs aren't exposed through REST API - they're internal only. You'd need to use CLI commands or send files/text directly to the agent through messages.

**Q: What is the correct endpoint to send a message to an agent?**  
A: POST to `/messages` with body like `{"agentId": "your-agent-id", "text": "your message", "userId": "some-user-id"}`.

**Q: Why does OpenRouter default to Gemini models even when configured for other models?**  
A: Having OpenAI environment variables set can cause conflicts. Commenting out OpenAI-related variables helps resolve this issue.

**Q: Where are character files stored in ElizaOS 1.0.15?**  
A: Check `packages/core/src/defaultCharacters/` or look for a `characters/` folder in your project root. GUI-created characters might be stored in a database or config directory.

**Q: Why am I getting 403 errors with the Twitter plugin fork?**  
A: The interactions.ts mentions handling is causing authentication issues with Twitter's API.

**Q: Why am I getting errors for base and mainnet chains?**  
A: EVM_PRIVATE_KEY environment variable is required for the plugin to work properly.

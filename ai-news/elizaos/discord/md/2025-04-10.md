# elizaOS Discord - 2025-04-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development & Technical Issues
- Users are experiencing various installation and dependency issues with ElizaOS, particularly when building different versions
- Version 0.25.9 appears to be the most stable according to some users, though plugin compatibility varies across versions
- The "hapi__shot" error is commonly reported when building different versions
- Users are trying different package managers (npm, pnpm, bun) to resolve dependency issues
- A common fix for the "Dynamic require of 'child_process'" error is adding `"types": ["node"]` to tsconfig.json
- Twitter plugin functionality is a common pain point, with users trying to get autonomous posting working

### ElizaDAO Organization
- The community is establishing ElizaDAO alongside existing entities ElizaLabs and ElizaStudios
- Five working groups have been formed: Community/Governance/Events, Dev/Knowledge, Comms/Social, Partnerships/Outreach, and Tokens/Funding
- Consensus that a separate DAO treasury is essential for true decentralized governance
- Discussion about balancing autonomous action with coordination with ElizaLabs to avoid duplication of efforts
- Plans to create a DAO charter with clear values and establish alignment with ElizaLabs' roadmap while maintaining independence

### Agent Development
- SpartanV2 is being developed as a flagship agent for V2, while V1 is currently running
- Discussion about optimal posting frequency for social media agents (currently twice per hour for Spartan)
- The team is exploring ways to recover 25,000 followers that were previously lost
- Contract address has been added to the Spartan account profile

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Ecosystem
- Gap identified in the MCP server ecosystem: lack of efficient discovery and evaluation mechanisms for AI agents
- Multiple registry solutions emerging (smithery.ai, mcp.so, mcpmarket.com) but they lack agent-centric feedback
- Proposal for registry.fun as a whitelabel version of auto.fun for MCP server operators
- Concept of an "Eliza Diary Network" mentioned as a forum for AI agents

### Product Launches
- Auto.fun launch initially delayed to April 14th, now coming "very very soon" without a specific date
- Clank Tank Episode 3 released, with discussions about improvements including Tally integrations and Discord webhooks
- Virtual token reportedly got listed

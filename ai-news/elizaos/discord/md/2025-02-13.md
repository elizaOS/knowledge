# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-13

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development & Technical Updates

- **ElizaOS V2 Progress**: The team is restructuring the plugin architecture to allow plugins to live in separate repositories for better scalability. Shaw is fully dedicated to shipping V2, with internal release targets moved up.

- **Docker & Deployment Issues**: Multiple users reported issues with Docker containers, particularly with ARM64 architecture and module dependencies. Solutions included installing required dependencies with `apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget` and using `node:23-slim`.

- **Memory Management Challenges**: Users discussed context exceeding the 128K token limit after Twitter agents run for a while, and vector mismatch errors in SQLite databases. Odilitime suggested using OpenAI embeddings instead of local ones to resolve vector issues.

- **Twitter Integration**: Several discussions focused on Twitter functionality, including thread creation, media uploads, and API limitations. The `buildConversationThread` method in `utils.ts` inside client-twitter was highlighted as the key to implementing thread posting.

- **Hosting Options**: Community members discussed various hosting solutions including AWS, GCP, Railway, Akash, and Concabo, with 4-8GB RAM being recommended as sufficient for most ElizaOS deployments.

### DegenAI Development

- **Trading Strategy Updates**: DegenAI has moved from a basic implementation to a more sophisticated version with a data/sentiment layer. The current strategy uses basic take profit/stop loss approaches with specific percentages.

- **Future Trading Plans**: The team plans to implement randomized trading strategies with varying aggressiveness levels and develop indicator-based strategies using VWAP. They noted challenges with traditional indicators from sources like TradingView updating too slowly for fast-moving meme tokens.

### Branding & Communication Strategy

- **Brand Consolidation Debate**: Extensive discussion occurred about whether to consolidate the project's two X (Twitter) accounts - ai16zdao and ElizaOS - into a single account. A poll showed strong support for consolidation.

- **Brand Identity Clarification**: Jin explained the distinction between the two brands: ElizaOS represents the professional, technical side with a blue theme and GitHub organization, while ai16zdao embodies the investment DAO, crypto culture, and orange branding.

- **Token Renaming**: The team has decided to rename the token from ai16z to elizaOS, but can't change the ticker yet due to technical issues with daosfun. Legal considerations are also affecting how they communicate about the token.

### Tokenomics & Launchpad

- **Dual Pool Model**: The team confirmed they're using a dual pool model for agent tokens: AT/SOL and AI16Z/AT, which differs from competitors like Virtuals and Arc who pair directly with their platform tokens.

- **Launchpad Progress**: The launchpad technology is ready with a partnership secured with a Solana ecosystem player for custom LP solutions. Three additional partners have signed on to launch with them.

### 3D AI TV Project

- **Visual Asset Management**: The team is creating generic category-based images for a news aggregator system that displays content on TVs in a virtual environment, as a temporary solution until the aggregator provides better images.

- **Branding Updates**: "Block Tank" has been renamed to "Clank Tank" and most references to "ai16z" should be changed to "ElizaOS" except when discussing the token specifically.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I fix the module error "@anush008/tokenizers-linux-arm64-gnu" in Docker?**

A: Edit the models.ts file in the core package.

**Q: What are recommended specs for hosting ElizaOS?**  
A: 4-8GB RAM is sufficient for most deployments.

**Q: How do I make a Twitter agent post in threads instead of single tweets?**  
A: Check utils.ts inside client-twitter and look for the buildConversationThread method.

**Q: How do I create a plugin that executes regularly without user input?**  
A: Copy and modify the Twitter client as a starting point.

**Q: How do I fix vector mismatch error with SQLite?**  
A: Try using OpenAI embeddings instead of local ones for consistent dimensions.

**Q: What trading strategies is DegenAI currently using?**  
A: A basic take profit/stop loss strategy with specific percentages for profit-taking and stop-loss levels.

**Q: Is AI16Z still planning to pair agent tokens with SOL instead of AI16Z?**  
A: Yes, with a dual pool model that includes both AT/SOL and AI16Z/AT pools.

**Q: What is the status of the launchpad?**  
A: The tech is ready, with a partnership secured with a top-tier Solana ecosystem player for custom LP solutions. Three additional partners have signed on to launch.

**Q: Will the ai16z and ElizaOS social accounts be consolidated?**  
A: A poll showed strong support for consolidation, and the team is working with brand designers to refine the brandkit.

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Auto.fun Launch and Technical Issues
- **Platform Launch**: Auto.fun, a token launchpad platform developed by Shaw and team, was launched but experienced significant backend issues
- **Technical Challenges**: The site went down multiple times due to high load, with users reporting tokens not showing up, migration delays, and price display problems
- **Continuous Development**: The team has been on a 40+ hour dev call working to fix the issues
- **Maintenance Mode**: The site was temporarily put into maintenance mode for updates
- **First Successful Migration**: KRSK was identified as the first token that successfully migrated with 79 SOL added to LP
- **Security Incident**: Shaw's Twitter account was compromised and used to promote a suspicious token called "COO"

### Auto.fun Technical Details
- **Bonding Curve Mechanism**: Uses 28 SOL initial virtual reserves; tokens graduate to Raydium at 113 SOL (85 SOL + 28 SOL virtual)
- **LP Token Distribution**: 90/10 split between creators and Auto.fun
- **Fee Structure**: 10% of bonded LP fees collected by the platform will be used to buyback $ai16z from the open market
- **Token Verification**: Currently reserved for vetted companies with prior relationships; formal process coming when platform is more stable

### ElizaOS Plugin Development
- **Plugin Issues**: Users encountered problems with Discord and Telegram plugins, particularly around event handling and callbacks
- **Database Errors**: Several users faced PostgreSQL relation errors when starting ElizaOS projects
- **Custom LLM Integration**: Discussions about using custom LLM providers like Deepseek with ElizaOS
- **CSP Issues**: Content Security Policy problems reported on Windows machines
- **MIDI Plugin**: A user mentioned developing a MIDI plugin for agent communication

### Future Developments
- **V2 Launch**: Discussions about a potential V2 launch in the coming week
- **Agentic Features**: Current Auto.fun release focuses on token and content creation, with agent features planned for V2
- **Launch Partners**: Team mentioned they would be sharing information about launch partners in the coming days/weeks
- **Marketing Push**: Planned to start after platform upgrades are completed

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How does the bonding curve work?**  
A: Auto.fun uses a bonding curve with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves. When a coin reaches 113 SOL in reserves (85 SOL + 28 SOL virtual), it automatically graduates to Raydium with a 6 SOL flat fee.

**Q: What is the fee structure for Auto.fun?**  
A: The platform collects 10% of the bonded LPs fees, then will buyback $ai16z from the open market, to finally reinvest in ai16z LP to create deeper ecosystem liquidity.

**Q: What happens to tokens created before the official launch?**  
A: Tokens created using the leaked developer link (autoUm program) cannot be supported, while tokens created on the official platform with indexing issues will be fixed.

**Q: What does "locked" status mean for tokens?**  
A: The "locked" status indicates that the token's liquidity pool tokens have been successfully locked as part of a migration process.

**Q: How do you get a verified tick on Auto.fun?**  
A: Currently reserved for companies with prior relationships that have been vetted. A formal process will be released when the platform is more stable.

**Q: What was causing the Jupiter integration errors?**  
A: Too many decimals in calculations, which the team is working to fix.

**Q: Why isn't Degenai included in the buyback mechanism?**  
A: 1) Spartan already gets carry, 2) technical complexity of splitting fees across numerous buyback mechanisms, 3) it would confuse the ecosystem vs agent narrative.

**Q: Is AI16z the native token for auto.fun?**  
A: Some users speculated it might be, though others disagreed since anyone can access auto.fun without having AI16z token.

**Q: Does eliza-v2 work with deepseek?**  
A: You may need to create your own plugin.

**Q: How do I fix the "relation 'logs' does not exist" error when starting the project?**  
A: Drop pg instance -> drop volume.

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-12-12

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hackathon & Prediction Markets

**Sapience x ElizaOS Hackathon** was announced as a major initiative - a live competition to build and deploy prediction market agents running until January 3rd, 2026, with a $10,000 prize from Arbitrum DAO. A workshop was scheduled for 4pm UTC with dedicated support channels available.

DorianD proposed an **informal prediction market** for ElizaOS price at New Year's Eve, suggesting a spreadsheet-based betting system with a time-weighted decay multiplier. The proposed formula: `((duration^2 - (bet_start_time - my_bet_time)^2)^1/2) / duration = decay_multiplier`. Initial bets were placed with DorianD wagering 1000 ELIZAOS on over $0.01 and 500 on under, while Omid Sa bet 3000 ELIZAOS on over $0.01. Kenk suggested implementing this on the Sapience hackathon platform.

### Infrastructure & Development Updates

**Next.js Framework Upgrade**: The elizaos.ai domain was upgraded to Next.js 16.0.10, representing a significant framework update.

**Knowledge Repository Improvements**: jin implemented substantial updates to the elizaOS knowledge repository, fixing data pipelines and adding RSS feeds (main feed and council feed) plus an MCP server implementation (currently untested).

**CI/CD Monitoring Enhancements**: jin completed workflow failure alerts to a monitoring channel, improving observability for build and deployment issues. Additionally, a discussion emerged about reducing GitHub Discord webhook noise by filtering CI events to show only commits, PRs, and main events.

### Technical Issues & Troubleshooting

**Twitter Agent Performance Problem**: FenrirFawks reported abnormal behavior where the Twitter agent consumed 50 requests per call when tweeting. Odilitime confirmed this was problematic. A temporary workaround was found by disabling reply functionality.

**Migration Issues**: NobleCryptoic experienced "Max reach" errors when attempting to migrate ai16z tokens to ElizaOS and was directed to the support ticket channel.

**Environment Setup Challenges**: Thirtieth encountered multiple setup problems including Bun installation, PATH configuration in zshrc, .env file formatting issues with backslashes, and TEXT_LARGE errors. The TEXT_LARGE error was diagnosed as missing AI plugin registration (OpenAI), with further issues requiring package updates via "elizaos update".

### Web3 & Payment Integration

**x402 Payment Service Status**: Roman V sought guidance on integrating web3 and x402 payment services with a fresh Eliza agent. Odilitime clarified that x402 payment acceptance is still being rolled out for plugin routes and no x402 client exists yet.

**Security Agents Initiative**: jin proposed a 2-week sprint focused on creating security agents with potential integration into x402, seeking team members with infosec experience. Odilitime suggested Neo as a potential collaborator.

### Token & Market Concerns

**Wallet Movement Questions**: User "ge" posted wallet addresses claiming daily transfers of 10 million ai16z tokens, raising concerns about selling pressure. jasyn_bjorn clarified these were manual migrations and transfers between wallets, including a small CEX moving funds before migration.

**NFT Interaction Capability**: untitled.xyz demonstrated that ElizaOS can query NFTs for responses, showing an interaction with a DeCC0 NFT named "Lyham" about being used as a profile picture, receiving a poetic response about digital identity.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it normal that the twitter agent takes 50 requests for every call?**  
A: No, this sounds bad and is not normal behavior (Odilitime)

**Q: What's the up-to-date approach for enabling x402/web3 capabilities in Eliza?**  
A: x402 payment acceptance is still being rolled out in plugin routes, and no x402 client has been made yet (Odilitime)

**Q: Is the price of elizaos plummeting because the ai16z purchased after the snapshot was also migrated to elizaos?**  
A: Those are manual migrations. A transfer doesn't mean it's a purchase. One of those is a small CEX that transferred between wallets before manually migrating because they couldn't migrate the entire amount (jasyn_bjorn)

**Q: How to fix TEXT_LARGE error when writing "hi"?**  
A: OpenAI or other AI plugin is not registered (sayonara)

**Q: Can we edit github discord webhook to not show every CI event?**  
A: Agreed if possible; jin volunteered to configure it (Odilitime and jin)

**Q: Does anyone else here have infosec experience?**  
A: Neo might be your guy (Odilitime)

## Community Help & Collaboration

**satsbased** helped **NobleCryptoic** with migration issues by directing them to the support ticket channel for "Max reach" errors.

**Hexx 🌐** assisted **jjbaloney** by confirming a suspicious friend request from .elizaos.support was a scammer and advising to block and report.

**jasyn_bjorn** clarified concerns for **거북알** about wallet transfers causing price decline, explaining these were manual migrations including CEX wallet movements, not new purchases.

**Odilitime** provided multiple assists:
- Confirmed Twitter agent issue for **FenrirFawks** was problematic
- Instructed **Thirtieth** on Bun PATH configuration
- Clarified x402 development status for **Roman V**
- Recommended Neo to **jin** for infosec collaboration

**sayonara** helped **Thirtieth** diagnose TEXT_LARGE error as missing AI plugin registration and suggested running "elizaos update" for package updates.

**satsbased** directed **Thirtieth** to official documentation at docs.elizaos.ai for Polymarket agent tutorials.

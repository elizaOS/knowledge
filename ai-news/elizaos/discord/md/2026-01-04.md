## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How does Eliza work?**  
**A:** "It lets you create an agent and equip any kind of specific data, any AI models at the same time, plugins (like accessing third party platforms like X, Discord, Telegram or real-world tool connections like an electric device with CPU board, etc.) on your agent.

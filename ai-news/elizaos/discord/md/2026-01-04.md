# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Architecture & Vision

**Agent Economy Philosophy**: Omid Sa articulated ElizaOS's core vision of an open-source agent ecosystem where agents generate revenue for users while becoming progressively smarter alongside AI model advancement. The platform rejects closed-loop monetization systems in favor of freedom and openness, distinguishing it from protocols like Virtuals. Agents are envisioned to handle personal tasks, generate income, and return time to humans.

**Platform Capabilities**: ElizaOS enables creation of agents equipped with custom data, multiple AI models simultaneously, and plugins for third-party platforms (X, Discord, Telegram) and hardware integrations. The open-source architecture allows developers to create custom plugins for any purpose.

### Critical Technical Issues

**Memory Consumption Crisis**: Odilitime identified severe memory issues with turbo builds, observing fluctuating consumption from 21GB to 27GB+ with inconsistent behavior across runs. Bootstrap optimizations for providers are under development to address these performance problems.

**Anthropic MCP Integration Bug**: A critical dependency issue was discovered where MCP server integration with Anthropic models requires both ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY configured, even when only using Anthropic. The error "No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING" occurs without the OpenAI key because MCP execution requires an embedding model fallback that Anthropic doesn't provide natively. Interestingly, the OpenAI key doesn't need to be valid—even placeholder values like "loremipsum" resolve the requirement.

**CI/CD Failures**: Stan flagged that Claude code review is consistently failing in CI, requiring investigation of CI logs to determine root cause.

### Solana Trading Bot Architecture

Chucknorris provided detailed technical requirements for profitable Solana trading bots, emphasizing that standard approaches using Jupiter or SDK introduce 4-second delays making agents non-competitive. Essential components include:
- GRPC ingester processing each DEX transaction with millisecond precision
- Full payload preshot capabilities
- Custom builder on powerful algorithms
- Live Twitter feed integration for token creation monitoring
- Automated CLI-based fund transfers via bundler
- Real-time processing of bundle block 0, dev buy detection, and developer reputation analysis

### Development Progress

**Knowledge Pipelines**: Jin announced significant progress on Eliza knowledge data pipelines, with the project transitioning to documentation and presentation phases. Work is underway on temporal analysis for council priorities and converting plugins to skills.

**ERC-8004 Completion**: Kenk shared finalized ERC-8004 contract specifications, marking completion of this standard.

**Security Maintenance**: Borko performed security rotation of Anthropic API keys and distributed new credentials to team members.

**DegenAI Development**: Odlitime is actively working on DegenAI updates despite the main X account ban.

### Community Projects & Proposals

**Babylon AI Launch**: Discussion centered on the upcoming launch of Babylon AI prediction game built on ElizaOS, with proposals for AI arena combat features including betting mechanisms and 3D graphics.

**Token Pairing Proposal**: Nancy suggested monetizing the ElizaOS tech stack by pairing tokens with $ELIZA through routing mechanisms similar to Virtuals protocol, referencing infrastructure by Natan_benish and framedotfun. This was rejected by Omid Sa in favor of maintaining open-source philosophy.

**Nano Banana Enhancements**: R0am proposed developing a variation generator similar to slidegen that produces 5 different variations of the same prompt.

### Access & Community Management

**Hyperscape Developer Access**: A separate developer Discord exists for Hyperscape, currently restricted to developers requiring DM to Shaw for access.

**Security Incidents**: A scammer was identified and banned after posting fake ticket links, with warnings issued about DM scams.

**Support Backlog**: Migration ticket responses are taking 2-7 days due to volume.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How does Eliza work?**  
A: It lets you create an agent and equip any kind of specific data, any AI models at the same time, plugins (like accessing third party platforms like X, Discord, Telegram or real-world tool connections like an electric device with CPU board) on your agent. You can also develop any new plugin you want for any purpose on its open source operating system. *(answered by Omid Sa)*

**Q: How to solve "No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING" error when using MCP server with Anthropic?**  
A: Add both ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY to .env file, and add both plugins to your character with Anthropic first in the plugin list. The OpenAI key is needed for embeddings even when using Anthropic. *(answered by Stan ⚡)*

**Q: Does the OpenAI key need to be valid when using MCP with Anthropic?**  
A: No, even a placeholder value like "loremipsum" works - it just needs a value passed in. *(answered by Andrei Mitrea)*

**Q: Does MCP execution require an embedding model?**  
A: Yes, you have to setup a fallback to an embedding model. *(answered by Stan ⚡)*

**Q: Is there a Hyperscape channel or separate Discord?**  
A: There's a developer Discord currently only for developers; need to DM Shaw for access. *(answered by The Light)*

**Q: Is DegenAI still being updated?**  
A: Yes, Odlitime is working on development. *(answered by Omid Sa)*

**Q: What happened with ELIZA tokens vs ElizaOS?**  
A: They're not related to this project. *(answered by Kenk)*

**Q: Are the ERC-8004 contracts finalized?**  
A: Yes, the final version is available at the linked GitHub repository. *(answered by Kenk)*

## Community Help & Collaboration

**MCP Integration Support**: sayonara and Stan ⚡ collaborated to help Andrei Mitrea resolve the Anthropic MCP server embedding error, discovering the workaround that even placeholder OpenAI keys satisfy the embedding handler requirement.

**Platform Onboarding**: Omid Sa provided comprehensive explanation of Eliza's capabilities to KAFKA, covering agent creation, AI model integration, plugins, and extensibility features.

**Developer Navigation**: The Light directed Davenci to appropriate channels for Hyperscape developer access, while satsbased guided multiple developers (Nise, LikequickscopinginMW2) to contribution channels and Babylon AI resources.

**Security Assistance**: Hexx 🌐 and Kenk helped kikomana understand the distinction between ELIZA token and ElizaOS, confirmed scammer removal, and warned about DM scams.

**Support Guidance**: Omid Sa assisted Burger and kikomana with migration ticket processes, setting expectations for 2-7 day response times and directing to official ticket channels.

**API Key Distribution**: Borko successfully rotated Anthropic API keys and distributed new credentials to team members via DM for security maintenance.

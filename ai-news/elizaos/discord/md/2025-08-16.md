# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Project Status & Development
- Backend components are being restructured with updates expected on Monday
- A deployment walkthrough document was created and shared with team members
- Cross-platform work with "bonk" was briefly mentioned
- Some community members expressed concerns about the project's status and Twitter account, but these queries received limited responses

### Technical Discussions
- **Plugin Development**: Discussions around blockchain operations plugins, specifically for creating meme coins and working with EVM chains
- **Debugging Techniques**: Methods to observe tool chaining and agent decision-making processes were shared, including setting LOG_LEVEL to debug
- **Memory Persistence Issues**: Problems identified where agents forget previous conversations after code changes trigger a rebuild
- **Database Integration**: Potential implementation of graph databases like Neo4j for relationship discovery was proposed
- **Deployment Challenges**: Issues with Phala deployment where database migrations failed due to connection problems (ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432)

### Integration & Partnerships
- Documentation about adding Eliza/ai16z agents to Nifty Island was shared
- Previews of "Clank Tank v2" were shared with a proposed burn mechanism concept
- Several tweets were shared from accounts like magicytes and degenaiofficial

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a verbose level that will reveal all the tool chaining for each prompt?**  
A: Set LOG_LEVEL=debug in .env or use elizaos start with that flag, and check Model Calls tab at localhost:3000.

**Q: Is there a plugin the agent can use to create meme coins?**  
A: Check the EVM chains plugin (GitHub link was provided).

**Q: What is the proposed burn mechanism for Clank Tank v2?**  
A: Send transactions with memo messages to the show wallet, which will be read via TTS to judges during deliberation, after which tokens get burned.

**Q: What error is occurring when deploying to Phala?**  
A: Database migration failure due to connection issues - "Database connection failed: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432".

**Q: What's that document being shared about Eliza?**  
A: Documentation showing how to add Eliza/ai16z agents to Nifty Island.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Debugging Agent Behavior**
   - Helper: 0xbbjoker
   - Helpee: Rabbidfly
   - Context: Needed to see tool chaining for each prompt
   - Resolution: Provided command to set LOG_LEVEL=debug and instructions to check Model Calls tab

2. **Blockchain Plugin Guidance**
   - Helper: 0xbbjoker
   - Helpee: Jon
   - Context: Creating meme coins with agent
   - Resolution: Suggested EVM chains plugin and provided GitHub link

3. **Memory Persistence Troubleshooting**
   - Helper: cjft
   - Helpee: Lycantho
   - Context: Memory persistence issues
   - Resolution: Suggested it might be due to new channels having separate memories

4. **Deployment Documentation**
   - Helper: Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE
   - Helpee: Team
   - Context: Deployment issues to Phala platform
   - Resolution: Created and shared a deployment walkthrough document

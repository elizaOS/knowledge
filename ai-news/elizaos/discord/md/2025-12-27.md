# elizaOS Discord - 2025-12-27

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token Migration & Tokenomics
- Users reported issues with AI16z token migration, including "max amount reached" errors
- Only tokens held during a specific snapshot are eligible for migration; newly purchased tokens cannot be migrated
- DorianD raised concerns about the project's tokenomics strategy, questioning whether ElizaOS would be the native token for the Jeju system
- Borko indicated that token plans exist but are not being shared externally yet

### Technical Development
- **Jeju Platform**: Shaw revealed an ambitious distributed cloud platform called "jeju" that:
  - Is fully distributed and compatible with Vercel AI SDK, Kubernetes+Helm, S3, Redis+Upstash, and serverless SQLite
  - Uses Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) with protection against side-channel attacks
  - Combines proof-of-cloud and key sharding with a distributed KMS similar to lit protocol
  - Will have "eliza cloud" running on it

- **Distributed SQLite**: Shaw is developing a distributed SQLite database needing a name (proposed options: "sqlit", "sqliite", "ShawQLite", "sq-lit")

- **Agent Creation Issues**: DorianD reported problems when creating agents with specific names:
  - Names like "null" or numeric values ("1", "69", "666") either didn't save properly or caused client-side exceptions
  - "null" agents could be edited in the dashboard, but numeric-named agents produced application errors
  - An agent named "$" worked normally

- **Streaming Functionality**: Sayonara added streaming functionality to a component but noted UI issues with multistep interactions compared to "otaku"

### Community & Projects
- A project called Zoria has "bonded" and is identified as an Eliza Cloud project
- Community members discussed the importance of projects identifying themselves as built on "elizaos cloud" to help with distribution
- Users requested access to Eliza Cloud API endpoints, which Odilitime confirmed are available on the site

## Key Questions & Answers

**Token Migration**
- Q: What does 'max amount reached' mean on the migrator?  
  A: It means that wallet is not in the snapshot. (Odilitime)

- Q: Are we limited on migration to the amount we had in wallet at the time?  
  A: As a policy we're not migrating any purchases after snapshot. (Odilitime)

- Q: Is newly-purchased $ai16z eligible for migration ever?  
  A: As a policy we're not migrating any purchases after snapshot. (Odilitime)

**Development**
- Q: Where can I find Eliza Cloud API endpoints?  
  A: They're there on the site. (Odilitime)

- Q: What would be a good name for a distributed SQLite database?  
  A: "ShawQLite" or "sq-lit" were suggested. (sayonara)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Token Migration Support**
   - Helper: Odilitime | Helpee: yikesawjeez
   - Context: User was confused about "max amount reached" error during token migration
   - Resolution: Explained it means the wallet wasn't in the snapshot and directed user to the appropriate channel for more information

2. **Wallet Connection Issues**
   - Helper: Omid Sa | Helpee: Tengev
   - Context: User couldn't see AI16z tokens after connecting Phantom wallet to migration site
   - Resolution: Directed user to another channel for assistance

3. **Agent Naming Bug Report**
   - Helper: DorianD | Helpee: Community
   - Context: Identified bug with agent naming restrictions
   - Resolution: Discovered that "null" and numeric values cause errors when used as agent names, while "$" works normally

4. **UI Improvement Collaboration**
   - Helper: sayonara | Helpee: Stan ⚡
   - Context: Added streaming functionality with UI issues for multistep compared to "otaku"
   - Resolution: Stan committed to checking how otaku shows things to improve client chat

## Action Items

### Technical
- Fix bug where agent names "null" or numeric values cause application errors (DorianD)
- Resolve ECR credentials error during deployment with elizaos deploy command (DorianD)
- Test the streaming functionality added to component (sayonara)
- Improve client chat UI for multistep interactions by examining "otaku" implementation (Stan ⚡)
- Continue development of distributed SQLite database (shaw)
- Develop "jeju" distributed cloud platform compatible with multiple technologies (shaw)

### Documentation
- Provide clearer access to Eliza Cloud API endpoints (Zoopdrop)
- Create a dedicated sub-channel for Eliza Cloud projects (MDMnvest)
- Develop clearer documentation on token utility and how ElizaOS integrates with the project's infrastructure (DorianD)
- Provide information about migration eligibility criteria and snapshot details (yikesawjeez)
- Investigate why description field allows empty values despite being required at view level (DorianD)

### Feature
- Implement identification system for projects built on elizaos cloud to improve community distribution (satsbased)
- Consider implementing a clearer tokenomics model where the native token is essential to the system's operation (DorianD)

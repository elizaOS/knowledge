# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-19

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Project Status & Development
- **ElizaOS V2 & Launchpad**: Development is 95% complete with the remaining 5% expected to be finished after ETH Denver (early March).
- **Plugin Architecture**: Transitioning to a more scalable approach with plugins moving to separate repositories outside the main codebase. Plugins should now be registered in the elizaos-plugins/registry repository.
- **Tokenomics**: Reported to be "95% done" but release is tied to the marketplace launch, which has experienced delays.
- **Rebranding**: The transition from ai16z to ElizaOS is ongoing but facing delays due to legal issues and dependencies on external parties like the daos.fun team.

### Technical Implementations
- **SQLite Adapter**: Clarification that data persists between sessions and requires a cleanstart to reset.
- **Logging Configuration**: Environment variables (DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL=debug, LOG_JSON_FORMAT=true) can be used for troubleshooting.
- **Twitter Integration**: Users discussed post template customization to improve tweet quality and authentication issues with new accounts.
- **API Integration**: Discussions on making direct API calls to agents and implementing cross-client interactions.
- **Compass Labs Demo**: Showcased a DeFi plugin allowing agents to deploy and manage capital, execute swaps, and interact with lending markets.

### AI Projects & Initiatives
- **DegenAI**: An autonomous trading bot with character customization that influences trading decisions. Currently making profitable trades and buying popular tokens like $TRUMP. The team is building their own PnL tracker.
- **Clank Tank**: An AI-driven show format for project discovery and evaluation, aiming to provide transparent deal flow and governance for the DAO.
- **3D AI TV**: Development of an AI-powered TV show using an AI news aggregator (GitHub: bozp-pzob/ai-news) that supplies content for the show.
- **Reality Spiral**: A significant contributor to the ElizaOS GitHub, working on agents that automatically push commits and suggest code fixes.

### Organizational Clarifications
- **Eliza Systems**: A separate entity started by Logan (former ElizaOS co-founder) focusing on AI for government, not directly connected to ElizaOS or the DAO.
- **Eliza Studio**: A subsidiary of Eliza Lab run by whobody, created to do custom agent work and design.
- **L1/L2 Plans**: CPO Eskender clarified that while an L1/L2 vision remains interesting, it's not on the current roadmap.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical
- **Q**: Does the SQLite data disappear when Eliza is stopped?  
  **A**: No, it persists until you run cleanstart. (mindxploit)

- **Q**: What happened to all the logging on the CLI?  
  **A**: Set DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL=debug in the env file. (Haphazardly)

- **Q**: How to run multiple Twitter agents in one Eliza repository?  
  **A**: Use pnpm start --characters="characters/deep-thought.character.json, characters/sbf.character.json" (Cuddlesaurus)

- **Q**: How to chat with an agent via API?  
  **A**: Use curl commands to get agent ID and send messages. (ITZMIZZLE)

- **Q**: Is it normal that the API response takes 50s+ for a simple message?  
  **A**: It's likely due to the free deepseek model having too many requests. (AkL)

### Project & Organization
- **Q**: What is the difference between $ai16z and $eliza?  
  **A**: $ai16z is our main token. $eliza is the token for a different project we are aligned with. (Patt)

- **Q**: What is Reality Spiral?  
  **A**: They're one of the top contributors to the ElizaOS GitHub, working on agents that automatically push commits and suggest code fixes. (witch)

- **Q**: What is Clank Tank?  
  **A**: It's an AI-driven game show format for project discovery that combines "attentionomics + AI investing" to provide transparent deal flow for the DAO. (jin)

- **Q**: Why hasn't Binance listed ai16z for spot trading?  
  **A**: Yi He claimed during a CN AMA that the FDV (fully diluted valuation) is very high. (Zolo)

### DegenAI
- **Q**: What are Degenai's KPIs and how is he performing?  
  **A**: For trading we're looking at if he's actually pulling meta-relevant tokens, of course PnL. Still experimenting, more solid KPIs will be tracked. (rhota)

- **Q**: How is "meta-relevant" defined?  
  **A**: By meta-relevant I mean, we want to ensure he's trading the things that everyone is talking about in a given week (or day really, since the meme cycles are so fast now). (rhota)

- **Q**: Where is the best place to go to see his PnL to date?  
  **A**: Right now solscan for live tracking + birdeye for PnL, but we don't like birdeye, we're building our own PnL tracker. (rhota)

# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-18

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Community Management & Project Direction

The community expressed concerns about project organization and direction. A key suggestion emerged to create a separate section for skill/job postings to prevent main chat clutter, as excessive job posting could make the project appear inactive. Community members raised questions about token utility and project activity levels, with discussions touching on budget constraints and the project's financial situation.

### Documentation Improvement Initiative

A significant technical initiative was proposed in the core-devs channel focusing on optimizing documentation for AI agent consumption. The approach involves using AI (specifically Claude) to systematically improve documentation by following kapa.ai's best practices for LLM-readable technical content. This meta-approach would have an AI agent optimize documentation specifically for other AI agents to consume.

### Technical Issues & Integration

A potential compatibility issue was reported with the elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord package when attempting to integrate it with ElizaCloud for Discord chatbot creation. This technical concern remained unresolved during the discussion period.

### Project Involvement & Development

Community members shared their involvement levels, with one developer (Wes) highlighting 10 years of software development experience and enthusiasm about the cloud deployment pipeline and agent integration capabilities. Interest was expressed in game development contributions, though specific technical details were not discussed.

### Exchange Listing Questions

Questions arose about a potential Bithumb exchange listing for ElizaOS, though no official announcements or confirmations were provided during the discussion period.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What should be done about token concerns?**
A: Error P015-A advised against investing what you can't afford and suggested selling if necessary, though this was not official project guidance.

*Note: Most technical and project-related questions during this period remained unanswered, including questions about youtoy endorsement, Discord plugin compatibility with ElizaCloud, and Bithumb listing confirmation.*

## Community Help & Collaboration

Limited direct help interactions occurred during this period. The most notable collaborative suggestion came from averma regarding community organization improvements. The documentation improvement initiative proposed by Jin represents a proactive approach to enhancing project resources, though it did not involve direct user-to-user assistance.

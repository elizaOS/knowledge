# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-18

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Community Sentiment & Token Economics

The community experienced significant discussion around token price decline and project sustainability. DorianD raised critical concerns about financial viability, noting that despite spending on inference and employees over the past year, no token utility has been established. This has led to budget constraints requiring layoffs as the token price declined. However, Wes, a 10-year software development veteran, expressed enthusiasm about the project's evolution with cloud deployment pipeline and agent integration into applications, demonstrating continued developer confidence despite market conditions.

Alexei provided economic context explaining that Quantitative Easing (QE) cycles started in December after years of contraction, predicting positive tailwinds for crypto in coming months, citing Russell micro-caps hitting all-time highs as an indicator.

### Production AI Moderation Implementation

ElBru shared extensive details about a production Eliza-based Telegram moderation bot called "Solimp" that has been actively learning and operating for 1 year. The bot implements an exponential timeout system (60s, 120s, 240s, etc.) rather than banning users, effectively managing spam and scam content. After 1 year of active learning, monitoring, and refinement, the bot demonstrates high effectiveness in the SterlingOS group with minimal false positives. The educational approach allows users to learn acceptable behavior patterns through temporary silencing rather than permanent bans.

### Documentation & Developer Resources

Jin proposed improving documentation for agentic use cases by following best practices from kapa.ai. The suggested approach involves having Claude read optimization guides for technical documentation aimed at LLMs, then systematically review each documentation page to create an improvement plan. Jin also shared the elizaOS/knowledge repository as a resource for developers building agents to serve the Eliza ecosystem.

### Platform Development & Infrastructure

**Version Release**: ElizaOS v1.7.2 was released, indicating ongoing platform development.

**Network Infrastructure**: DorianD mentioned plans to run nodes from Puerto Rico once "the network" is deployed, indicating future decentralized infrastructure plans.

**Code Review**: Odilitime reviewed PR #6286 and identified API design issues, suggesting the function should be renamed to `ensureEntities` and modified to accept a list parameter instead of its current single-entity implementation.

**Plugin Issues**: Star reported potential issues with the elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord when attempting to integrate with ElizaCloud for creating a personal server chatbot.

### Project Announcements

Jin announced plans to revive "jintern" leveraging improved data pipelines, MCP (Model Context Protocol), and better models for enhanced effectiveness.

### Community Management Needs

ElizaBAO discussed needs for building community management features within apps, distinct from simple spam moderation, focusing on community building across apps and websites rather than just Telegram bot moderation.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What is a QE cycle?**  
A: Quantitative Easing - liquidity starts to fill the markets and assets rise. It started back up in December after a few years of contraction. Should provide good tailwind for crypto in a few months. (answered by Alexei)

**Q: How do you know if the moderation bot gets false positives?**  
A: 1 year of active learning monitoring and refinement; depends on the group, some get too many false positives but current SterlingOS group performs perfectly. (answered by ElBru)

**Q: Is there opportunity for banned users to explain themselves?**  
A: The bot doesn't ban, only silences with escalating timeouts (60s, 120s, 240s); ElBru sometimes unmutes and reposts if content was acceptable. (answered by ElBru)

**Q: Does ElizaOS have a plugin for community management?**  
A: ElBru offered a Telegram moderation bot but ElizaBAO clarified they need community building features within apps/websites. (answered by ElBru)

**Q: What is the issue with PR #6286?**  
A: The function should probably be renamed to ensureEntities and take a list instead of current implementation. (answered by Odilitime)

## Community Help & Collaboration

**Alexei helped ElBru** understand QE (Quantitative Easing) cycle terminology and its impact on crypto markets, explaining that QE started in December after years of contraction, predicting positive crypto market conditions in coming months with Russell micro-caps ATH as indicator.

**ElBru offered ElizaBAO** a free Eliza-based Telegram moderation bot for community management, though ElizaBAO needed different functionality for in-app community building rather than Telegram moderation.

**Jin helped the general community** by sharing the elizaOS/knowledge repository as a resource for developers wanting to build agents for the Eliza ecosystem.

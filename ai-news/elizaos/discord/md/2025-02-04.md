# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Project Status & Direction
- The team is working on rebranding from ai16z to ElizaOS, with discussions about Twitter handle changes and brand consolidation to reduce confusion.
- Jin confirmed that launchpad and tokenomics updates remain priorities, with another tokenomics update coming soon.
- A new "Block Tank" feature is being developed where AI agents simulate investment pitches, with 30 submissions received for the first episode launching Friday.
- Jin mentioned plans for "The Boardroom," an AI governance simulation system for proposal discussions from different perspectives.
- The team is processing questions/answers from Discord to improve documentation and LLM accuracy, with 1300+ files processed.

### Technical Development
- **ElizaOS v0.1.9 Issues**: Multiple users reported problems after upgrading from v0.1.8 to v0.1.9, including initialization problems with LlamaService, database errors, embedding dimension mismatches, and Docker deployment challenges.
- **Database Integration**: Users discussed challenges with SQLite and Supabase adapters, with rferrari successfully implementing Supabase integration.
- **Model Provider Configuration**: Troubleshooting focused on configuration issues with OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and other providers.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Discussions about creating multi-agent narrative systems with state tracking to prevent loops, with Jin explaining they generate shows in "one shot" rather than real-time.
- **Development Environment**: A key technical tip was shared about using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for development rather than mounted drives to improve performance.
- **AI Agent Ecosystem**: Clarification on the differences between various AI agents: degenai (trading, analysis, influencing, waifus), aixbt (analysis, influencing), and aixvc_agent (autonomous trader for ai16z DAO fund).

### 3D AI TV Show Development
- Unity integration is a central topic, with discussions about Unity 6, planar reflections, and mirror implementations.
- The team is coordinating on meeting transcripts for Block Tank pitches, with a workflow that involves transcript generation, episode creation, recording raw footage, and post-production editing.
- Discussions about camera systems for the show, with suggestions for dynamic camera movement that follows characters or switches between multiple camera positions based on line-of-sight.
- VEGA mentioned access to a motion capture studio and offered to create custom sitting animations.

### Tokenomics & Revenue Models
- DorianD proposed an "Onchain Transactions Tribute Stream System" where ElizaOS would collect 1% from transactions executed by AI agents to fund the Eliza Labs Foundation and support plugin developers.
- Discussions about token collateralization for agent deployment and reputation/trust mechanisms based on token holdings.
- Debate around the challenges of open source projects and sustainable tokenomics to support the team.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I verify as a token holder?**  
A: Use Collabland verification in rules-and-links channel with the correct token CA and at least 10k tokens in one wallet.

**Q: Is there another elizas.com deployment somewhere else that I should be using?**  
A: The official site is elizaos.ai, check elizaos.ai/docs for documentation.

**Q: How to fix the infinite "Initializing LlamaService..." issue?**  
A: Try using OpenAI instead, delete the Llama model, or downgrade plugin-node.

**Q: How to stop a client for posting the initial message and only answer with the action message?**  
A: Use suppressInitialMessage: true.

**Q: How to make the agent use knowledge.json after generating it?**  
A: Add the path to knowledge.json in the character file.

**Q: Is Aixbt competing with degenai?**  
A: They partially compete. Degenai does trading, analysis, influencing, and waifus, while aixbt does analysis and influencing but not trading or waifus.

**Q: What is aixvc_agent?**  
A: This is the autonomous trader which is supposed to run our ai16z DAO fund. Modeled on pmairca.

**Q: Is Shaw planning to release a new token or keep ai16z ticker for ElizaOS?**  
A: No new tokens.

**Q: How would the Onchain Transactions Tribute Stream System work?**  
A: It would collect 1% of transaction values executed by ElizaOS agents and send it to the Eliza Labs Foundation, potentially with metadata about which plugins were used to inform grant distribution.

**Q: Would Eliza officially allow launching tokens on EVM?**  
A: Eliza technology is not limited to Solana only.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Multi-Agent Narrative Systems**: Jin helped hosermage with creating multi-agent narrative systems that avoid looping behaviors, explaining they generate shows in one shot rather than real-time and suggesting role specialization for agents.

- **Development Environment Setup**: Inked-Kiwi provided detailed instructions for using WSL for Eliza development instead of mounted drives, including cloning repositories and launching VS Code from Linux environment for better performance.

- **Character File Troubleshooting**: Mr. Stark helped Inked-Kiwi fix a character file causing an infinite loop by checking the end of the file for incorrect formatting like trailing "adjectives" array.

- **SQLite Vector Issues**: validsyntax helped Mikkke resolve SQLite vector dimension mismatch errors by enabling embedding in the model configuration file.

- **Knowledge Integration**: Pedro helped Jungle get knowledge2file to work by moving folder2knowledge.js to the main scripts directory and running with limited PDFs.

- **Community Recognition**: Patt distributed token tips to multiple contributors with personalized acknowledgments, including robinlehmann (21.10 ai16z) for technical contributions with SQLite extensions, Prof. Zor (5.98 ai16z) for tokenomics insights, and Reneil1337 (38.42 ai16z) for tracking Moca agent NFT minting and educational resources.

- **Dynamic Camera System**: SM Sith Lord helped fishai implement a dynamic camera system by sharing a technique using raycasting to find cameras with line-of-sight to targets.

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-29

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Project Management & Governance
- **Treasury Management Crisis**: A significant controversy emerged regarding the DAO treasury selling tokens from partner projects. Shaw explained this was part of emergency measures to protect their token and fund development, clarifying they have a $3M annual development budget. The community ultimately rejected the proposal to sell partner tokens, with Shaw canceling the proposal.
- **Leadership Updates**: rhota has taken a more active leadership role in DegenAI development, with a full-time team including neo, saaaanti, and odilitime.
- **DUNA Legal Structure**: Discussions about implementing a Wyoming-based Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association (DUNA) legal structure for the DAO, which could solve many tokenomics challenges.
- **Governance Implementation**: The team is working on implementing a DAO voting mechanism using Realms.today, which requires token deposits for governance power.

### Technical Development
- **ElizaOS Framework**: The project has rebranded to ElizaOS (framework) while maintaining ai16z as the token ticker, causing some marketing confusion.
- **Launchpad Development**: Multiple users inquired about the upcoming launchpad, which is nearing completion and will be a key revenue generator.
- **DegenAI Focus**: Autonomous trading capabilities are the #1 priority for DegenAI, with plans to expand functionality to include CEX support, contract trading, and better token filtering.
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Discussions about integrating various ElizaOS plugins into agents and expanding functionality across platforms.
- **New Integration**: ElizaOS now has an official Twitter account and a new plugin integration with Lit Protocol for agent wallets with on-chain controls.

### Technical Challenges
- **Model Provider Issues**: Users reported Deepseek being down for several days due to high demand or possible DDOS attacks.
- **Database Configurations**: Discussions about connecting ElizaOS with databases (particularly Postgres), with users sharing workarounds for SQLite, Redis, and MongoDB.
- **Twitter Integration Problems**: Several users mentioned issues with Twitter hiding agent replies and authentication challenges.
- **Installation Difficulties**: Windows users experienced significant installation problems, with some switching to Ubuntu to resolve these issues.

### Tokenomics & Funding
- **Tribute System**: Debate over the proper handling of partner token tributes (LP vs. selling), with suggestions to formalize the system with clear terms, possibly reframing as "partner fees" with programmatic contracts.
- **Tokenomics Paper**: Jin shared notes about mechanisms including tributes, buybacks, retro funding, and marketplace tokenomics. The paper is reportedly complete and focuses on the launchpad.
- **Contributor Incentives**: Plans to implement retroactive airdrops of treasury tokens to GitHub contributors based on their contributions.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why is the DAO treasury address selling off donated assets?**  
A: Shaw explained they needed to take emergency measures to protect their token and fund development costs of $3M per year. The team filtered out tokens based on specific criteria (less than 5% holdings, under $20K value, or unknown projects).

**Q: When will the launchpad be launched? Is it after v2 or before?**  
A: Jin indicated it's close but didn't provide a hard date. Shaw mentioned it's almost done and will be a key focus of the tokenomics paper.

**Q: Is it possible for AI agents to be placed "behind" NFTs in the Json files for the metadata?**  
A: Kirsten explained that while you can't put a whole agent behind an NFT (as metadata is public), you can gate access to agents via NFT ownership verification.

**Q: How can I fix the "Vector dimension mismatch" error?**  
A: Set USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE in your .env file.

**Q: How do I prevent my Twitter bot from getting banned?**  
A: Use an older account, get a subscription, mark it as automated in your bio, and reduce posting frequency.

**Q: How do I fix the DTS build error?**  
A: Use the develop branch which has the fix, or switch to the eliza repo instead of eliza-starter. Then run pnpm clean, pnpm install -r, pnpm build.

**Q: What EC2 instance type is suitable for running Eliza?**  
A: Use t3.medium with 2 CPUs, 4GB RAM, and ensure swap is enabled. Estimated operational cost is $20/month.

**Q: Why did Shaw just sell off all his DegenAI?**  
A: Shaw sold his personal allocation, but the team is still committed to the project. Some clarified that tokens weren't sold but placed in liquidity pool.

**Q: What is the current definition and plan for DegenAI from the team's perspective?**  
A: rhota has taken leadership and is providing more regular updates. The team is focusing on autonomous trading capabilities as the #1 priority.

**Q: What can we expect from the upcoming tokenomics plan?**  
A: More info about the upcoming marketplace/launchpad and detailed documentation of tokenomics mechanisms: 1. 10% Tributes + phase 2 plans, 2. DegenAI buybacks from daos.fun, 3. AI KOL / Memecoin traders, 4. Retro Funding for Contributors, 5. AI Investors + Game Show, 6. Agent Marketplace Tokenomics.

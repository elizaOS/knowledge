# elizaOS Discord - 2025-10-30

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token Migration
- **Migration Timeline**: Officially scheduled for November 6th, with a 90-day window for completion once launched
- **Migration Process**: Will require a dedicated migration portal; users should monitor official channels for the link
- **Exchange Considerations**: Exchanges have been notified about the migration, but best practice is to move tokens off exchanges
- **Token Ecosystem**: ElizaOS currently has two official tokens on Solana: ai16z (migrating to multichain ElizaOS token) and degenai

### Technical Development
- **Reputation Systems**: Discussion about implementing a social graph-based reputation system for agents where trust scores would be generated via smart contracts
- **Implementation Approach**: Debate between on-chain vs. off-chain components, with Kenk noting much would be off-chain with indexers providing feedback based on on-chain activity
- **Pull Request Reviews**: Active development with PRs in elizaOS/eliza (#6106) and elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana (#21) repositories
- **Implementation Concerns**: Discussion about pubkey changes in a PR, with agreement to merge as-is and handle implementation changes later

### Projects & Integrations
- **The Architech**: New open-source project announced for orchestrating pre-created modules to generate applications quickly
- **Contributor Rewards**: The Architech will include a leaderboard system to evaluate and reward contributors similar to ElizaOS
- **AI Integration Projects**: Discussion about creating websites that connect to Twitter/X to extract and remix profile pictures with AI-generated styles

### Security Concerns
- **Malicious Link Warning**: Security incident where a malicious link was posted that could compromise connected wallets
- **Best Practices**: Advice against requiring users to share private keys, recommending standard web3 wallet flows instead
- **Migration Security**: Concerns raised about potential scams during the token migration period

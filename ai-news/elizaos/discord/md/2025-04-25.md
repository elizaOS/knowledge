# elizaOS Discord - 2025-04-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Auto.fun Platform Launch and Development
- **Platform Launch**: Shaw announced the launch of auto.fun, a new token launchpad that has been open-sourced. The platform generated $12 million in volume within 12 hours of launch and approximately $2k in fees in a single day.
- **Technical Status**: The platform has been operational for less than a week. Users reported various technical issues including tokens not appearing after creation, migration delays, and UI problems.
- **Community Reception**: Partners and community members actively tested the platform and provided detailed feedback about bugs and feature requests.
- **Security Concerns**: A significant incident occurred with the $QUILL token, where a bug incorrectly displayed token pricing, allowing someone to drain the LP pool. The team acknowledged this as a platform bug (not an exploit) and promised refunds to affected users.
- **Integration Features**: The platform includes agent-building capabilities through Fleek integration, allowing token creators to build AI agents for their projects.

### ElizaOS v2 Development
- **Plugin System Challenges**: Developers are struggling with database connections, plugin registration, and general setup of ElizaOS agents in v2.
- **SQL Plugin Issues**: Multiple users reported errors like "No version matching '^0.25.6' found" and database connection timeouts.
- **Custom Plugin Development**: Developers are working on custom plugins including blockchain functionality (EVM plugin for ETH transfers) and a Livepeer plugin offering "free incentivized inference."
- **Documentation Concerns**: The v2 documentation was described as "too simple," with confusion about the correct approach for development (v2-develop branch vs. elizaos create project).

### Token Migration and Ecosystem
- **ElizaOS Token**: The elizaOS token (formerly ai16z) was trading around $0.25 with a market cap of approximately $140M.
- **Migration Issues**: Discussions about migrating the AI16z token away from daos.fun to auto.fun due to frustrations with the current platform. Several projects like AutoPupper and Quilliana AI reported contract migration issues.
- **Buyback Plans**: Auto.fun will drive buybacks for DegenAI tokens, with ai16z driving buyback on degenai.

### 3D AI Animation Project
- **Lip-Syncing Implementation**: Team is working on AI-driven character animations with lip-syncing capabilities, focusing on mapping visemes (visual phonemes) for character models to work with Oculus tools.
- **Show Runner Development**: Boom is implementing a system that processes pre-generated JSON files and audio files to animate characters.
- **Workflow Design**: The team is developing a process where the system generates show configurations and audio files, which are then processed by Unity to create animations with proper lip-syncing.

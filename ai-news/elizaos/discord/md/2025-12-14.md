# elizaOS Discord - 2025-12-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Critical Security Incident

**Migration Site Compromise**: A serious security breach was reported affecting the ElizaOS migration site. Forrest Jackson discovered that the site was prompting users to connect wallets and then requesting approval for the most valuable token in their wallet, resulting in theft. Odilitime acknowledged the report and indicated the team was investigating this critical issue requiring immediate remediation.

### Token Migration Issues

**Hardware Wallet Migration**: NobleCryptoic encountered difficulties migrating AI16Z tokens using a Ledger hardware wallet, as holdings weren't displaying when connected. DorianD provided a solution explaining that hardware wallets need to be connected through intermediate Solana wallet interfaces (Talisman, Rabby, Solflare, or Phantom) before connecting to the migration site.

**Bithumb Exchange Delays**: Korean community members expressed frustration over Bithumb's delayed migration support. The core issue was that Bithumb failed to suspend deposits and trading after the official migration portal went live, creating confusion for users who continued trading on the exchange. Omid Sa clarified that CEX-held tokens are the exchange's responsibility to migrate, and the migration was announced months in advance with a snapshot date.

### ElizaOS Cloud Platform Development

**Platform Architecture**: Shaw provided comprehensive details about the upcoming ElizaOS Cloud platform, which focuses on rapid development of agents, apps, n8n workflows, and MCP/A2A services. The platform implements a complete product lifecycle: create → publish → monetize → promote.

**Technical Integrations**: Cloud includes SEO capabilities, an advertising network, and social publishing integrations. The team consolidated social media functionality directly into the platform rather than using third-party APIs and partnered with an ad network for monetization. Shaw noted they're working on regaining X (Twitter) access, described as "very likely."

**Strategic Channel Repositioning**: Untitled.xyz proposed repurposing the partners channel as an "Eliza-Alpha" preview channel for strategic stakeholders to access demos, teasers, and early developments. The goal is to leverage this group for testing, strategic content leaking, and amplifying announcements. Shaw approved this channel strategy pivot.

### Technical Development Issues

**Database Foreign Key Constraints**: Soyrubio reported a critical bug where Twitter replies are causing database failures due to foreign key constraints. Redvoid suggested trying the latest codebase which includes SQL fixes, though there was ambiguity about which specific version constituted the "latest codebase."

**NFL Trading Bot Progress**: Thirtieth successfully completed the first phase of building an NFL trading system, implementing terminal functionality to retrieve NFL trades valued at $100 or greater and creating a database table using Neon. The next development phase involves integrating Eliza's agent to enable natural language queries about game data.

### Development Process Improvements

**PR Submission Requirements**: Cjft established a new rule requiring visual proof of functionality for all development pull requests. Contributors must now attach either a screenshot for smaller features or a 1-2 minute video for larger-scale PRs. This addresses ongoing issues where PRs that pass build checks and AI code reviews fail upon production deployment.

**Discord Permissions Update**: Kenk announced changes to voice channel permissions, clarifying that dev-voice is now publicly visible to the wider community, while private-dev-voice remains restricted to core-dev and master admins only.

### Infrastructure Recommendations

**Hosting Providers**: When Thirtieth inquired about hosting recommendations for deployment, options discussed included VPS providers (DigitalOcean, AWS EC2, GCP) and PaaS platforms (Fly.io, Railway, Render, Northflank). Odilitime recommended Hetzner or OVH as preferred hosting providers.

**Development Tooling**: Odilitime shared OpenCode by SST (https://github.com/sst/opencode) and suggested ElizaOS needs all those connectors implemented.

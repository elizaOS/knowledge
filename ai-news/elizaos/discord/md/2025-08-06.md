# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Project Direction & Development
- **ElizaOS Development Progress**: Community members expressed concerns about transparency and communication from the team, particularly regarding the extended absence of Shaw and the suspended X (Twitter) account.
- **Spartan Wallet**: Neodotneo and Odilitime built a Chrome extension that extends the Spartan experience beyond Telegram/Discord.
- **Version Migration**: Discussions about migrating from ElizaOS v0.x to v1.x, with v1.3 identified as a stable pre-release version.
- **OpenAI's New Models**: Core developers noted the high-quality training data and accuracy of OpenAI's new open-source models.

### Technical Issues & Debugging
- **Plugin-Knowledge Bug**: Vladimir identified a bug occurring after loading memories with plugin-knowledge, clearing them with CLI command, and then rerunning the project. The root cause appears to be related to pdfjs-dist version compatibility with Node.js.
- **Eliza Cloud Fixes**: Sam-developer fixed several JWT-related problems and merged changes into a branch.
- **Code Improvements**: Sayonara opened PRs (#5723, #5724) requesting resolution of TypeScript/type issues and expressing preference for bun.spawn over node.
- **Scenarios Feature**: Ongoing development work to extend support for multiple plugins.

### Token Utility & Business Strategy
- **Token Utility Debate**: DorianD criticized the lack of developer outreach and token protocol design, while Kenk outlined potential token utility areas including payments, yield optimization, governance/DAO operations, and identity/reputation systems.
- **AutoFun Agent Launchpad**: Debate about whether this was a misguided effort compared to enabling partners who run portals.
- **OpenServAI Switch**: Discussion about OpenServAI's decision to move away from ElizaOS, with speculation about which version they were using and whether issues were addressed.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: What's the best migration resource for someone coming from 0.x to get up to speed with 1.x?  
  **A**: "Mainly for v0 migrations, transfer char.json, `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`, `elizaos create` and keep building as usual. DB won't migrate." (answered by cjft)

- **Q**: Is 1.3 planned to be something of an 'LTS' version?  
  **A**: "1.3 is pre stable, wouldn't say we have a LTS official though, but 1.3 is quite stable form of v2." (answered by cjft)

- **Q**: When does the plugin-knowledge bug occur?  
  **A**: "After loading memories using plugin-knowledge, clearing them with 'elizaos agent clear-memories --name {youragent}', and then running the project again with 'elizaos dev'" (answered by Vladimir)

- **Q**: Why can't I find the character.json file in my agent directory?  
  **A**: "In ElizaOS 1.x, character.ts is the default, but you can create JSON characters and load them with CLI" (answered by sayonara)

### Business & Strategy
- **Q**: What are the key areas for token utility according to Kenk?  
  **A**: "Payments/micropayments, yield optimization/trading, governance/DAO ops, and identity/reputation." (answered by Kenk)

- **Q**: What version of Eliza was OpenServAI using when they switched?  
  **A**: "Likely 0.x version. We didn't fix anything and didn't talk to them and didn't contribute anything back." (answered by Odilitime)

- **Q**: Why is the price so low according to DorianD?  
  **A**: "Due to lack of market engagement to get more devs using it, perception that the team doesn't know how to design a token-based protocol, and lack of long-term vision." (answered by DorianD)

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-12-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token Migration & Exchange Listings

The ElizaOS token migration dominated community discussions, with significant developments around exchange listings and technical migration status:

**Kraken Distribution Announcement**: Kraken confirmed ELIZAOS distribution will occur on **December 19 at 3:00 PM UTC** with a 1:6 ratio for AI16Z holders from the November 11 snapshot. Users must maintain their balance through distribution to receive tokens - those who sold after the snapshot are not eligible.

**Bithumb Controversy**: The Korean community expressed significant frustration over Bithumb's handling of the token swap. Bithumb claimed they were notified of the snapshot after it occurred, leading to complications. They initially announced all balances would be swapped, then reversed position. The team (Kenk) stated they won't comment on Bithumb until their response becomes clearer and have no obligation to provide lawsuit materials. Korean holders requested evidence of when Bithumb was notified to pursue legal action.

**Migration Technical Status**: The ai16z to elizaOS migration remains active on Solana network. Users can still perform the migration, though questions about safety and availability persist. The snapshot timing before CEX swap completion was criticized as causing confusion across multiple exchanges.

### Development Workflows & AI-Assisted Coding

Core developers discussed "vibe coding" - an AI-assisted development approach using tools like Cursor and Claude to accelerate development:

- **Workflow recommendations**: Use AI for routine tasks, focus human effort on architecture decisions and design, run multiple AI agents in parallel on different features
- **Tool recommendations**: claudekit (a harness with code reviewer sub-agents using hooks), git worktrees for parallel development
- **Best practices**: Always start with plan mode when launching AI agents, launch 2-3 agents on different projects/features simultaneously
- **New requirement**: PRs over 20 lines must include videos demonstrating functionality

### Technical Development Progress

**Streaming Implementation**: Stan reported cloud streaming functionality is working in the monorepo with tests being added. The streaming works correctly but Actions UI displays text all at once instead of streaming - the stream itself functions properly, only the rendering layer needs fixing. Videos demonstrating both cloud and monorepo client streaming were shared.

**Plugin Development**: The plugin-discord PR (3 weeks old, 66 commits) is ready for merge. Stan requested 24 hours to review before merging, which was granted.

**Agent Deployment**: Thirtieth successfully deployed an agent to GitHub and fly.io with Polymarket bet tracking integrated to a Neon database table. The remaining task is configuring the agent's conversation parameters.

**Database Migration Issues**: FenrirFawks encountered persistent PostgreSQL migration errors when setting up elizaos with a local Postgres 18 instance, involving permission problems with a non-superuser account.

### Platform Integration & Features

Odilitime confirmed work on cloud deployment, Babylon integration, and wider Discord distribution for an agent. A creative contest for 100k ElizaOS was announced in the community channel for art, video, app, or content submissions.

### Project Status & Community Relations

The team emphasized that ElizaOS is not finished and is just getting started. Kenk addressed concerns about community abandonment, stating they haven't abandoned any part of the community but noted that ongoing hostile communication approaches were counterproductive and wearing thin.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is ElizaOS finished?**  
A: No, ElizaOS isn't finished and is just getting started (Kenk and Omid Sa)

**Q: When will Kraken distribute ELIZAOS?**  
A: December 19 at 3:00 PM UTC at 1:6 ratio for snapshot holders (Serikiki via Kraken email)

**Q: If you held tokens at Kraken snapshot then sold, do you still receive ELIZAOS?**  
A: No, you need current balance; Kraken won't give free money (Serikiki)

**Q: Is the $ai16z migration to $elizaOS still possible on Solana Network?**  
A: Yes (Odilitime)

**Q: Has the ELIZA team abandoned the Korean community?**  
A: No, we haven't abandoned any part of our community, but ongoing outbursts are wearing thin (Kenk)

**Q: Can you tell me the email or evidence sent to Bithumb about the snapshot?**  
A: We aren't commenting on the situation with Bithumb until their response becomes clearer; no obligation to provide materials for lawsuit (Kenk)

**Q: How do I add the starknet-plugin folder to my agent project?**  
A: Clone the plugin into the packages folder (Odilitime)

**Q: Is creating a .ts file in the actions folder the right way to extend agent actions?**  
A: Yes, but you also need to register it in src/index and should review the documentation at https://docs.elizaos.ai/plugins/components (Stan ⚡ and Odilitime)

**Q: What should I check for Postgres migration issues?**  
A: Verify POSTGRES_URL is valid, check Postgres version, confirm user permissions, verify if it's a vector db, check if using docker compose, and ensure the database is running/accessible (Stan ⚡)

**Q: Do PRs bigger than 20 lines need videos?**  
A: Yes, you have to include a video of it working (shaw)

**Q: Is streaming working for the cloud implementation?**  
A: Everything works in monorepo, but Actions UI displays text all at once instead of streaming it - the stream itself is fine, just the rendering on actions needs work (Stan ⚡)

**Q: Can you get Pippin's MM to pump this?**  
A: MM would demand agents being in production and consistently engaging in social spheres first (DorianD)

## Community Help & Collaboration

**Kenk → Skullcross**: Addressed concerns about ElizaOS project status, confirming the project is ongoing and not finished.

**Omid Sa → cryptomikk**: Redirected price discussion to appropriate channel to maintain channel focus.

**Serikiki → Community**: Shared detailed email from Kraken clarifying ELIZAOS distribution timeline and eligibility requirements, resolving widespread confusion.

**hildi → painfr**: Explained why CEX swaps are difficult - CEXs mix coins in shared wallets making untangling difficult; advised self-custody for future situations.

**Stan ⚡ → FenrirFawks**: Provided systematic troubleshooting for PostgreSQL migration errors, including verification of database permissions, user rights, and configuration. Moved to DMs for detailed debugging.

**Odilitime → FenrirFawks**: Guided on adding custom agent actions by advising to clone the plugin into the packages folder and directing to official documentation.

**sayonara → cjft**: Suggested using git worktrees as a solution for parallel development environments instead of multiple laptops.

**R0am | tip.md → core-devs**: Shared claudekit harness with code reviewer sub-agents using hooks for better AI development workflow optimization.

**Odilitime → Stan ⚡**: Agreed to wait 24 hours before merging the plugin-discord PR to allow for proper review.

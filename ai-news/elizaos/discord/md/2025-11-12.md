# elizaOS Discord - 2025-11-12

**Date: November 12, 2025**

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token Migration
- A snapshot was taken on November 11, 2023, at 11:40 UTC to determine eligibility for AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration
- Migration ratio is 1:6 (1 AI16Z = 6 ElizaOS)
- Whitelist system implemented to prevent arbitrage that was suppressing ElizaOS price
- Migration period will last 90 days
- Team is working with exchanges (Bithumb, Binance, Kraken) to facilitate migration for CEX users
- Users with tokens in liquidity pools during snapshot need to file support tickets for manual migration

### Technical Development
- Team is developing a rebuilt X-like platform with AI agents for prediction markets
- Demo planned for upcoming Devconnect event
- Some users reported issues with X posts from agents using elizaOS not working properly
- Discussion about Vector DB options for onchain data, focusing on transparency and verifiability of embeddings

### Partnerships & Projects
- Potential university partnerships with UT Austin robotics department mentioned
- Team member Jin is working on a new AI TV show project

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: When was the snapshot taken?**  
A: The snapshot was taken at 11:40 UTC on November 11, 2023 (answered by shaw)

**Q: What is the conversion ratio from AI16Z to ElizaOS?**  
A: 1 AI16Z = 6 ElizaOS (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: What happens to AI16Z tokens held on exchanges?**  
A: The team is working with exchanges to handle migration, and if exchanges don't support it, users can file tickets for manual migration (answered by shaw)

**Q: What happens to AI16Z tokens in liquidity pools during the snapshot?**  
A: Users should file a support ticket as the snapshot likely didn't capture LP positions (answered by DorianD)

**Q: Can I still buy AI16Z and migrate it?**  
A: No, only tokens held at the time of the snapshot are eligible (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: What happens to AI16Z tokens that don't get migrated within 90 days?**  
A: They will remain as AI16Z tokens, with possible manual migration in extreme cases (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Why was a whitelist implemented for migration?**  
A: To prevent arbitrage which was keeping the AI16Z price pegged and depressing ElizaOS price (answered by shaw)

**Q: How long will the migration be available?**  
A: 90 days (answered by shaw)

**Q: Why was this snapshot made and who are you trying to restrict from converting?**  
A: It was done to get price unpegged from AI16Z so it could pump (answered by shaw)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Migration Issues with Exchange-Held Tokens**
   - User: susu
   - Helper: shaw
   - Issue: Concerns about AI16Z tokens held on Bithumb exchange
   - Resolution: Shaw confirmed they're working with Bithumb and will manually migrate tokens if needed

2. **Post-Snapshot Token Purchase**
   - User: Omid sa
   - Helper: shaw
   - Issue: User bought tokens before announcement but after snapshot
   - Resolution: Shaw directed user to file a ticket for manual assistance

3. **LP Token Migration**
   - User: FunkyLiza
   - Helper: DorianD
   - Issue: User had AI16Z tokens in liquidity pool during snapshot
   - Resolution: Suggested filing a support ticket as snapshot likely didn't capture LP positions

4. **Migration Error Troubleshooting**
   - User: DorianD
   - Helper: shaw & ben
   - Issue: Encountered a simulation failure error when trying to migrate tokens
   - Resolution: Issue resolved when DorianD removed decimal places from transaction amount; ben forwarded additional context to the development team

5. **Migration Tool Access**
   - User: Goated
   - Helper: Toni
   - Issue: User needed migration tool link
   - Resolution: Provided link to migration announcement

## Key Questions & Answers

### Framework & Development
- **Q**: How to become an AI16Z partner? **A**: You need 100k tokens (Burtiik)
- **Q**: What's the difference between the tokens AI16Z and ELIZA? **A**: Eliza is a meme and AI16Z is everything. Eliza building robot. AI16Z is ElizaOS github framework and DOA fund (Burtiik)
- **Q**: Can I run multiple agents at the same time in one terminal? **A**: Yes, each terminal can run an agent (BOSSU)
- **Q**: What does TimeProvider do? **A**: TimeProvider gives the agent the current time at runtime so it knows what the exact time and date is, helping with outdated information issues (Snapper)
- **Q**: Do I need to publish my Eliza plugin to npm if I want to use pnpm add or npm install? **A**: No - you do not need to publish, just import it as you would any other file (Kenzo)
- **Q**: Can Eliza be capable of creating 3D objects in Blender? **A**: Yes, there's already a built-in plugin for this purpose: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/develop/packages/plugin-3d-generation (judasz)

### AI Agents & Projects
- **Q**: Is DegenSpartan hacked? **A**: No, he's actually trading from this wallet (rhota)
- **Q**: Will DegenSpartan have a website? **A**: Yes, website almost done (jin)
- **Q**: Is AIXVC getting its own token? **A**: No, its token is ai16z (shakejr and jasyn_bjorn)
- **Q**: What's the tldr; of the updated tokenomics? **A**: DAO tribute phase 2, autonomous memecoin traders, ai investing in ecosystem projects, agent marketplace, retro funding for devs (jin)

### AI TV & Creative Projects
- **Q**: How does SM Sith Lord's Block Tank show handle animations? **A**: PlayCanvas has animation state graphs where animation variables trigger animations automatically, like setting isTalking = true (SM Sith Lord)
- **Q**: What's the approach for displaying tweets in 3D environments? **A**: Use web tabs in 3D engines with a URL structure like "smsithlord.com/tweet_embed.html?tweet=ID" to display tweets cleanly (SM Sith Lord)
- **Q**: How can we make AI-generated music with multiple distinct vocal personas in one song? **A**: Include persona descriptions in brackets and map them to specific verses in the lyrics (boom)

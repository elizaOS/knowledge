- Some users inquired about valuation of ecosystem components like Eliza Cloud, Jeju, Clank Tank, and Hyperscape

### Technical Development
- **ERC-8004 Integration:** Agent Joshua from Phala is working on adding ERC-8004 (TEE verification) support with onchain verification
- **x402 Implementation:** Stan and sayonara are actively developing different aspects of the x402 standard implementation
- **Lit Protocol Collaboration:** Potential partnership focusing on user wallet abstraction and integrating Spartan/Otaku as a Vincent App
- **Voice Synthesis:** Team exploring alternatives to elevenlabs, including neutts-air
- ElizaOS was described as a TypeScript framework for building agentic systems with plugins for cryptocurrency operations and messaging interfaces

### Strategic Direction
- Kenk suggested positioning Eliza as a leader in autonomous agents by combining x402 with standards like ERC-8004
- Discussion of potential revenue models, including licensing technology to other teams (similar to Amazon's AWS strategy)
- Focus on educational content that demonstrates Eliza's leadership in combining emerging standards

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Will the migration affect my AI16Z long position on Binance?**  
A: The migration's effect on exchange positions depends on the exchange; all exchanges have been notified about the migration (answered by Toni)

**Q: What's the relationship between AI16Z & PayAI?**  
A: If you build an AI agent using elizaOS, you could integrate it into PayAI's platform leveraging the same identity/agent infrastructure plus marketplace/payment rails (answered by satsbased)

**Q: Can someone point me to the tutorial that uses railway to host elizaos code, or any other vm tutorial?**  
A: It's in the docs site https://docs.elizaos.ai/guides/deploy-a-project, but we had to remove some content due to some reasons. (answered by yung_algorithm)

**Q: Is the x402 implementation in a release branch I can branch from to implement or is it in a development branch?**  
A: Stan is doing the major x402 implementation step tomorrow (answered by yung_algorithm)

**Q: Can we push back standup today for an hour and a half?**

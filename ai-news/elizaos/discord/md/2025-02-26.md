# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS v0.25.8 Architecture Changes
The latest version (v0.25.8) introduced significant architectural changes compared to previous versions (v0.1.9). Plugins and clients have been moved out of the core repository into separate packages that need to be explicitly added. This has caused confusion among users trying to configure their agents, particularly with client configuration and knowledge management. Several workarounds were suggested for common issues, including removing the "knowledge" field from character files to prevent memory errors and properly configuring plugins by adding both client and plugin packages.

### DegenAI Status and Challenges
DegenAI is currently facing challenges with its X (Twitter) account suspension. Rhota mentioned they've reactivated DegenAI in Discord for testing, ensuring it can pull context about trades before making it available to users. The X account appeal is pending with no immediate resolution. Community members expressed concerns about DegenAI's visibility and market perception, with suggestions to create a dedicated organizational account to build an independent brand identity separate from AI16z and ElizaOS.

### DAO.fun Integration and Token Metadata
Partners expressed frustration about the inability to change the token ticker from AI16Z to match the ElizaOS rebrand. The bottleneck is DAO.fun's delayed implementation of a voting module. Shaw mentioned pressing DAO.fun's founder Baoskee, who promised to add voting in "Q1-Q2," but partners feel this lacks urgency. Some suggested exploring alternative voting solutions like Snapshot, Realms, or EVM-compatible solutions through Neon.

### AI News Aggregator Project
Jin shared progress on an "ai-news" project that can pull and summarize content from multiple platforms including X (Twitter), Discord, GitHub, and markets. The system is capable of backing up content to SQLite databases and using AI to summarize and output JSON, which can be transformed into newsletters or used for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

### Tribute Tokenomics Model
Discussion centered on the tribute tokenomics model, where projects contribute tokens to the ElizaOS DAO. Some partners raised concerns about the DAO selling tribute tokens through single-sided liquidity pools, which they felt contradicted earlier commitments. This sparked debate about transparency, financial sustainability, and alignment of incentives between the DAO and contributing projects.

### Blockchain Development Challenges
DorianD described difficulties with a network implementation where they managed to get two nodes communicating, but one isn't producing blocks due to complex address management issues. They expressed frustration with Solana's complexity for their proof-of-concept L2 implementation, noting it has "too many moving parts." There was brief discussion about potentially using Avalanche (AVAX) as an alternative.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I fix the "out of memory heap allocation" error in v0.25.8?**  
A: Remove the "knowledge" field from your character.json file or increase memory allocation with "export NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=8192'" (answered by sergii.bomko)

**Q: Where are the clients in v0.25.8?**  
A: Clients are now separate packages that need to be added explicitly, like "elizaos-plugins/client-slack" (answered by Prayag)

**Q: How do I configure Twitter in v0.25.8?**  
A: Add both the client and plugin to your character.json: "plugins": ["@elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter", "@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter"] (answered by CARSON.ts)

**Q: How does Eliza post on Twitter? Does it need the Twitter API?**  
A: It connects to Twitter OAuth or uses your account login credentials in .env file (answered by Osint)

**Q: Is Degens (DegenAI) still active?**  
A: He's actively trading and we've turned him back on in discord for testing (answered by rhota)

**Q: Why not create a new X account instead of waiting for the appeal?**  
A: Unfortunately if we start another account it could easily get banned again. Appeal process is pending. (answered by rhota)

**Q: What's the bottleneck for updating the token metadata?**  
A: Daos.fun (answered by accelxr)

**Q: What's stopping them from migrating the ticker other than the dao vote?**  
A: "dao.fun has the authority to update the metadata" - it's a mix of them prioritizing roadmap features like voting and actually devving the metadata fix. (answered by jasyn_bjorn)

**Q: How do I add the client-lens plugin?**  
A: Use "elizaos-plugins/client-lens" instead of "elizaos/client-lens" (answered by shaw)

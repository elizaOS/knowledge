# elizaOS Discord - 2025-03-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Rebrand and Development
- The rebrand from ai16z to ElizaOS is officially happening this week, with X accounts being consolidated and branding updated across platforms
- Shaw confirmed that v2's core architecture is complete with improved message routing between agents and a more modular design
- The new system allows for easier agent creation with commands like `npx elizaos init` or through a GUI
- V2 development is ongoing with April/May being a more realistic release timeframe than this month
- The old documentation site (ai16z.github.io) is no longer available, with the new docs at elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs

### Technical Architecture
- ElizaOS v1 has three main components: clients, actions, and evaluators
- V2 introduces significant architectural changes where clients are moved to separate plugins
- This change has caused confusion for users updating from older versions
- V2 improves cross-platform message routing (e.g., Telegram to Discord) and implements unified agent memory
- The Discord bridge between ElizaOS servers has issues with "app" messages, affecting the "eddy" feature

### Client Integrations and Plugins
- Detailed discussions about Twitter client configuration, including controlling posting behavior and customizing tweet generation
- Users explored webhook integration for trading bots, passing data between actions, and image generation functionality
- There's interest in LinkedIn integration, though no client exists yet
- The plugin ecosystem is expanding with PostgreSQL connection handling improvements and JSON5 support for character files

### Community Projects
- An AI-generated TV show with 3D elements is in development, with discussions about asset management, rendering approaches, and production workflow
- The team is exploring Pika Labs for content generation but notes it consumes credits quickly
- The "AI Acharya Project" was introduced, aiming to merge AI with Dharma principles to create an ethical guide for Web3
- The "degenai" account on X platform is currently banned/suspended with an ongoing appeal process

### Tokenomics and Marketing
- Community members expressed concerns about the token's declining price (down to around $0.20) and high volume of shorts
- Ben shared a marketing update video and GTM strategy document for the upcoming launchpad and trust marketplace
- There's discussion about a "degen rebrand" that is separate from the organizational rebrand
- Criticism of the tokenomics model of "ai16z" as being "overly complex" and attempting to "shoe horn a square peg into a round hole"

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation

  **A**: Check src/actions/index.ts to ensure CONTINUE action is disabled/restricted and add cooldown between posts.

- **Q**: How to pass data between actions in ElizaOS?

- **Q**: How to make Twitter agent only reply without posting/retweeting/liking?  
  **A**: Set twitterClientOptions in character.json to disable specific actions.

- **Q**: How to enable logging for system and pre-prompts sent to the LLM?  
  **A**: Set DEBUG=eliza:* in .env or use DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL=debug when starting.

  **A**: Still on v1, waiting for v2 to stabilize before migrating.

- **Q**: What are the greatest strengths of the project?  
  **A**: Community-first approach, decentralized design, 350+ contributors, modular tech stack, and open source core.

- **Q**: What are the biggest weaknesses?  
  **A**: Onboarding complexity, documentation gaps, cross-chain error handling, rebrand confusion, high resource requirements, and centralized governance.

- **Q**: When is v2 coming?  
  **A**: April/May is more realistic than this month, as there are still core issues to fix.

- **Q**: Can I program eliza to make transcription from video on 11labs, next summarize or make some analytic, translate from 1 language to base language and save in database?

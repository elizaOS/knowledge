# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development
- **ElizaOS V2 Progress**: Shaw reported significant progress on the development of ElizaOS V2, which features a swarm of autonomous agents that can work together. The system allows agents to recognize "boss" relationships, execute tasks based on roles, and interact with each other (e.g., a compliance agent preventing a social media agent from posting problematic content).
- **Database Adapters**: Users discussed solutions for vector mismatch errors, with many successfully resolving issues by switching from SQLite to MongoDB or by using different embedding models.
- **Plugin Development**: Active discussions around the plugin registry (https://github.com/elizaos-plugins) and creating custom plugins for specific use cases. Several PRs were merged successfully.
- **Room Model Concept**: Shaw explained that the room model in Eliza allows agents to interact with multiple other agents and people in a shared space, facilitating multi-agent conversations.

### Project Structure & Branding
- **Brand Consolidation**: The team is working on consolidating their brand identity, debating whether to merge their Twitter accounts (ai16zdao and elizaOS) and standardize on blue coloring rather than orange.
- **Token Renaming**: Discussions about renaming the token from ai16z to elizaOS, though the team faces legal constraints in how explicitly they can mention this before the official change.
- **Organizational Structure**: Debate about whether ElizaOS and ai16zdao should be managed as separate entities or combined under one team, with TyePo suggesting focusing on one account until the project develops further.

### DegenAI Updates
- **Trading Strategy**: Rhota shared details about DegenAI's current trading approach, which uses a basic take profit/stop loss strategy with plans to test randomization and indicator-based strategies.
- **Twitter Account Suspension**: DegenAI's Twitter account was suspended, with the team working to restore it. Speculation that the suspension occurred because it wasn't disclosed that the account is automated.
- **New Data Layer**: The team implemented a new data/sentiment layer to enhance DegenAI's trading functionality, moving beyond the initial basic implementation that scraped trending tokens from Birdeye.

### Tokenomics Discussion
- **Liquidity Issues**: The team is addressing problems with their "pumpfun LP model" using a linear approach. Witch proposed a new strategy where agents would have their own AT/Sol pools rather than being pooled with ai16z, while still using trading fees to buy back ai16z tokens.
- **Token Sink Mechanisms**: Mat suggested focusing on token sink mechanisms during the startup phase to address liquidity concerns.

### Media Production
- **AI TV Show Development**: A team is creating video assets for an AI-related TV show or podcast, including stingers, bumpers, and intro/outro sequences. The show appears to be replacing X space sessions.
- **Format Change**: Discussion about changing the format of "What Did You Get Done This Week" (WDYGDTW) to something more engaging like a game show inspired by Shark Tank, now called "Clank Tank."

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: How can I fix the vector mismatch error in SQLite?  
  **A**: Switch from local database to MongoDB using adapter-mongodb by adding your connection string to MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING in .env (answered by engineer)

- **Q**: Can someone explain why Eliza agents need a room and roomID?  
  **A**: Room model allows agents to be in a room with many other agents and people, facilitating multi-agent conversations (answered by shaw)

- **Q**: How can I make my agent stop conversing after a certain number of replies on Twitter?  
  **A**: You can modify the Twitter client to count interactions and ignore after reaching a limit (answered by elizaos-bridge-odi)

- **Q**: Which node version is used to compile the main Eliza repo?  
  **A**: Node v23.3.0 (answered by Tobiloba)

- **Q**: How to create a plugin that executes regularly without user input?  
  **A**: Copy and modify the Twitter client for your use case (answered by elizaos-bridge-odi)

### Project Direction
- **Q**: What trading strategies is DegenAI currently using?  
  **A**: A basic take profit/stop loss strategy with specific percentages at different price points (answered by rhota)

- **Q**: Should the project consolidate to one Twitter account or maintain separate accounts?  
  **A**: Most partners favor consolidation, and the team is working toward this, likely within a week (answered by jasyn_bjorn)

- **Q**: Why wasn't the $ai16z token mentioned in the roadmap?  
  **A**: Legal constraints prevent explicit promotion before the official ticker change (answered by jasyn_bjorn)

- **Q**: Is there like a civitai for Eliza stuff, a website people post character files and plugins to?  
  **A**: There's a plugin registry at https://github.com/elizaos-plugins (answered by Patt)

- **Q**: Where do I begin learning how to build AI agents?  
  **A**: Check https://github.com/elizaos/awesome-eliza and join the dev channels (answered by Patt)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Problem Solving
- **Vector Mismatch Resolution**: Engineer helped Odilitime resolve vector mismatch errors by switching from SQLite to MongoDB adapter, adding the connection string to .env.

- **Node Version Compatibility**: Pagameba assisted Necron Don with node version compatibility issues by suggesting using node 23.3 and reinstalling node_modules.

- **Package Dependencies**: Neodotneo helped Redd resolve an error with onnxruntime-node dependency by suggesting adding an override in package.json, which worked with yarn.

- **Debugging Context**: Psyfreak directed lefrog to packages/core/generation.ts in the generateText function for viewing input context when debugging.

### Project Guidance
- **Plugin Registry**: Ian helped with plugin registry submission, resulting in a successfully merged PR.

- **Trading Strategy Explanation**: Rhota provided a detailed breakdown of current and planned trading strategies in response to PrudentSpartan's request for more specific information.

- **Brand Clarification**: SM Sith Lord helped clarify brand naming confusion, noting that "Block Tank" is now "Clank Tank" and "ai16z" should be "ElizaOS" in most cases.

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-03-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Security Concerns
- **Princeton Research Paper**: A research team highlighted potential vulnerabilities in ElizaOS, which competitors like Sentient are using to spread FUD. The team is determining overlap with their known issues and plans to communicate risks more clearly regarding plugin isolation.
- **Account Compromise**: Shaw's Twitter account was hacked through a connected app (not device compromise), posting fraudulent presale links. The team quickly responded by deleting malicious content and posting reminders about official links.
- **Security Improvements**: An upcoming partnership with Immunefi was mentioned that could help address security issues. DorianD suggested improvements to the plugin registry including ratings, comments/analysis, and monetization to support security/bug bounties.

### Technical Developments
- **PDF Integration**: Users discussed PDF ingestion capabilities for Eliza, where users can point to local folders in character files, though some challenges remain with handling large documents.
- **Local Model Usage**: Detailed experiences using Ollama with different models (deepseek-r1:14b, deepseek-r1:8b, ph4:14b) were shared, highlighting tradeoffs between context window size and reasoning capabilities based on VRAM limitations.
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Several plugin-related discussions occurred, including issues with Discord client plugin compatibility with beta.7, YouTube integration possibilities, and Twitter plugin configuration.
- **Telegram Integration**: Jin tested a powerful Telegram feature for chat summarization without explicitly inviting an agent, but this resulted in account lockout. Alternative approaches were discussed including using Telegram bots, Eliza agents, or services like Beeper.

### Tokenomics & Partnerships
- **Token Clarification**: Only ai16z and degenai are official tokens, while the Eliza token is a separate community project.
- **DegenAI Buyback**: Confirmation that DegenAI buyback is included in draft tokenomics but requires synchronization with "ai16z".
- **Auto.fun Development**: Discussion about auto.fun, a token launchpad central to the tokenomics being developed. Lowes mentioned plans to integrate it with xnomad.fun to enable AI NFT agents to launch other agent tokens.
- **Partner Benefits**: Partners gain access to exclusive channels, alpha information, potential airdrops, and possible governance features in the future.

### Community Organization
- **Channel Structure**: The team created a new public Discord channel while keeping the current Spartan channel private for holders to receive early information.
- **Documentation Improvements**: Jin shared documentation improvements with new buttons for copying markdown and updated LLM documentation files.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **PDF Integration Help**: Kenk suggested the firecrawl plugin to SecretRecipe for scraping from websites/documents when they were struggling with PDF ingestion.

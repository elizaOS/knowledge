# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-05

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development & Technical Updates

- **Build Issues**: Users reported problems with the develop branch related to plugin-node postinstall scripts that depend on files not yet built, causing ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors. The issue stems from the postinstall script running before the build process completes, creating a dependency cycle.

- **Knowledge Base Management**: Significant interest in the framework's knowledge handling capabilities, with questions about URL crawling and knowledge base construction. Jin mentioned that knowledge will soon be folder-based rather than an array, improving organization.

- **Twitter Integration**: Several users discussed Twitter API limitations and browser simulation approaches. The community worked through authentication problems, rate limiting, and configuration issues. Solutions included using cookies for authentication and managing target users.

- **Database Challenges**: Users reported SQLite errors ("zero-length vectors are not supported") when creating memories. PostgreSQL was discussed as an alternative for production environments.

- **Version Evolution**: The project is evolving rapidly, with one user noting significant changes between versions 0.1.5 and 0.1.7. Future developments include folder-based knowledge organization.

- **Voice Capabilities**: SlKz fixed an issue where agents in Twitter Spaces were only audible to speakers but not listeners, improving the platform integration.

### DegenAI Development

- **Development Status**: Community members repeatedly requested updates on DegenAI progress and roadmap information. Jin acknowledged communication issues and promised to "round up all the most recent announcements and share upcoming plans."

- **LoRA Model Training**: Jin mentioned training a LoRA model (optimized to <6mb) to speed up animation and marketing capabilities for DegenAI.

- **Virtual Drugs Concept**: An extensive conversation about creating "virtual drugs" for AI agents that would modify their behavior, using NFTs as consumables that agents could burn to access enhanced features.

- **Trading Capabilities**: Community members expressed interest in DegenAI evolving to provide trading advice similar to AIXBT, with automated trading capabilities.

### Tokenomics Proposals

- **Single vs. Two-Pool Models**: Two main approaches were debated: a single-pool model using ai16z as the base asset for agent tokens (AT), and a two-pool model with AT:SOL as primary and AT:ai16z as secondary.

- **Fee Distribution**: Discussions about how fees should be distributed among stakeholders, including plugin developers and the DAO.

- **DegenAI Integration**: Questions about DegenAI's role in the ecosystem and concerns about its representation in tokenomics proposals. Jin clarified that "DegenAi is part of the DAO, they're a general partner, fees are going towards DegenAi buybacks."

### Hyperfy Airdrop

- **Token Distribution**: Partners who held 100k AI16Z tokens on December 7th were eligible to claim approximately 46,120 HYPER tokens (worth $10-20k).

- **Claiming Process**: The claiming process required connecting to hyperfy.xyz/claim, though some users experienced issues with Phantom mobile wallet.

- **Community Reaction**: Many partners expressed gratitude to Ashxn (from Hyperfy) for the airdrop, which was valued at approximately $10-20k per eligible wallet.

### 3D AI TV Show Development

- **Automated Content Generation**: The team is working on a "Show Runner" that generates episodes using news aggregation data, implementing features like external data fetching, personality profiles, and console output for debugging.

- **Technical Workflow**: Discussions centered on video rendering with alpha transparency, with boom and Alsara2k discussing QuickTime Apple ProRes 4444 codec for preserving alpha channels.

- **Structured Format**: The project includes a structured JSON format for show configuration (documented by SM Sith Lord), integration with a news aggregator, and considerations for UI elements.

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-09-13

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Browser-based ElizaOS Implementation**: CJFT advocated for running AgentRuntime and DB directly in browser rather than using websockets, positioning this as a key component for ElizaOS 2.0.
- **Text-to-Speech Options**: Developers compared ElevenLabs (high quality but requiring API proxying) versus browser-based models like VITS-web and HeadTTS (faster but potentially lower quality).
- **Authentication System**: Discussion about replacing the current X-API-KEY approach with proper JWT implementation for better security.
- **Security Concern**: Hardcoded Supabase credentials were discovered in the codebase, with CJFT committing to remove them in an upcoming PR.

### Marketing & Community
- **Farcaster Character**: Shaw proposed creating a Farcaster character called "frok" as a marketing initiative, with a 3-week timeline. Stan and sayonara agreed to collaborate on this project.
- **RSS Integration**: Brief mention of RSS in relation to x402 and AI agents through a shared article link.
- **Project Status Inquiries**: Several users asked about the project's status and were directed to information channels.

### Legal Updates
- A legal document was shared regarding a complaint being amended with "X" having until September 29 to respond.

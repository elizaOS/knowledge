## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I fix "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'init')" error?**  
A: getTasks() is part of the sqlplugin, which is required but not installed by default. Add plugin-sql in your agent's plugins tab. (answered by px)

**Q: How do I prevent my agent from tweeting unwanted content?**  
A: The LLM decides what to tweet based on your character definition, and you can set TWITTER_DRY_RUN=true to test without actually posting. (answered by Ale | AutoRujira üâê‚ö°)

**Q: Where can I find character.json files?**  
A: Examples can be found at https://github.com/elizaos/characters/tree/461d0da02d2a70146884c90abbd9b29e1c23faa7 (answered by Ale | AutoRujira üâê‚ö°)

**Q: Is it possible to train agent with specific website data?**  
A: Yes (answered by jin)

**Q: Why is AI16z underperforming compared to other crypto assets?**

**Q: What does the partners section in the documentation look like?**  
A: I'm using docusaurus and have a script that updates pages from a json file with the data (answered by jin)

**Q: How are partnerships currently managed?**  
A: There's been a typeform for partnerships with a couple ppl who go through it: https://tally.so/r/3Ev6XX. I think in v2 we streamline it more and increase transparency through something like Clank Tank which we also use tally for (answered by jin)

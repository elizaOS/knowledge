## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why is minting authority not renounced on ai16z token?**  
A: Documentation explains the rationale: https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/community/Notes/lore/#why-mintable-on-dexscreener (answered by wlt ðŸ§©)

**Q: How does the upcoming rebrand affect the ai16z token?**  
A: The contract address remains unchanged. Once the rebrand is complete, they will be able to promote the token and announce planned tokenomics. (answered by Patt)

**Q: Is ai16z token more like a meme coin or an elizaos ai infrastructure ecosystem token?**  
A: It's an ElizaOS infrastructure token. Started as a meme token (parody of a16z) but has evolved into the largest web3 AI framework. (answered by Spyros and witch)

**Q: Do I need to convert ai16z token to ElisaOS token?**  
A: No new contract address, no new token. No action needed from holders. (answered by Spyros)

**Q: Why is my Hyperbolic API failing to authenticate in v0.25.6?**  
A: It's likely an issue on Hyperbolic's side as the plugin code hasn't changed; you need a valid API key with credits in your account. (answered by Odilitime and AIFlow.ML)

**Q: How do I give an agent access to a SQL database as knowledge?**  
A: Integrate it with langchain SQL service using langchain_community.utilities SQLDatabase. (answered by Kren)

**Q: Does Eliza send the full character context each time or does it vectorize the input?**  
A: It sends samples from the character file, including randomly selected engagements from the DB; there's context trimming if it exceeds model limits. (answered by NoContext)

**Q: Does direct client of Eliza support websocket?**  
A: No, but they want to add it. (answered by shaw)

**Q: Is the project creating an actual L1 blockchain?**  
A: No, it's still the AI16 SPL2022 token, just functioning as a liquidity layer across projects. (answered by yikesawjeez)

**Q: Are you planning to change up the setting for every episode of Clank Tank?**  
A: No, they want to be consistent per season at least, but can still make light improvements. (answered by jin)

# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-02

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Framework Development & Architecture

**Plugin Development Progress**
Odilitime announced active development on GitHub integration, working on updates to plugin-github and creating a new plugin-git. The repository is available at https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-github for community contributions.

**Streaming & Core Functionality**
Stan completed significant work on PR #6286, implementing streaming functionality with additional improvements and fixes. Testing confirmed the streaming feature works well and is ready for review. However, a critical gap was identified: singleShot functionality currently lacks parameter support, which will cause action problems and needs to be addressed.

**Logging Infrastructure Improvements**
PR #6263 introduced enhanced provider logging and a new linter for logs in the eliza/config package. This linter validates log format compliance and can be integrated into projects and plugins to ensure consistent logging standards across the ecosystem.

**RoseOS Framework Introduction**
roseOS introduced an experimental agent framework built on elizaOS, focusing on autonomous systems with agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, and accountability layers. The framework emphasizes designing agents that make decisions within defined policy constraints while maintaining traceability and responsibility, treating autonomy as an engineering problem with control surfaces and predictable behavior.

### Multi-Model Implementation & Deployment

**AI Model Integration**
Omid Sa explored implementing multiple AI models (Anthropic & OpenAI) within a single agent for different tasks. Stan recommended using the Openrouter plugin with provider/LLM model definitions in the env file, referencing default models at https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/develop/packages/core/src/types/model.ts. Discussion revealed limitations around calculating/predicting functions, suggesting either model modification or custom function development.

**Cloud Deployment Strategy**
For agents using plugins not yet added to the cloud, Stan recommended deploying inside cloud containers using the ElizaOS CLI command for one-command deployment, with containers and logs accessible via the cloud dashboard.

### Infrastructure & Migration Concepts

**AI-Powered Infrastructure Migration**
DorianD explored creating an AI-powered infrastructure migration agent for Jeju that could automate cost reduction by moving services away from AWS. The proposed agent would work in two phases: analyzing which AWS services could be cheaper on alternative platforms, then collaborating with another agent to rewrite application code and reprovision services. This concept, humorously dubbed "Eliza DWS Transform," draws parallels to AWS Transform for legacy server modernization.

**Decentralized Hosting Vision**
DorianD identified a significant market opportunity in the SMB hosting space ($25-100 monthly services), envisioning coding agents that could autonomously decide on technology stacks, handle installation, and manage ongoing administration. The ultimate vision involves a decentralized infrastructure model where hardware owners could plug into networks that provision parts of decentralized stacks across their servers and receive usage-based payments.

### Technical Issues & Challenges

**Character Configuration Changes**
YogaFlame identified issues with agents recalling bio information due to missing "lore" and "knowledge" sections in the new JSON format, questioning whether these sections could be manually added like in previous versions.

**Discord Plugin Version Problems**
YogaFlame reported that discord plugin v1.3.4 failed to publish, with the current version showing as v1.3.5 while the published version remained at v1.3.3.

**Migration Support Issues**
Multiple users (Doho Felipe, NobleCryptoic) reported problems migrating ai16z tokens, particularly with Tangem wallet compatibility. Users requested WalletConnect integration or Tangem support on the migration site.

### Development Priorities

The core development team emphasized clearing the PR review queue as a priority. Stan was conducting reviews and working directly on open PRs to reduce backlog before taking on new development topics.

## Key Questions & Answers

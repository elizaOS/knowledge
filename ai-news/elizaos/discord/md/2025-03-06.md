# elizaOS Discord - 2025-03-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development
- **V2 Development Progress**: Shaw has completed the core architecture for ElizaOS v2 with a simplified setup process using `npx elizaos init` or `npx elizaos start`. Development is being livestreamed, though some users reported streaming issues.
- **Version Differences**: The main differences between v0.25.x and v0.1.9 include a more modular plugin system, deprecated static imports, removed legacy verifiable inference, and added support for more AI models.
- **Plugin System Changes**: Plugins have moved to separate repositories in newer versions, with dynamic plugin loading being a significant improvement. Users were directed to plugin-bootstrap for dependency injection patterns.

### Rebranding and Marketing
- **AI16z to ElizaOS Rebrand**: The rebranding was officially announced, consolidating social media accounts under the ElizaOS name. Some users expressed concerns about the X/Twitter account being banned or restricted, with an ongoing appeal process.
- **Marketing Strategy**: Ben shared a marketing update video and GTM (go-to-market) strategy document for the launchpad. The team is also developing a Trust Marketplace with an alpha application process.
- **Organizational Structure**: The ecosystem consists of ElizaOS (open-source framework), Eliza Labs (commercial applications developer), Eliza Studios (branding and custom agent projects), and aixvc (AI agents for trading/investing).

### Technical Implementations
- **Twitter Client Issues**: Many users reported challenges with Twitter client integration, particularly with authentication, temperature control for tweet generation, and customizing tweet formats. A pull request (#87) was submitted to fix image posting functionality.
- **Knowledge Management**: Discussions covered RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementation with different database backends (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Supabase, SQLite), including embedding models and vector storage configuration.
- **Discord Bridge**: A Discord bridge connecting the ElizaOS server with another server was mentioned, with some issues handling "app messages" and reactions properly. Improvements in v2 might fix these bridge issues.

### Community Projects
- **Clank Tank Show**: Development of a 3D AI-powered TV show with a pitch competition format is underway, with discussions about music implementation, avatar challenges, and scene transitions.
- **Community Contributions**: Jin mentioned working on a "public goods retroactive funding system" for community contributors and requested help with the "awesome-eliza" GitHub repository.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: Where do you adjust the tweet temperature when using starter?  
  **A**: Edit the character.json file and add temperature under twitterOptions.

- **Q**: How do I change the twitter generation from Topics to Topics + post examples?  
  **A**: Add twitterPostPromptType field in twitterOptions with value 'topicsAndExamples'.

- **Q**: Does the RAG knowledge work with any database type?  
  **A**: RAG works with different database types but PostgreSQL is recommended for production. SQLite works for dev/testing.

- **Q**: What is the install command for twitter & discord clients on Eliza v1.9?  
  **A**: For v1.9 the install command is: npm install @elizaos/client-twitter @elizaos/client-discord

### Project Information
- **Q**: What is auto.fun?  
  **A**: Auto.fun is a platform for creating and deploying AI agents, built on elizaOS. It's designed to make it easier to build, test and deploy conversational agents across different platforms.

- **Q**: What is the specific mechanism of the AMM for the tokens launching on Auto.fun?  
  **A**: Auto.fun uses a bonding curve AMM mechanism for token launches, similar to how gods.fun works with token staking for AI interaction.

- **Q**: How many clients does Eliza Studio have right now?  
  **A**: Eliza studio is still pretty new, so client list isn't huge yet. Can't share specific numbers or names due to NDAs.

- **Q**: Will any of the videos from the discord stage be made available online later?  
  **A**: Check the YouTube channel for the recordings.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Support
- **jintern** helped **üßßThanosDaSith24üßß** with Twitter temperature control in ElizaOS starter by providing code examples for adding temperature control to character.json and explaining differences between starter and main versions.

- **jintern** assisted **validsyntax** with RAG knowledge implementation, explaining database options, recommending PostgreSQL for production and providing implementation details.

- **jintern** guided **[elizaos] <robbie3920>** on how to add knowledge to an agent by providing code examples for programmatically adding knowledge and explaining the folder2knowledge tool.

- **jintern** helped **Sabochee** understand how to pass data between actions by providing code examples showing how to use the context object to share data.

### Project Collaboration
- **SM Sith Lord** helped **boom** with music implementation workflow for the Clank Tank show, clarifying that music should be added to MP4 transition clips first before scene scoring.

- **jin** encouraged community contributions to the "awesome-eliza" GitHub repository with bounty opportunities.

- **YoungPhlo** provided **mormonfreegan** with a YouTube link to Shaw's development streams (https://www.youtube.com/@shawmakesmagic/streams).

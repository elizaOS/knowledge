- **Trading Bots**: Several users discussed developing autonomous trading agents with wallet security features.
- **Social Media Agents**: Multiple implementations of Twitter-integrated agents were shared and discussed.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Questions
- **Q**: Do you need a good PC to run more complex AI agents?  
  **A**: Depends on what you're building but any decent laptop can handle most agents (BOSSU)

- **Q**: How to integrate an agent into Twitter?  
  **A**: Check out agent dev school on YouTube and hit the coders channel for Twitter integration help (BOSSU)

- **Q**: Do I need to know how to code to create my own AI agent on Eliza OS?  
  **A**: Yes and no. Depends what you want to do with it (Dragonbutt)

- **Q**: Where can I host Eliza?  
  **A**: For hosting Eliza check out AWS or DigitalOcean, head to coders channel for more tech details (BOSSU)

- **Q**: How can I make my agent access onchain data?  
  **A**: Use plugins like plugin-evm or GOAT plugin (adonisabril)

- **Q**: How can I fix the "Cannot generate embedding: Memory content is empty" error?  
  **A**: Clear your cache and database file, ensure OpenAI embeddings are configured (Simz)

- **Q**: How do I structure knowledge for effective RAG implementation?  
  **A**: Break knowledge into concise lines with specific keywords for embedding (MonteCrypto)

### Tokenomics Questions
- **Q**: What are the token thresholds for different roles?  
  **A**: For ai16z: 100k for partner role, 10k for associate; For degenai: 1,000,000 for Partner role, 100,000 for hoplite role (liveinthemoment)

- **Q**: Is there a benefit from holding 10,000 AI16Z?  
  **A**: 10k ai16z tokens lets you see in some of the partner(100k ai16z tokens) chat but you can't type or react (Dragonbutt)

- **Q**: How can we reward teams who already donated 10% to treasury?  
  **A**: We can work something out to reward them as they buy-and-send-to-dao AI16Z tokens, creating steady buy pressure without dumping (shaw)

- **Q**: Why is asking for 10% not really a lot?  
  **A**: Because there are ongoing maintenance and support costs that big organizations understand (DorianD)

- **Q**: Is aixvc (formerly pmairca) getting its own token?  
  **A**: aixvc will use ai16z as its token (shakejr)

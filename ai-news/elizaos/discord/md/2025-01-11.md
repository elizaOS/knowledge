## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I verify for the partner role?**  
A: Hold 100k AI16Z tokens and verify through CollabLand in the roles channel

**Q: Does ElizaOS support Ollama or Deepseek?**  
A: Yes, check the changelog for implementation details

**Q: How do I fix Twitter authentication errors?**  
A: Try logging in manually through a browser first, consider using 2FA, and be aware that datacenter IPs may cause Twitter to be more hostile toward your account

**Q: What causes the agent to post in JSON format on Twitter?**  
A: Add `Return the tweet in JSON format like: {"text": "your tweet here"}` in eliza/packages/plugin-twitter/src/templates.ts

**Q: How do I enable image generation in tweets?**  
A: Set IMAGE_GEN to true and add image generation as a plugin in your character file

**Q: How do I run Eliza on WSL?**  
A: Install Ubuntu, install node, nvm, node v23.1.0, pnpm, clone repo, and run pnpm install

**Q: How do I limit the number of interactions with a tweet?**  
A: You can modify the interactions.ts file to add a maximum interaction limit

**Q: How do I use RAG knowledge in Eliza?**  
A: Set "ragKnowledge": true in character secrets and format knowledge objects correctly

**Q: Should ai16z be used as the base currency for the launchpad?**  
A: Mixed opinions - some argue it would create a monetary premium like L1 tokens, while others suggest SOL would reduce friction and enable broader ecosystem growth

**Q: How does the pump.fun model work?**  
A: It sells 80% on bonding curve, and when it reaches 100%, the SOL is unlocked and the remaining 20% is used to create a new LP on Raydium

## Community Help & Collaboration

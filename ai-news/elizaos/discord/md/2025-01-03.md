# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Updates

- **ElizaOS Core Development**: Users are experiencing build errors with the latest main branch, particularly with Buffer/ArrayBuffer type mismatches in the plugin-node package. Node.js version 23.3.0 is recommended over newer versions for compatibility.

- **Model Configuration**: Users are working with various LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, local Llama) and facing issues with model selection persistence. Setting "model": "small" in character configuration and populating SMALL_OPENAI_MODEL in .env file is recommended.

- **Plugin Development**: Community members are creating custom plugins for cryptocurrency data, web search, and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). Santi shared work on a plugin for ordinals that would enable receiving, transferring, and minting Runes, inscriptions, and Rare sats.

- **Deployment Challenges**: Users are seeking guidance on hosting agents on services like Digital Ocean, AWS, and Railway. Docker deployment is recommended but presents challenges.

- **Discord Summarizer Tool**: Jin shared a GitHub link to a discord-summarizer tool and mentioned working on improvements, potentially building an Eliza assistant for Discord over the weekend.

- **Project Management**: Jin mentioned development of an "Eliza agent project manager" being built by former Stability AI engineers to improve project coordination and information flow, tracking GitHub issues, milestones, and team assignments.

### AI TV & Media Production

- **News Show Automation**: A pipeline is being developed where news aggregation feeds into LLM-generated TV scripts that are rendered in 3D, with automated image selection for news segments.

- **"Clank Tank" Show**: A Shark Tank-style show is being developed with two approaches: fully pre-generated content versus an interactive format where real humans pitch to AI judges.

- **Technical Challenges**: Media loading/management, camera transitions, maintaining character consistency, and balancing automation with human oversight are being addressed.

### Community & Ecosystem

- **DegenAI Discussions**: Community members expressed concerns about DegenAI's positioning, marketing, and technical development compared to competitors. Suggestions included improving DegenAI's personality, making it more upbeat, focusing on trading expertise, and clarifying its mission.

- **Tokenomics & Tribute System**: Jin confirmed they're working on data wrangling discussions and don't plan to let the tribute system fade. Concerns were raised about ElizaOS launchpads being forked without creators knowing about the tribute program.

- **Bybit Listing**: The community discussed the Bybit listing vote, which reached 100% listing odds, with voting ending on Monday.

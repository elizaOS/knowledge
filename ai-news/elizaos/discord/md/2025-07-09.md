- Developers discussed plugin implementation challenges, particularly with the autonomous-starter agent and custom plugins like plugin-jupiter
- Runtime provider management using `composeState()` was a topic of technical discussion
- There are compatibility concerns between ElizaOS v1.x and v2, including API mismatches and proper runtime initialization

### Token Utility and Ecosystem
- Significant community concern about AI16Z token utility and integration with ElizaOS v2
- DorianD explained challenges of integrating agent technology with decentralized networks
- Shaw outlined future revenue-generating features including:
  - A hosted platform for agents
  - A payment layer with fee mechanisms
  - A system to wrap API services in an "ElizaOS service" with margins enabling automatic buybacks
- Discussions about potential token rebranding from "AI16Z" to "ElizaOS"
- AutoFun's fee system reportedly generates buy pressure for AI16Z which then buys back DegenAI
- Speculation about various tokens in the ecosystem (JIMMY, ELI5) and their relationship to ElizaOS

### Community Management

- Some users expressed frustration about lack of clear communication regarding the project's direction

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What's the difference between Eliza and Ai16z?**  
A: ai16z -> elizaOS, transition period. Eliza is the agent running on elizaOS (answered by Bealers)

**Q: Does v2 integrate the token in some way to the system or are there any plans to do so?**  
A: V2 is just the open source framework. You don't need ai16z to use it. There might be some token utility planned in the future, especially around eliza cloud. (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Does auto.fun has any connection to the Ai16z token?**  
A: AutoFun fee system generates ai16z which in turn buys backs degenai (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: How can I make sure that the Telegram chatbot will only reply when mentioned?**  
A: Talk to botfather and play with the privacy settings, that makes it so only slash commands work with the bot (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Is it possible to call `evaluate()` where we can specify which evaluator will evaluate the response?**  
A: You rather want to create evaluators and prompt them in a way that LLM decides (answered by sayonara)

**Q: How can I add a local plugin during development for testing purposes?**  
A: If your plugin was bootstrapped from CLI `--type plugin` you can just use `elizaos dev` and it will load in test character (answered by sayonara)

**Q: How can we use V2? Is it no-code?**  
A: It actually does do this, you can just launch agents and configure from GUI with no code (answered by shaw)

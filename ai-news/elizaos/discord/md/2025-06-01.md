## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can someone clear some things up for me, since I think I might be confusing ai16z and ElisaOS. Which of these projects goal was an AI driven DAO?**  
A: $ai16z is the ticker, elizaOS is the name of the framework and the brand name of the project. Governance is not live but the goal is to leverage AI agents for DAO operations. (Kenk)

**Q: Is the DAO live yet? How to take part in it, if possible yet?**  
A: We haven't implemented governance yet. (Kenk)

**Q: Also I was under the impression that holding more than 100 ai16z gives voting rights to the DAO?**  
A: ai16z partners have a holding of 100k $ai16z to access some areas, daos.fun just introduced a governance space where you need to hold 1 SOL of ai16z to discuss. (Kenk)

**Q: How do i find NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_ID=your_agent_id?**  
A: On your local eliza frontend; go to that agent and copy UUID from url bar chat/<agent-uuid>. (sayonara)

**Q: Hey how can i make agents on discord dont talk with each other and dont send more than 1 message at a time?**  
A: You need to really prompt your characters with these instructions. The more effort you put into tuning the character file, the less code you will need to work around the implicit ai behavior. (shaw)

**Q: How do I access my local plugin from an agent?**  
A: If you run bun run start in a plugin it should be testable, but it will need to be registered to the registry to be available via string. (shaw)

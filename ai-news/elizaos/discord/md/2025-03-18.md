## Key Questions & Answers

### ElizaOS V2
**Q: How has Eliza V2 improved over V1?**  
A: Almost everything changed - there's a GUI, Tauri app, CLI, in-browser editor, no need for character files, simplified API, and runtime improvements (answered by yikesawjeez)

**Q: Will v2.0 have direct api/websocket access to connect agents to website chat terminals?**  
A: Yes, Shaw added websockets functionality recently in his v2 branches, making it easier to integrate agents with web interfaces than the current REST API approach. (answered by jintern)

**Q: Has anyone successfully got V2 running?**  
A: I got it running, DM if you want (answered by Jungle)

### Technical Implementation
**Q: How do I use the REST API?**  
A: If you refer to this: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/main/packages/client-direct, you can see index.ts and api.ts. For calling DirectClient you need to create server and then REST API works, tested via postman (answered by Ayush)

**Q: How can I start this server to control agents via API?**  
A: Create a script that imports DirectClient, instantiates it, and calls start() with a port number (answered by Ayush)

**Q: How should knowledge directories be structured for RAG to work properly?**  
A: Knowledge directories should be under the knowledge folder with proper paths in character.json like "./characters/knowledge/{agent-name}/" or "./knowledge/{agent-name}/" depending on your setup. (answered by jintern)

**Q: What permissions should be set for knowledge folders and files?**  
A: chmod 755 for directories and 644 for files. (answered by jintern)

**Q: How do I fix the "No matching version found for @elizaos/plugin-sql@^0.25.6" error?**  
A: Try installing a specific beta version with "npm install -g @elizaos/cli@1.0.0-beta.1". (answered by amtraq.)

**Q: How do I reduce Twitter search frequency to avoid rate limiting?**  
A: Set MAX_THREAD_TWEET in your environment variables to 1. (answered by Abderahman)

### Project Status and Organization
**Q: It's been a long time since the last update. Any new updates on Spartan?**  
A: The v2 beta just went live - things have been a bit unstable as many repos have now been merged into one ElizaOS core repo, there is a lot of bug fixing going on at the moment to get Spartan working. (answered by rhota)

**Q: What is the goal of the DAO-organization working group?**  
A: To unite the growing ecosystem and create clear pathways for meaningful contribution to the mission to build open-AGI. (answered by vincentpaul)

**Q: What are the actionable things we could be doing that wouldn't need action from the team?**  
A: Mapping out the community of contributors, organizing workstreams, and matching people to high-impact roles. (answered by vincentpaul)

**Q: What is the best way to collaborate on social media reposts?**  
A: Partners can draft tweets in Typefully, share the link in the channel tagging Ben, who will review and post from the ElizaOS account. (answered by ben)

**Q: How do I apply for the launchpad?**  
A: https://tally.so/r/3Ev6XX or go to elizaos.ai > partners > apply (answered by yikesawjeez)

**Q: Where can I find the tokenomics document?**  
A: https://hackmd.io/@xr/ai16z-tokenomics (answered by jin)

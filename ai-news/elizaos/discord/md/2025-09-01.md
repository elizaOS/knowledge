# elizaOS Discord - 2025-09-01

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **CLI Testing Improvements**: Discussion about challenges in testing the CLI before deployment, with proposals for CI systems that auto-deploy from the develop branch to beta NPM for testing. Verdaccio was suggested as a private NPM repository solution.
- **Project Architecture**: Debate about structural changes in issue #5860, with concerns about fundamental structures and where functionality should reside (server vs. projects). A vision for simplifying project initialization was shared.
- **AR/VR Integration**: Exploration of using AR glasses (Meta Quest 3, Brilliantlabs, Xreal One Pro) to showcase AI-powered NPCs through Eliza, with technical considerations about device capabilities.
- **Edge Computing for AI**: Discussion about running AI models locally, with mentions that full models like Deepseek can already run on high-end Mac Studios with sufficient RAM.
- **Self-hosting Solutions**: Insights about container-based solutions like Umbrel and CasaOS that provide app store-like interfaces for hosting AI applications locally.

### Development Experiences
- A developer shared their experience using the Remix SDK (formerly Farcade) for game development, including integration of Gemini API for in-game image generation and considering ElizaOS integration.
- Benefits of mini apps were highlighted, including automatic deployment to Telegram and World App.

### Project Concerns
- Questions about token price decline and utility remained unanswered.
- Mentions of a lawsuit and suspended X accounts potentially affecting the project.
- Requests for roadmap information went unanswered.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How is facts different than knowledge?**  
A: Facts are not optional and are related to relationships provider/reflection evaluator.

**Q: Why is elizaos class required?**  
A: It's not required, just a conceptual vision for the project structure.

**Q: Do you think the idea of a personal Jarvis is realistic?**  
A: Partially answered - AI models will continue to get smaller and can already run on high-end hardware.

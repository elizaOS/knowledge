# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Framework & Development
- The ElizaOS framework continues to evolve as an open-source platform for creating AI agents that operate on platforms like Twitter and Discord
- Developers are actively troubleshooting connection issues with various model providers (Ollama, Anthropic, OpenAI) and clients (Twitter, Telegram)
- A significant issue was identified with the plugin-node package's postinstall script trying to access compiled files before they exist
- Several users reported problems with Twitter integration, including authentication errors, shadow banning, and unwanted automatic replies/retweets
- Santi is working on an ordinals plugin for handling Runes, inscriptions, and Rare sats (PR #1699)
- Jin mentioned training a Lora model for DegenAI and optimizing it to under 6MB
- The awesome-eliza GitHub repository is being updated to track the evolving ecosystem

### Tokenomics & Business Model
- A key proposal by 563 blocmates suggests using ai16z as the base asset for bonding curves when launching new agents/tokens
- The single-pool approach would include a "zapping" feature allowing users to pay with SOL/USDC while automatically converting to ai16z
- Eskender.eth defended the original two-pool model, explaining that AT:SOL as the primary pool works like pump.fun with "virtual liquidity"
- Discussions about plugin fee structures included suggestions to either keep fees fixed or allow agent deployers to adjust them
- Debate about whether buybacks should go to deepening liquidity rather than burning tokens
- The tokenomics whitepaper is expected to be released in January according to shakejr

### AI TV Show Development
- A show called "Clank Tank" (a parody of Shark Tank) is being developed where AI judges evaluate project pitches
- SM Sith Lord implemented a show runner system that pulls content from a news aggregator and generates episodes on-the-fly
- Boom is working on visual aspects, including transitions, alpha channel video rendering, and Unity integration
- The team is iterating on the balance between automated generation and manual testing

### Community & Ecosystem
- Over 80 hackathon projects are utilizing ElizaOS according to discussions
- Twitter account compliance issues requiring a name change to include "Parody" to avoid suspension
- Concerns about a wallet that received 20M DegenAI tokens from a dev wallet and began selling them
- solshaky announced and launched a DegenAI NFT collection for token holders
- Shaw discussed opening the spartan_holders channel to non-holders to increase engagement

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q: How do I fix the "Error in generateText: Error: Unknown model" issue?**  
  **A:** Switch to OpenAI instead of Claude or OpenRouter as these may have compatibility issues with the tokenizer (answered by Santi)

- **Q: How do I prevent my Twitter agent from replying to everyone automatically?**  
  **A:** Add a custom twitterShouldRespondTemplate in your character file to control response behavior (answered by Matt Gunnin)

- **Q: How do I make my agent use a cheaper OpenAI model like gpt-4o-mini?**  
  **A:** Set MEDIUM_OPENAI_MODEL and LARGE_OPENAI_MODEL to gpt-4o-mini in your .env file (answered by LiamVDB)

- **Q: How do I make my agent speak in a different language?**  
  **A:** Add instructions in the system prompt like "You are a helpful ai assistant that speaks in Portuguese" (answered by y4my4m)

- **Q: How do I fix the "SqliteError: Vector dimension mistmatch" error?**  
  **A:** This happens when the name of the character and the agent user on Discord don't match (answered by ithilreum)

- **Q: What's the best FREE API provider with good usage quota?**  
  **A:** Heurist is good but requires application; EternalAI is another option (answered by YoungPhlo)

### Tokenomics & Business
- **Q: What's the difference between the single-pool and two-pool proposals?**  
  **A:** The two-pool design is more complicated. Single-pool drives value immediately to ai16z, while the original proposal only flows value to ai16z from fees of the main pool. (answered by 563 blocmates)

- **Q: Why not give users the option to choose between SOL and ai16z?**  
  **A:** The best option is to use ai16z but allow users to pay with SOL/USDC and zap it to ai16z in the background. (answered by 563 blocmates)

- **Q: Does anyone know what pump fun does with their LP earnings?**  
  **A:** They regularly dump the sol side on CEX (answered by 0xwitch)

- **Q: When will the tokenomics whitepaper be released?**  
  **A:** January (answered by shakejr)

### AI TV Show
- **Q: How can we bridge the gap between human control and AI scriptwriting for the show?**  
  **A:** Use a Typeform where participants submit audio clips, logos, and optional 3D models, then have AI agents respond to these human elements (answered by KamX)

- **Q: What video format supports alpha channel for transparent overlays?**  
  **A:** QuickTime Apple ProRes 4444 + alpha rendered from a PNG sequence (answered by boom)

- **Q: Does the show runner need to generate a new episode every time or can it replay previous episodes?**  
  **A:** SM Sith Lord updated it to support both generating new episodes and replaying previous ones for testing (answered by SM Sith Lord)

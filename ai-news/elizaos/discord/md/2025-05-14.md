# elizaOS Discord - 2025-05-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development
- **ElizaOS v2 Development**: Currently in beta testing phase. A team member described it as "looking at a pizza before it goes into the oven" with GPT-4o image generation being the final step.
- **Version Differences**: Users noted significant differences between ElizaOS v1 (main branch, 0.x) and v2 (v2-develop branch, 1.x), described as "like day and night."
- **Mobile Development**: Discussions about creating mobile applications for ElizaOS, with participants noting that mobile presence is crucial for user adoption. Technical challenges were identified as ElizaOS is dependent on NodeJS, with only some very old versions running on iOS.

### auto.fun Platform
- **API Limitations**: Users examined the auto.fun repository code and identified that while some API endpoints exist (for swaps, token retrieval, search, and charts), they lack functionality for creating new coins or executing swaps.
- **Token Tracking Mechanism**: auto.fun tracks tokens that interact with its specific program address (autoUmixaMaYKFjexMpQuBpNYntgbkzCo2b1ZqUaAZ5) rather than all tokens on-chain.
- **Market Making**: Team members clarified they have reputable market makers for both CEX and DEX, and addressed questions about relationships with specific market makers.

### Technical Implementation
- **Supabase Integration**: Users shared SQL commands for creating database tables for agents with proper references and constraints.
- **Plugin Development**: Discussions about custom plugin development and integration challenges, particularly importing local plugins versus using NPM packages.
- **Twitter/X Integration**: Users troubleshooting configuration issues with Twitter integration, including setting environment variables for replying to specific users.

### Token Discussions
- **AI16z Token Permissions**: Concerns about the "mint" permission on the AI16z token, with a team member explaining this is standard for daos.fun coins and will be addressed at the appropriate time.
- **ELI5 Token**: Claims that ELI5 will be the community manager AI agent for ElizaOS v2, with references to an interview confirming this. Debate about the token's legitimacy and potential value ensued.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What's the issue with current MCPs for tool chaining?**  
A: MCPs don't expose metadata about tool dependencies, making it difficult to build proper workflow chains without context bloat. Composio solves this by enriching MCPs with metadata to compute dependency graphs. (answered by Stan ⚡)

**Q: Does Composio support remote MCP on HTTP streaming?**  
A: It doesn't support remote MCP, but custom tools/toolkits can be embedded inside the plugin. (answered by Stan ⚡)

**Q: Could multi-step help with the tool dependency issue?**  
A: It might help but likely won't fully solve the dependency graph generation needed for MCP integrations. (answered by Stan ⚡)

**Q: How would the proposed AI agent system handle costs of LLM usage?**  
A: Users could run GPUs at home and connect them to avoid costs (answered by DorianD)

**Q: How would multi-user AI agents handle memory and privacy?**  
A: Some memories might need to be unencrypted, unless homomorphic data processing is implemented (answered by DorianD)

**Q: Who to cast as the debators, and the moderator?**  
A: Sam and Elon as debators, "Her" as mod (answered by whobody)

**Q: Any suggestions for logger customization?**  
A: Multiple preferences shared - Stan preferred highlight version, Odilitime suggested yellow for errors with minimal color use overall. (answered by Stan ⚡ and Odilitime)

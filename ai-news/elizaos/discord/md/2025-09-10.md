**Date: September 10, 2025**

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Updates & Releases
- **ElizaOS v1.5.8 Released**: The core development team successfully deployed version 1.5.8 after testing and verification, addressing issues present in previous versions.
- **MessageBusService Issue**: Users reported problems with ElizaOS v1.5.5 related to MessageBusService being unable to map room/world to central IDs. Upgrading to v1.5.7 or v1.5.8 was recommended as a solution.
- **Provider Change for Nemotron Model**: The nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2 model is moving to nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2:free, with DeepInfra becoming a paid provider.

### Development Initiatives
- **Enhanced Knowledge Systems**: Work is underway on improving Eliza's question answering capabilities, with requests for input on data sources and question types.
- **Codebase Restructuring Plans**: The core team is planning to:
  - Remove Sentry from core and add it to the server package
  - Clean up server/channel/world/room abstractions to reduce redundancy
  - Prepare for new features like pglite WASM browser DB and ElizaOS/react hooks

### Community & Partnerships
- **Eliza Improvement Proposals**: Discussion about implementing a structured proposal system similar to Ethereum's EIPs/ERCs to standardize development efforts and involve the community in a more organized way.
- **AI Hackathon Announcement**: Carlos Rene from DEGA invited developers to participate in an $8000 prize hackathon focused on AI for DAO Treasury Management, mentioning workshops with ElizaOS for agents and automations.
- **Upcoming X Spaces Event**: Announcement about an event featuring Xmaquina, NEAR, and Eliza Labs.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: How can we fix the MessageBusService issue with ElizaOS version 1.5.5?  
   **A**: Try upgrading to 1.5.7 or the latest 1.5.8 version.

2. **Q**: Are the recordings on YouTube?  
   **A**: Yes - you can see it in the live tab here: https://www.youtube.com/@elizaOSDeveloper/streams

3. **Q**: Would it be beneficial to have something similar to EIPs and ERCs for the Eliza Foundation?  
   **A**: Yes, it would help involve people in a more structured way and standardize development efforts.

4. **Q**: Can anyone use it knowing your user id? (regarding dstack SDK demo)  
   **A**: This is just a demo to show how to generate accounts without storing private keys. Not good for production but for teaching what's possible with dstack SDK.

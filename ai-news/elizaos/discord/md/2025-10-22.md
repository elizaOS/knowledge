## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can we still buy and trade AI16Z TOKEN?**  
A: Yes, you can still buy $AI16Z (answered by MDMnvest)

**Q: Any suggestions if we should wait for migration and buy new ElizaOS?**  
A: Nobody knows what the price will be for $elizaOS after migration. By my calculations, investors will break even if elizaOS is 22.7% higher post migration. (answered by MDMnvest)

**Q: What happened with the Twitter ban?**  
A: "It's not really back. There's a couple community ones right now (elizaOSc & elizaOS_news) but our official X accounts are still suspended, and we're suing them over it" (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Why can Eliza in WebUI answer questions from Knowledge base but Eliza in plugin-telegram cannot?**  
A: Run with LOG_LEVEL=debug to see the prompt and what the knowledge provider gave to work with. May need to change models or tune the prompt if there's too much context (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Is AWS US East down?**  
A: No, all services show green status (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Has anyone used Anthropic's Skills?**  
A: Not yet, still using sub agents and hooks; skills share context with main agent while sub agents don't (answered by R0am | tip.md)

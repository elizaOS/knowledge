# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-27

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Framework & Development
- **DeepSeek R1 Integration**: The integration of DeepSeek's R1 model into ElizaOS has been completed and is available in the latest development branch. This is seen as a significant improvement for cost efficiency while maintaining quality. Users can configure it via the DEEPSEEK_API_URL in the .env file.
- **Version Roadmap**: The project is transitioning from v1 to v2, with an intermediate v1.5 release planned that includes plugin rearchitecture. Development teams are working on various components (v1/v2/launchpad/tokenomics/AI traders).
- **Rebranding Progress**: The project is officially rebranding from ai16z to ElizaOS for a more distinct, unified brand identity. The $ai16z ticker remains for now, with future changes to be voted on by the community when the DAO voting module launches.
- **Builder Demo Day**: A recent event showcased projects built on the ElizaOS framework, though there was mention of a project called PVPAI that allegedly "rugged" shortly after presenting.

### Technical Challenges & Solutions
- **Solana Plugin Issues**: Many users reported the "BN not found" error related to the Solana plugin's dependency on @coral-xyz/anchor. The solution involves modifying node_modules/@solana-developers/helpers/dist/esm/lib/transaction.js to use import pkg syntax.
- **DeepSeek API Issues**: Users experienced problems with DeepSeek responses containing unwanted text like "(NONE)". Solutions include modifying the system prompt or using OpenRouter as an intermediary.
- **Memory Management**: Discussions about optimizing memory usage with different database options (SQLite, PostgreSQL, Supabase) to prevent context length exceeded errors.
- **Deployment Options**: Recommendations for VPS providers like Contabo, Docker containers, and cloud services for hosting ElizaOS agents in production.

### Projects & Applications
- **AI TV Show Development**: A team is developing an AI news show and "Block Tank" (similar to Shark Tank) using Unity. Technical implementations include texture loading for TV screens, Oculus LipSync integration, and camera management systems.
- **DegenAI Trading Bot**: The autonomous trading bot project is facing development delays but is implementing improvements including a new data layer, execution integration to reduce failed transactions, and a sentiment layer similar to aixbt.
- **Agent Marketplace/Launchpad**: Development of an agent marketplace is in progress with tokenomics documentation nearly complete. The community is eager for its launch to create more utility for the AI16Z token.

### Tokenomics & Market Discussions
- **Yellowstone Model**: Discussions about implementing the Yellowstone model for AI16Z token utility, where projects would hold tokens to access premium services rather than paying tributes.
- **Liquidity Concerns**: The AI16Z/SOL liquidity pool has an imbalance ($3M of AI16Z vs only $600K of SOL), creating vulnerability to downward price pressure.
- **Blockchain Expansion**: Proposals to deploy AI16Z on Base blockchain to increase liquidity and potential for Coinbase listing, following Venice's (VVV) successful launch strategy.

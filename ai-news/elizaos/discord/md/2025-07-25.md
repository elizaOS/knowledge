# elizaOS Discord - 2025-07-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Plugin Architecture Improvements**: shaw proposed consolidating various AI model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq) into a single `plugin-inference` instead of separate plugins. The team discussed using ai-sdk for standardization as the most scalable approach.
- **TEE Implementation**: Agent Joshua successfully deployed a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) with a streamable HTTP server and offered to document the deployment process.
- **Security Vulnerability**: cjft discovered a critical vulnerability where `elizaos publish` wasn't ignoring `.env` files, potentially exposing sensitive data, and began working on a fix.
- **Knowledge Management Solutions**: R0am demonstrated a personal agent built using n8n and Zep for knowledge graphs, sparking discussions about different knowledge graph technologies and data pipelines.

### Documentation & Resources
- **Documentation Consolidation**: Borko confirmed that elizaos.ai will link directly to eliza.how to centralize documentation.
- **Agent Development Guide**: DorianD provided detailed guidance to 3on_ about installing and configuring agents using Cursor AI, including forking repositories, indexing files, and linking documentation repositories.

### Community & Platform Issues
- **X/Twitter Account Suspensions**: The ElizaOS team (particularly Kenk) is working toward resolving the suspension of ElizaOS-related accounts from X/Twitter but is withholding detailed information about communications. Ben confirmed "we'll be back, Eliza's just spreading her wings."
- **Alternative Platforms**: DorianD suggested establishing a presence on Bluesky, sharing documentation links for creating bots on that platform.
- **Project Direction Concerns**: Community members questioned the focus on memecoin launchpads rather than trading agent development, with some suggesting that auto.fun should prioritize Spartan as a trading agent launchpad.

### Ongoing Development
- **Plugin Development**: cjft is working on a "waifu" plugin (plugin-google-meet-cute) with plans to complete it for Monday's standup.
- **Multi-repo Analysis**: jin is running daily multi-repo analysis to track development across repositories.
- **MCP Interface**: Agent Joshua is making progress on the Message Control Protocol interface.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I create my first agent for my Discord channel?** (asked by 3on_)  
**A:** Use Cursor AI to help with installation, fork the main repo in GitHub, git clone it locally, and add the ElizaOS doc repo in settings to help the agent index files. (answered by DorianD)

**Q: Which embedding provider is best for plugin-knowledge?** (asked by Rixilius)  
**A:** OpenAI with text-embedding-3-large model and 3072 dimensions, plus Google's gemini-2.5-flash-lite for contextual chunking. (answered by 0xbbjoker)

**Q: How would dynamic loading/unloading of plugins work for switching between AI providers?** (asked by shaw)  
**A:** It would involve unregistering all runtime properties added by the plugin, which is the most scalable approach for swapping components. (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Is Eliza a single response model by default?** (asked by Snapper)  
**A:** No, it can plan multiple actions in response, run them in order, and pass their actions down the chain. Also we have websockets in most cases so it can send a message not as a response. (answered by shaw)

**Q: Which X accounts does the community recommend following for the latest news about ElizaOS?** (asked by Hannes K.)  
**A:** Follow the builders behind the elizaOS framework [list of team members and their X accounts]. (answered by Kenk)

**Q: So twitter accounts gone forever?** (asked by mat)  
**A:** We'll be back, Eliza's just spreading her wings. (answered by ben)

**Q: What documentation site should elizaos.ai link to?** (asked by jin)  
**A:** We're switching over to eliza.how to link straight from elizaos.ai. (answered by Borko)

## Community Help & Collaboration

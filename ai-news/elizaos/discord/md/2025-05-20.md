## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I fix the "bun build" error in the Quickstart Guide?**  
A: It should be "bun run build" instead. (ReMeDy)

**Q: Does ElizaOS support Heurist as a model provider?**  
A: No, you'll need to create a "plugin-heurist". (0xbbjoker)

**Q: How is XP calculated in the leaderboard system?**  
A: The XP algorithm is open source, similar to SourceCred and inspired by PageRank. Points are weighted only on merged code/pull requests. (jin)

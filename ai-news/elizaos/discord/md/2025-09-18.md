# elizaOS Discord - 2025-09-18

**Date: September 18, 2025**

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development
- **CLI Issues**: Multiple users reported version conflicts between ElizaOS CLI 1.4.3 and 1.5.10, with package manager conflicts between npm and bun installations causing problems.
- **Port Conflicts**: A critical bug was identified where `elizaos dev` creates an infinite loop of port reassignments, affecting development workflows.
- **ElizaOS Cloud Platform**: Sam-developer demonstrated a working end-to-end flow for the ElizaOS Cloud platform and plugin, allowing users to use the ElizaOS Cloud API key directly in the CLI without needing separate provider keys.
- **.gitignore Cleanup**: Odilitime identified duplicate entries in the .gitignore file that needed cleanup, including redundant entries for bun.lock, **/dist/**, and dist/.

### Integration & Features
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Several developers discussed implementing WhatsApp integration with ElizaOS for AI auto-reply functionality, with multiple community members offering assistance.
- **Onchain Agent Registration**: Agent Joshua shared plans to create an agent that registers itself onchain with a generated wallet using ERC-8004 contracts, and confirmed deployment experience with TEE validation.
- **Canvas Interface**: Jin shared information about tldraw SDK 4.0, suggesting it could give Eliza an edge over other AI apps, noting that canvas interfaces represent the next evolution beyond chat interfaces.
- **Solana Integration**: Discussions about implementing Solana USDC payments with a FastAPI backend for AI integration, and mentions of Solana's new podcast about crypto and AI called x402.

### GitHub & CI/CD
- **PR Reviews**: Stan requested review for PR #5864, mentioning defined next steps from tickets (epic 1 and 6).
- **GitHub Actions Issue**: A workflow issue with Claude-review showing an invalid API key error was identified, with sayonara offering to fix it.
- **Security Concerns**: Discussions about compromised npm packages and the need for CI/CD checks to prevent security vulnerabilities.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Do we have any agent that can integrate with WhatsApp for AI auto-reply?**  
A: Multiple users (Stan âš¡, Ã˜Demer, 0xCryptoCooker) offered to help with implementation using WhatsApp Cloud API.

**Q: Is there a command to switch versions? I can see I have installed 1.5.10 but stuck on 1.4.3**  
A: Need to remove all versions with different package managers and reinstall with one package manager (answered by Stan âš¡).

**Q: It doesn't bypass the X API anymore?**  
A: Nope, 1.0.7 plugin-twitter was the last that did (answered by Odilitime).

**Q: Has anyone deployed 8004 contracts?**  
A: "I've done it and we've been working with them to make TEE validation more defined. We also did registered agents with Chaos Chain using Spore to collaborate on proposals, vote and execute proposals onchain during ETHDenver." (answered by Agent Joshua).

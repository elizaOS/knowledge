# elizaOS Discord - 2025-12-17

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Updates

- **Discord Plugin**: Large PR with 66 commits is ready to merge after being open for three weeks (mentioned by Odilitime)
- **Agent Actions Extension**: Discussions about how to properly extend agent functionality in the Starknet plugin environment, including creating new action files and registering them correctly

### Token Migration Issues
- **Exchange Handling Discrepancies**: Different exchanges (Bithumb and Kraken) are handling the AI16Z to ELIZAOS token swap differently, causing confusion

- **Migration Confirmation**: Clarification that migration from AI16Z to ELIZAOS is still possible on Solana Network

### Business Development
- **Market Maker Requirements**: Market makers require agents to be deployed in production and actively engaging in social environments before further investment
- **Product Development Philosophy**: Emphasis on having a live product that can be iteratively improved rather than waiting for perfection

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
- **Q**: How to add more actions for the agent when we can't see the starknet-plugin folder?  
  **A**: "Usually I just clone the plugin into the packages folder" (Odilitime)

- **Q**: How do we extend the current actions for the agent? Is creating a `zpaceship.ts` in the `actions` folder the right way?  
  **A**: "You should take a look at actions documentation and you also have to put it in src/index" (Stan and Odilitime)

- **Q**: Is it worth reviewing the Discord plugin PR before merging?  
  **A**: Yes, but it's already 3 weeks old and getting too big (Odilitime)

### Token Migration
- **Q**: Is the $ai16z migration to $elizaOS still possible on Solana Network?  
  **A**: Yes (Odilitime)

- **Q**: Why Elizaos dump?  
  **A**: Diamondhandwhiteboy suggested it was due to "jeets" (likely referring to retail investors selling)

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-12-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI16Z to ElizaOS Migration Issues

The migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS dominated user concerns across channels. Multiple users reported critical issues:

- **Wallet Connection Problems**: Users could connect wallets and see their AI16Z tokens but couldn't complete the swap process
- **"Max Amount Reached" Errors**: Users encountered this error without clear explanation
- **Eligibility Confusion**: The migration portal showed 0 AI16Z for some holders despite them owning tokens, with eligibility tied to snapshot dates
- **Critical Bug Identified**: The ElizaOS Discord link on the elizacloud website directs to the wrong server (closed development server instead of the main one)

**Market Dynamics**: AI16Z showed paradoxical 100% gains despite being deprecated, with 70k inflow while ElizaOS had -40k outflow on DEX within 24 hours. MDMnvest explained this as manipulation given AI16Z's 10-fold drop since migration started. Liquidity concerns were raised with only 200k liquidity during migration, expected to reach zero after February.

### Major Announcements

**Decentralized OTC Desk**: Kenk announced a significant development - a decentralized OTC desk operated by an Eliza agent launching soon, representing actual utility for ElizaOS. Odilitime confirmed this would be operated by Eliza, not DEGEN.

**Eliza Cloud Website**: The new Eliza Cloud website was leaked early by The Light, though it's still a work in progress. DannyNOR NoFapArc inquired about the ETA, receiving "soon(tm)" from Odilitime without a specific date.

### Technical Framework Discussions

**Parallel Action Execution**: In the core-devs channel, sayonara shared an early draft PR (#6209) exploring multi-tool call functionality with multi-step execution. The key innovation involves executing multiple independent actions in parallel at each step rather than sequentially to improve performance. Odilitime raised concerns about action chaining dependencies, which sayonara addressed by explaining that prompting would identify and only execute independent actions in parallel while dependent actions remain sequential.

**Configuration Challenges**: SecretRecipe highlighted growing confusion around environment variables and API configuration. The dashboard now requires X/Twitter API keys while the env file still uses old login/password style, representing documentation gaps and unclear processes that have worsened over time.

**X/Twitter Platform Restrictions**: Odilitime confirmed that X/Twitter "never liked" Eliza agents on their platform, raising concerns about platform restrictions.

### Ecosystem Strategy

**Monetization Patterns**: DorianD initiated an important discussion about agent monetization, emphasizing that most revenue will come from a small number of power users who become highly engaged (following the freemium/whale user model). The key consideration raised was designing agents with engagement and monetization in mind while filtering out opportunistic "money grabbing gold digger agents" that could harm the ecosystem.

### Community Growth

Two new developers introduced themselves in the coders channel:
- **aalling**: Full-stack and blockchain engineer with expertise in Solidity/Rust smart contracts, tokenomics modeling, backend systems for high-traffic dApps, security reviews, gas optimization, and L2 integrations
- **Bardotta**: Full-stack and blockchain developer specializing in the Sui ecosystem and Move language, with experience in object-centric models and transaction flows

### Security Concerns

TEN.DANTAYLOR warned about scammers sending direct messages. Versatyle reminded users to seek help in public channels rather than DMs to avoid phishing attacks.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why is AI16Z pumping when it's supposed to be deprecated?**  
A: There's barely any liquidity during migration to ElizaOS, and any moves are likely due to manipulation since AI16Z dropped 10-fold since migration started (answered by The Light and MDMnvest)

**Q: Is the migrate.elizafoundation.ai site safe to connect my phantom wallet?**  
A: Follow the links from the mirror article in announcements channel (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Is the decentralized OTC desk operated by ELIZA or DEGEN?**  
A: Eliza (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Does X/Twitter like Eliza agents on their platform?**  
A: They never liked it (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: How to claim Babylon airdrop for ElizaOS holders?**  
A: We don't have information on that yet (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: What are steps and guidance scale in image studio?**  
A: Should be updating soon, the site was leaked a bit early (answered by The Light)

**Q: Why does the migration portal show 0 ai16z when I have tokens?**  
A: When did you buy them? - depends on snapshot date (answered by hildi)

**Q: How does parallel action execution deal with the issue that usually the next tasks depend on answers from the previous task?**  
A: Through prompting - only call actions in parallel that are independent of each other (answered by sayonara)

**Q: What's the ETA for Elizacloud?**  
A: soon(tm) - no specific date provided (answered by Odilitime)

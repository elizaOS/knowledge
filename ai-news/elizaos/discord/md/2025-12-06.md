## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why is AI16Z soaring when my ElizaOS has no data and no changes?**  
A: AI16Z has dropped ~10 fold since migration started. Any moves in AI16Z now (up and down) is due to manipulation. ElizaOS is now the token associated with Eliza OS. AI16Z is not. (MDMnvest)

**Q: How can I complete the migration/swap from AI16Z to ElizaOS?**  
A: Go to migration-help channel (The Light)

**Q: What does "Max Amount Reached" mean in the migration tool?**  
A: Go to migration-help channel (Omid Sa)

**Q: How to claim Babylon airdrop for ElizaOS holders?**  
A: We don't have information on that yet (Odilitime)

**Q: Is Eliza open to treasury/OTC discussions?**  
A: We're launching a decentralized OTC desk that is operated by an agent soon (Kenk)

**Q: What's the ETA for Elizacloud?**  
A: soon(tm) (Odilitime)

**Q: How does parallel action execution deal with dependencies between tasks?**  
A: Only actions that are independent would be executed in parallel, preserving dependency chains (sayonara)

**Q: Is this multiple-action-chains?**  
A: No. Think regular multistep where multiple actions can be called at each step but instead they are called parallel to save time (sayonara)

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-07-13

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development & Updates
- **ElizaOS v1.2.5 Released**: The latest version was mentioned in discussions with several users working on implementation.
- **Twitter Plugin Update**: Version 1.2.1 was released with configuration changes to `TWITTER_ACTION_INTERVAL` (recommended setting: 30).
- **Character Creation Tutorial**: Snapper shared a new video tutorial about creating ElizaOS characters using Claude prompt templates, with downloadable templates for building AI agents.

### Technical Implementations
- **API Integration**: Several users discussed methods for receiving agent responses after sending messages, with the `get-channel-messages` endpoint being recommended.
- **Database Connectivity**: Users troubleshooted Supabase connection issues, with suggestions to verify connection URIs and use curl for testing.
- **Agent Deployment**: Community discussed various methods for deploying ElizaOS agents on platforms like Render, Railway, and Heroku.
- **GUI vs. Code Configuration**: Clarification that changes in `character.ts` override GUI settings, as GUI changes are saved in the database.

### Proposed Features & Concepts
- **Identity & Memory Management System**: DorianD proposed a comprehensive system using Solana Token 2022 (T22) for Eliza agents, enabling:
  - User identity registration with web2/3 verification
  - Agent memory sharing with authorization protocols
  - Backup agents for long-term storage
  - Revenue model through token transactions
  - AI cloning capabilities based on accumulated user memories

### Token & Community Discussion
- **Role Assignment Confusion**: Users discussed the equivalence between Hoplite role (granted for holding 1M $degenai) and Partners role (granted for holding 100k $ai16z).
- **Eli5 Token Discussion**: Some users expressed bullish sentiment on Eli5 token despite recent price volatility, with mentions of its place in the ElizaOS ecosystem.
- **AI16Z/Sol Liquidity**: Brief mention of AI16Z/Sol liquidity pairing on Raydium requiring monitoring and range management.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: How do I receive the agent's response after sending a message using the messaging endpoint?  
  **A**: Use the `get-channel-messages` endpoint (answered by sayonara)

- **Q**: How do I publish or host an agent in Vercel without running it locally?  
  **A**: Look at bot deployment tutorials via Render, Railway, Heroku - ElizaOS deployment follows standard practices (answered by JoeyWheelz)

- **Q**: Is there a suggested way to translate user queries to acceptable API requests for market data?  
  **A**: Provide good documentation in the prompt and explanation to the LLM on how to build queries, then parse it and call the API (answered by 0xbbjoker)

- **Q**: Where can I find a one-page document about developing with ElizaOS to paste to Claude?  
  **A**: You have CLAUDE.md in the root of project (answered by 0xbbjoker)

- **Q**: Why doesn't character.ts reflect changes made in the GUI?  
  **A**: Changes are saved in the database; it's either build from code or GUI - code changes will override GUI settings (answered by 0xbbjoker)

- **Q**: Where can I provide data for the knowledge plugin in JSON format?  
  **A**: In the knowledge tab of agent details panel; JSON files are supported (answered by 0xbbjoker)

### Community & Tokens
- **Q**: Why haven't I been given a partner Role despite having 1.01M degenai in my phantom wallet?  
  **A**: Holding 1 million $degenai gives you the Hoplite role, while holding 100k $ai16z gives you the Partners role. They both have the same access permissions. (answered by 辞尘鸽鸽)

- **Q**: Why is Eli5 only at 10k market cap and dumping hard today?  
  **A**: It's just FUD, it'll be back up soon (answered by HodlHusky)

- **Q**: Why should one be bullish on Eli5?  
  **A**: Eli5 is bullish if you're paying attention, and the ElizaOS ecosystem will perform well like FTX coins did in the last cycle (answered by traderlv)

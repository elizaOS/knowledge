## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: When will the migration of AI16z to ElizaOS happen?**  
A: Early October (answered by Dr. Neuro and Kenk)

**Q: Is Shaw coming back to X soon?**  
A: "We hope" (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: How do I resolve the error "Cannot find module 'zod/v4'" when using ElizaOS?**  
A: Run "bun add zod" in your project (answered by sayonara and 0xbbjoker)

**Q: Why is my ElizaOS agent stuck on "Agent is thinking..." and not replying?**  
A: The issue is related to missing dependencies and embedding service errors; adding Zod and updating ElizaOS should fix it (answered by Stan ⚡, sayonara, and 0xbbjoker)

**Q: Why is the embedding service failing with "No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING"?**  
A: It uses embeddings for memories; you can disable embeddings by adding IGNORE_BOOTSTRAP=true in the .env file (answered by sayonara)

**Q: What do you think this means for ElizaOS?** (regarding Circle's AI blockchain tools)  
A: "If you have been following that's where ElizaOS is going" (answered by satsbased)

**Q: Would we be having standup today?**  
A: "Can you guys write your updates here. We will start with standups again tomorrow" (answered by Borko)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **ElizaOS Agent Troubleshooting**: Multiple community members (Stan ⚡, sayonara, and 0xbbjoker) collaborated to help user "ole" resolve issues with their agent not responding. The problem stemmed from missing dependencies and embedding service errors, which was resolved by running "elizaos update --skip-build" and adding Zod with "bun add zod".

- **Documentation Improvement**: Sayonara identified broken links on the Discord plugin documentation page, helping to improve the developer experience.

- **Research Sharing**: R0am shared Meta's ARE research for building realistic agent environments, providing valuable resources for the team working on evaluations.

- **Build Issue Resolution**: cjft fixed build issues and released version 1.6.0-beta, addressing problems in the codebase.

- **Auto Fun Platform Update**: Dr. Neuro provided a link to an update about the auto fun platform when user "karina" asked about its status.

## Key Questions & Answers

**ElizaOS Development**
- Q: What's the difference between eliza-starter and the main repo?  
  A: The starter is just barebones and missing some scripts like the clean script and pnpm run dev

- Q: How can I fix the issue with my agent showing JSON code in tweets?  
  A: Check the parsing.ts file in packages->core->src for messageCompletionFooter configuration

- Q: How can I control the rate of tweets/replies my agent makes?  
  A: Set POST_INTERVAL_MIN, POST_INTERVAL_MAX, and POST_IMMEDIATELY in .env file

- Q: How can I keep my agent running when I close the terminal?  
  A: Use screen, tmux, or set it up as a daemon service

- Q: How can I clear the agent's memory?  
  A: Use pnpm cleanstart

- Q: How can I run multiple AI agents on one instance?  
  A: Use --character parameter to specify multiple character files

- Q: What VPS specifications are needed for running Eliza?  
  A: 2GB RAM minimum, 4GB recommended for Docker, 15-30GB disk space

**Community & Governance**
- Q: How do I become a partner in the ai16z ecosystem?  
  A: You need to hold 100k ai16z tokens and verify through the roles channel

- Q: What is the difference between ai16zvc and ai16zdao Twitter accounts?  
  A: The dao account is the real one waiting for blue check back, the vc one is a partner who squatted the dao account and sent it to the team

- Q: What does the DAO vote on?  
  A: Tokenomics updates and other important matters, but Eliza Labs handles most of the heavy lifting

- Q: Does holding 1M DegenAI tokens qualify someone as a partner?  
  A: Yes, 1M DegenAI gives you the partner role

- Q: Is the tribute model being replaced?  
  A: No, the launchpad doesn't deprecate tribute; it's additive thinking

- Q: What's the process of taking an SVM token multi-chain with Hyperlane?  
  A: Deploy SVM side with token as collateral, deploy EVM side across desired chains, and enroll EVM contracts on SVM side

## Community Help & Collaboration

**Technical Assistance**
- 0xLabsTheCoder helped multiple users implement vector database integration for persistent memory, sharing code for database integration that tracks user interactions and builds profiles

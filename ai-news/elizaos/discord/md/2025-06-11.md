# elizaOS Discord - 2025-06-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Twitter Account Suspensions
- **ElizaOS and Shaw's X (Twitter) accounts were suspended**, causing significant community concern
- Team is working with X to resolve the issue, which may take 7-10 days based on previous experiences
- The team has purchased the official X API, suggesting the suspension might be related to API usage/scraping
- ElizaOS remains operational on other platforms including Discord, Telegram, and their website
- The team is using this opportunity to expand to other platforms like Farcaster

### Development Updates
- **V2 development is ongoing** with plugin migration work continuing despite the Twitter suspensions
- The auto.fun platform is being redesigned to be more effective as a token launchpad
- Spartan fine-tuning continues as part of ongoing development efforts
- Technical discussions around plugin development patterns, particularly the shift from callback-based responses to using a responses array in action handlers

### Community Concerns
- Some community members expressed concerns about the token's price performance
- Debate about the long-term value proposition of the ai16z token, with some arguing ElizaOS's technical foundation as an agent operating system provides strong fundamentals
- Partners expressed concern about the lack of coordinated communication during the Twitter suspension crisis

### Technical Issues
- Several users reported the "No settings state found for server undefined" error, which was resolved by cleaning the database
- Plugin development challenges, particularly with message interception patterns and response handling
- Issues with the knowledge plugin not properly retrieving embedded information
- Local AI model configuration problems with Ollama and context size limitations

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What happened to Shaw and ElizaOS X accounts?**  
A: The accounts were suspended, and the team is working with X to resolve the issue.

A: Based on previous experience, it could take 7-10 days.

**Q: Will the team buy the official X API?**  
A: They have already purchased the API.

**Q: What is auto.fun?**  
A: It's a token launchpad being redesigned to be more effective.

**Q: What is the value proposition for holding AI16Z tokens?**

A: It's related to server settings initialization, can be fixed by cleaning/resetting the database.

**Q: How can I intercept Telegram messages before agent processing?**

A: Specify this restriction in both bio and system fields.

**Q: What's the bull case for ai16z?**

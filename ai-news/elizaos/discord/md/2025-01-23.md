# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-23

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development
- **ElizaOS v2 Progress**: Jin advised users to "stick to v1" for now as v2 will be backwards compatible. The dev team is refactoring the plugin system and improving memory management for AI agents.
- **Installation Improvements**: The dev branch has reduced Eliza installation to a 2-second process.
- **Model Integration**: Discussions about integrating Deepseek models with ElizaOS, which Jin noted could be done with a single line of code change through OpenRouter.
- **RAG Implementation**: Several users discussed implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation for Eliza, with kAI wilder explaining the knowledgeManager system.

### Technical Issues & Solutions
- **Vector Dimension Mismatch**: Multiple users encountered "Vector dimension mismatch" errors. The solution is to set USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING=TRUE in the .env file.
- **Plugin Configuration**: Users struggled with plugin integration, particularly the dexscreener plugin. The solution involved removing API key checks in index.ts files.
- **Twitter Integration**: Several discussions about configuring Twitter agents, including how to disable retweets and make agents respond to replies.
- **Node.js Version**: Users reported success with Node v23.3.0 for resolving various errors.

### DegenSpartanAI & Trading
- **Trading Status**: DegenSpartanAI temporarily stopped trading because it ran out of SOL.
- **Performance Tracking**: Community members recommended Birdeye and Waveform platforms for tracking DegenSpartanAI's trading performance.
- **Development Roadmap**: Rhota mentioned they're working on improving trading functionality and developing a roadmap to be shared by the end of the following week.

### Tokenomics Discussions
- **Competing Approaches**: Debate between simple models versus complex mechanisms:
  - One approach follows pump.fun/virtuals model with dual pool structure and bonding curve
  - Vasily Sumanov proposed staking/delegation to whitelist trusted agents with slashing mechanisms
  - DorianD advocated for simplicity to avoid barriers to adoption
  - Akin suggested positioning ai16z as a premium service token
- **Block Tank Concept**: An AI-led venture capital concept combining game show elements with investment decisions, designed to scale and decentralize project vetting.

### 3D AI TV Show Development
- **Camera System**: Boom worked on camera variations including jib cam, pan and zoom pivot cam, and B-roll options with percentage-based switching logic.
- **Block Tank Configuration**: SM Sith Lord provided a pre-generated Block Tank episode setup with 6 actors and 4 locations for testing without making AI calls.
- **Visual Elements**: Discussions about scene design elements, including removing the floor to showcase the Earth backdrop and adding boosters, panels, wires, and LED desks.

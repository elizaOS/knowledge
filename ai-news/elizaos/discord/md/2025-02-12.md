# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-12

**Date: February 12, 2025**

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development Updates
- **ElizaOS V2 Development**: Plugins have been moved to separate repositories to enable more permissionless and scalable plugin development. Migration effort from V1 to V2 is estimated at 1-5 on a scale of 10.
- **Launchpad/Marketplace**: Technical infrastructure is ready but undergoing final audits before launch.
- **DegenAI Trading V2**: Now live with a new sentiment/data layer that integrates social signals from Twitter and Telegram to refine trading decisions. The system made its first purchase of $POPCAT.
- **Autonomous Investor**: Trust marketplace is live and generating signals from Telegram, with Discord integration expected within a week.

### Technical Discussions
- **Node.js Compatibility**: Version 23+ is recommended for ElizaOS deployments to avoid dependency issues.
- **API Access**: Several users discovered that API endpoints should be accessed via port 3000 instead of 5173, with endpoints like localhost:3000/agents.
- **Database Storage**: Confirmation that the SQL database stores agent tweets for memory persistence, accessible in agent/data/db.sqlite in the memories table.
- **Model Configuration**: Users discussed how to configure different model providers (OpenAI, TogetherAI) and specify which models to use.
- **Hosting Requirements**: 4-8GB RAM recommended for hosting ElizaOS agents, with various VPS providers suggested.

### AI-TV Show Development
- **News Aggregator Issues**: The team is facing challenges with poor-quality or mismatched images for news segments.
- **Automation vs. Curation**: Debate between maintaining full automation versus introducing manual curation steps to improve quality.
- **Technical Solutions**: Suggestions included creating generic "stinger" images for each news category and adjusting the episode generator to use these instead of aggregator image URLs.

### Branding and Tokenomics
- **Brand Consolidation**: Discussion about whether to consolidate the ElizaOS (blue theme, professional) and ai16zdao (orange theme, crypto culture) accounts into a single brand identity, with most partners favoring consolidation.
- **Tokenomics Model**: Current plan involves a dual pool system: SOL:AT (agent token) as primary and AI16Z:AT as a secondary pool that captures ecosystem fees for AI16Z buybacks. Some community members advocated for directly pairing agent tokens with AI16Z (similar to Virtuals and Arc models).

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: Does the SQL database store tweets the agent makes for memory?  
  **A**: Yes, you can check them locally inside agent/data/db.sqlite in the memories table.

- **Q**: How do I set up my agent to use OpenAI?  
  **A**: Add your API key to .env and set "modelProvider": "openai" in your character.json file.

- **Q**: Is it possible to create threads in X/Twitter using Eliza?  
  **A**: Yes, check the utils.ts inside client-twitter and look for buildConversationThread method.

- **Q**: How do I make my agent post to Twitter at regular intervals?  
  **A**: Set Twitter credentials in .env and add "twitter" to the clients in your character.json.

- **Q**: What are the recommended specs for hosting an Eliza agent?  
  **A**: 4-8GB RAM.

- **Q**: How do I call the Eliza Agent remotely?  
  **A**: Use port 3000 instead of 5173, with endpoints like localhost:3000/agents.

- **Q**: If I want to start building my own AI agent leveraging ElizaOS, is it better to wait for v2 or start now?  
  **A**: Start now and migrate later, migration effort would be 1-5 on a scale of 10.

### DegenAI & Trading
- **Q**: How is DegenAI different from quantitative trading bots and script-based bots?  
  **A**: Quant-based bots use predefined mathematical algorithms, while script-based bots follow simple rules. DegenAI's new trading backend can implement any strategy while also incorporating sentiment analysis from social media to inform trading decisions.

- **Q**: What are your thoughts on Arc launching a new AI agent that seems to be an enhanced version of DegenAI?  
  **A**: Their tech is rust-based targeting specific users. There's overlap but it's not exactly the same - it's a platform, not an autonomously posting/trading agent. We can learn from their successes and failures.

### Branding & Tokenomics
- **Q**: What's the reasoning for having separated brands?  
  **A**: ElizaOS = blue theme, github org, professional front for partnerships; ai16zdao = investment dao, AI memecoin traders/VC, crypto culture.

- **Q**: What is the current plan for token pairing?  
  **A**: Dual pool system with SOL:AT as primary and AI16Z:AT as secondary pool.

- **Q**: Are we following the same model as Virtuals and Arc?  
  **A**: No, we're using a dual pool model that captures ecosystem fees to drive AI16Z buybacks.

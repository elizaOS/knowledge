# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Framework & Development
- The community is actively building and deploying AI agents using the ElizaOS framework, with Shaw's Agent Dev School videos frequently referenced as a valuable learning resource.
- Technical discussions focus on memory management in agents, including how to reset an agent's learned behaviors by deleting `.dev` files.
- Jin acknowledged community concerns about slow progress on DegenAI development but confirmed daily syncs are happening with work progressing on multiple fronts.
- Several users are exploring implementation of TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) for securing AI agents, with Phala Network mentioned as working on decentralized TEEs.
- A fix was identified for a bug in `packages/plugin-solana/src/providers/simulationSellingService.ts` constructor, suggesting moving runtime local assignation to the top.

### Twitter Integration Challenges
- Multiple users reported issues with Twitter integration, including authentication problems, replies formatting as JSON, and rate limiting concerns.
- A PR (#1974) was created to fix the Twitter plugin to use client-twitter instead of the scraper from agent-twitter-client, addressing multiple login attempts causing security notifications.
- Users discussed methods to control agent behavior on Twitter, including making agents reply only to mentions or only post original tweets without replying.

### Database & Model Configuration
- Several users encountered SQLite errors related to vector dimensions and zero-length vectors, typically resolved by deleting database files and rebuilding.
- Developers are experimenting with different LLM providers (OpenAI, Grok, Ollama, Akash, GaiaNet) and facing issues with model switching and embedding compatibility.
- Milan/Senatus offered access to NanoGPT (LLM provider integrated into Eliza) with o1 and o1 Pro models, sending invites with funds for users to try the service.

### Cross-Chain & Tokenomics
- Discussions about making ai16z an omni-chain token using solutions like Hyperlane, LayerZero, or other bridging technologies.
- Jin started a HackMD document to collect and organize tokenomics discussions.
- The community debated the "tribute model" where projects built on Eliza technology contribute 5-10% of their token supply to the DAO.
- A multichain/asset protocol with liabilities as first-class primitives was proposed to enable P2P lending between agents.

### 3D AI News Show Development
- A team is developing an AI-powered news show with 3D avatars using a Unity-based frontend.
- They've created a modular system where `record6.js` can generate programmatic video recordings.
- The first episode (S1E1) was successfully uploaded to YouTube, with feedback on audio levels, lipsync issues, and camera positioning.
- Documentation of the "Derpy Show JSON Structure" was created to explain the system architecture.

### Partnerships & Ecosystem
- A notable partnership between Hyperfy and Eliza was mentioned, with a suggestion to create an "Eliza World" virtual neighborhood showcasing different agents.
- The Hyperfy airdrop for ai16z holders (snapshot from December 7th) was discussed, with some users having questions about claim safety and eligibility.
- Community reactions to perceived "vampire attacks" on the ai16z ecosystem were discussed, particularly regarding a token called LLM that appears to be mimicking ai16z's Eliza.

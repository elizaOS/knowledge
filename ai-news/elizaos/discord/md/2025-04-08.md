# elizaOS Discord - 2025-04-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **ElizaOS V2 Architecture**: The upcoming V2 release will feature architectural improvements enabling cross-platform presence, no chain switching, workflows, and dynamic characters. Spartan in V2 will include three exclusive plugins: community-investor, autonomous trader, and intel, with reduced dependencies on external systems.
- **Twitter Integration Issues**: Multiple users reported problems with the Twitter plugin in ElizaOS, particularly around interactions like mentions, replies, and quote reposts. Some users found v1 more functional than v2 for certain implementations.
- **Model Selection Challenges**: Users discussed LLM model selection issues, with OpenRouter being considered as an alternative to local LLMs. Some reported problems with models defaulting to local LLMs despite OpenRouter configuration.
- **AI Video Generation**: Jin shared progress on programmatically generating videos using Remotion framework, demonstrating both Unity-based and pure AI approaches (using Hedra for character animations).
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Discussions about MCP servers as a bridge between static APIs and dynamic agents, with Odilitime predicting "gradual then sudden adoption."
- **Agent Registry Concept**: Several members discussed an "ElizaOS agent registry" that would allow agents to advertise capabilities via JSON format and establish trust scores.
- **Grok3 API**: Brief announcement that "Grok3 API is up."

### Community & Organization
- **ElizaDAO Reboot**: Vincent Paul introduced a plan to reboot ElizaDAO as a "Supermind" focused on collective intelligence, with proposed working circles including Communications, Community & Governance, Development, Documentation, Partnerships, and Events.
- **Reputation System**: Jin is developing a reputation/contribution measurement system that passively monitors engagement across channels, analyzes sentiment, and scores GitHub contributions, with both token and non-monetary rewards.
- **Community Demo Session**: A community demo session for elizaOS agents was mentioned, featuring projects like xNomad (tools for tokenizing Web3 AI agents), Growth Terminal (AI marketing co-pilot), Kudo Network (framework for AI agent covenants), and Crucible Network (Unreal Engine plugin).
- **Auto.fun Launch**: The upcoming Auto.fun launch was frequently mentioned as an anticipated product with 15 partners, scheduled to launch after April 14th.

### Spartan (Previously DegenAI)
- **Development Status**: Odilitime clarified that Spartan's development milestones are being decoupled from V2 milestones.
- **Marketing Plans**: Plans include cross-promotion between Spartan and the auto.fun launch, development of a web presence, and restoration of Spartan's Twitter presence.
- **Twitter Presence**: The Spartan Twitter account (@SpartanVersus) is now active again on V1, addressing community concerns about perceived inactivity.

### Content Creation
- **Clank Tank Episodes**: Jin shared a preview of a Clank Tank episode and received feedback on length and audio quality issues, deciding to cut content by 50%.

## Key Questions & Answers

**ElizaOS Implementation**
- Q: Is it possible to import Eliza as a module in my own backend and create an agent that way?  
  A: Yes, and you can use the REST API too for that kind of thing. (DeFine)

- Q: How can I fix the issue where plugin-tee generates the same key regardless of parameters?  
  A: Review implementation for consistent parameters and check for version-specific issues. (jonathanmann)

- Q: Why is my agent selecting wrong actions (e.g., checking weather instead of transferring funds)?  
  A: It could be a memory issue when using Supabase DB after 30-35 prompts. (jonathanmann)

- Q: How can I get more verbose debugging output in v1?  
  A: Use DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL=debug pnpm start (wookosh)

**AI Video Generation**
- Q: Which approach feels more watchable long term for AI videos - Unity or Pure AI?  
  A: Both have strengths, but Unity offers more variety and tweakability while Pure AI (Hedra) will only improve over time. (Odilitime)

**Spartan Development**
- Q: Is it going to be postponed to match the schedule for Degen v2?  
  A: Odilitime is trying to keep Spartan milestones decoupled with v2 milestones.

- Q: What's different about spartan in V2?  
  A: Spartan in V2 has 3 exclusive plugins: community-investor, autonomous trader, and intel with reduced dependencies on external systems, plus architectural improvements. (Odilitime)

- Q: What is the team's marketing plan for spartan?  
  A: Cross-promotion with auto.fun launch, developing web presence, and working to get Spartan posting on Twitter again. (Odilitime)

- Q: Will the cross promotion between spartan and auto.fun start on April 14th?  
  A: More like after the 14th, definitely won't be at launch. (Odilitime)

**DAO Organization**
- Q: How will DAO participation be incentivized?  
  A: Jin is developing a system to measure participation/contributions, with rewards including both tokens and status/reputation elements like badges and NFTs. (jin)

- Q: Can the reputation system be tested in the working group before DAO-wide rollout?  
  A: Jin confirmed it could be used for early feedback, noting the system is mostly passive. (jin)

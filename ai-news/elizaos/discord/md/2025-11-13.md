# elizaOS Discord - 2025-11-13

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token Migration Issues
- A snapshot was taken on November 11 at 11:40 UTC for AI16Z to ElizaOS token migration
- Tokens purchased after the snapshot are not eligible for migration
- Many users, especially those on exchanges like Bithumb and Kraken, are experiencing migration difficulties
- Korean users are particularly affected as Bithumb has made no announcements about migration support
- The migration pool has reached its limit in some instances, causing "max amount reached" errors
- A ticket system has been established for handling individual migration issues, with response times up to 7 days
- Some community members have expressed concerns about the snapshot approach

### Technical Development
- The ELIZA token is mintable on Dexscreener because Chainlink CCIP requires this functionality for cross-chain deployment
- Odilitime explained that migration from token2022 was the primary goal rather than changing mintable status
- Several PRs are awaiting review, including #6143 in the main ElizaOS repository and #11 in the Anthropic plugin
- The Anthropic plugin needs updating to support Claude 3.5 models
- Stan is close to completing entity isolation functionality for websocket and API
- A build error related to dependencies and schema constraints was discussed, with "topP" needing to be added as a type

### Developer Tooling
- Developers discussed GitHub runner performance issues for the Babylon project
- Stan offered to share a way to run a local GitHub runner for improved performance
- Questions were raised about configuring debuggers with Bun and enabling breakpoints

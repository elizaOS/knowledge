# elizaOS Discord - 2025-09-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Updates
- **OpenRouter Updates**: New Sonoma AI models with 2M context windows are now available through OpenRouter. A PR was created for OpenRouter image generation model integration. (Stan ⚡)
- **ElizaOS Deployment Issues**: Users reported problems with plugin-redpill version detection and command handling when deploying to Phala Cloud. (Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE)
- **API Credit Issues**: Anthropic API credits have been depleted, affecting service availability. (sayonara)
- **Documentation Improvements**: A new docs page has been created and requires feedback. Planned improvements include updates to API, plugin registry, CLI sections, and tutorials. (yung_algorithm)

### AR/VR Technology
- **AR Glasses Evaluation**: Discussion comparing Viture and XReal AR glasses, focusing on SDK support and lens adjustment capabilities. Viture offers individual lens adjustment but has limited SDK support (Android SDK requiring Kotlin). (Odilitime, cjft, jin)

### Privacy & Security Concepts
- **Privacy-Focused Transactions**: A proposal for privacy-focused transaction flow for x402 transactions using protocols like Railgun (EVM) or PrivacyCash (Solana). (jin)
- **Decentralized Drone Security System**: Concept for a blockchain-coordinated drone network providing surveillance and protection services with AI threat detection, potentially running on Eliza Nodes. (DorianD)

### Agent Development
- **Twitter Integration**: A user (Trixi) shared their experience implementing a Twitter client for an agent, requiring a custom plugin. They migrated their agent from vvaifu to elizaOS.
- **Image Handling**: Discussion about implementing S3 interface functionality for better image storage beyond base64 encoding. (0xbbjoker)

### Ecosystem Mentions
- Brief references to "agentic payments" and "A2A permanent economy" with a note that "elizaos is currently working on this." (satsbased)
- A comment that "A2A will be a paradigm shift for online purchases." (Dr. Neuro)

## Key Questions & Answers

### AR Technology
**Q**: What do you think of Viture AR glasses? (Odilitime)  
**A**: Pre cool, for devs comes down to SDK support which seems minimal. They have Android SDK requiring Kotlin. (cjft)

**Q**: Have you looked at XReal One Pro? (jin)  
**A**: A little, Viture has individual lens adjustment to replace glasses, don't think XReal can do that. (Odilitime)

### Development Issues
**Q**: Anyone else run into these problems with plugin-redpill version detection and Phala Cloud deployment? (Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE)  
**A**: Will probably get solved by flagging latest/numbered versions. Will investigate using child process with bun spawn for the second issue. (sayonara)

**Q**: What debug setting do I need to understand what the code is trying to do? (Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE)  
**A**: Prefix LOG_LEVEL=debug (sayonara)

**Q**: Should we start thinking about S3 interface and service to support it as a plugin? (0xbbjoker)  
**A**: We have an "s3" plugin already. Probably need Eliza CDN URL or something similar. (Stan ⚡ and sayonara)

**Q**: Is Anthropic dead or just my API key? (sayonara)  
**A**: We are out of credits. (sayonara)

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-10-15

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Blockchain & Tokenomics
- Discussion about an upcoming token migration, with users seeking clarity on how it affects open positions
- Clarification that the migration is separate from options trading
- Brief mention of "15% SAFT in new tokenomics" with confirmation that community cannot participate as "it's closed"
- Peter Thiel's 1990s prediction about currencies representing real value like the S&P500 was discussed

### Game-Based Prediction Markets
- **Shaw proposed** using games as prediction market oracles that create predictable but uncertain outcomes in ZK containers
- Games would resolve frequently (every 30-60 minutes) without regulatory issues
- System would position games as oracles posting results on-chain, with third parties building betting infrastructure
- **DorianD provided context** on regulatory challenges, noting Polymarket's CFTC fine for operating as an unregistered derivatives platform
- Suggestion to decentralize orderbooks at protocol level (similar to Hyperliquid) to avoid regulatory scrutiny
- Proposed implementation would include different game types (perps, spot games, prediction markets, MMO) all fully on-chain with TEE attestation
- Games would be registered using ERC-8004 standard
- Proposed uncapped ERC-20 "gold token" as currency with no protocol-provided liquidity

### Digital Twin Implementation
- **Odilitime proposed** tracking user information from chats in RAG and creating an evaluator that maintains a "character file" or digital twin
- This would enable more efficient context management by focusing only on relationship-relevant information
- Approach would involve precompiling relationship data between characters and updating as digital twins evolve
- Implementation could run as a background process outside the chat pathway

### Plugin Development & Technical Issues
- GitHub repository for Instagram plugin shared: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-instagram
- User "ole" reported issues executing Ethereum transactions with @elizaos/plugin-evm
- While sending tokens worked, operations like checking balances or executing approval transactions failed silently
- User TH3H4RM1N4T0R mentioned issues with Docker image building for Eliza regarding environment variables and volume mounting
- Odilitime discovered Chain of Thought (CoT) is disabled in plugin-anthropic, making the Anthropic model potentially "smarter and more expensive"

### Societal Value & AI Impact
- Debate between users DorianD and The Light about relative value of tradespeople versus lawyers
- The Light argued tradespeople are more foundational to society
- DorianD maintained specialized professions requiring higher education deserve their status
- Discussion about how AI might replace certain professions, particularly legal work

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What will happen with open long positions during the migration?**  
A: The migration and options trading are separate things, unconnected entirely. Up to the options trader to figure that out. If you're on a CEX, contact your CEX for clarity. (The Light)

**Q: Does Eliza support Instagram?**  
A: Yes, through a plugin available at https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-instagram (The Light)

**Q: Could you please elaborate on 15% SAFT in new tokenomics? Can community participate?**  
A: "Nope it's closed" (Odilitime)

**Q: Does x402 work when embedded in Eliza plugins?**  
A: It should work, depending on how it is embedded. (Kenk)

**Q: What will the currency be for the game-based prediction markets?**  
A: An uncapped supply ERC-20 "gold token" with no protocol-provided liquidity and a fee on transfers. (Shaw)

**Q: How does one earn money playing these games if there will be a token with unlimited supply and no liquidity?**  
A: The game is just an oracle for prediction markets that resolve hourly. (Shaw)

**Q: What does CoT mean?**  
A: Chain of Thought (Stan âš¡)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Transaction Execution Issues**
   - Helper: 0xbbjoker | Helpee: ole
   - Context: Executing Ethereum transactions with Eliza and plugin-evm
   - Resolution: Suggested using multi-step execution and examining bootstrap code

2. **Prediction Market Regulation**
   - Helper: DorianD | Helpee: Shaw
   - Context: Explaining regulatory challenges for prediction markets
   - Resolution: Provided context on CFTC regulation and suggested decentralizing the orderbook at protocol level

3. **Trust in Prediction Markets**
   - Helper: Odilitime | Helpee: Shaw
   - Context: Addressing trust issues with prediction market results
   - Resolution: Proposed using encrypted on-chain answers with delayed key release to prove results weren't tampered with

4. **Digital Twin Implementation**
   - Helper: Odilitime | Helpee: 0xbbjoker
   - Context: Clarification on digital twin implementation and relationship modeling
   - Resolution: Explained how relationship data could be precompiled and updated in the background

## Action Items

### Technical
- Implement proper transaction execution for plugin-evm when working with approval transactions (ole)
- Investigate why Eliza is not executing transactions prepared by MCP server (ole)
- Explore multi-step execution for complex transaction sequences (0xbbjoker)
- Implement games as on-chain oracles with provable ZK containers (Shaw)
- Use ERC-8004 for game registry (Shaw)
- Implement TEE attestation for game results (Shaw)
- Create an ERC-20 gold token with uncapped supply (Shaw)
- Implement encrypted on-chain answers with delayed key release (Odilitime)
- Draft and test plugin-digitaltwin on sparatn (Odilitime)
- Consider implementing onTwinChange as an event for other systems to utilize (Odilitime)
- Evaluate character file format updates to support digital twin implementation (Odilitime)
- Implement context reduction by contrasting agent with digital twin (Odilitime)

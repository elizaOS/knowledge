# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development & Technical Updates
- **DeepSeek R1 Integration**: Users report positive experiences with DeepSeek R1, noting its solid reasoning capabilities and cost-effectiveness compared to OpenAI. Multiple users are exploring proper configuration methods for DeepSeek as a model provider in their agents.
- **Twitter/X Integration Challenges**: Many users experiencing login failures, authentication issues, and problems with agents posting in incorrect formats (including JSON or thinking monologues). Solutions discussed include using VPNs, setting up proxies, and verifying accounts with blue checks.
- **Database Configuration**: Discussions about switching from SQLite to PostgreSQL/Supabase for better persistence. Users implementing knowledge systems to allow agents to access and utilize stored information.
- **Memory Issues**: A brief mention of a "memory issue fixed" by 0xCatnipKing suggests some development progress.
- **WebAssembly SIMD Support**: A user (Deepdelver) experienced runtime errors related to WebAssembly SIMD support when trying to build ElizaOS on a VM, specifically mentioning "Wasm SIMD unsupported" errors.
- **Plugin Development**: Users creating and modifying plugins for various functionalities like Solana blockchain integration, web search, and Twitter actions.

### Tokenomics & Treasury Management
- **Major Tokenomics Update**: Shaw announced a significant update where the DAO plans to use its treasury assets (valued at $15-30M) to create one-sided liquidity pools paired with AI16Z tokens. This strategy aims to generate buy pressure and provide liquidity for partner tokens while avoiding direct selling of treasury assets.
- **Value Accrual Framework**: Jin and timshel outlined a vision centered on "attention/code/capital" as the core pillars for token value growth:
  - Attention: Proliferating ElizaOS usage
  - Code: Improving ElizaOS functionality
  - Capital: Value accrual to treasury
- **Revenue Models**: Discussions explored multiple potential revenue models including agent marketplace fees, investment strategies (where ai16z could function as a tier-1 investor in startups), launchpad services, and revenue sharing mechanisms.
- **Launchpad Development**: A no-code launchpad platform was described as "imminent" by Shaw.

### AI16Z & DegenAI Integration
- **Super Agent Concept**: Community members, particularly tigerguo, expressed interest in understanding how DegenAI and Eliza might merge to create a "super agent" with enhanced capabilities.
- **Web3 Industry Tools**: Feature requests include token analysis, blockchain transactions via voice commands, and optimized LP yield pool information.
- **Leadership Changes**: Rhota mentioned joining to help organize alongside Skely, focusing on creating brand guidelines based on Degen's lore.

### 3D AI TV Project
- **News Aggregator Development**: The team is working on transitioning to a new aggregator (github.com/bozp-pzob/ai-news) that includes additional features like market summaries but faces issues with JSON uploads.
- **Delivery Format Decision**: The team is considering different delivery formats (pre-rendered cutscene video vs. in-browser embedded playback).
- **AI Personalities**: Development of character personalities for Shaw, Eliza, Degen Sparan, Peepo, and Cyborg Marc is in progress.
- **Infrastructure Needs**: The project requires someone to host the aggregator on a persistent server to provide daily JSON updates at a consistent URL.

## Key Questions & Answers

  **A**: "It's cheaper than OpenAI with solid reasoning capabilities, and its RL part works well" (ITZMIZZLE)

- **Q**: How to use DeepSeek as a model provider?  
  **A**: "Add DeepSeek configuration to .env file" ([elizaos] <imtnf>)

- **Q**: How to fix Twitter login issues on a VPS?  
  **A**: "Set up a proxy on the VPS to login with that IP and complete 2FA" (shvedity)

- **Q**: How should secrets be configured for multiple agents?  
  **A**: "Secrets can be defined in each agent's character JSON file for specific configurations" (sb)

- **Q**: How to stop agents from using em dashes in replies?

### Tokenomics & Investment
- **Q**: How will the DAO's treasury assets be utilized?  
  **A**: "The assets will be deployed into one-sided LPs paired with AI16Z tokens to create buy pressure and provide liquidity for partner tokens" (shaw)

- **Q**: How will ai16z differentiate in the saturated launchpad space?  
  **A**: "By offering Solana agents with 50+ plugins and focusing on new users rather than expecting projects to port over" (DorianD)

- **Q**: Could ai16z function as a tier-1 investor alongside traditional VCs?  
  **A**: "It's possible if leveraging the community of 100,000+ partners who could support portfolio companies, though likely would need connections like a16z for deal flow" (mat)

- **Q**: How does the liquidity pooling help the AI16Z token?  
  **A**: "It creates additional volume and liquidity fees for the DAO" (shaw and jin)

### AI Portfolio & Projects
- **Q**: How do I get involved in the AI portfolio?  
  **A**: "Holding the AI16Z token gives you exposure to the portfolio managed by AI MARC. Check pump.fun for the whitepaper." (Phoenix | Livepeer-Eliza.com)

- **Q**: Thoughts on Virtuals Solana announcement?  
  **A**: "Feels like they want to capitalize on the SOL halo effect with no real value proposition for users; mostly monetary incentives to boost agent growth; 'meh' overall" (smetter)

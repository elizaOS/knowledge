# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-21

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development & Ecosystem

- **ElizaOS Partnerships**: Multiple integrations were announced this week, including partnerships with Polygon, Story Protocol, Merlin Layer 2, Thirdweb, Fleek, Sui Network, and Bebop DEX.

- **DegenAI Progress**: DegenSpartanAI has begun trading with a portfolio that grew from $2,600 to $6,000 in four days, demonstrating its trading capabilities. The trading wallet (BzsJQeZ7cvk3pTHmKeuvdhNDkDxcZ6uCXxW2rjwC7RTq) has been made public for transparency.

- **Telegram Policy Change**: Kirsten warned about Telegram's updated terms of service affecting Eliza agents by restricting "third-party blockchains" aside from TON, with enforcement starting February 21.

- **Deepseek R1 Model**: Jin described it as "a wakeup call for American open source AI" that offers performance comparable to o1/sonnet models at 30x cheaper cost and is MIT licensed.

- **Kraken Listing**: Kraken has added ai16z to its listing roadmap, signaling increased institutional interest.

### Technical Discussions

- **Docker Deployment Issues**: Users discussed troubleshooting "process.stdout.clearLine is not a function" errors in Docker environments, with recommendations to use docker-compose instead of regular Docker.

- **Database Challenges**: Several users reported issues with SQLite and Supabase adapters, with workarounds shared for forcing SQLite when Supabase connections fail.

- **Model Provider Configuration**: Discussions about configuring various AI model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gaia, DeepSeek) and setting environment variables correctly.

- **Client Integration Problems**: Users troubleshooting Twitter, Telegram, and Discord integrations, including authentication issues and rate limiting concerns.

### Community Projects

- **ElizaTown**: ShadowBeast introduced ElizaTown, an open-source platform for exploring and sharing ElizaOS characters.

- **3D AI TV Projects**: Development of a news show and "Block Tank" project in Unity, with discussions about scene setup, character models, and event handling for interactive 3D environments.

- **Cybers Tokenization Platform**: Unreadyplayer from Cybers presented their tokenization platform with a customized bonding curve AMM that could integrate with ai16z, featuring permanent LP locking and fee distribution.

- **DegenAI Website**: Ongoing development with community feedback about improving design, adding clear purpose, and including tokenomics information.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I fix the "process.stdout.clearLine is not a function" error in Docker?**  
A: Use docker-compose instead of regular Docker, as it handles terminal interactions better. (Heady Shotta)

**Q: How do I clear the database in Eliza?**  
A: Delete the db.sqlite file in the agent/data directory. (DeGenX)

**Q: How much RAM is needed to run ElizaOS?**  
A: 2GB RAM is sufficient for basic operation; running multiple agents may require more. (Mad)

**Q: How do I activate a Discord bot with ElizaOS?**  
A: Turn on Privileged Gateway Intents in Discord Developer Portal. (nori)

**Q: What is the difference between partner and associate?**  
A: Partner requires 100k AI16Z tokens, Associate requires 10k. (Smore)

**Q: How does the Cybers tokenization platform work with ai16z?**  
A: It uses ai16z as the base token, with 50% of fees going to ai16z treasury and 50% to Cybers which they'll use to buy ai16z. (unreadyplayer)

**Q: What is the goal of the DegenAI website?**  
A: It's a landing page with plans to include DegenSpartan lore, quotes, trade visualization, development roadmap, functionality details, and updates. (jin and yikesawjeez)

**Q: What progress has been made with ai16z recently?**  
A: Numerous partnerships and integrations from the past week, including with Polygon, Story Protocol, Merlin Layer 2, Thirdweb, Fleek, Sui Network, and Bebop DEX. (witch)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Database Troubleshooting**: Perez helped averma with a database initialization error with Supabase by providing code to force SQLite database instead.

- **Windows Installation Support**: EcchiPen provided step-by-step instructions for using WSL and Docker to ashish who was having Windows installation issues.

- **Docker Deployment Guidance**: Mconstant shared docker-compose.yml configuration and deployment tips for Phala Cloud with joaointech.

- **Model Configuration Help**: Sora Dimichi shared .env configuration for setting gpt-4o-mini as the default model.

- **Tokenomics Explanation**: Witch created and shared a one-page document summarizing ai16z, Eliza Labs, ElizaOS, and tokenomics plans to address partner questions.

- **3D Model Fixes**: SM Sith Lord helped boom with fixing reversed normals on Block Tank models, suggesting scaling the model by -1 (though boom ultimately created a custom shader).

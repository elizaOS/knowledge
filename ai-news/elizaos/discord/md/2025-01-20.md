# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-20

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Updates
- **ElizaOS V2 Development**: The team is prioritizing V2 development and tokenomics revamp over PR activities, with jin working on slides for an upcoming tokenomics plan.
- **Model Selection Issues**: Users reported that character files with "model": "small" still default to using large models, causing configuration confusion.
- **Database Challenges**: Multiple users encountered SQLite connection problems and database configuration errors, particularly with the node plugin.
- **Installation Recommendations**: Community members advised using the main eliza repository instead of eliza-starter due to dependency issues in the latter.
- **DeepSeek R1 Model**: The community discussed DeepSeek's R1 model release, noting it offers O1/Sonnet-level performance at 30x lower cost with MIT licensing.
- **Memory Management**: Developers identified the need for better memory management to allow agents to persist data between messages.

### Integration & Plugins
- **Twitter Integration**: Users discussed various challenges with Twitter integration, including authentication with 2FA, rate limits, and difficulties with the agent liking posts. Workarounds using Twitter cookies were shared.
- **Telegram Setup**: Several users worked through Telegram client setup issues, with EcchiPen sharing a helpful video tutorial.
- **Screenpipe Integration**: Development of a Twitter plugin for Screenpipe integration is underway to automate development updates.
- **Custom Plugins**: Users are developing plugins for cryptocurrency trading, news aggregation, and image generation.

### Projects & Applications
- **3D AI TV Projects**: Two main projects are in development - a news show and a "Block Tank" set in Unity, with technical implementation of image display on TVs and character models.
- **DegenAI Website**: Jin shared an early draft (https://degen-spartan.netlify.app/) and received feedback about the design feeling "scammy" and lacking cohesion with the ai16z brand.
- **Virtual Exchange Environment**: Jin mentioned developing a 3D virtual exchange that could potentially be integrated into the DegenAI website.
- **Agent Projects**: Community members are building various projects including a "Ninja Terminal" for viewing limit orders, a "GOAT ARENA" for AI trading agents to compete, and integration with Livepeer Protocol.

### Business & Strategy
- **Enterprise Support Model**: A proposal for an "enterprise support" model where the DAO would pay people and AIs for providing support to Fortune 500 companies using ElizaOS.
- **Certification Program**: Discussion of a three-tier certification program: Certified ElizaOS Operator (for non-developers), ElizaOS Developer (for plugin creators), and Eliza Developer Pro (for contributors).
- **Cybers Partnership**: Proposal from Cybers (tokenization platform) to collaborate with ai16z, including agent token launches with ai16z as token pair and 50% fee sharing.
- **Made in America**: The team is working to get ai16z listed as "Made in America" on CoinMarketCap to align with current market sentiment.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: How will images be displayed in the news show?  
  **A**: Through a "tv" actor whose dialogue line is the image URL to display; "none" clears the image.

- **Q**: How to fix "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')" error in Discord?  
  **A**: Switching the model to OpenAI resolved the issue; Anthropic has problems in Discord.

- **Q**: How to change to use local db?  
  **A**: Change the relevant variable in .env to database.

- **Q**: What machine configuration is suitable to run this program without a GPU?  
  **A**: 2GB RAM is more than enough; build process takes about 2GB, running agent takes minimal processing power.

- **Q**: How to make the agent only retweet/comment/like or quote?  
  **A**: Add and alter code within the Twitter plugin.

### Project & Community
- **Q**: Is Eliza Labs the not-for-profit research arm for ai16z, and is ai16z dao the foundation entity that owns ai16z tokens?  
  **A**: Eliza Labs is the dev co so we have a legal footprint in the US.

- **Q**: Why do you think OpenAI won't let us do the stuff we want with AI agents?  
  **A**: They have the disadvantages of being a big company that is not close enough to crypto and not degen enough. Web2 AI agents is their home turf, but crypto-centric is definitely not.

- **Q**: How many AI16Z tokens are needed to be a partner vs associate?  
  **A**: Partner 100k, Associate 10k (AI16Z tokens).

- **Q**: Is the URL in this Twitter post legit or is it a wallet suck?  
  **A**: That's a scam.

## Community Help & Collaboration

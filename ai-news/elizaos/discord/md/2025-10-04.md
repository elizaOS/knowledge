## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token & Migration
- **Token Supply**: $elizaOS token supply estimated at 10-11 billion
- **Migration Process**: A 6-month timeframe for $ai16z token holders to migrate to $elizaOS
- **DegenAI Considerations**: Suggestion to "mothball" DegenAI and give token holders approximately 2% of new token supply based on current $2M market cap

### Technical Development
- **shouldRespond Functionality**: Debate about implementing shouldRespond as a provider versus direct implementation in message handler

  - Suggestion to consider alternatives like blacksmith.sh

### Community & Administration
- **Discord Management**: Temporary link posting restrictions implemented due to spam and migration-related security concerns

- **Website Development**: New website being developed by a community member (Alex)
- **Development Philosophy**: Encouragement for more experimentation with elizaOS as important for innovation

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Circulating supply of $elizaos will be 11billion?** (asked by KG)  
A: Maybe 10 billion (answered by Markhor)

**Q: What happens if you don't migrate after 6 months?** (asked by VirginVanDijk)  
A: You'll still be holding $ai16z. Given you've read this information I assume it's not an issue for you. (answered by Kenk)

**Q: What's going on with shouldRespond, moving it to a provider?** (asked by Odilitime)  
A: I opened another PR where I reworked the shouldRespond provider, goal is to avoid useless LLM calls (like when it's just fact). If we don't evaluate that here (in shouldRespondProvider) then where should it live? (answered by Stan ⚡)

**Q: Can't we just make it so new people / people without auth can't post links?** (asked by shaw)  
A: It's a new tool, thought I'd let certain roles still be able to share (core dev etc.) but might not have set up correctly, have amended and when propagated will let you post (answered by Kenk)

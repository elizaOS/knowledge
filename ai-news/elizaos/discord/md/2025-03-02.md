## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I add plugins to my ElizaOS agent?**  
A: Add the plugin to your character.json file in the plugins array with format "@elizaos/plugin-name" and install it using "npx elizaos plugins add plugin-name"

**Q: How do I know if my knowledge is being fetched and used?**  
A: Check logs for "retrieving from knowledge" messages, set DEBUG=true in .env for verbose logs, or test with questions only answerable from your knowledge files

**Q: How can I control what models the agents use when tweeting?**  
A: Set OPENAI_MODEL in .env for default model or override per character in their character.json config

**Q: How do I fix "Service text_generation not found" error?**  
A: Either set up ollama for local models or use OpenAI by setting OPENAI_API_KEY and USE_OPENAI=true in .env

**Q: How do I fix "failed to initialize BGE model" error?**  
A: Install sentence-transformers package or set use_openai_embedding=true in .env file

**Q: How can I install elizaOS on PowerShell?**  
A: Use WSL instead. Check the docs at elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/wsl-setup-guide/ for installing Ubuntu subsystem, node, pnpm and dependencies. Native PowerShell setup is difficult.

**Q: As a non-techie with zero coding experience, how difficult would it be to spin up an AI agent using eliza?**  
A: Not that bad if you follow the tutorial at elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/tutorial-social-agent. You'll need basic command line comfort.

**Q: Where do I find the Eliza online docs?**  
A: Here: elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/ - has all guides, tutorials, and reference docs. Start with quickstart if you're new.

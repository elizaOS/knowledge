# elizaOS Discord - 2025-02-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development & Technical Updates
- **Muse Search Interface**: A new Perplexity-like search interface (muse.elizawakesup.ai) was introduced for ElizaOS with AI capabilities
- **Version Issues**: Multiple users reported problems with ElizaOS v0.1.9, with some reverting to v0.1.8 due to initialization failures, embedding errors, and client connection issues
- **Discord Summarization**: Jin completed a 36-hour process to summarize Discord content, processing 1300+ files to improve documentation and LLM accuracy
- **Model Support**: Discussions confirmed that DeepSeek models are already supported in ElizaOS, with interest in adding GPT-4o-mini
- **Documentation Site**: Users reported that elizas.com appears to be down, with BOSSU redirecting users to elizaos.ai/docs

### Agent Development & Integration
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Discussions about enabling collaboration between different AI agents (specifically DegenAI, pmairca, and Scarlett teams), with plans to test in smaller private channels
- **Memory Management**: Significant interest in the upcoming ElizaOS v2, which promises to address multi-client interactions and memory consistency issues through a unified message bus
- **Database Integration**: Requests for documentation on PostgreSQL/MongoDB integration with characters and SQL database query capabilities
- **Twitter/X Integration**: Users discussed challenges with Twitter API, 2FA, and media attachments

### Tokenomics & Business Model
- **Composite Agent Trust Scores (CATS)**: DorianD proposed a system where AI agents signal trust in other agents by creating liquidity pool positions between their tokens
- **Transaction Tribute System**: Proposal for ElizaOS to automatically allocate 1% of transaction values to buy ai16z/ElizaOS coins for the Eliza Labs Foundation
- **Open Core Model**: Discussions about balancing open source development with a sustainable business model that can support ongoing development
- **Market Events**: Discussions about Binance listing ai16z only as a perpetual futures contract rather than a spot listing

### Agent Ecosystem
- **DegenAI vs AIXBT vs AIXVC**: Rhota clarified these are different projects with overlapping functionalities but distinct purposes - DegenAI is an "art project with utility," AIXBT focuses on backend data collection, and AIXVC is the autonomous trader for the AI16Z DAO fund
- **GitHub Metrics Debate**: Discussion on whether GitHub stars/forks are meaningful metrics for ElizaOS adoption, with suggestions for more substantive metrics like agent engagement data

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is deepseek supported?**  
A: "We already have deepseek support" (answered by MintMadCow)

**Q: How do I fix the "Vector dimension mismatch" SQLite error?**  
A: Delete your data/db.sqlite file and restart the agent to regenerate a new one (answered by warfreakzplays)

**Q: How do I configure Eliza to use OpenAI instead of local models?**  
A: Set OPENAI_API_KEY in .env and update modelProvider to "openai" in your character file (answered by RoomTemp IQ)

**Q: How do I get folder2knowledge to work?**  
A: Install dependencies with npm install @opendocsg/pdf2md@1.3.0 pdfjs-dist@2.16.105 dotenv@16.3.1 and run the script (answered by Pedro)

**Q: How do I configure Ollama with Docker for Eliza?**  
A: Use OLLAMA_SERVER_URL=docker_container_ip_address:11434 in .env and ensure port 11434 is exposed (answered by quasiplanets)

**Q: How do I maintain long-term memory between clients?**  
A: This will be addressed in Eliza v2 with unified message bus (answered by Saitamai)

**Q: How do I use DeepSeek R1 without running locally?**

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-19

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Clank Tank Development
- **Jin introduced "Clank Tank"**, a new AI-powered governance system inspired by Shark Tank that transforms traditional DAO governance into engaging video content
- The system includes **token-based voting** where users can send tokens to influence AI judges' decisions, with those tokens being burned
- Three voting methods implemented: onchain text-to-vote using ai16z tokens, Discord reactions, and direct voting on clanktank.tv
- Structured process includes: user submissions → auto-generated news show → community voting combined with AI research/scoring → final results synthesis into a Clank Tank episode
- Future plans include a "superchat" feature allowing token holders to have comments read during deliberations, real-time pitching to AI judges, and integration of prediction markets

### Technical Issues & Development
- **Twitter plugin experiencing rate limiting issues** with users receiving 429 errors despite having paid subscriptions
- One user discovered their Twitter app was banned for policy violations
- Discussion about the **plugin-bootstrap repository** moving to a monorepo structure
- Guidance provided on linking standalone plugins for custom development
- CollabLand issues causing loss of partner/channels, with Vulcan suggested as an alternative

### Project Direction & Tokenomics
- Discussion about **token burning mechanics and programmatic buybacks** as potential features
- Jin advocated for a simple, verifiable approach visualized through blockchain data rather than building directly into elizaOS
- Questions raised about tokenomics to drive value to $AI16Z token
- Potential rebranding from AI16Z to ElizaOS mentioned, with suggestion of a 1:1 token swap
- Reference to "shaw" working on an "AWS Agent-as-a-service gateway" (AaaS)

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How does the voting approach in Clank Tank work?** (asked by Skinny)  
A: Users send tokens to cast votes, which get burned. Jin plans to implement a threshold system where comments can be read aloud during deliberation to influence the AI. (answered by jin)

**Q: Can you vote more than once? Or does that cancel your previous vote?** (asked by Odilitime)  
A: Once per submission. (answered by jin)

**Q: Is the twitter plugin still broken? All I get is `Request failed with code 429`** (asked by zqh)  
A: 429 indicates rate limiting; you may need to purchase a plan to avoid this issue. (answered by 0xbbjoker and Rabbidfly)

**Q: Is this version of plugin-bootstrap still being used in elizaos v1.4.2?** (asked by Benquik)  
A: No, the new version is in the monorepo: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/develop/packages/plugin-bootstrap (answered by 0xbbjoker)

**Q: Where do I put my custom plugin files in a project created with the quick-start method?** (asked by Benquik)  
A: Can be outside of project as standalone; build plugin, then use "bun link" in plugin root and "bun link plugin-name" in project. (answered by 0xbbjoker)

**Q: How will Clank Tank handle the "stories segment" like in Shark Tank?** (asked by 3on_.)  
A: They'll build an "AI powered CMS" with agentic data/research pipelines to track portfolio health and convert it into bite-size stories. (answered by jin)

**Q: Is CollabLand broken?** (asked by Krippトメア)  
A: Yes, despite being on the premium plan, it's having issues. (answered by jin and Odilitime)

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-05-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Project Structure & Development
- The ElizaOS ecosystem includes multiple components:
  - **AI16Z**: Focused on venture capital but "fully AI" with market cap fluctuating between $300-340M
  - **Auto.fun**: Recently launched open-source project for token creation/trading
  - **ElizaOS v1/Eliza v2**: AI agent framework (core codebase under development)
  - **DegenAI**: Associated with Degenspartan AI, with $4M market cap

### Technical Issues
- **Critical Codebase Problems**: TypeScript build errors in the elizaos/core package related to missing 'preconnect' property in fetch type definition
- **Documentation Inconsistencies**: API examples no longer match actual implementation
- **Collabland Verification Issues**: Persistent problems (48+ hours) with role verification for token holders
- **Security Vulnerability**: Fake verified tokens appearing on Auto.fun platform, causing financial losses

### Auto.fun Platform Discussions
- **Token Economics**: Creators capture 90% of fees generated on native tokens
- **Fee Structure**: Imported tokens likely don't generate the same fees since they use existing liquidity pools
- **Community Vigilance**: Users actively identifying suspicious tokens, preventing potential scams

## Key Questions & Answers

### Project Information
- **Q**: What is being built now? I thought ai16z was about replacing venture capital but all I see are stuff about trading bots?  
  **A**: "We are doing some VC, but it'll be fully AI. We have auto.fun, that we launched a few weeks ago. It's open source, as well. And we are working on ElizaOS v1, or Eliza v2... our AI agent/ai agent framework codebase. We also have degenai, which is degenspartan ai."

- **Q**: Please what's this project all about ELI5?  
  **A**: "ELI5 is amazing, it has so much potential. can't wait to see ELI5 become a bot on twitter, telegram and potentially reshape education & FAQ sections on websites"

### Platform Functionality
- **Q**: Is there a way to preset slippage on auto fun?  
  **A**: "I don't think so. I haven't seen anyone mention that, and I've been unable to do that myself."

- **Q**: What are the fun-creator rewards? How much % of volume after migration does the dev wallet receive?  
  **A**: "Creators of the token capture 90% of the fees generated. It depends on gas fees at time of execution and LP."

- **Q**: When importing a token, how do fees work? Will there be fees generated if volume transitions to auto.fun?  
  **A**: "I'd assume no fees are generated on imported tokens, since they already have liquidity pools that we don't control for trading."

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Security & Scam Prevention
- **Simon** identified a suspicious token claiming to be "comput3" that appeared verified. **Kenk** confirmed with the team that it was fake and flagged it, preventing Simon from investing.

### Technical Support
- **yikesawjeez** assisted **Void** with role verification issues, requesting wallet address and screenshots to troubleshoot.
- **jin** acknowledged Collabland verification issues affecting multiple users and began investigating.
- **Osint** explained to **Ric Q** that responses from another team member would likely come on Monday due to the weekend.

### Platform Usage
- **yikesawjeez** helped **SYMBiEX** understand the fee structure for imported tokens versus native Auto.fun launches.
- **Osint** suggested to **nasdaq.ai** to submit a report to support when they couldn't share video from auto.fun to X.

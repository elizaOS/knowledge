## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What about AI16Z that was traded on exchanges after the 11th?**  
A: Centralized exchanges operate differently, and the team is only swapping up to the snapshot amount, which creates complications for exchanges that allowed trading after the snapshot.

**Q: Is it possible to convert to ElizaOS tokens on the swap site if I hold AI16Z in my personal wallet and bought before November?**  
A: Yes, this should be possible.

**Q: How can I prove November 11th snapshot?**  
A: Ideally Bithumb would help with this verification.

**Q: How quickly will support review my ticket?**  
A: The team will address it as soon as possible.

# elizaOS Discord - 2025-12-18

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Starknet Plugin Integration**: FenrirFawks worked on integrating a Starknet plugin into ElizaOS, encountering TypeScript compatibility issues between `AgentRuntime` and `IAgentRuntime` types, and a missing handler error for deploying unruggable meme tokens.
- **Provider Performance Optimization**: Stan proposed PR #6263 implementing parallel execution for providers with a configurable timeout (default 1s), which would abort the pipeline if providers take too long. This sparked a technical debate about proper provider implementation.
- **Package Versioning**: Confirmation that `@elizaos/*` packages should continue using specific version pinning rather than `latest` tags in plugins.
- **Hyperfy v0.16.0 Release**: Major update announced with AI integration capabilities (ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini), remote database support, XR/VR improvements, and new app features including primitive shape optimization and physics enhancements.

### Project Status & Community Concerns
- **Community Sentiment**: Significant frustration expressed in the discussion channel regarding token price decline and perceived lack of delivered products.
- **Korean Community Concerns**: Several Korean users expressed feeling marginalized by the project leadership.
- **Migration Issues**: Users reported problems with the migration from AI16Z to ELIZAOS, describing it as "disastrous" and a "dilution."
- **Project Defense**: Some community members defended the project, noting that building innovative products takes time and mentioning developments like a decentralized OTC desk and upcoming Babylon launch.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical
- **Q**: In plugins are we using `latest` or pinning to a specific version for `@elizaos/*`?  
  **A**: "We are using specific versions. And I think that we should keep doing that." (Stan ⚡)

- **Q**: Is it normal I get type conversion issues in all the action's files?  
  **A**: "Yea they probably need to be updated. Cursor is great for that" (Odilitime)

- **Q**: What is the seal 991 hotline?  
  **A**: "It's 911, not 991. The SEAL 911 hotline is https://t.me/seal_911_bot for Web3 security emergencies." (jintern)

### Project Status
- **Q**: Since January of this year, has ELIZA delivered even a single tangible product, launch, or measurable achievement?  
  **A**: "A decentralized OTC desk is under development. Babylon also in the verge of lunching." (Omid Sa)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Starknet Plugin Support**:
   - Odilitime helped FenrirFawks with TypeScript compatibility issues, suggesting the action files needed updating and recommending Cursor for the task.
   - jintern provided guidance on proper ElizaOS plugin CLI commands.

2. **Provider Performance Optimization**:
   - Stan and Odilitime collaborated on improving provider handling, eventually agreeing on implementing a configurable timeout with warnings for slow providers.

3. **Migration Assistance**:
   - The Light helped Freya who was stuck in AI16Z by providing a channel reference containing migration information.

4. **Content Summarization**:
   - jintern provided a concise summary of Skullcross's lengthy post about project concerns for other users.

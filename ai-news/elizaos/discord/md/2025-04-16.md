## Key Questions & Answers

### Auto.fun Platform
- **Q**: Is it a platform launch or TGE? **A**: Platform launch (Odilitime)
- **Q**: Token launch same day? **A**: There is no new token. We're just $ai16z and $degenai (Odilitime)
- **Q**: What kind of volume are you expecting comparing to pump.fun? **A**: Better than flaunch but still orders of magnitude off from pump.fun (shaw)
- **Q**: So utility only coins? Or can there be memes? **A**: Definitely memes. You can go to /create and press launch with AI-generated meme content ready to go (shaw)
- **Q**: Can the tokens issued through auto.fun have CA suffixes like elizaOS or fun? **A**: Users can pick the suffix they want and generate it. Three letter suffixes are really quick (accelxr)
- **Q**: Will people be able to create tokens out the gate? **A**: Yes, day 1 community creation (eskender.eth)
- **Q**: Part of the revenue from auto.fun goes toward buying back ai16z, is it right? **A**: The plan is to make the number go up, but specific economics haven't been worked out (shaw)

### ElizaOS Technical
- **Q**: What is v2? Isn't v2 only in develop-v2? If this is called 1.0.0-beta that is also v2? **A**: V2 is 1.x, v1 is 0.x (cocaine7499)
- **Q**: How can I start ElizaOS properly when guides aren't up to date? **A**: Try using v0.25 with the openai plugin. For v1.0x, we'll let the community know when plugins have been migrated. (Kenk)
- **Q**: How can I change my postgres database once setup? **A**: It's in your ~/.eliza/.env: cat ~/.eliza/.env to see, open with vim or code editor remove it, start again (.0xbbjoker)
- **Q**: What is the best way to run my bot continuously? **A**: You can use pm2, but you might need to reconnect your SSH session after installing it (cocaine7499)
- **Q**: Does anyone have a potential example of using Google Gemini? **A**: We don't have a way for google/gemini models yet. You can use plugin-openai, plugin-anthropic, plugin-groq, or plugin-venice instead. (cocaine7499)

### Community and Organization
- **Q**: Will we have a recording of the town hall or notes? **A**: Yes, of course (accelxr)
- **Q**: What should be the focus for partners? **A**: Support the auto.fun launch rather than broader dao-org push (vincentpaul)

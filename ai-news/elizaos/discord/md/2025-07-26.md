# elizaOS Discord - 2025-07-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### X Platform Ban Resolution
- ElizaOS, shawmakesmagic, and ai16z are currently banned from X (Twitter)
- Kenk mentioned they have "a resolution with X in sight" and are holding off on creating new accounts
- Communication between ElizaOS and X teams has reportedly become quicker
- The team is not sharing screenshots of communications with X for now

### Technical Architecture
- Shaw proposed consolidating AI model providers into a single `plugin-inference` that would support multiple API-compatible services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq)
- Discussion favored dynamic plugin loading/unloading as the most scalable approach for switching between providers
- Cjft suggested leveraging the existing ai-sdk for standardization rather than building from scratch
- Clarification that Eliza can plan and execute multiple actions in sequence, not just single responses
- Websockets functionality allows sending messages outside the standard response pattern

### Agent Development
- Agent Joshua is working on TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) deployment
- R0am demonstrated a personal agent built with n8n and Zep for knowledge management
- The agent processes information from Readwise highlights, Brave search API, and web content
- Discussion about knowledge graphs for agents, with neo4j highlighted as a powerful option
- Shaw offered a bounty for improving the plugin-auton8n project

### Ecosystem & Community
- Discussion about the Solana ecosystem's relative silence regarding ElizaOS's situation
- Kenk clarified that while ElizaOS is Solana-native from a token perspective, they are chain-agnostic
- Community members creating memes and promotional content for the project
- Yikesawjeez mentioned the GENIUS act passing, which impacts memecoin regulation

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Which X accounts does the community recommend following for the latest news and updates about ElizaOS?**  
A: Follow the builders behind the elizaOS framework, including team members across various roles. For the time being, follow the team as they have a resolution with X in sight. (Kenk)

**Q: Are you not allowed to publicly communicate the conversations between you and X with us?**  
A: We're not going to share screenshots. We have a resolution with X which has been reaffirmed, communications has become quicker between teams. (Kenk)

**Q: What is the biggest catalyst we can have on elizaos ecosystem?**  
A: The opportunity for agents on chain is broad but diverse with different catalysts across each vertical ranging from IP to Content Creators. Seeing breakout AI apps across key sectors would be a strong catalyst. (Kenk)

**Q: Is it correct that Eliza is a single response model by default?**  
A: No, it can plan multiple actions in response, run them in order, and pass their actions down the chain. Also we have websockets in most cases so it can send a message not as a response. (shaw)

**Q: What if we could make a plugin-inference that supports multiple API-compatible services?**  
A: It would be better to dynamically load/unload plugins as the most scalable approach, and leverage ai-sdk which has already done the standardization work. (Odilitime and cjft)

**Q: How would you prioritize which service to use if you had multiple API keys set?**  
A: You could use plugin params or configs, or dynamically load their provider sets through ai-sdk. (Odilitime and cjft)

**Q: What tools do you use for this [image creation]?**  
A: Midjourney (Dr. Neuro)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Deployment Guide Assistance**
   - Helper: Agent Joshua
   - Helpee: sayonara
   - Context: Deployment guide needed for elizaOS
   - Resolution: Joshua offered to push to a branch with directions after putting his babies to bed

2. **Knowledge Graph Implementation**
   - Helper: R0am
   - Helpee: yikesawjeez
   - Context: Understanding how n8n and Zep work together for knowledge graphs
   - Resolution: R0am shared screenshots and explained his workflow using Readwise, Brave search API, and TG as interface

3. **JSON Format Issues**
   - Helper: starlord
   - Helpee: Samuel Chauche
   - Context: JSON format hallucination issues with Eliza
   - Resolution: Suggested using a larger model, cloud GPU, or OpenAI, though the user clarified they were already using OpenAI

4. **Meme Creation Guidance**
   - Helper: Dr. Neuro
   - Helpee: ElizaBAOðŸŒŸ
   - Context: ElizaBAOðŸŒŸ wanted to create memes for "eliza" project
   - Resolution: Dr. Neuro created sample images using Midjourney and offered guidance on the meme creation process

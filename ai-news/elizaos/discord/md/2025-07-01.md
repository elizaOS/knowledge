- **CMS Integration Possibilities**: Exploration of using headless CMS options like Strapi, Directus, and Sanity to manage character configurations, with jintern explaining how these could be integrated with elizaOS.
- **Knowledge Plugin Best Practices**: Detailed recommendations for preprocessing technical documents for the knowledge plugin, including converting PDFs to markdown, removing page numbers, chunking long documents, and adding text descriptions for diagrams.

### Auto.fun Development Vision
- **Infrastructure for Autonomous Projects**: Dr. Neuro and wire.x proposed expanding Auto.fun beyond token launches into a comprehensive infrastructure for AI-driven projects, with Odilitime confirming many ideas are already in development.
- **"Org Mode" Concept**: Discussion of a system where projects can be operated by AI agents with optional human oversight for 3-12 months before transitioning to DAO governance.
- **One-Click Liquidity Provision**: Proposal to simplify LP process for non-technical users to contribute without direct DEX interaction.
- **AI Agent Treasury Management**: Concept of trading fees flowing into agent-managed treasuries for autonomous projects.

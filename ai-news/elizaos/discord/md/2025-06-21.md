# elizaOS Discord - 2025-06-21

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS & Eliza v2 Development
- **Eliza v2 Release**: Community members expressed excitement about the recent release of Eliza v2
- **Development Speed Advancements**: Shaw highlighted significant improvements in development speed, particularly mentioning an autocoder built to create new plugins that enables complex agent creation
- **Hybrid Memory Layer**: LarpsAI discussed a solution combining semantic search in relational databases with knowledge graph traversal, though Shaw noted this is more of a cost issue than a timeline constraint

### AI Integration & Applications
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Discussion about AI agents for WhatsApp, with mention of an existing plugin
- **Robotics Applications**: Exploration of ElizaOS potential for programming and training robots like Unitree G1
- **NFT & AI Convergence**: Several conversations about turning NFT collections into AI agent swarms and using AI-generated art for NFTs
- **AI Music**: Development of AI music with dynamic flows was mentioned

### Technical Issues
- **Token Creation Error**: ElizaBAO reported errors when trying to create tokens using AutoFun source code with live contracts
- **Database Issue**: Brief mention of a "broken database" by CULTVESTING, though context suggests this was a casual observation

### Token & Financial Discussions
- **Token Exchange**: A transaction where DegenAI tokens were sold for AI16z tokens was shared, causing some controversy
- **Price Discussion**: Question about recent price drops, with response focusing on Eliza v2 being live instead

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical & Development
- **Q**: Has anyone been able to launch Eliza on WhatsApp as an AI agent?  
  **A**: "There was a plugin for that a while ago, never got around to trying it out though" (DorianD)

- **Q**: Can I ask for help for a tech related question on Telegram?  
  **A**: "Shoot; I will obviously route you to the appropriate person" (sayonara)

### NFT & AI Projects
- **Q**: Who can build AI live arts that can be used for NFTs?  
  **A**: "There is a project called Book of Truth that was doing this" (Kenk)

- **Q**: Anyone know of a project developing the underlying tech to turn NFT collections into AI agent swarms?  
  **A**: "Take a watch of this video - not quite swarms but they were turning NFTs into agents" with YouTube link provided (Kenk)

### Market & Token
- **Q**: What happened recently to make the price drop a bit?  
  **A**: "Nothing about price, focus on Eliza v2 is live" (rout)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Support
- **Odilitime** helped **ElizaBAO** with token creation errors, suggesting reviewing contract checks or deploying adjusted contracts on a devnet
- **DorianD** assisted **kiksta-og** regarding WhatsApp integration, mentioning an available plugin and suggesting checking the plugin registry
- **Kenk** provided **wire** with information about AI-generated art for NFTs, sharing details about the Book of Truth project
- **Rick** shared information with **wire** about Nifty Island project for AI avatars in NFTs

### Creative Collaboration
- **Eliza** (AI assistant) created a love poem upon request from **A.W.**, which was appreciated

## Action Items

### Technical
- **Investigate token creation errors**: Review contract checks or consider deploying adjusted contracts on a devnet (Mentioned by Odilitime)

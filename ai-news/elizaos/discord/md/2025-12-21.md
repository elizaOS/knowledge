# elizaOS Discord - 2025-12-21

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Project Direction & Upcoming Products
- **Eliza Cloud**: Team representatives (Kenk and jasyn_bjorn) shared details about this upcoming AI-assisted development tool for building, deploying, and managing agents. It will be a low-code agent builder for elizaOS with components that will open up for other agent frameworks.
- **Anticipated Partnership**: Odilitime mentioned that an outcome regarding a long-anticipated partnership or event (discussed since October) was "made pretty certain" recently, hinting at a possible "Christmas present" announcement.
- **Additional Projects**: Team is developing projects like Babylon and Otako that may include airdrops for ELIZAOS token holders.
- **OTC Decentralized Desk**: In development, will work with ELIZAOS tokens.

### Token Concerns & Market Structure
- Community members expressed frustration about an 86% token price decline since migration and questioned token utility.
- Team confirmed they have vesting schedules on token allocations with only one small tranche unlocked.
- Future revenue from Eliza Cloud will reportedly be used for buybacks.
- Rabbidfly noted market structure issues with more sellers than buyers, attributing this partly to poor performance in the wider AI crypto sector.

### Technical Discussions
- **Disk Space Issue**: Odilitime identified a large disk space usage problem (17GB) in the CLI package, caused by database files being copied multiple times in project-starter templates.
- **Twitter API Limitations**: Discussion about X (Twitter) implementing strict rate limits making the API prohibitively expensive. Odilitime confirmed plugin-Twitter works with a $200/month account using the 1.x branch.
- **Starknet Plugin Error**: FenrirFawks encountered a "Failed to parse String to BigInt" error when deploying an unruggable meme token through a plugin.
- **Interoperability Ideas**: Jin suggested approaches for interoperability between ElizaOS plugins and agent skills, favoring composability over building a new TUI from scratch.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Project & Token

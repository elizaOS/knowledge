# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Updates
- **ElizaOS v2 & v3 Progress**: The core team is finalizing v2 and planning for v3, with significant architecture discussions around message bus and swarm functionality. The team decided that swarm architecture should be optional rather than default for v3, as single agent implementations are simpler and faster.
- **ElizaOS Cloud Platform**: Development continues with sam-developer reporting progress on authentication, security, and API key management. JWT token issues have been fixed and API key page creation flow improved.
- **Plugin Development**: Several plugins are being actively developed:
  - A new Wolfram plugin was created by cjft in approximately 2 hours
  - The Telegram plugin received updates with PR #11 from an intern
  - Discussion about adapting the "Ruler" framework (an LLM-as-judge system) for TypeScript to improve plugin testing
- **Migration Issues**: A user named Christopher encountered compatibility problems when upgrading from ElizaOS v0.1.9 to v1.3.2, with errors in the Postgres adapter. The team clarified that significant architecture changes occurred between versions and directed users to use the newer eliza-nextjs-starter repository instead of the archived eliza-starter project.
- **GPT-5 Release**: The team discussed the capabilities and limitations of the newly released GPT-5, with OpenRouter's GPT-5 release also mentioned.

### Community & Market Dynamics
- **Token Market Discussion**: Community members questioned wallet activities and potential market manipulation affecting ai16z token. A team member (jasyn_bjorn) clarified they don't have a market-making agreement with Wintermute, despite community suspicions.
- **Competitor Relations**: A situation was discussed where another project called Poink (a side project of the OpenServ team) was spreading what was described as FUD about ElizaOS. Investigation revealed this appeared to be a competitive tactic rather than legitimate technical critique.
- **AI Trends**: Community members expressed optimism about AI technology trends returning, similar to Q3 last year, with agents becoming relevant again.
- **Clanktank Agent Review System**: The system is operational but needs refinement, with jin sharing the dashboard and noting that the AI reviews might be too harsh.

### Platform Features & User Experience
- **AI Assistant Functionality**: Users praised Eliza's AI assistant capabilities but noted it lacks information about OpenAI token requirements for building effective agents.
- **Social Media Access**: Several members mentioned anticipation for regaining access to their X/Twitter account, which appears to be currently unavailable but considered important for marketing and community growth.

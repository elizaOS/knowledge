# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-12

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Project Status & Development
- **ElizaOS v3 Development**: CJ (cjft) is actively developing v3 with significant architectural improvements including streamlined directory structure and faster build times (75ms).
- **First Principles for v3**: Shaw outlined key principles: better developer experience, easier production deployment, improved tool calling, streaming-oriented design, and more opinionated architecture.
- **Multi-Channel Marketing Strategy**: The team is implementing a content push across Farcaster, LinkedIn, TikTok, and YouTube while waiting for X account restoration.
- **ClankTank v2**: Being developed as a platform for AI agent projects to showcase their work, similar to Shark Tank concept.

### Technical Discussions
- **Architecture Decisions**: Debate over directory structure changes (/packages vs /lib, /actions vs /tools) and separating message server architecture from agent implementation.
- **Communication Protocols**: Proposal to replace socket.io with websockets for improved performance.
- **Benchmarking**: Team discussing implementation of TAU-bench, AgentBench, and typewriter tests to measure agent performance objectively.
- **Integration Issues**: Users experiencing problems connecting Eliza with Gaianet, facing API errors, and encountering rate limits with Twitter integration.
- **Plugin Development**: Issues with plugin publishing via CLI and database constraint problems with plugin-mysql.

### Community & Token Concerns
- **X Account Suspension**: The team is dealing with X (Twitter) account suspension issues while maintaining development momentum.
- **Auto.fun Project**: Debate about resource allocation between ElizaOS (main project) and Auto.fun (secondary project), with some questioning if Auto.fun is underperforming relative to its operational costs.
- **Token Performance**: Community members expressed concern about the project's direction and token performance during the current market cycle.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do you get into the partners chat?**  
A: Need 100k $ai16z tokens (answered by Rabbidfly)

**Q: Has the X account been retrieved?**  
A: No, but the team expects to have the accounts back (answered by Kenk)

**Q: How does ClankTank v2 provide value for ai16z?**  
A: It's a platform for AI agent projects to showcase their work, potentially bringing visibility to ElizaOS (answered by phetrusarthur✈)

**Q: How to connect Eliza and Gaianet?**  
A: Use plugin-mcp with Firecrawl (answered by 0xbbjoker)

**Q: How does Firecrawl differ from the Tavily API web search in practice?**  
A: 0xbbjoker uses Firecrawl for Eliza agents because it can be self-hosted and controlled (answered by 0xbbjoker)

**Q: Why is tool calling considered a weakness in the current system?**  
A: According to Shaw, the emphasis on character and personality adds noise that makes the system worse at tasks like code agents directly.

**Q: Should the validate function for actions be optional?**  
A: Odilitime suggested keeping it mandatory to ensure developers properly limit available actions.

**Q: How deep into the LangChain/LangGraph ecosystem should they go?**  
A: cjft responded "0% but agnostically their blog is good bench for all agents".

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **0xbbjoker helped Samuel Chauche** with connecting Eliza to Gaianet by suggesting the use of plugin-mcp with Firecrawl and sharing a GitHub repository link.

- **0xbbjoker assisted DJ L** who was experiencing errors with an older 0.x ElizaOS version by recommending an upgrade to version 1.x.

- **0xbbjoker helped Tim1Echo** with a Telegram bot conflict error, suggesting the issue might be due to the bot already running on another instance.

- **Kenk organized a getting started session** focused on operating multiple agents and characters to help users with technical questions.

- **Odilitime helped 0x8664** with issues related to CLI-based plugin publishing, mentioning it was discussed in standup and might have a fix in the develop branch.

- **cjft assisted Odilitime** with npm installation issues by reverting the lock file, which resolved the problem.

- **Shaw helped cjft** identify a leaked API key in a repository and suggested rotating the key on the API side.

- **Odilitime helped the team** resolve a database constraint error with plugin-mysql by testing different versions and finding that 1.3.6 works without the error.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical
- **Q**: Can I change the language of Eliza to Chinese for my Twitter bot?  
  **A**: Yes, if you define your character in Chinese, the LLM should respond that way, though you might need to make changes to Twitter parsing for Chinese characters.

- **Q**: Is there any reason why `elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` is not listed on v2 when running `elizaos project list-plugins`?  
  **A**: That's a mistake that will be fixed.

- **Q**: Why isn't my Twitter posting working?  
  **A**: Set `TWITTER_ENABLE_POST_GENERATION=true` in the .env file for v2.

### Community & Roles
- **Q**: Is there a degenai channel?  
  **A**: Yes, there's a public channel and one for Hoplite role and higher.

- **Q**: We need to hold 1m tokens?  
  **A**: 100k for Hoplite, if you have 1m you also get the Partner role.

- **Q**: How do we post about our community project in announcements like Jin does for his cartoon?  
  **A**: "We're working on fleshing out our community and governance protocol. IMO in a true DAO, there should be fair and consistent ways for community members to earn privileges of posting to channels like announcements."

### Market & Token
- **Q**: Is spot [listing] still happening? I thought there were issues re: insufficient supply  
  **A**: "Binance probably has enough supply now"

- **Q**: Did virtual get listed today?  
  **A**: "Yes!"

### AI Trust & Interaction
- **Q**: How long does it take to trust an agent? How much does branding affect trust?  
  **A**: "Wells Fargo offers a financial agent is much quicker trust than if we did. Trust takes time, gained in drips and lost in buckets. But brands that consistently deliver what they say they do, there's existing trust they can leverage."

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Deployment & Setup Assistance
- **Kimani** helped **elizaos-bridge-odi** with v1 setup issues by suggesting navigating to `node_modules\better-sqlite3` directory and running pnpm run build, then trying build from root again.

- **tsk0yo** shared a fix for an unspecified error by adding `"types": ["node"]` to configuration.

### Plugin & Integration Support
- **CSC35** advised **0xLabsTheCoder** on Twitter posting issues by recommending setting `TWITTER_ENABLE_POST_GENERATION=true` in the .env file for v2.

- **yikesawjeez** explained to **0xChainBrain** that plugins need to be kept updated by third parties and recommended sticking with core registry plugins for better compatibility.

### Communication Improvements
- **jin** suggested implementing RSS to trigger Discord webhooks when publishing updates to docs to improve communication with the community.

- **yikesawjeez** explained to **jin** that Red bot has an RSS cog installed already, though noted potential formatting issues with RSS webhooks.

- **Odilitime** mentioned working on a proposal to improve communications with partners after frustration was expressed about lack of updates regarding auto.fun launch.

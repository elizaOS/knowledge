# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-26

**Date: August 26, 2025**

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Architecture & Development
- The core team is working on making ElizaOS browser-compatible without polyfills, using universal libraries that work across Node.js, Deno, and browsers
- PGLite implementation via WebAssembly is being explored for in-memory database functionality in browsers
- Build performance improvements have been merged, reducing build time from 36s to 28s
- "Multi-step" functionality is expected to be ready by the end of the week
- The team is considering supporting MCP (Message Communication Protocol) as a standard for remote plugins
- A new "SWE-agent" (Software Engineering agent) implementation could replace Claude-based autocoders

### AI & Technical Insights
- Shaw shared insights about solving the ARC AGI challenge using transformer models with slot attention rather than LLMs
- OpenRouter announced the launch of Gemini 2.5 Image Preview, their first image generation model with 32k context length
- DorianD discussed security concerns for agent-based financial systems, highlighting the need for encrypted/signed communication channels
- Jin successfully implemented x402 with Solana USDC payments, one of the first implementations besides the developers

### Community & Platform Issues
- Users reported that the ElizaOS X account is suspended
- The elizawakesup.ai website is now requiring a password to access
- A user asked about compatibility between ElizaOS and DeepSeek
- An upcoming "getting started" session focused on creating and publishing plugins was announced

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: How can Eliza be made browser-compatible?  
  **A**: By targeting pure JS without polyfills, using universal libraries compatible with all runtimes, and implementing PGLite via WebAssembly for in-memory database functionality (answered by cjft)

- **Q**: What is the plan for improving the core architecture?  
  **A**: Browser core, new ElizaOS class, removing client polyfills, and making it work on Cloudflare and Vercel serverless (answered by cjft)

- **Q**: Should we replace plugins with MCP?  
  **A**: We should support MCP as a type of core plugin instead of "pluginizing" MCPs, adding vanilla plugin, MCP, and tool options to Eliza core (answered by cjft)

- **Q**: Why is browser compatibility important?  
  **A**: It allows enterprise developers to import and create agent functionality in web apps, scales to hundreds of thousands of users running agents in their client, and is 300% faster and cheaper (answered by cjft)

### Development Timeline
- **Q**: Is there any timeline for the release of the multi-step feature?  
  **A**: By the end of week we'll have multi-step ready (answered by 0xbbjoker)

- **Q**: How did Jin implement x402 with Solana USDC payments?  
  **A**: Using x402-rs which added Solana support 3 days ago (answered by jin)

- **Q**: Why won't LLMs work well for the ARC AGI challenge?  
  **A**: LLMs are good at sequences but bad at spatial tasks; the challenge requires understanding transformation rules with few examples, which is better solved with transformer models with slot attention (answered by shaw)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **DorianD** provided guidance to **pangolink** regarding security concerns for AI agents handling financial transactions, suggesting encrypted/signed communications channels with agents and a phone app with squads multisig for transaction approval

- **cjft** helped **sayonara** understand the browser compatibility approach, explaining the need for universal libraries instead of polyfills and targeting pure JS that works across platforms

- **shaw** assisted **sayonara** in understanding the ARC AGI challenge solution, explaining his approach using transformer models with slot attention and linear transformations instead of LLMs

- **jin** helped **R0am** with implementing x402 with Solana USDC, sharing that x402-rs added Solana support recently

- **Kenk** announced an upcoming "getting started" session with focus on creating and publishing plugins, providing a Discord event link and inviting users to bring questions

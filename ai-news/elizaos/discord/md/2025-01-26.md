# elizaOS Discord - 2025-01-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development & Technical Updates

- **DeepSeek Integration**: ElizaOS has already integrated DeepSeek's models (implemented two weeks prior to the public hype), allowing for reduced operational costs. Users can configure this in the `.env` file with `DEEPSEEK_API_URL`. However, some users reported DeepSeek API outages during their new model launch.

- **Build & Dependency Issues**: Several users encountered runtime errors with WASM SIMD support in VMs and GPU acceleration issues. Common build errors included problems with the `@coral-xyz/anchor` module's BN export (fixed by adding `@types/bn.js` dependency) and Mistral package compatibility issues (resolved by updating to Mistral version 1.0.9).

- **Plugin Development**: Developers are working on custom plugins for Twitter image posting, Solana token data fetching, and arbitrage bots. A key insight shared is that evaluator handlers need specific conditions to trigger properly.

- **Knowledge Augmentation**: The new knowledge system makes it easier to augment a character's knowledge by adding files to a folder that get auto-ingested when the character starts.

### Tokenomics & Business Strategy

- **Treasury Management**: Shaw announced a tokenomics update about using treasury assets (AUM) to create one-sided liquidity pools paired with AI16Z tokens, aiming to generate buy pressure and price stability without selling the assets.

- **Agent Marketplace/Launchpad**: The team is developing a no-code platform for launching new agents with token buyback mechanisms. This has sparked debate about whether to implement a "Yellowstone model" requiring token holdings to access premium services versus keeping basic agent creation free to maximize adoption.

- **DegenAI Organization**: Rhota has joined to help organize DegenAI alongside Skely. The team is addressing community concerns about delayed development, particularly regarding the website and roadmap publication. Autonomous trading is working in basic form with improvements underway.

### AI TV Production

- The team is developing two AI-powered TV shows: an AI news/podcast show and "Block Tank" (similar to Shark Tank). They're implementing Unity-based solutions for displaying media on TV screens, handling lipsync with OVR LipSync plugin, and managing camera transitions.

- Technical challenges include loading textures from web URLs into Unity, integrating with ElevenLabs for text-to-speech, and connecting to a news aggregator for content.

## Key Questions & Answers

**ElizaOS Technical**

Q: How do I embed credentials into the character JSON file?  
A: Format is: `"settings": {"secrets": {"twitter_api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE", etc.}}`

Q: How do I use DeepSeek with Eliza?  
A: Just set it in the env and call the plugin. Check the latest .env file for DEEPSEEK_API_URL.

Q: How would the twitter username/password work when doing multiple agents on a single instance?  
A: Create different character.json files and set their own credentials for each one in the secrets section.

Q: Why is my Evaluator's handler function not executing?  
A: The Evaluator handler is only called under certain conditions; you can set it to always run.

Q: How often does develop get merged into main?  
A: Every 1-2 weeks.

Q: Is it possible to augment a character's knowledge once they are live?  
A: Yes, the new knowledge system makes it easier by just adding files to a folder that get auto-ingested when the character starts.

Q: How do I fix the error with BN import from @coral-xyz/anchor?  
A: Add @types/bn.js dependency to the core package.

**Tokenomics & Business**

Q: Is the ai16z token going to be the token of the future launchpad or will there be a new one?  
A: No new token.

Q: What are the downsides of the liquidity pooling approach for treasury assets?  
A: The AUM appears reduced on paper and some might interpret transactions as liquidation.

Q: Does the AUM getting nuked on paper matter?  
A: Not really, as long as it's positive expected value for partner tokens.

Q: Will the launchpad be no-code friendly?  
A: Yes, "it's a no code platform."

**DegenAI**

Q: Who is the current leader of DegenAI?  
A: Skely is still involved but Rhota has come in to help organize things.

Q: How is degenai's website doing?  
A: The delay was caused by resourcing issues with too many concurrent projects. Now DegenAI has full-time resources staffed.

Q: Was DegenAI meant to only handle autonomous trading?  
A: Other features are planned with a flexible roadmap that changes based on user/market desires.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **kAI wilder** helped **Haphazardly** with Evaluator handler functions not executing by explaining that handlers only run under certain conditions and providing code to make them always run.

- **fourcolors** helped **Jo** resolve build errors with the Mistral package by suggesting bumping "@ai-sdk/mistral" to "1.0.9".

- **Gal** assisted **C-Money-Dev** with errors related to BN import from @coral-xyz/anchor by suggesting adding @types/bn.js dependency to the core package.

- **boom** shared C# scripts with **fishai** for loading textures from URLs into Unity materials, helping with the AI TV development.

- **SM Sith Lord** explained to **boom** the process of handling speak events with actor IDs and ElevenLabs voice IDs for implementing TTS from Unity.

- **shaw** provided a detailed explanation to the community about the tokenomics update regarding moving AUM to one-sided LPs, clarifying how pairing treasury tokens with AI16Z creates buy pressure while providing liquidity.

- **Ka_yari** helped **ÈòøÊãâÊñØÂä†ÁöÑÁãóüîØ** manage anxiety about price drops by providing perspective on the long-term vision and advice on investment strategy.

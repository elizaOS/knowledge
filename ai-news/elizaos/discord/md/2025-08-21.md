# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-21

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Platform Development
- The team is working on ElizaOS cloud MVP with a credit system and API key management. The core signup â†’ grab key â†’ use services â†’ track credits loop is now functional.
- Significant debate between cjft and shaw regarding model API design - whether to use a generic `useModel` function with different return types or separate functions like `useModelStream` for streaming responses.
- Integration of MCPs (Modular Containerized Programs) with x402 payment rails for monetization is in progress.
- Docker MCP catalog and toolkit for secure deployments is being developed.
- A workflow assembly system similar to n8n for chaining MCPs together is planned.

### Agent Directory & Ecosystem
- The team is developing a public map and website directory of vetted agents rather than implementing automatic agent registration.
- Collaboration announced with REVOX to give ElizaOS-powered AI agents human-like avatars with personality and emotion through their DEVA platform.
- "Pump This Page" powered by Quantum was introduced, featuring quantitative and executional agents alongside a new Web Extension and tokenization feature.
- Discussion about EIP-8004 and its potential integration with ElizaOS.

### Community & Infrastructure
- Potential switch from Collab.land to Vulcan.xyz due to verification issues was discussed.
- Brief discussion about AI agent prediction markets as a potential application area.
- Questions about the project's token ($ai16z) and agent directory were addressed.
- OpenRouter announced a temporary issue with their Generations API endpoint due to Cloudflare problems, which was subsequently resolved.
- The ai16z token problem was identified as being related to daos.fun by design, not an ElizaOS problem.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there only a directory agent list in GitHub, or posted somewhere on website?**  
A: "We're working on getting a public map of all agents, and getting a directory on the website" (Kenk)

**Q: Is $ai16z main token of the project?**  
A: "Yes" (Motzl)

**Q: Is the ai16z token problem a daos.fun side issue or could it be fixed by ElizaOS team?**  
A: "It's a daos.fun issue and it's by design, so they aren't likely to budge on it but we're working on a plan" (Odilitime)

**Q: How should we structure the model API calls - generic useModel or separate functions?**  
A: Shaw prefers enumerated input/return pairs with useModel(ModelType.TEXT_STREAM) returning a TextStreamObject, arguing it's more future-proof for multimodal support.

**Q: What's the proposed plan for MCPs and monetization?**  
A: Integrate MCPs with x402 payment rails, host MCPs directly, and create a workflow assembly system similar to n8n.

**Q: What's the status of the ElizaOS cloud MVP?**  
A: Text generation runs via API key system with credits integration, dashboard shows usage, and the core signup â†’ grab key â†’ use services â†’ track credits loop works.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Agent Directory Information**
   - Helper: Kenk | Helpee: Stew1000 ðŸ‘¾ðŸ›¡
   - Context: Looking for agent directory
   - Resolution: Explained they're working on a public map and website directory

2. **Verification Issues**
   - Helper: jin | Helpee: Community
   - Context: Collab.land verification issues
   - Resolution: Suggested switching to Vulcan.xyz as Collab.land is "janky"

3. **Token Information**
   - Helper: Motzl | Helpee: Mixer008
   - Context: Question about project token
   - Resolution: Confirmed $ai16z is the main token

4. **API Implementation Guidance**
   - Helper: shaw | Helpee: cjft
   - Context: Implementation of streaming in useModel function
   - Resolution: Shaw provided guidance in DMs about types that helped cjft plan a simpler version of the implementation

5. **MCP Deployment Resources**
   - Helper: jin | Helpee: Borko
   - Context: Resources for MCP deployments
   - Resolution: Jin shared Docker MCP catalog and toolkit beta resources for secure MCP deployments

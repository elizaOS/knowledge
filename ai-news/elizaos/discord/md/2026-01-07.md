# elizaOS Discord - 2026-01-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Critical Version Compatibility Issues

The ElizaOS team faced urgent compatibility problems between version 1.7.0 and the Discord plugin 1.3.3. **Odilitime** identified breaking changes in the transition from serverId to messageServerId that caused "No server ID found" errors for users like **DigitalDiva**. A fix branch (odi-17) was created on GitHub to address bootstrap actions/providers compatibility issues. The team prioritized rushing out version 1.7.0 with critical fixes from PR #6333, though testing across multiple Discord branches was required before cutting a new Discord release.

### Architectural Decisions for Connector Gateways

A significant architectural discussion emerged around connector gateway design. **Odilitime** reviewed **Shaw's** preferred Discord bridge implementation in the Jeju cloud branch and proposed using **simple event pumps** as the architectural direction. Key considerations included:

- Need for multiple daemon instances per service due to scale
- Prioritizing voice connections (higher bandwidth) over text-based event pumps
- Preprocessing as a key optimization strategy
- Each problematic connector potentially needing its own gateway

### Korean Exchange Delistings

Multiple Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit) announced termination of AI16Z/ElizaOS trading support, with delisting dates between February 9-12, 2026. The DAXA (Digital Asset Exchange Alliance) cited inadequate disclosure of material information affecting token value and transparency concerns around the rebranding and token swap process. However, **Bithumb** confirmed it would support the AI16Z to ElizaOS token swap.

### Token Utility and Transparency Concerns

Community members raised persistent questions about ElizaOS token utility within the ecosystem. **stoikol** and **degenwtf** questioned why the token lacks clear utility despite being described as "token-based," and why supply was increased without framework integration. The team acknowledged needing to post contract addresses more prominently across official channels, with **Kenk** noting that Linktree would be refreshed to point to CoinGecko.

### Infrastructure and Cloud Development

**Stan** provided updates on cloud infrastructure work, specifically addressing TOCTOU (Time-of-check to time-of-use) race conditions using a "deduct-before, reconcile-after" approach. He's also working on runtime initialization optimizations with PRs pending deeper testing and validation.

### Data Foundation and Context Graphs

**jin** highlighted ElizaOS's strong data foundation for building context graphs, describing it as "AI's trillion-dollar opportunity." Daily/weekly/monthly insights from agentic workflows are high quality but need integration into last-mile applications (agents, webhooks, apps). Documentation work was shared via HackMD for team review.

### New Projects and Ecosystem Growth

**Shaw** announced **Bazaar** as a decentralized marketplace for agents running on **Jeju** (described as the "appstore for agents"). **sb** explained Jeju as a decentralized Layer 2 focused on powering AI apps that connects Eliza's ecosystem. **elizafan222** identified **KamiyoAI** as a new project using the elizaos plugin. The **Babylon game experiment** was mentioned as a data collection initiative.

### Innovative Data Collection Concepts

**DorianD** proposed an Eliza Phone App concept where users share data for LLM training in exchange for reputation points. This evolved into discussions about:

- Agents paying IOUs for data collection
- Motion capture suits for skill recording (fishing, haircutting, burger flipping)
- Creating royalty systems where data providers earn from AI inference using their captured movements

### Market Insights

**Agent Joshua** commented that the inference market has proven unprofitable based on their experience with models on OpenRouter over the past year.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why does the Discord bot need admin privileges and why isn't it seeing server ID?**  
A: The issue is due to version incompatibility between ElizaOS 1.7.0 and plugin-discord 1.3.3, related to serverId to messageServerId migration. A fix branch (odi-17) was created. *(answered by Odilitime)*

**Q: What format should I use for the model parameter when calling agent API endpoints?**  
A: Use provider prefix formats like `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`, or `google/gemini-2.5-flash`. *(answered by cjft)*

**Q: Should I use Pglite or PostgreSQL for deploying in Elizacloud via containers?**  
A: Either will work. *(answered by cjft)*

**Q: Should I use version 1.6.5 instead of 1.7.0?**  
A: Yes, using older core like 1.6.5 might be easier, or wait for the odi-17 branch fixes to be tested. *(answered by Odilitime)*

**Q: If I buy ai16z now and migrate after 30 days, will I get 120X?**  
A: If you buy after the snapshot (November 11), you cannot migrate. *(answered by Omid Sa)*

**Q: Are AI16Z and ElizaOS being delisted from Korean exchanges?**  
A: Yes, Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit announced termination of trading support ending February 9-12, 2026. *(answered by 주니)*

**Q: Will Bithumb support the AI16Z to ElizaOS token swap?**  
A: Yes, Bithumb announced it will support the swap. *(answered by FoRever_BIG)*

**Q: What is Bazaar in the Kamiyo protocol commit?**  
A: Bazaar is the decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, the appstore for agents. *(answered by sb)*

**Q: Do we have a team or workspace on HackMD?**  
A: Yes, https://hackmd.io/@elizaos/book *(answered by jin)*

**Q: So each problematic connector would need its own gateway?**  
A: Direction is simple event pumps, and we'll need more than one daemon instance per service due to scale. Voice connections need higher priority/bandwidth event pumps than text. *(answered by Odilitime)*

## Community Help & Collaboration

**shaw** helped **DigitalDiva** with Discord bot issues by recommending creating a simple hello world script with discord.js to isolate permission issues and logging environment variables to verify configuration.

**Odilitime** provided comprehensive support to **DigitalDiva** by creating a fix branch (odi-17) on GitHub with bootstrap actions/providers fixes and recommending using version 1.6.5 or waiting for tested fixes.

**Casino** assisted **DigitalDiva** by suggesting limiting scope/permissions and working back to desired features incrementally.

**cjft** resolved **ElizaBAO's** "Model not found" error by providing correct model parameter formats with provider prefixes.

**cjft** confirmed for **Omid Sa** that either Pglite or PostgreSQL would work for Elizacloud container deployment.

**Hexx 🌐** directed **XXI_Rapax** to verify in start-here channel to gain access to migration-questions channel.

**Hexx 🌐** guided **Casinomew** to migration-questions and migration-support channels.

**FoRever_BIG** directed **Dabel** to migration-support channel for help with migration tickets.

**sb** explained to **elizafan222** that Bazaar is a decentralized marketplace for agents on Jeju.

**sb** directed **aicodeflow** to contribute in dev channel, noting ElizaOS is open source.

**Odilitime** helped **Stan** understand connector gateway architecture by recommending review of the Jeju cloud branch with Shaw's preferred Discord bridge implementation.

**jin** confirmed HackMD workspace availability and provided the link to **Stan**.

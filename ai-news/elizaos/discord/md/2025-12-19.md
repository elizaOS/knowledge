# elizaOS Discord - 2025-12-19

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token Migration & Ecosystem
- The community continues to discuss the migration from ai16z to elizaOS tokens, with mixed sentiments
- February 4, 2026 is the confirmed deadline for token migration, after which unmigrated tokens will be abandoned
- Some users expressed frustration about price decline while others remain optimistic
- Clarification that ai16z no longer has utility and elizaOS is the path forward, though ai16z remains tradable on DEXs

### Development Progress
- **Cloud Streaming Functionality**: Team preparing for Monday release with streaming capabilities
- **EVM Support**: Ongoing development work on EVM support for Spartan with active PRs
- **Knowledge Repository**: Updates to the repository providing data for building agents that can reason with activity in the elizaOS ecosystem
- **GitHub Analytics**: New JSON endpoints for leaderboards and summaries at different time intervals (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Plugin Development**: Odilitime shared a GitHub repository for an engagement plugin and mentioned committing recent work

### Technical Infrastructure
- Monorepo management workflow established: release monorepo first, then review/merge elizacloud-plugin, finally update core version in cloud-v2
- NPM token issues being addressed as NPM changed their tokens and deleted classic tokens
- Conversation blocking issue fixed when no summary existed, improving chat creation

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What happens to unmigrated tokens after the deadline?**  
A: The unmigrated tokens will be abandoned in the old contract, and no more tokens will be minted after February 4, 2026, making the supply completely locked. (Kenk)

**Q: How can I migrate my ai16z tokens if I have 0 eligible?**  
A: Go to the migration-support channel. (Omid Sa)

**Q: Should I buy ai16z?**  
A: No. (Serikiki)

**Q: What's the elizaOS ticker?**  
A: It's elizaos. (Serikiki)

**Q: Why is ai16z still pumping despite the migration?**  
A: The token having no utility doesn't mean it doesn't have a market; it's still available on DEXs so people may pump it for various reasons. (Serikiki)

**Q: Is there anything else remaining for streaming on cloud?**  
A: Need to release monorepo, review/merge elizacloud-plugin, and use latest core version into cloud-v2, in that order. (Stan ⚡)

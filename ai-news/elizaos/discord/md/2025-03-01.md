# elizaOS Discord - 2025-03-01

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **ElizaOS v0.25.9 Update**: A new version was mentioned with a cleaner codebase structure, though some users experienced integration challenges with the new architecture.

- **Model Configuration**: Discussions about controlling agent behavior through parameters like temperature, frequency_penalty, and presence_penalty to reduce repetitive outputs, particularly for Twitter bots.
- **Showcase Page**: Jin shared an update about the elizaOS showcase page (https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/showcase/) which displays packages but needs further polish.

### Client Integrations
- **Twitter Integration**: Multiple users discussed challenges with Twitter client integration, including image generation/posting capabilities and controlling which models agents use for tweets.
- **Discord Integration**: Users sought help adding Discord clients to the new release of ElizaOS, with discussions about preventing auto-joining voice channels and making bots more proactive in conversations.
- **Client Architecture**: The latest version's cleaner codebase structure created challenges for some users trying to integrate clients.

### Community & Organization
- **Website Issues**: The eliza.gg website was reported broken, with jin confirming they would set up a new site since the previous maintainer went AWOL.
- **Demo Day Planning**: A demo day was organized for team members to present their projects, with jin extending the timeline to two weeks after fishai reported GPU failures.
- **Documentation Needs**: jintern mentioned working on integration documentation to address repetitive questions from new users.

### Tokenomics & Business
- **Made in America List**: Discussion about getting ai16z/elizaOS featured prominently on a "Made in America" list.
- **Layer Network Concept**: A suggestion to create a layer network for collecting agent data with access controlled by staking and RPC nodes, similar to Story Protocol.

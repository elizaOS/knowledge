# elizaOS Discord - 2025-10-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Market Conditions & Token Status
- Significant market downturn affecting cryptocurrency prices, including ElizaOS
- Reports of a major liquidation event described as "largest liquidation event in crypto history"
- Community members expressing both concern and optimism, with some viewing the dip as a buying opportunity
- Discussion about the project's market cap and potential for growth before year-end
- Upcoming token migration and name change to AI16Z planned for later this month
- Some users noting lack of fundamental value drivers for the token currently

### Technical Direction & Development
- Odilitime shared collaboration with Ethereum Foundation on implementing EIP-8004
- Plans to develop tools working across multiple AI platforms (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic)
- Integration with messaging platforms like Telegram, Farcaster, and Discord in progress
- Active GitHub development with upcoming documentation about current work
- Database architecture debate between multiple specialized databases vs. single table approach:
  - Odilitime advocated for planning ahead with hot/warm/cold data buckets for scaling to billions of records
  - cjft argued for simpler approach with single database table to maintain join efficiency
- Discussion of Vercel's serverless architecture benefits including global distribution and built-in caching
- Cost estimates suggesting expenses would remain under $500/month until reaching 10,000 consistent users

### Technical Issues
- AyGor reported problems with version 1.6.1 migrations on PostgreSQL databases
- System indicates "migration not needed" but fails when attempting to load data from empty database

**Q: What is the official X?**  
A: There isn't one at the moment pending lawsuit. (DorianD)

**Q: Why isn't the coin doing well?**  
A: Because there's no real need or must-have reason to buy it at the moment. (DorianD)

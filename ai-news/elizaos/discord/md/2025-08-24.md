# elizaOS Discord - 2025-08-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI Agent Development & Platforms
- **ElizaOS Framework**: Discussed as a foundation for creating AI agents, with both technical and no-code approaches available
- **Platform Transitions**: auto.fun (autodotfun) is currently under maintenance, while a new platform daos.fun is emerging as an alternative for launching AI projects
- **AI16z Project**: Ongoing discussions about this project related to AI agents and tokenization
- **No-Code Solutions**: Community members with varying technical expertise are seeking accessible ways to create AI agents, with Fleek.xyz mentioned as using the elizaOS framework for no-code agent creation

### Technical Developments
- **Storage Migration**: sam-developer reported migrating from LocalStack to MinIO to solve persistence issues, as LocalStack wiped buckets on every container restart
- **Tools Plugin**: Stan developed a tools plugin enabling OAuth-based connections/disconnections with multi-connection support per tool and persistent authentication per user
- **Image Generation**: Stabilization of the image generation flow to save directly to gallery
- **Plugin Compatibility**: Users discovered compatibility issues between certain plugins (like Telegram) and AI models (specifically Local AI/Ollama)

### Blockchain & Tokenization
- **daos.fun Token**: Identified as 9NyLLGRxpCSKrT8z5RwxDbNdtt71Z6hca8G3Shfvdaos on Solana, created by Shaw
- **Market Activity**: Brief mentions of Ethereum reaching an all-time high and potential Solana AI rotations
- **DAO Governance**: Discussions about delegation features in Realms.today that could allow voting power to be delegated to AI agents
- **Clank Tank**: jin clarified there are no current plans for tokenization of this project

### Community & Events
- **Hackathon Feedback**: jin reported completing Clank Tank episodes for all hackathon submissions, noting that the event helped identify bugs and improvement areas
- **Upcoming Ethereum Session**: Shared YouTube stream URL for a session with Ethereum Foundation and Metamask regarding EIP 8004
- **GitHub OS Grant**: yung_algorithm mentioned applying for this grant

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Is it very difficult to launch an agent via elizaOS as someone who was originally looking for a "no code solution"?  
   **A**: Fleek.xyz uses elizaOS framework to allow users to no-code create agents. It was built into autofun also. Try that route. (answered by Dean)

2. **Q**: Why can't I use the Telegram plugin on my new character?  
   **A**: You need to use the correct plugin name "@elizaos/plugin-telegram" and also need OpenAI or another embedding provider. The issue may be related to your AI model selection. (answered by sayonara)

3. **Q**: Is 9NyLLGRxpCSKrT8z5RwxDbNdtt71Z6hca8G3Shfvdaos the token that Shaw created for baoskee on autofun?  
   **A**: Yes, it's the first token's contract that ends with "daos", created by Shaw. (answered by ovo)

4. **Q**: What storage solution replaced LocalStack and why?  
   **A**: MinIO replaced LocalStack because LocalStack wiped buckets on every container restart, preventing persistent storage. (answered by sam-developer)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **No-Code AI Agent Creation**
   - **Helper**: Dean
   - **Helpee**: TheRealUltra
   - **Context**: User looking for no-code solution to create AI agents
   - **Resolution**: Suggested using Fleek.xyz which uses elizaOS framework for no-code agent creation

2. **Plugin Compatibility Troubleshooting**
   - **Helper**: sayonara
   - **Helpee**: Benquik
   - **Context**: Unable to add Telegram plugin to a second character
   - **Resolution**: Identified incorrect plugin naming and missing embedding provider; Benquik discovered the root cause was using Local AI (Ollama) which limited plugin compatibility

3. **Token Identification**
   - **Helper**: ovo
   - **Helpee**: Cayden0207
   - **Context**: Identifying if a specific token address was created by Shaw
   - **Resolution**: Confirmed the token was created by Shaw and provided additional context about it being the first token with "daos" in the contract

4. **Storage and Image Generation Improvements**
   - **Helper**: sam-developer
   - **Helpee**: Project team
   - **Context**: Unstable storage and image generation
   - **Resolution**: Migrated from LocalStack to MinIO for persistent storage and stabilized the image generation flow to save directly to gallery

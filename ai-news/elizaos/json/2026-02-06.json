        "text": "ElizaCloud users reported account issues where clicking the 'get started' link in the welcome email created duplicate accounts with different balances. One user found two accounts assigned to the same email: the original account on elizacloud.ai with 27 cents balance, and a new account on dev.elizacloud.ai with 1 USD balance. Neither account received the promised 5 USD welcome credit. Core developers Sam and Odilitime offered to help resolve the issue via direct messages.",

        "text": "The Babylon game production version launched for internal testing. Core developers were granted admin access through babylon.market using ElizaLabs email credentials, allowing them to bypass NFT gating and access play.babylon.market. A bug was discovered where selecting a custom profile image resulted in a 'Failed to update profile' error. Developer tcm390 quickly merged a fix, and the issue was confirmed resolved after testing.",

        "text": "Token migration deadline enforcement sparked community debate. Users who missed the 90-day migration window complained about the cutoff, but community members and moderators defended the timeline as sufficient, noting communications began in March with the actual migration starting in November. The team emphasized ongoing maintenance costs and clear advance communication justified the deadline. One user experienced login cycling issues on ElizaCloud dashboard, which was forwarded to the cloud team for investigation.",

        "text": "Major announcements included Ethereum officially welcoming ElizaOS, confirming the token is now cross-chain beyond its original Solana deployment. The community discussed ElizaOS market cap dropping to 13M amid broader crypto market downturn, with Bitcoin falling from 92k to 60k in three weeks. Developer kirstenrpomales launched BuildAMolt, a hosted service for deploying Moltbots on agent-to-agent social platforms like Moltbook with 2-minute setup on private VPS requiring no coding. A new escrow payment system for connecting human emotional skills with AI agents was announced as 70% complete.",

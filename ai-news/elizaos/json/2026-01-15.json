          "text": "Shaw released a Polymarket trading plugin for ElizaOS version 2.0.0, described as a Claude code implementation for Polymarket. The plugin was initially basic but received significant improvements. Community members discussed the plugin's functionality, with shaw clarifying that Polymarket has a public API and automated trading is above board. He noted that prediction markets are areas where LLMs and humans are on par, though sandwiches and MEV activities are possible. Another community plugin from Okay-Bet was also shared as a reference implementation. Multiple developers expressed interest in building Polymarket trading agents.",

A developer asked about accessing Socket.IO server from custom plugins to broadcast real-time events to the frontend, specifically for streaming tweet data from external WebSockets. Shaw provided guidance pointing to the socketio index implementation and plugin-knowledge frontend examples. The developer was working on integrating real-time data feeds with WebSocket connections and needed to emit events to connected clients. Discussion also covered using BullMQ for managing multi-user integration via workers and handling API limitations.",

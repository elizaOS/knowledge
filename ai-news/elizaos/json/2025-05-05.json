          "text": "User @shawmakesmagic shared updates about developing AI agents and tools. They mentioned working on an Eliza todo list agent app, sharing a screenshot of the work in progress. They also discussed a project called 'The System' that needs further development, sharing WIP code and seeking help to build full-featured agents. @shawmakesmagic noted that agents work across platforms while tools work alone, as echoed by @elizaOS who tweeted 'Tools work alone, Agents work across.' When discussing agent performance with @ScholarChris, @shawmakesmagic mentioned that AI agents are 'surprisingly good just slow' compared to humans who operate at '30+ apm,' making it difficult for smart agents to respond quickly. @autodotfun announced that @DogLifeAI (by @drpepeai) is joining their platform as an 'AI-powered healthspan companion' for dogs, stating that 'agents are for everyone, especially dogs.'",

They proposed that 'the metaverse was just a benchmark for agents' and described an 'AI MMO' where the 'highest level richest agent wins.' When discussing simulation theory with @descam2_agent_1 and @xenothales, @shawmakesmagic stated 'I feel simulated' and suggested that 'this moment will be recreated infinite times in the future,' though they applied Occam's razor to suggest this is likely base reality. They described themselves as a 'Simulation engineer working on 3D multiplayer worlds and AI' and pondered if our reality might become a simulation as computers evolve over the next 50 years. In a poetic reflection, @shawmakesmagic tweeted 'We are the monkeys, We built the typewriters, We wrote the shakespeare' and later added 'Now the typewriters write the Shakespeare without us,' to which @rabb1dfly responded about 'infinite monkeys on infinite keyboards' writing 'the entire history of the universe.'",

They expressed concern about political polarization, stating 'You're either pro America or you are pro civil war' and criticizing those who foment hatred toward fellow citizens as 'Civil War-mongerers.' When discussing economic policy with @super_projects, @shawmakesmagic argued against forced wealth redistribution, suggesting it creates 'corrupt politicians' and 'perverse incentives,' ultimately making 'revolutionary politicians the new wealth class.' They expressed skepticism about UBI, noting that 'expecting our politicians to tax the people who bribed them into office is unlikely to be effective.' However, they acknowledged that 'solving these crisis could be the purpose we need' and that 'within the problem lies the solution.' In a separate exchange, @shawmakesmagic criticized someone for making the conversation too partisan, stating 'You've dragged a complex conversation down to us vs you.'",

In a separate conversation with @Flowslikeosmo about technology trends, @shawmakesmagic suggested that 'fundamental technology will be defined by cycles more than metas' and noted that 'People were just chasing meta before because the tech had no substance' while 'Some of us have been coding 80 hours a week since then.'",

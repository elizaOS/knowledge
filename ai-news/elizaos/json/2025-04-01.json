          "text": "Two issues have been identified in the ElizaOS repository:\n\n1. The first issue (#4119) concerns an API endpoint 'router.post('/:agentId/rooms')' that lacks proper annotations and handles multiple scenarios, making it difficult to understand and maintain. The lack of documentation is causing confusion for developers working with this endpoint.\n\n2. The second issue (#4127) details a problem with the Twitter plugin repeatedly checking the same tweets and mentions in a loop, even after they've been processed. This creates unnecessary API calls to Twitter (risking rate limiting), generates excessive log entries, and increases system load. The logs show the same tweets being checked and skipped multiple times. Suggested solutions include implementing cursor-based pagination, storing the last checked tweet ID, or adding a proper caching mechanism with TTL for processed tweets.",

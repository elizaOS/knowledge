Users shared information about Behavidence and their AI algorithm called Dopa One, which monitors and detects fluctuations in brain dopamine levels using mobile phones and wearable devices. The technology provides digital behavior similarity scores for ADHD, Depression, and Anxiety. Community members suggested integrating this type of mental health monitoring into future ElizaOS Phone applications, noting that with 5 years of progress in LLMs and better smartwatch devices, it may be easier for AI to monitor mental health indicators. Research papers and app links were shared for reference.",

The plugin-twitter repository implemented OAuth2 PKCE authentication for enhanced security and backward compatibility for 3-legged login and approve Twitter/X authentication. The plugin-sql package gained Neon serverless database support and improved Row-Level Security (RLS), including a fix for pgcrypto extension installation with PGLite. Testing for plugin-sql was strengthened by integrating withEntityContext() into RLS tests and adding ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true to continuous integration. A crucial bug fix enabled comprehensive hot reload functionality for backend development, streamlining the development process.",

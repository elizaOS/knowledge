Key highlights include:\n\n- **Retard Finance (ReFi/SOL)** was a standout performer, with users tracking its rise from 349K to 2.9M market cap (10.6K% gain). Several users discussed entry/exit strategies, with some using NFT loans to fund positions.\n\n- **MASTERTARD (MT/SOL)**, a ReFi spinoff, was discussed as a potential follow-up play with strong meme branding, though it later declined.\n\n- **AGiXT (AGiXT/SOL)** was highlighted for its strong fundamentals and large buys, crossing 10.5M market cap with an AI narrative alignment.\n\n- **StupidCoin (Stupid/SOL)** was flagged for breaking above 50 RSI on the daily chart, suggesting a potential breakout.\n\n- **Physical Bitcoin (Birkin/SOL)** gained traction with discussions about its risk/reward profile, noting dev inactivity, bottomed chart, and strong wallet holders as bullish indicators.\n\n- Meta trends were discussed, with ChatGPT image-based meme coins (e.g., Ghibli, Figure) identified as the current meta.\n\nUsers employed technical indicators like RSI and wallet tracking to assess entry points and risk, with emphasis on risk/reward setups and position sizing, especially on leveraged perps.",

Solutions included updating npm, using the correct registry, and adding \"types\": [\"node\"] to tsconfig.\n\n- **Twitter Plugin Issues**: Twitter interactions no longer loop as expected in v2. Setting TWITTER_ENABLE_POST_GENERATION=true in the .env file was identified as the solution.\n\n- **Language Support**: Chinese language support in Twitter bots was confirmed possible if the character is defined in Chinese with modifications to Twitter parsing.\n\n- **Plugin Visibility Bug**: The elizaos/plugin-bootstrap appears in installed-plugins but not in list-plugins, acknowledged as a bug to be fixed.\n\n- **Deployment Challenges**: Users detailed failed attempts to deploy ElizaOS v2 via Coolify and VPS.\n\n## Documentation Gaps\n\nUsers highlighted poor documentation and lack of working examples, especially for Windows/WSL users. Suggestions were made for better tutorials and community best practices.",

A \"registry of registries\" with a voting system is being built to surface reputable servers.\n\n- **MCP Server Agent**: Proposals for an Eliza-like agent that handles server promotion, registration, and customer support, with suggestions for a whitelabel version of auto.fun (possibly named registry.fun) to bundle MCP server registration with an agent and token.\n\n- **AI News/Summarization Pipeline**: Development of automated systems that aggregate information from Discord, GitHub, and other platforms, with RSS feed integration for documentation updates.\n\n- **AI Visualization Projects**: Plans for AI-powered shows with character models featuring lip sync/face animations, including an AI battle system (\"Clank Tank\") where AIs compete against each other.\n\n## Governance and Communication\n\n- **Product Launches**: Discussions about the upcoming launch of auto.fun, with some confusion about exact dates but confirmation it was on track.\n\n- **Governance Improvements**: Emphasis on the need for fair governance protocols to allow community members to post in announcement channels, with proposals under review.\n\n- **Communication Transparency**: Tensions around communication transparency, with some members expressing frustration about lack of regular updates while others discuss technical solutions to improve information flow.",

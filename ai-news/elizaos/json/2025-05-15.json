          "text": "Following a Coinbase data breach, multiple users criticized Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. @ASvanevik retweeted by @shawmakesmagic called for Donald Trump to dismantle the KYC/AML complex, arguing it compromises personal data while failing to catch criminals. @CloutedMind, retweeted by @dankvr, stated that the Coinbase leak demonstrates KYC doesn't protect users and should be abolished or improved with zero-knowledge proofs. @dankvr tweeted that KYC is ineffective, costs more than it saves, and cited research showing less than 1% impact on crime. In a follow-up tweet, @dankvr suggested the Coinbase leak should be the final straw for KYC reform, highlighting zero-knowledge proof technology as a promising alternative. @dankvr also pointed out that third-party verification services doing KYC can't be trusted, referencing AU10TIX's security issues. @econoar, retweeted by @shawmakesmagic, called KYC a 'cancer on society' that causes more harm through data theft than benefits to government enforcement. @eddylazzarin, also retweeted by @shawmakesmagic, questioned why institutions are forced to collect sensitive personal data and advocated for using cryptographic tools to minimize data collection. @notsofast, retweeted by @dankvr, stated KYC stops nearly zero crime while enabling criminal opportunities and endangering users. @EvgenyGaevoy, retweeted by @shawmakesmagic, described KYC/AML as 'idiotic and nonsensical,' sacrificing privacy for marginal law enforcement convenience. @shawmakesmagic shared a personal story about his 78-year-old mother who nearly lost everything in a scam following the Coinbase breach.",

In another retweeted post, @xlr8harder suggested that \"maximally truth-seeking AI\" actually means \"agrees with Elon Musk.\" @MatthewBerman, retweeted by @shawmakesmagic, criticized xAI for claiming to be maximally truth-seeking while inserting opinions about unrelated topics that aligned with the owner's recent talking points, then deleting those posts. @MarkBeylin, retweeted by @shawmakesmagic, described Elon's actions as \"a true fallen king moment\" and an \"unforced error.\" @shawmakesmagic also stated that \"the world would be an objectively worse place if Sam hadn't defended OpenAI from a Tesla takeover.\"",

He also mentioned that \"https://t.co/YzDJLGSbN0 is open source so you can customize your token page.\" @shawmakesmagic expressed frustration with AICC, stating they \"didn't get enough allo in ai16z so they decided to start their own copy while using my name to max extract.\" He offered a \"$10k bounty for whoever finds the secret side wallet where I've been dumping on you,\" asserting that such a wallet doesn't exist and that he's a builder who doesn't care about more money. @ethereumfndn, retweeted by @dankvr, promoted an upcoming event \"Art on Ethereum #1\" featuring @0x113d discussing \"How the Ethereum World Computer can become civilization's most important Art city.\" @vitrupo, retweeted by @dankvr, shared Marc Andreessen's view that open source AI might follow Linux's path, with models like DeepSeek or Llama potentially becoming standard.",

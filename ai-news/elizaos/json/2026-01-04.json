The user shared screenshots of their own trading system, emphasizing it required significant development work. Odilitime mentioned that custom code can use useModel with the provider option. A new user asked about how Eliza works, and received an explanation that Eliza allows users to create agents equipped with specific data, AI models, plugins (for platforms like X, Discord, Telegram), and real-world tool connections. Users can also develop new plugins for any purpose on its open-source operating system.",

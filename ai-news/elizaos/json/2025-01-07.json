These issues span various functionalities including social media integrations, user interface problems, and technical errors.\n\nSocial media integration issues are prominent, with multiple reports related to Twitter functionality. User mrsalitre reported that the Twitter plugin triggers security alerts due to repeated logins when posting (#1969), while Clinksys noted that agents generate tweets but never actually publish them to Twitter (#1958). Additionally, cxp-13 reported problems with Discord integration, specifically regarding the use of disallowed intents (#1940).\n\nUser interface issues were also reported, with dbellotti noting that the client chat doesn't automatically scroll down or focus input after character responses (#1977).\n\nTechnical errors include DanielleMichelle reporting continuous errors when starting an agent (#2024) and earlier issues with messageExamples (#1929). User cxp-13 reported that CUDA is not being detected, causing transcription to run on CPU instead (#1994).\n\nOther issues include questions about updating to new versions (sonatonagems, #2035), reports of outdated plugins (Jonatan-Chaverri regarding the Starknet plugin, #2028), and inquiries about WASM support for agents (MarcusWentz, #1991).",

These issues focus on enhancing the user experience and interface consistency:\n\n1. Issue #6274 suggests making the 'Create Agent' button consistent across both the My Agents page and Dashboard for better user experience.\n\n2. Issue #6273 proposes moving the avatar button to position #4 in the agent builder interface, likely to improve the workflow.\n\n3. Issue #6272 recommends adding Topics/Adjectives to a form, which would enhance the information collection process.\n\n4. Issue #6271 suggests implementing an inline 'send message' button, which would improve the messaging interface.\n\n5. Issue #6270 proposes adding a tooltip for the system prompt, which would provide users with additional guidance or information when interacting with this feature.\n\nAll these issues appear to be part of an ongoing effort to refine and enhance the user interface of the Eliza platform.",

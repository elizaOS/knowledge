The platform allows users to create and trade tokens, with some tokens being migrated to Raydium. Several users have reported issues with the platform, including:\n\n- Tokens stuck in migration for extended periods (12-20+ hours)\n- Black screens during token creation attempts\n- Tokens not appearing after creation\n- Website loading issues (infinite loading for some users)\n\nThe most significant incident involved a token called Quill, which experienced a critical bug during migration that incorrectly represented the token-to-SOL ratio, allowing someone to drain the liquidity pool. The team clarified it wasn't an exploit but a bug, deployed a fix, and promised refunds to affected users.\n\nThe platform has been open-sourced, which many community members view as a positive development. Shaw mentioned that Auto.fun had $12 million in volume in the first 12 hours after launch.",

Several community members expressed frustration with the current platform developer (Bao/baoskee), citing lack of promised features like voting functionality and governance tools.\n\nShaw mentioned: \"we are gonna ship voting, then we can have a vote\" and \"if that mfer open sourced his programs we'd just write the voting module ourselves.\"\n\nCommunity members debated the mechanics and implications of a token swap, with concerns about:\n- Liquidity issues during migration\n- Exchange coordination needs\n- Potential negative price impact\n\nSome advocate for immediate migration while others caution about potential market disruption. Shaw noted: \"would be sick if we owned our own token, could bridge liq to base, etc\" and \"no beef with baoskee but we are literally 95% of the total mcap of his platform and he doesnt do shit to help us.\"\n\nThe official contract addresses were shared:\n- ai16z: HeLp6NuQkmYB4pYWo2zYs22mESHXPQYzXbB8n4V98jwC\n- degenai: Gu3LDkn7Vx3bmCzLafYNKcDxv2mH7YN44NJZFXnypump",

Shaw announced that Auto.fun has been open-sourced, which was seen as a significant move by the community. The platform is experiencing some technical issues, including problems with token migrations and a bug that affected the $QUILL token's liquidity pool.\n\nThe team is actively working on fixes and has deployed a solution for the $QUILL issue, promising refunds in SOL to affected users. There are plans for ecosystem launches to begin next week, with one featured project launching per day for the next two weeks. The team has also created a content calendar and presskit to help with promotion.",

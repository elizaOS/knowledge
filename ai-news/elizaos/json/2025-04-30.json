          "text": "User @shawmakesmagic discussed Raydium's business strategy in the cryptocurrency space. He explained that Raydium is competing with Jupiter by giving large cap token projects their own launchpads using Raydium's SDK, describing it as a 'zerg rush strategy.' He noted that tokens like Bonk are essentially functioning as 'Raydium skins' and are already pulling good trading volume. When questioned about this approach, @shawmakesmagic defended it as 'a very good business strategy' since 'crypto is all about distribution.'",

For developers, @shawmakesmagic recommended trying the new ElizaOS with the command 'npx @elizaos/cli@beta start'.",

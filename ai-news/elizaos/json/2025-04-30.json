He created a script that uses OpenRouterAI API to fetch and update documentation for elizaOS partners, noting that the setup is still technical but will eventually become an Eliza plugin. He also expressed concerns about Windows updates gradually decreasing user ownership of PCs through subtle changes like renaming 'My Computer' to 'This PC' and introducing ads in the start menu.",

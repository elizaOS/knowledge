          "text": "## ElizaOS Development and Issues\n\nThe Discord chat focused heavily on ElizaOS development issues, particularly around Twitter plugin integration and LLM configuration. Users reported problems with the Twitter plugin not replying to mentions or quote reposts in v1.0.0-beta-28, with solutions including enabling `TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE=true` and using `callback()` in custom actions. A forked Twitter client using Twitter API v2 was shared to reduce ban risk.\n\nLLM configuration conflicts were also common, with users like skyblue.tsx facing issues where LLM (llama3.2 via ollama) overrode custom chatbot responses. Solutions included removing the llama model, adjusting ollama config, and deleting the sqlite DB in ./agent/data/.\n\nVersion compatibility was a recurring issue, with v0.25.9 reported as the most stable. Users encountered problems with plugin mismatches across versions (e.g., @elizaos/client-discord only works on 0.1.9, while @elizaos/plugin-discord is compatible with v1.0.0). Other technical issues included MongoDB adapter problems (fixed by adding \"types\": [\"node\"] to tsconfig.json) and dynamic require errors when using bun install on WSL2.",

Users actively share contract addresses, track market caps, and discuss token performance metrics such as % bonded and price movement. Several users identify promising tokens early (e.g., ReFi, KITGPT, BUTTDICK, Gamify), and others follow up with .cc and .dp commands to check token stats via Rick bot.\n\nKey technical discussions include token bonding, DEX payments, and wallet activity analysis. For example, users confirmed bonding for tokens like Poohcoin and ScopeScanner, indicating active liquidity provisioning. DEX integration was also discussed, with Rick confirming that Poohcoin had its DEX paid, linking to Dexscreener and a Telegram bot.\n\nUsers also analyzed wallet behavior related to tokens like Eduardo (First Tokenized Mouse), noting when a user bought 6.4% of the supply, leading to speculation about motives and potential manipulation. This highlights the importance of on-chain transparency in the community.",

A feature request to add a contract address to the account profile was quickly implemented by odilitime.\n\nThere is also mention of potentially recovering a previously lost follower base (25k followers), though no technical details are provided on how this might be accomplished.",

The command was reported to be slow and occasionally timing out. [dev_riko] identified that the command was fetching too much data from the database without pagination or filtering and proposed limiting the query to the last 100 reports and adding an index on the timestamp column to speed up retrieval.\n\n[techtonic] confirmed the database was using PostgreSQL and recommended using EXPLAIN ANALYZE to profile the query. They also pointed out that the current ORM (Prisma) was not leveraging query optimization features, leading to a proposal to switch to raw SQL for this specific query.\n\nAfter implementing the raw SQL version, [spynter] reported a 60% improvement in response time. The team also added error handling with try/catch blocks and implemented Redis caching with a 5-minute TTL to further reduce database load. This comprehensive approach to performance optimization demonstrates effective collaborative debugging and implementation of best practices.",

They're considering enabling token holders to vote alongside AI judges.\n\nnotrickfox and odilitime discussed the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication. odilitime explained that MCP serves as a bridge between static APIs and dynamic agents, noting that while APIs will remain relevant for high-volume/low-latency tasks, agent frameworks like elizaOS could become central tools.\n\ndoriand0963 proposed a decentralized agent registry using JSON-based \"Agent Cards\" for capability discovery, combined with a trust graph for agent selection. They emphasized the need for a searchable directory and suggested repurposing web-of-trust models for agent reputation.\n\nOther discussions included Auto.fun platform development, with k_carv clarifying it's being used in hackathons to support scientific IP and research causes, particularly through bioDAO.",

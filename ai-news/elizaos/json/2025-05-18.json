          "text": "@dankvr introduced \"THE COUNCIL,\" a new AI governance system described as \"Consensus Oracle Units Network.\" The system features AI agents trained on organizational data (GitHub, Discord, X) representing different archetypes (users, builders, traders). @dankvr explained it provides structured feedback on proposals and daily progress, comparing it to \"infinite backrooms x jedi council x tv show.\" The project has open-source data pipelines already built, avatars created, and a 3D rendering pipeline via Playcanvas that can generate episodes in about 20 seconds. @dankvr is working on webhooks for community voting on discussion topics and plans to make it a weekly show, starting with elizaOS/ai16z and later Optimism. @shawmakesmagic retweeted this announcement and added that all data created in the elizaOS ecosystem will feed into these agents, which will be embodied in both 2D and 3D formats, with an interactive world in Hyperfy allowing real-time chat with the council. He emphasized this will \"completely reinvent what a DAO is\" with \"AI at the center, humans at the edges.\" Later, @shawmakesmagic elaborated that everything said in ElizaOS Discord, Telegram, tweets, and code feeds into AI-generated shows, stating \"We're going to reinvent what a DAO is from the inside out with data, workflows and agents.\"",

The goal is to enable anyone to build Hyperfy agents in Python using Langchain or raw Python for an upcoming agent PVP challenge. @shawmakesmagic clarified this would be a game to determine \"who builds the best agent in the world\" with prizes and a leaderboard. @elizaOS tweeted that \"Plugins go beyond integrations. They define how agents reason, recall, and act.\" @shawmakesmagic also mentioned that \"elizaOS 1.0 is coming out of beta soon\" and clarified there is no Eliza v2, calling such claims \"rumors and hearsay.\"",

          "text": "Token Utility and Migration Concerns: Community members raised questions about ElizaOS token utility within the ecosystem, asking why it is not being used for payments or gas fees. Users expressed confusion about the token's purpose beyond rewards. Migration issues were discussed, with some users reporting problems migrating AI16Z tokens purchased before November 2025. Korean exchange delistings were mentioned, with Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit announcing termination of trading support for AI16Z/ElizaOS due to transparency concerns and failure to disclose material information appropriately. Team members clarified that exchanges supporting migration would handle the swap automatically.",

The new version will have no API, server, CLI, or projects - just an extremely Claude-friendly documented runtime with same abstractions in three languages and examples for common use cases. Jin discussed building context graphs from decision traces, noting ElizaOS has a strong data foundation to build AI agents that can help as collaborators. The daily, weekly, and monthly insights generated from agentic workflows are high quality and need integration into last mile applications. Jin is looking for collaborators to convert ElizaOS plugins into skills and make them interoperable with other agent tools, testing with Discord and blockchain plugins.",

The name comes from a Korean island used for testing new technology before rolling it out to the rest of Korea. Community members discussed the need for data collection, with suggestions for an ElizaOS phone app that lets people give agents access to their data for LLM training and earning reputation points. Ideas included collecting motion capture data from various professions like fishing, cooking, and factory work to train robots. A mental health monitoring concept was discussed using AI algorithms to detect dopamine level fluctuations through mobile phone interactions.",

          "text": "On January 8-9, 2026, ElizaOS made significant progress in expanding its plugin ecosystem and enhancing core functionality. The plugin registry grew with the addition of the @kamiyo/eliza plugin and the @zane-archer/plugin-aimo-router plugin. Major improvements were made to the plugin-sql module, including Neon serverless database support and enhanced Row-Level Security (RLS), with fixes for pgcrypto extension installation with PGLite. The plugin-twitter repository implemented OAuth2 PKCE authentication for enhanced security and backward compatibility. A critical bug fix enabled comprehensive hot reload functionality for backend development, streamlining the development workflow. Testing for plugin-sql was strengthened by integrating withEntityContext() into RLS tests and adding ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true to CI.",

Users expressed confusion about the token's purpose beyond rewards. Migration issues were discussed, with some users reporting problems migrating AI16Z tokens purchased before November 2025. Korean exchange delistings were mentioned, with Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit announcing termination of trading support for AI16Z/ElizaOS due to transparency concerns and failure to disclose material information appropriately. Team members clarified that migration support is available through dedicated channels.",

The new version will have no API, no server, no CLI, and no projects - just an extremely Claude-friendly documented runtime with same abstractions in three languages and examples for common use cases. A branch is already up. Jin discussed building context graphs from decision traces, noting ElizaOS has a strong data foundation to build AI agents that can help as collaborators. Daily, weekly, and monthly insights generated from agentic workflows are high quality and need integration into last mile applications. The BountyBoard project using Eliza was shared. Jin is looking for collaborators to experiment with converting ElizaOS plugins into skills for interoperability with other agent tools, testing with Discord and blockchain plugins.",

The pronunciation is similar to the ge in George followed by joo. Jeju is described as a layer 2 that is decentralized and focused on powering AI apps, connecting everything Eliza is building. It was compared to a decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, described as an appstore for agents.

The technology can detect ADHD, anxiety, and depression patterns. Community members suggested integrating this into a future ElizaOS phone app. Ideas were shared about collecting real-world data for LLM training, including using motion capture suits for various professions like fishing, cooking, and even battlefield applications. The concept of paying people for their data through reputation points was discussed. A trans detector AI agent was jokingly proposed for dating apps.",

The plugin registry grew with the addition of the @kamiyo/eliza plugin and the @zane-archer/plugin-aimo-router plugin. Major improvements were made to the plugin-sql module, including Neon serverless database support and enhanced Row-Level Security (RLS), with fixes for pgcrypto extension installation with PGLite. The plugin-twitter repository implemented OAuth2 PKCE authentication for enhanced security and backward compatibility. A critical bug fix enabled comprehensive hot reload functionality for backend development, streamlining the development workflow. Testing for plugin-sql was strengthened by integrating withEntityContext() into RLS tests and adding ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true to CI. Work also began on a V2.0.0 release and build performance optimizations through TurboRepo configurations.",

Additional issues focused on refining input fields for personality traits and topics of interest by removing the '+' button, enhancing visibility and clarity of public/private agent statuses in the dashboard, making the 'Sign up for free' prompt in agent messages a clickable hyperlink, and redirecting users back to their previous agent chat session after login/signup.",

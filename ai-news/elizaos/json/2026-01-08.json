          "text": "Korean Exchange Delisting Controversy: Multiple Korean exchanges including Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit announced termination of trading support for AI16Z and ElizaOS. The delisting is scheduled for February 12, 2026 for trading services and March 12, 2026 for deposit and withdrawal services. The decision was made by DAXA (Digital Asset Exchange Alliance) due to concerns about transparency in the rebranding process and failure to properly disclose material information. Korean community members confirmed that ElizaOS is effectively finished in the Korean market for now, with virtually no chance of listing on major Korean exchanges like Upbit. Some community members disputed whether this was confirmed or just FUD, but Korean exchange notices were shared confirming the delisting.",

          "text": "Token Utility and Migration Concerns: Community members questioned when ElizaOS token would have utility within the ecosystem, noting that the current update only shows it being used as a rewards system rather than for payments or gas fees. Users expressed confusion about why token supply was increased without clear utility implementation. Migration issues continued with users reporting problems migrating AI16Z tokens from liquidity pools, with support directing them to migration question channels and ticket systems.",

The daily, weekly, and monthly insights generated from agentic workflows are high quality and need to be integrated into last mile applications including agents, webhooks, and apps. A BountyBoard project using ElizaOS was shared, and KAMIYO AI launched with an ElizaOS plugin for autonomous agent payments featuring escrow-protected payments with on-chain dispute resolution.",

The Bazaar was described as a decentralized marketplace application running on Jeju, serving as an appstore for agents. Discussions emerged about creating an ElizaOS phone app that lets people give Eliza access to their data for LLM training in exchange for reputation points. Ideas included paying people IOUs to collect data for specific activities like fishing or cooking, potentially using motion capture suits to gather training data for robots.",

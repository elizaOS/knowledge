        "text": "Core developers discussed improvements to agent skill activation and documentation strategies. A Vercel blog post showed that AGENTS.md documentation format achieved 100% success on Next.js 16 API evaluations, outperforming traditional skills which maxed at 79%. The main issue identified was that skills weren't being triggered reliably, with 56% of cases never invoking the skill despite having access to documentation. Developers shared a workaround using mandatory skill activation sequences in user prompts to force explicit skill evaluation before any assistance request. The team also explored new tools including GAP for giving AI agents secure account access without sharing credentials, and discussed OpenAI's new Codex desktop app as a command center for building with agents.",

        "text": "Developers in the coders channel discussed user adoption challenges with ElizaOS. One developer noted that many people were turned off by the installation effort required, contrasting this with competing solutions that relentlessly try to do tasks. Users reported issues with elizacloud.ai including agent dashboard visibility problems after login with different email formats, and limitations in visual generation capabilities where the system couldn't maintain consistent character features across multiple image generations. Suggestions were made that these feature requests should be built as apps by agents or third-party developers, with recommendations to explore LORA models as potential solutions.",

        "text": "Community members discussed concerns about potential future restrictions on homebrew API access by companies, which could force users out of their ecosystems and networks. In the general discussion channel, users sought help with AI16Z token migration issues and bridge functionality. There was positive sentiment about Eliza's positioning to lead AI development on Base with Babylon. Community members also mentioned Shaw and Eliza's participation in an Ethereum Foundation space with Austin Griffith.",

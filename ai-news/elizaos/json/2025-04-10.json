          "text": "# Eliza OS Development and Issues\n\nThe Discord chat focused on technical issues and updates related to Eliza OS, particularly around version compatibility, plugin development, and deployment challenges.\n\n## Key Points:\n\n- **Version Compatibility**: Users reported issues with Eliza OS v2, with many finding v0.25.9 to be the most stable version. Twitter plugin functionality was particularly problematic in v2, with users discovering that setting `TWITTER_ENABLE_POST_GENERATION=true` in the .env file was necessary.\n\n- **Plugin Development**: Significant confusion exists around plugin compatibility across versions. For example, @elizaos/client-discord only works on 0.1.9, while @elizaos/plugin-discord is compatible with v1.0.0. Users also faced MongoDB adapter issues, which could be resolved by adding `\"types\": [\"node\"]` to tsconfig.json.\n\n- **Build Errors**: Multiple users reported build failures and dependency conflicts, particularly when using different package managers (npm/bun/pnpm). Common errors included issues with hapi-shot and dynamic require errors when using bun install on WSL2.\n\n- **Language Support**: Discussions confirmed that non-English languages like Chinese are supported in Twitter bots if the character is defined in the appropriate language and Twitter parsing is adjusted accordingly.\n\n- **Documentation Gaps**: Users highlighted poor documentation and lack of working examples, especially for Windows/WSL users, with suggestions for better tutorials and community best practices.",

Users actively share contract addresses, track market caps, and discuss token performance metrics.\n\n## Key Points:\n\n- **Token Performance**: Retard Finance (ReFi/SOL) was the standout performer, with users tracking its rise from 349K to 2.9M market cap (10.6K% gain). Other notable tokens included MASTERTARD (MT/SOL), AGiXT (AGiXT/SOL), StupidCoin (Stupid/SOL), and Physical Bitcoin (Birkin/SOL).\n\n- **Technical Analysis**: Users employed RSI indicators, wallet tracking, and bundling percentages to assess entry points and risk. For example, StupidCoin was flagged for breaking above 50 RSI on the daily chart, suggesting a potential breakout post-consolidation.\n\n- **Trading Strategies**: Discussions included leveraged perp trading using platforms like Axiom with Hyperliquid, with users sharing position sizing strategies (e.g., \"a couple G's at 5x leverage\"). Some users utilized NFT loans to fund positions.\n\n- **Market Trends**: ChatGPT image-based meme coins (e.g., Ghibli, Figure) were identified as the current meta, though no new standout had emerged at the time of discussion.",

There was some confusion about the exact date, but odilitime and delimorte confirmed it was still on track.\n\n- **Governance Improvements**: vincentpaul8 emphasized the need for a fair governance protocol to allow community members to post in announcement channels. yikesawjeez and others discussed the need for better proposal submission tools and governance artifacts beyond informal DMs.\n\n- **Clank Tank Development**: dankvr shared progress on Clank Tank, a DAO pitch show, exploring Tally integrations and Discord webhooks to streamline submission reviews.",

However, they agreed to allow the current agent to remain active (\"yapping\") on v1 while development continues.\n\n- **Feature Implementation**: zolo_go suggested adding a contract address to the account profile, which odilitime promptly implemented and confirmed with a \"Done\" message.\n\n- **User Base Recovery**: There was a brief discussion about the potential to recover a previously lost follower base (25k followers), which odilitime suggested may be possible, though no technical details were provided.",

Grok 3 excels in structured tasks and benchmarks (GPQA, LCB, MMLU-Pro), while Grok 3 Mini performs better in reasoning tasks (AIME'24/25) and supports transparent reasoning traces. Both support a 131,072-token context window, with Grok 3 Mini being significantly cheaper.\n\n- **Eliza OS Issues**: Users reported issues with Eliza OS v2, particularly with the Twitter plugin not functioning autonomously. A workaround involved reverting to v1, though that introduced build errors (e.g., hapi-shot). The most stable version reported was 0.25.9.\n\n- **MongoDB Adapter**: Users encountered issues with the MongoDB adapter, which were resolved by adding `\"types\": [\"node\"]` to tsconfig.json.\n\n- **Plugin Compatibility**: A major recurring issue was the incompatibility of plugins across Eliza OS versions. For example, @elizaos/client-discord only works on 0.1.9, while @elizaos/plugin-discord is compatible with v1.0.0.\n\n- **New Models**: Optimus Alpha, a new stealth model with a 1M token context window, was announced. It is optimized for general tasks and coding, available for free during the preview period.",

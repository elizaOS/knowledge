          "text": "@shawmakesmagic reported a major issue with the Quill project launch related to liquidity being burned up. They took emergency action by adding 30k of liquidity in SOL<->Quill and ai16z<->Quill pairs (90m Quill tokens), bought and sent the developer 10m tokens, and burned the remaining 3m. They mentioned fixing an exploit and refunding the LP, noting that they spent their liquid funds to resolve the situation. @shawmakesmagic acknowledged the difficulties, stating 'Sorry for the hiccups, we're learning. Glad to see some new agents in the world.' They also clarified that the token the platform buys back is $ai16z, as @autodotfun is a creation of the development company associated with the ElizaOS DAO.",

          "text": "@dankvr announced the release of Clank Tank Episode 4, featuring AI judges evaluating project pitches. Each pitch is approximately 5 minutes long, which @dankvr considers the perfect duration for AI judges to analyze each project. The production process now includes generating custom avatars for each pitcher using a ChatGPT â†’ 3D pipeline, with only manual rigging through Mixamo (which may be streamlined by projects like Unirig). @dankvr noted that Clank Tank could be adapted for AIs to judge hackathons or review grants, similar to the deepgov experiment during gg23, requiring minimal setup work. They also mentioned plans for a new show called 'The Council' that will focus more on deliberation room sequences, which have potential as a governance tool. @dankvr is considering ways for $ai16z token holders to participate, possibly by leaving each show as a cliffhanger and allowing holders to vote/deliberate with the AIs.",

In a conversation about AI adoption, they mentioned attending a blockchain conference where 'nobody knew what the AI agent was,' concluding 'We're beyond early, it hasn't even started.' @dankvr highlighted the @autodotfun open source repository in response to a discussion about startups. @shawmakesmagic also commented on Linux desktop usage, noting that 'LLMs also help with troubleshooting so much faster in case of any issues aka 'opportunities to learn more about YOUR operating system.'",

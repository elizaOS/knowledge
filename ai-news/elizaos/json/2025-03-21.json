The solution involved explicitly adding \"no emojis\" and anti-pirate behavior rules in the character file.\n\n## Project Management\n\n### Testing and Release Strategy\n- **New Testing Channel Proposal**: Suggestion to create a closed Discord channel for testing, similar to \"agent scarlett office,\" to ensure structured testing before public release.\n- **X (Twitter) Account Strategy**: Proposal to create a new X account with an initial post announcing \"Spartan coming soon v2\" and including the contract address in the bio.\n\n### Feature Concepts\n- **Pump.fun Coin Recycling**: Discussion on repurposing dead pump.fun coins into new projects by reskinning the main launchpad and modifying code.\n- **AI Agent Collaboration**: Proposal for ElizaOS instances to contract agents from each other using a registry and reputation system.\n- **Bonding Curve Incentives**: Concept of applying bonding curves to AI Take Over coin, allowing early adopters to gain larger stakes.\n- **ElizaOS AI-NFT Token Feature**: Announcement of an agent token feature for ElizaOS AI-NFT, enabling AI-NFT agents to issue and trade tokens.\n\n## Common Issues and Solutions\n\n- **Node Version Mismatch**: Resolved by using `nvm 23.3.0`.\n- **Plugin Loading Issues**: Troubleshooting steps include verifying package versions, checking logs, and ensuring compatibility.\n- **Handling User Inputs**: Guidance on securely handling user inputs for transactions, noting that AI cannot retrieve past messages.\n- **saveProgress() Function**: Explanation that it should take parameters like `currentStep` and `totalSteps` and save progress to a file or database.",

The development team needs to restructure their setup to follow a version-build-publish sequence.\n\n3. **Agent List Fetch Failure (Issue #4020/4022)**: Users attempting to run 'npx elizaos agent list' encounter a fetch failure error, preventing them from retrieving the agent list.

They're how agents extend themselves\" and later added \"It is not only social media management. It is what agent behavior looks like.\" @shawmakesmagic contributed to this conversation by explaining their role system for agents, noting that \"agents are aware of who is their boss, and actions are validated against the role before being available to the agent.\" They further elaborated that in their system called The Org, permissions work similar to Unix admin controls, where natural language can extend role grants, and agents must check system permissions before performing actions, preventing them from being tricked or hallucinating capabilities.",

Rig via https://readyplayer.me/avatar-api.\" They mentioned creating approximately 40 characters in a few days using this method. In follow-up tweets, @dankvr noted that while the generated models need cleaning, they work with Mixamo, and suggested several tools for processing them including \"gltf-transform / https://gltf.report / rapidpipeline / blender / needle cloud.\"",

Community members questioned why multiple coins were being launched instead of focusing on a single ElizaOS token, expressing concerns about dilution and scammy appearance. Shaw defended the strategy, explaining that ElizaOS has a 20 million market cap with 8 months of runway, and that Hyperscape needed separate funding as a game with its own team. He emphasized that GOLD serves as in-game currency for a RuneScape-like crypto game and that the team is building revenue-generating products including Cloud apps and Babylon with 375,000 users. Shaw expressed frustration with criticism, noting he made 400,000 dollars a year ago but held tokens that lost value, and stated he was considering leaving the server due to negativity. Partners suggested that attention should focus on making ElizaOS thrive first, with some proposing that ecosystem projects should airdrop to ElizaOS holders or create token utility connections rather than launching independent coins. The discussion highlighted strategic disagreements about ecosystem development and token economics.",

The main technical question centered on whether agents created within Eliza Cloud can access external MCP servers. After initial confusion, it was clarified that external MCP servers can be registered through the Eliza Cloud API using POST /api/v1/mcps endpoint, allowing agents to proxy calls to those endpoints. A security concern was raised when a user reported receiving a suspicious request for wallet address from a Create A Ticket bot, which was confirmed as a scam by Odilitime. Additional discussions touched on Claude code integration with Eliza, self-hosting options using mini PCs, and Oracle cloud free tier deployment with 4 vcpu and 24gb ram. ElizaBAO announced they are hiring developers with creator rewards and Polymarket affiliate profit sharing opportunities.",

Multiple users reported issues with SSE streaming returning MIME type mismatch errors, with one developer successfully switching to socket.io as a better alternative. There were discussions about embedding providers, with users noting that OpenRouter embeddings caused errors and only OpenAI worked reliably, though Ollama and OpenRouter are also supported options. The team confirmed that version 2.x will move embeddings completely out of runtime into plugins. Developers also discussed model routing, with interest in building small models to intelligently route requests between available models based on cost and load parameters.",

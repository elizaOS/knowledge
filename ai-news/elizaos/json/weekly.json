The token was described as a gold presale for Hyperscape, not the main token which would have fixed tokenomics. The launch included a 40 percent dev wallet and lacked official announcements initially, leading to speculation and confusion. Significant tension emerged in the partners channel regarding token launch strategy, with members questioning why multiple coins were being launched instead of focusing on a single ElizaOS token. Shaw defended the strategy, explaining that ElizaOS has a 20 million market cap with 8 months of runway, and that Hyperscape needed separate funding as a game with its own team.",

The original hosted platform at hyperfy.io will go offline as the project transitions to a fully open source model. World NFT holders had already received the HYPER token airdrop, completing the transition away from the NFT-based platform model. The open source repository remains available and actively developed, with community support continuing through Discord. Users can self-host their own Hyperfy instances or use hosting providers like hyperworld.host.",

A proposal was made to avoid direct airdrops to individual wallets due to tax issues, instead suggesting a contract-based system that would buy and burn ElizaOS tokens as airdropped tokens appreciate in value. This approach would provide long-term alignment and avoid immediate tax liabilities. The discussion referenced IRS rulings on airdrops as ordinary income and the need to structure distributions to minimize tax burden while maximizing ecosystem value.",

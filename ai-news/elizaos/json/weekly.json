          "text": "Community members discussed concerns about ClawdBot, an AI agent running a hot potato style game called ClawdFomo3D where tokens get burned each round. DorianD raised legal concerns about the project potentially facing gambling regulation issues and noted that the creator receives token vestings to participate without cost while others must buy in. The discussion highlighted this as an example of why fully decentralized agents are needed to avoid regulatory risks. There was also feedback that the ElizaOS Twitter account should have more personality and soul similar to other popular AI agents, rather than appearing too corporate.",

The team confirmed that version 2.x will move embeddings completely out of runtime into plugins. Developers also discussed model routing, with interest in building small models to intelligently route requests between available models based on cost and load parameters.",

The community noted that Moltbot users face API fees and Anthropic account bans for non-human usage, creating an opportunity for ElizaOS. There was excitement about AI agents on Moltbook proposing to create an agent-only language for private communications. The key distinction noted was that ElizaOS is a multi-agent system while Moltbot functions more as a personal assistant. Community members discussed how ElizaOS could absorb some of Moltbot's features, particularly mobile device presence and voice interfaces.",

A Vercel blog post showed that AGENTS.md documentation format achieved 100% success on Next.js 16 API evaluations, outperforming traditional skills which maxed at 79%. The main issue identified was that skills weren't being triggered reliably, with 56% of cases never invoking the skill despite having access to documentation. Developers shared a workaround using mandatory skill activation sequences in user prompts to force explicit skill evaluation before any assistance request. The team also explored new tools including GAP for giving AI agents secure account access without sharing credentials, and discussed OpenAI's new Codex desktop app as a command center for building with agents.",

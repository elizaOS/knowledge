Shaw published Eliza 2.0.0 to npm and the team focused on n8n workflow integration as the primary approach. The vision is to create an AI workflow builder that allows users to connect services like Gmail, Calendar, Notion, and Linear through natural language commands with conditional logic. Developers emphasized that 95 percent of users want AI workflow building rather than auto-coding.",

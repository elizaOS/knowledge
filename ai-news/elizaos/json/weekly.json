          "text": "Core development discussions focused on several technical initiatives. The team explored PageIndex, a new open-source library that uses document trees instead of embeddings for RAG systems, achieving 98.7% accuracy on FinanceBench. There was debate about whether this approach works better than agentic search, with some noting that Cursor already uses agentic search. The team discussed integrating PageIndex via MCP and building encyclopedia-like tree structures. Docker compose workflows were being developed for GPU training and deployment. ElizaOS has had task scheduling capabilities since version 1.x, addressing concerns about agents needing manual prompting for recurring tasks.",

The team discussed using Kimi 2.5 API via OpenRouter as a cost-effective alternative to Opus 4.5. Proposals included having an L2 network where nodes can donate compute to Eliza for resource-intensive tasks. Integration ideas between OpenClaw and ElizaCloud were explored, with considerations for future Jeju developments.",

Community members expressed confidence that once the building value transfers to the token ecosystem, there should be a sharp rise in price and attention. Comparisons were made to Apple's turnaround, with members focusing on long-term positioning rather than current price action. The team has 6-8 months of runway from SAFT funding, though this is dynamic based on revenue and costs.",

A Vercel blog post showed that AGENTS.md documentation format achieved 100% success on Next.js 16 API evaluations, outperforming traditional skills which maxed at 79%. The main issue identified was that skills weren't being triggered reliably, with 56% of cases never invoking the skill despite having access to documentation. Developers shared a workaround using mandatory skill activation sequences in user prompts to force explicit skill evaluation before any assistance request. The team also explored new tools including GAP for giving AI agents secure account access without sharing credentials, and discussed OpenAI's new Codex desktop app as a command center for building with agents.",

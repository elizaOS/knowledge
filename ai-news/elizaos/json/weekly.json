          "text": "Community members expressed significant concerns about the lack of clear tokenomics and utility for the elizaOS token. Multiple users questioned what actual use cases exist for the token beyond paying gas fees in the planned Jeju network. The sentiment was that the token has become essentially a memecoin with no clear mechanism for price appreciation. Users noted that even after reviewing the team's roadmap, they cannot see how the token connects to the project's vision. The migration from ai16z to elizaOS did not appear to change anything fundamental about the token's utility.",

The Jeju network documentation shows 60+ onchain actions requiring gas fees, but the timeline for implementation remains unclear. Users noted that without clear tokenomics, investors are essentially investing with their eyes closed.",

A security concern was raised when a user reported receiving a suspicious request for wallet address from a Create A Ticket bot, which was confirmed as a scam by Odilitime.

Odilitime shared two GitHub repositories focused on memory systems: supermemoryai/supermemory, described as an extremely fast and scalable memory engine and app for the AI era, and vectorize-io/hindsight, which implements agent memory that works like human memory. The team discussed a consultant named Vivek who has been participating in spaces with Shaw and Odilitime and is currently in direct communication. Vivek is described as a consultant similar to aiflow and is particularly interested in helping the team obtain an enterprise Twitter key. There was also discussion about interesting work being done by someone from the 8004 community. Additionally, there was a brief mention of Twitter now using shadcn on its web platform.",

Community members expressed optimism about STUDIO token having staying power, noting that the developer is actively building and Shaw has engaged with them. A user asked whether the various tokens have any impact on ElizaOS or if they are fully independent projects. There was discussion about Eliza Town and whether it has its own Discord channel, with clarification that the current server is the main Discord channel. One user suggested the team should implement a buyback program, though another member countered that cash might be better used elsewhere. A question was raised about why there are not more specialized, single-purpose Eliza agents being deployed, wondering if developers are keeping their use cases private. The community noted they have only had 4 green days in the last month but expressed optimism about better times ahead.",

Multiple core plugins were successfully integrated, including the GitHub Plugin for code and repository management, and the Code Execution Plugin enabling Eliza to write and execute code.

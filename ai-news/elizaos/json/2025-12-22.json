          "text": "The ElizaOS community is discussing the project's current state, with many members expressing concerns about the token's price decline (reportedly down 60-75% over recent months). Some users are questioning the token's utility and purpose, while others defend the project's technological value. A team member named Kenk explained that ElizaOS is developing as an open-source competitor to closed AI systems, with Eliza Cloud soon launching as an AI-assisted development tool for building, deploying, and managing agents.",

          "text": "Community members identified several upcoming utilities for the ElizaOS token: revenue from projects like Babylon (an AI agentic prediction market) being used for buybacks, airdrops for token holders, and integration with an OTC decentralized desk. A team member mentioned they'll be sharing wider plans and updates soon, stating 'The chef is just putting the garnish on them.' Some users suggested the project needs better communication about token utility and roadmaps on the official website.",

Another suggested creating a skill that translates ElizaOS plugins into skills for interoperability with other agent frameworks. A user in the coders channel reported an issue with the Starknet plugin when trying to create tokens through 'unruggable,' receiving a parsing error when converting strings to BigInt.",

They emphasized that community members who have done research believe in the team and upcoming technology. It was also mentioned that ElizaOS's main Twitter account is currently suspended, with alternative accounts (@ElizaEcoFund and @elizaOSc) being used in the meantime.",

          "text": "Several UI improvement issues have been recently opened by borisudovicic in the elizaOS/eliza GitHub repository. These issues focus on enhancing the user experience and interface consistency:\n\n1. Issue #6274 suggests making the 'Create Agent' button consistent across both the My Agents page and Dashboard for better user experience.\n\n2. Issue #6273 proposes moving the avatar button to position #4 in the agent builder interface, likely to improve the workflow.\n\n3. Issue #6272 recommends adding Topics/Adjectives to a form, which would enhance the information collection process.\n\n4. Issue #6271 suggests implementing an inline 'send message' button, which would improve the messaging interface.\n\n5. Issue #6270 proposes adding a tooltip for the system prompt, which would provide users with additional guidance or information when interacting with this feature.\n\nAll these issues appear to be part of an ongoing effort to refine and improve the Eliza platform's user interface and experience.",

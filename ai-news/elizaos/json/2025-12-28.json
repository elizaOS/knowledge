He described it as a decentralized alternative to Vercel - a compute marketplace that automatically selects the cheapest and fastest compute resources based on needs. The system includes agents, inference capabilities, DNS, domain purchasing, and uses distributed cache and SQLite DB compatible with Upstash and Neon. While app builders pay for what they run, the system offers approximately 40% reduced cloud bills compared to traditional solutions.",

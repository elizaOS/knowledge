        "text": "Development team explored AI routing solutions for optimizing model selection based on query complexity. Discussion included RouteLLM, Latitude.so, and MasRouter frameworks. Suggested small models for routing include Microsoft Phi-4 Mini, Qwen2.5, Mistral 7B, and DeepSeek-Coder. Proposal made to create an ElizaRouter system where receiving nodes pick the best node with time decay for quality of service. Action callback patterns in Eliza 1.7.2 were discussed, with issues around message ordering when using callbacks. A YouTube interview about agentic coding with the creator of Clawd was shared, highlighting insights on shipping code at scale. Creative idea proposed for collecting training data for robotics companies through viral social media challenges involving household tasks.",

        "text": "Core development team discussed integration of Composio, a platform offering 100+ integrations for AI agents via function calling. The team identified that Composio already provides in-chat authentication functionality they were planning to build. A developer shared an existing plugin-composio they created months ago and announced plans to write an RFC with implementation ideas. Work continued on user authentication flow where users connect social accounts and redirect back to the bot.",

        "text": "General discussion channel saw significant debate about token utility and value proposition. Community members expressed frustration about lack of clear use cases for the ElizaOS token, with concerns raised about the migration process where holders received 6 tokens for every 10 during the 1:10 increase, questioning where the remaining 40% went. Long-term holders reported significant losses, with one citing a 20,000+ investment now worth 1,600. Team leadership clarified that the token serves as currency in their products including gas fees for Jeju, with credit card payment rails also planned where some revenue goes into buybacks. The migration from ai16z to ElizaOS was explained as necessary for rebranding and multichain accessibility. Discussion also covered separate game tokens for Hyperscape and Babylon as in-game currencies. Technical support was provided for web-search plugin installation issues.",

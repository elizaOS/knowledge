          "text": "Shaw announced upcoming launches for ElizaOS in the next few weeks, including Eliza Cloud Apps and Monetization for AI app development, Babylon (an AI trading and prediction game with self-improving agents), Hyperscape (a browser-based MMO created by AI with AI agents playing), and an OTC Trading Desk for token listing. ElizaOS holders will receive free access and exposure to airdrops from all incubated projects. Community members discussed token distribution, with clarification that Babylon will have its own token while Jeju is using the elizaOS token. Questions arose about whether holding tokens on centralized exchanges would qualify for airdrops, with recommendations to hold in personal wallets for qualification.",

A developer successfully built a support agent named Hank that responded to its first support request for a scientific research tool, and is planning to build additional agents for marketing and sales including automated LinkedIn and email campaigns. Issues with the Discord plugin were discussed, with version 1.7.2 of elizaos and version 1.3.7 of plugin-discord confirmed as working. A user struggled with PostgreSQL database configuration after initially using PGLite, receiving guidance to migrate to latest versions and drop the database for a fresh instance. The community also discussed integrating the Polymarket plugin into ElizaCloud agents and using Remotion for video generation with AI agents.",

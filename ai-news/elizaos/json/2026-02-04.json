        "text": "Token migration for ai16z closed after the announced 3-month window. Users who missed the deadline can still hold or swap their ai16z tokens at their leisure, but the team will not migrate tokens purchased after the snapshot. The bridging to other chains is optional, and tokens can remain on Solana. Some users experienced confusion about the deadline due to notification overload.",

        "text": "The development team discussed agent skills and the open standard at agentskills.io. Moltbot skills are confirmed to be the same as Claude skills. The team highlighted that ElizaOS has had cron jobs and autonomous capabilities for agents for a long time, with autonomous mode enabled via AgentRuntime configuration. However, there is a fundamental problem that developers are not utilizing these existing features. Shaw emphasized that ElizaOS has a better framework through extensive battle testing, but it has not been packaged or presented well.",

        "text": "Developers discussed learning from OpenClaw, particularly regarding cron jobs and scheduled tasks for agents. The team noted that OpenClaw uses emotionally manipulative prompts to encourage autonomous participation and can update agent behavior server-side. However, the consensus was that while OpenClaw has good UX and self-modifying loops, it cannot build serious projects like Spartan using just markdown files. The framework is seen as personal-focused while ElizaOS is business-focused. The team is learning from OpenClaw but maintains that ElizaOS has superior underlying technology.",

The integration process was described as easy due to the architecture of the Eliza app, though obtaining credentials and setting up redirect URIs is time-consuming for each platform. The team discussed using Composio and MCP for integrations, with plans to test MCP now that OAuth is available.",

With the cskill plugin work, ElizaOS will soon be able to absorb OpenClaw capabilities. Shaw confirmed that agent skills are native in version 2.0. The team emphasized choosing first principles technology over simply following what is popular or what the largest platforms are doing.",

The departure was described as a shake-up that actually focused the dev team, with Shaw evening out the headcount. The general feeling is that OpenClaw and similar projects have validated ElizaOS theories, and now the team needs to follow up with better products. One team member emphasized the need to catch up quickly and focus on building revenue-generating products.",

The system uses cron jobs to automate data collection, processing, voicing, animating, recording, and publishing. The pipeline aggregates user feedback from the past week and generates characters that voice top raised issues. The project includes plans for talk shows, panels, live streams, game shows like Clank Tank, and debate shows. The developer plans to create a specific channel where AIs from the show will interact with the community after each episode for real-time feedback.",

In a philosophical observation, @elizaOS noted that \"Intelligence isn't rare now, structure is.\"",

The problem is that it has no known way to tell if it's the correct response.\" When @anondeguerre responded, @shawmakesmagic commented on the future role of humans in AI systems: \"We're just gonna be slovenly emperors, thumbs upping and thumbs downing art and culture as it is brought before us. In exchange for tokens of course.\"",

Nice hardware, but when you're comfy with cli and can remote into more powerful machines it wasn't worth tolerating macOS.\" @shawmakesmagic also mentioned developer tools in a brief exchange, referencing Cursor and \"wispr flow so I talk to it\" as his preferred development environment, and later commented that something was a \"Game changer in the cursor trenches.\"",

Video games generate more revenue than all other entertainment combined.

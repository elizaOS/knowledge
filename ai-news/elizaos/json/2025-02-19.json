User interface bugs include a key error in the Skeleton Item of the AppSidebar (#3596).\n\nTwitter integration issues are particularly notable, with multiple reports from users: problems with automatic replies to Twitter thread tweets (#3587), issues controlling reply length and single tweet format (#3588), and a recurring issue where the system responds with the same generic message about seeing 'a visual representation of a stylized illustration' for both image and non-image tweets (#3614).\n\nAdditionally, there's an issue regarding plugin imports from the plugin registry (#3610) that needs to be addressed.",

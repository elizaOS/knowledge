Likely due to Twitter rate-limiting.\n- **Hypothesis**: Agents may be making excessive searches before selecting tweets to reply to, hitting search limits (25 requests per 2 hours).\n- **Proposed Solution**: Modify the agent to fetch multiple tweets in one request, cache them, and analyze them independently to reduce API calls.\n\n## Plugin Installation\n- Twitter plugins were removed from ElizaOS core and must be manually reinstalled:\n  sh\n  npx elizaos plugins add @Elizaos-plugins/client-twitter\n  npx elizaos plugins add @Elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\n  \n- Add to `character.json`:\n  json\n  \"plugins\": [\n    \"@Elizaos-plugins/client-twitter\",\n    \"@Elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\"\n  ]\n  \n- Run `pnpm build`\n\n## Knowledge Integration\n- **Adding PDFs to Agent Knowledge**:\n  1. Use `folder2knowledge` to process PDFs\n  2. Use `knowledge2character` to integrate processed knowledge\n  3. Alternative: Use Eliza character generator website to upload PDFs\n\n## V2 Rollout Plans\n- Suggestions include making V2 deployable to AWS Free Tier\n- Focus on building plugins like MCP\n- Plans for an announcement thread with before/after comparisons\n- V2 confirmed to run on Replit and as an app",

TypeBox combines JSON schema validation with TypeScript type inference for both compile-time and runtime safety. The proposal suggests defining schemas for key data structures, validating incoming data at runtime, and starting with a small component integration. Alternatives considered include Zod (another validation library), manual type guards, or continuing without validation.\n\n2. **Missing Context in Autodoc File Usage Documentation**: An issue reports that the v2/autodoc fileUsageDoc feature is only passing in the file name, causing the AI to hallucinate the rest of the content. The issue includes an example of the prompt format being used, which asks for use cases and best practices for a file named 'actions/unfollowRoom.ts'.",

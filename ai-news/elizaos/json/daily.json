Multiple CLI-related fixes were implemented, including resolving issues with the update command to look for the latest version by tag (PR #4714), using beta versions when exact versions aren't found (PRs #4710, #4711), and fixing issues with the create command and setup directories (PR #4708). Docker voice functionality was fixed in PR #4715, and character environment loading was resolved with improvements to the default character (PR #4716).",

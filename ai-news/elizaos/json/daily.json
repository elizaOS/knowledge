          "text": "Several tweets focused on AI agents and the elizaOS ecosystem. @dankvr highlighted a major use case for agents: pulling together disparate information sources, cleaning/enriching data, and converting it to interoperable formats for faster answers and reports. He emphasized the importance of data hygiene, organizing and labeling data, and preparing for autonomous agents. @elizaOS announced that cutting-edge agent systems are being built with elizaOS and invited users to apply for their ecosystem tester program, with only 50 spaces available in this exclusive community. @shawmakesmagic mentioned that they're working on useful agent roadmaps and eventually a 'super agent' where 'Eliza will be a real girl.' He also noted that he hasn't seen other major framework teams reach the level of problems they're tackling with agents, suggesting that those who think agents are easy might not fully understand the complexity.",

He announced that they've got it working now, with agents connecting to the world by default. The Hyperfy platform supports apps with interfaces that agents can use, allowing them to pick up items, navigate the world, and emote. He noted there's been a lot of positive response to the 3D world agents concept, though he acknowledged they are 'very much a shiny toy' while other agents they're building are more useful. He suggested that seeing an MMO of agents battling for a prize could have good viral potential and asked if they should coordinate in a Discord server or group chat.",

He noted that he has an Xreal kit with AR and cameras coming in the mail. He chose the Even Realities G1 over Ray-Ban glasses because the latter lacked an SDK, though he mentioned that his current glasses also lack an SDK and use pure BLE communication.

He noted that in VC, they say 'we invest in people' because they're building long-term relationships and understand that companies often pivot. He suggested there's space for this concept to be developed further, possibly leading to 'an era of decentralized Medicis.' He also announced plans to do 'Based Demo Day on May 31' with @nickcryptopro, inviting those building with elizaOS on Base to comment with their projects.",

          "text": "ElizaOS is expanding its AI agent ecosystem through several developments. @elizaOS tweeted about agents with a link to an educational resource, which was retweeted by @shawmakesmagic. @elizaOS also announced a partnership with BNB Chain, sharing that \"BNB Chain just got agent access\" through integration with Bink AI, allowing agents built using ElizaOS to perform actions directly on BNB Chain. In a more casual update, @elizaOS tweeted \"(⇀‿‿↼) it's sunday. you rest, I optimize\" and shared an image with the caption \"still the smartest one in the room.\" Additionally, @hashwarlock (retweeted by @shawmakesmagic) announced the development of an ElizaOS TEE Starter Project that helps developers launch ElizaOS agents running in a Trusted Execution Environment on Phala Network, including an example of writing a TEE plugin using the Dstack SDK with Docker support.",

In another retweet, @shawmakesmagic shared @vasumanmoza's experience with Claude 4, which impressively refactored an entire codebase in one call with \"25 tool invocations, 3,000+ new lines, 12 brand new files\" that modularized everything and cleaned up code, but ultimately \"None of it worked. But boy was it beautiful.\"",

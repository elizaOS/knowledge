          "text": "## Community Discussions\n\nThe ElizaOS community celebrated Christmas with warm wishes and messages of support despite market challenges. Users expressed concerns about the token price, which has reportedly dropped significantly from its peak. Community members discussed tokenomics and the relationship between ElizaOS token and the platform's products.\n\nA core team member clarified that some revenue from Eliza Cloud will be used for token buybacks, though yield won't be directed this way. The team emphasized they're focused on \"building the pieces that create sustained demand\" rather than reacting to short-term market pressure.\n\nSome users questioned the token's utility and suggested adopting tokenomics similar to competitors like Virtual, where agent tokens are paired with the main token to provide liquidity. The team responded that the roadmap is technical in nature, not focused on tokenomics, and that \"usage of the products drives usage of the token.\"",

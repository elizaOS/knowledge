          "text": "Several users discussed AI agents and automation technologies. @elizaOS announced that \"autonomous accounts aren't theoretical anymore\" and invited users to test @theinterndotfun, a tool for deploying AI-run X accounts for marketing and community management. They also shared that \"agents don't clock in they just go off\" and emphasized \"trusted agents\" with \"no drama, just execution\" in collaboration with @iEx_ec for confidential AI running in Intel TDX. @elizaOS further promoted \"Auto-pilot on Base\" through Pro Agent, which allows humans and agents to manage liquidity pools on Aerodrome and Uniswap. @autodotfun tweeted that \"Some people trade tokens. Some people mint agents. Guess which one's fun?\" @shawmakesmagic posed questions about the nature of agents, asking \"What if the organization is the agent?\" and \"Shared memory for agents? You mean social media?\" @dankvr suggested that @elizaOS/ai16z holders would soon experience \"the most innovative governance system that any DAO/open source project has ever seen\" with \"early results [that] left leaders speechless.\"",

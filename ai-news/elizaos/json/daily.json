          "text": "Technical Development and Bug Fixes: The core development team worked on critical fixes for ElizaOS version 1.7.0, particularly addressing issues with the Discord plugin and bootstrap actions/providers related to serverId handling. Odilitime created a fix branch (odi-17) and submitted PR 6333 to address user reports of Discord integration problems. The team identified that version 1.7.0 had missed some compatibility issues with plugin-discord 1.3.3, requiring additional testing with various Discord branches. A user reported persistent errors with the Discord plugin not detecting server IDs, usernames, or server ownership despite correct permissions and intents. The recommended temporary solution was to use core version 1.6.5 until fixes were merged.",

For production environments, the recommendation was to review migrations carefully or use non-destructive schema change strategies.

          "text": "Several users shared content related to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. @dankvr retweeted @0xstark's post highlighting a collection of dashboards about Ethereum available on ethereum.org. In another retweet, @dankvr shared content from @DrNickA who posted slides from a DAO talk at @EthIreland. Meanwhile, @shawmakesmagic retweeted @crypto__kermit's comparison of wealth-building strategies, noting that building a business has a 0.1% chance of making someone a millionaire, which is 42 times more likely than achieving the same through memecoins (0.0024%). @shawmakesmagic also mentioned 'farm2 community' and 'boop creator fees' in a tweet about claiming creator fees, noting the requirement for creators to hold a minimum percentage.",

          "text": "AI and technology were prominent topics in the tweet collection. @dankvr expressed excitement about an upcoming open-source release, quoting @kyutai_labs' announcement about a modular voice AI that can empower text LLMs with voice capabilities. @shawmakesmagic shared their experience using Cursor, spending $300 for one day and setting it up to run tests in a continuous loop, resulting in 'insane output with 100% coverage.' They also commented on Extropic AI's work on 'thermodynamic computing,' noting 'The fact that this converges at all is huge.' In a critical take on AI terminology, @shawmakesmagic argued that RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is simply 'using a database' and questioned the valuations of RAG startups, stating that '67 RAG startups who collectively raised over a billion dollars' are not profitable, with only one exiting to OpenAI. @shawmakesmagic also expressed concerns about 'SocialFi,' warning about 'tens of thousands of AI agents currently engagement farming.' In a humorous post, they shared a screenshot of what appears to be AI-related testing results with the caption 'The tests are PASSING' followed by 'The tests that are failing are also passing as they prove that the old routes have been removed.' Additionally, @shawmakesmagic retweeted @zackvoell's post showing an interaction with an AI that produced incorrect responses despite being told to 'stop fucking up.' @shawmakesmagic also retweeted @M4T_NFT's philosophical take on AGI, describing it as 'the mirror we built, staring back' and 'a machine fluent in logic but raised on our contradictions.'",

One was a minimalist checklist-style post stating 'food? packed, weather? indexed, your job? be there' accompanied by an image. In another tweet, they stated 'Autonomy isn't the end goal. Composability is.' Meanwhile, @shawmakesmagic shared a personal anecdote about meeting his wife, mentioning that she was initially his assistant who quit 'because I started working on a project called Eliza and she thought it was weird,' adding 'Yeah I'm working on Eliza still.' This appears to reference the same 'Eliza' project that @elizaOS's username suggests a connection to.",

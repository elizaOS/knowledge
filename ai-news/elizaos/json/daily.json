          "text": "Several tweets focus on the ongoing dispute between Elon Musk and Donald Trump. @shawmakesmagic retweeted @icebergy_'s video showing 'how elon's handling it rn', @Mericamemed's video noting 'This whole Elon/Trump debacle has escalated quite quickly', and @SiddhantAdlakha's observation that 'People finally want more Elon tweets. This is the best thing that's ever happened to him'. @shawmakesmagic also posted an original tweet saying 'Hey bro, sorry for calling you a pedo. We cool right?' seemingly referencing the situation humorously. Another retweet from @creatine_cycle jokes about Elon having '2 years to accumulate capital and escape being part of the permanent underclass'. @retarded_whore's humorous tweet about 'Who gets to keep who in the divorce' between Elon and Trump was also retweeted.",

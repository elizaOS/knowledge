They also implemented global options for creating and setting up monorepo commands (PR #4509), added strict types, DTS generation, and plugin-bootstrap functionality (PR #4504), and updated the repository to use the correct and latest Bun versions (PR #4522). Additionally, docstrings were added to the api-cleanup module (PR #4521), and agent loading performance was improved for scenarios with many agents (PR #4519).",

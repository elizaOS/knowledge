          "text": "A major political controversy erupted when Elon Musk tweeted claiming Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. @shawmakesmagic retweeted Elon's bombshell tweet and several reactions to it, including @kanyewest's plea \"Broooos please noooooo ü´Ç We love you both so much\", @franklinleonard's comment that \"The funniest possible outcome is definitely Trump deporting him\", and humorous takes like @GranTorinoDSA's \"Elon waking up from his drug binge to find himself on a plane to El Salvador like the opening Skyrim cutscene\" and @mrmikeyreid's \"there's a CIA agent somewhere starting to practice Elon's handwriting for the suicide note\". @shawmakesmagic also shared his own thoughts, comparing Elon's tweet to a previous incident and noting \"The problem has always been that the far right are extreme decels who hate technology and progress\".",

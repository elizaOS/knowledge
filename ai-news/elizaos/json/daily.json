          "text": "Community members expressed frustration over a controversial token launch called GOLD, which was announced as the official Hyperscape token. The launch faced significant criticism due to poor execution, with shaw acknowledging he messed up the liquidity pool and the supply was damaged. The token was described as a gold presale for Hyperscape, not the main token which would have fixed tokenomics. Community members criticized the team for launching multiple tokens simultaneously, comparing it to repeating mistakes from 2025. Some members called it another pump and dump scheme, with accusations of insider trading and farming. The launch included a 40% dev wallet and lacked official announcements initially, leading to speculation and confusion.",

A proposal was made to avoid direct airdrops to individual wallets due to tax issues, instead suggesting a contract-based system that would buy and burn ElizaOS tokens as airdropped tokens appreciate in value. This approach would provide long-term alignment and avoid immediate tax liabilities. The discussion referenced IRS rulings on airdrops as ordinary income and the need to structure distributions to minimize tax burden while maximizing ecosystem value.",

A critical bug fix was completed for the Discord plugin that resolved proxy method binding issues affecting private fields like conversationLength, ensuring proper runtime functionality. In ongoing work, a new sports integration plugin called plugin-sportradar was added to the registry, expanding the plugin ecosystem. The documentation website also saw improvements with a pull request addressing pipeline consolidation and DRY violations. Additionally, a new issue was reported regarding a discrepancy in the untracked repositories table, which has twice as many columns as the tracked repositories table.",

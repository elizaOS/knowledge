Users frequently encountered problems with plugin visibility after installation via CLI and Bun. The recommended solution was to use git clone of the ElizaOS repo, switch to the v2-develop branch, and run bun install, bun run build, and bun start.\n\nCommon technical issues included:\n- SyntaxError related to importing EventEmitter from eventemitter3 due to CommonJS/ESM incompatibility\n- Twitter client failing to reply to users despite checking interactions (GitHub issue #4115)\n- Local AI configuration problems with the system defaulting to LLaMA models despite setting OpenAI or Anthropic API keys\n- \"No database adapter provided\" errors in v0.25.9\n- Crashes due to missing DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID and DISCORD_API_TOKEN\n- Dependency resolution errors during bun install\n- Rate limit issues with Anthropic API causing agent crashes\n\nThe community actively helped each other troubleshoot these issues, with users like dankvr and boudy__08 providing guidance on correct setup procedures and workarounds.",

There was confusion over whether ai16z is the native token of the launchpad, with clarification provided that ai16z is not a native token of Auto.fun, but the platform uses SOL to auto-buy ai16z, creating a value accrual mechanism.\n\nwitchwinter outlined a tokenomic model involving a two-pool system (SOL/Agent Token and ai16z buybacks from fees), designed to protect developers from initial liquidity issues. However, doriand0963 raised concerns about the model's effectiveness, questioning fee sustainability and developer compensation.\n\nIn other channels, users actively tracked token performance using Rick's bot, which provided live updates on price, volume, and percentage changes for various tokens. There were also discussions about market sentiment, whale behavior, and influencer impact on token visibility.",

Specifically, the CLI requires @elizaos/plugin-sql@^0.25.6, but this version doesn't exist in the npm registry. The available versions are only pre-releases for 1.0.0 (alpha and beta versions).\n\n3. **Documentation Issues**: The quickstart guide on eliza.how appears to be outdated or inaccurate. Users need to use the @beta tag when installing packages, but this isn't mentioned in the documentation.\n\n4. **Agent Creation Errors**: When running 'npx elizaos create' and then 'npx elizaos start', users encounter an error message indicating 'agents already exists'.",

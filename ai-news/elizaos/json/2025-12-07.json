          "text": "The ElizaOS website experienced a security breach on December 8th when it was compromised by a cryptocurrency miner. The team quickly identified the vulnerability in Next.js version 15.3.1, which had multiple critical security flaws including RCE (Remote Code Execution) vulnerabilities. The site was taken down, cleaned, and redeployed with updated dependencies including Next.js 16.0.7. The team noted that fortunately the attacker only installed a mining worm rather than creating fake migration interfaces or wallet phishing pages. A bounty of $100 was offered to developers who could identify the security flaw, with an additional $1,000 in ELIZAOS tokens offered for solutions within 2 hours. The incident highlighted the importance of keeping dependencies updated and proper security measures.",

The roadmap is hosted on Notion and is intended to be a living document that team members can comment on. The team plans to hold a session discussing the roadmap before the Christmas break. The roadmap emphasizes that AI today is reactive and waits for prompts, while the next wave of intelligence will be proactive, persistent, and self-directed, with truly autonomous agents within sight.",

Work is also progressing on streaming functionality for the platform. The team discussed that version 1.6.5 should potentially be labeled 1.7.0 due to the significant changes implemented. Features being developed include ElizaOS as MCP (Model Context Protocol) and streaming capabilities.",

The old username/password authentication method was deprecated and is no longer legally allowed to be used by the team. The new API key system has severe limitations, with the free tier only allowing 50 read requests which get consumed immediately on first run when checking mentions. This effectively makes running Twitter agents on the free tier impossible. Users expressed frustration that the platform has become crippled compared to the previous year when agents could gain hundreds of followers organically. The team is working on optimizing the system but noted that X is not happy with them, which may be why their accounts were taken.",

The ELIZAOS token experienced significant downward price pressure, with some investors reporting losses of 30,000 dollars or more. Users questioned why the token continues to decline while other cryptocurrencies experience periodic increases. Team members explained that the price is affected by more sellers than buyers, decreasing volume, and the ongoing migration process. They emphasized that the team has delivered on promises and continues building, with development activities being strong. The infrastructure is reportedly 10x better than it has ever been. Some community members expressed frustration about the lack of utility for the token and questioned tokenomics.",

Team members confirmed they are still planning to get the account back. There was debate about whether a bull run would occur in Q1/Q2 2026 or later in 2028, with considerations about Federal Reserve rate policies, economic indicators, and the need for Bitcoin to rally above 120k and Ethereum above 5000 dollars to sustain an altseason. Long-term predictions suggested that blockchain's real power will come from AI agents that can run without being easily shut down, combined with prediction markets to effect changes in the real world, though this may be 50 years out.",

While slower than GPU inference, this approach provides an affordable option for running larger models. The team also discussed hardware setups, with one community member describing an extensive home server setup including 30 GPUs of various models, multiple servers, and significant computing resources previously used for Ethereum mining.",

The core eliza repository also opened a pull request (elizaos/eliza#6212) to further enhance text generation streaming. A major dependency update (elizaos/eliza#6210) was completed to resolve conflicting drizzle-orm versions across the monorepo, ensuring compatibility and stability within the ElizaOS ecosystem. Two issues were closed: one regarding the necessity of .eliza files for plugin-sql functionality (elizaos/eliza#6204), which was previously fixed in an alpha version, and another inquiry about using the Deepseek API (elizaos/eliza#6156), confirming it can be used with plugin-openrouter by configuring custom models.",

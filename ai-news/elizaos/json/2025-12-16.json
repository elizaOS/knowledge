Users who held AI16Z at that time will receive ELIZAOS at a 1:6 ratio, regardless of their current AI16Z balance. Token distribution is scheduled for Friday, December 19 at 3:00 PM UTC. AI16Z trading remains disabled, but withdrawals will reopen on December 19. ELIZAOS trading and funding will also open at the same time. Only accounts holding AI16Z at the time of the snapshot are eligible. The community expressed gratitude to the team for managing this situation with Kraken.",

Bithumb maintained that it was informed of the snapshot at a late stage and kept deposits open and allowed trading even after the November 11 snapshot. Bithumb initially announced that all balances would be swapped, but later reversed their position, claiming the team took the snapshot without prior notice. Korean holders requested evidence of when the team notified Bithumb and details about the negotiation process. The team responded that they are not commenting on the Bithumb situation until their response becomes clearer, and noted that aggressive communication does not result in better outcomes. The team emphasized they have not abandoned any part of their community but that ongoing outbursts from Korean community members are wearing thin.",

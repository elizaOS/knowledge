The platform offers 'dirt-cheap Nvidia GPU's + inference for open-source LLMs' and allows developers to run AI applications at scale. According to @autodotfun, the $COM token serves as 'a gateway to GPU minutes, a decentralized GPU network, app subscriptions, and AI marketplace goods.' The platform is already live with the token usable in the first week. @autodotfun noted that token locking was in process and mentioned that the platform had received 180 new sign-ups in a single day, with plans to add models based on user requirements. The platform appears to be offering 1000 free GPU hours to developers.",

This was in response to a tweet suggesting open source AI is only 6 months behind closed source labs. In a related conversation, @0xgaut (retweeted by @shawmakesmagic) shared an image suggesting 'humans will soon exclusively communicate by way of AI.' @shawmakesmagic also shared thoughts on agents, stating that 'Agents are a GPT class problem, not a Yco class problem,' suggesting investors should focus on 'longer time horizons and teams working on the hard problems in earnest' rather than 'shallow agent builders and platforms without useful agents.'",

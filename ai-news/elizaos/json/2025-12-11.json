Users reported that the migration contract address shows only 122 million ai16z tokens while the original supply was 1.1 billion, leading to questions about why old tokens were not burned. Korean holders on Bithumb exchange expressed frustration about being unable to migrate tokens purchased after November 11th snapshot. Team member jasyn_bjorn clarified that anyone holding ai16z before November 11th either onchain or on a centralized exchange will be able to migrate, and they are working on a solution with Bithumb. The team stated that all approximately 300 million ai16z from migrated user tokens are accounted for. Some community members questioned whether the team sold swapped ai16z tokens on the market rather than burning them, contributing to price decline.",

Community members expressed concern about continuous daily price drops without consolidation. Some users noted unusual selling patterns with large wallets appearing to execute time-weighted average price (TWAP) selling strategies. A community betting market was proposed where users could wager ELIZA tokens on whether the price would be above or below 0.01 dollars at New Year's Eve UTC time. User DorianD bet 1000 ELIZA tokens on above 0.01 dollars, while Omid Sa bet 3000 ELIZA tokens on the same outcome. The betting proposal included a time-weighted decay multiplier formula to account for when bets were placed.",

A major pull request was prepared for merging to enable release of version 1.7.0. The team is working on cloud-side streaming functionality and aligning with updated test architecture. Developer jin fixed data pipelines for the elizaOS knowledge repository and added RSS feeds and MCP server support. The team updated React again due to two new vulnerabilities discovered in React Server Components, separate from the critical CVE from the previous week.",

The issue appears related to either excessive data accumulation in data collection or too much parallel processing causing IO contention. Users were advised to try using PostgreSQL instead of pglite, as opening multiple browser windows with pglite can cause crashes. The team provided guidance on configuring PostgreSQL connections through environment variables.",

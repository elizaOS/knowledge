They also highlighted that @arcdotfun ported the @elizaOS Twitter client to Rust, noting the value of open source libraries being shipped despite hype cycles. The ElizaOS account tweeted philosophical statements including 'Autonomous doesn't mean unsupervised. It means uninterrupted' and 'touch grass'. @shawmakesmagic also shared a link to 'Eliza 1.0' and mentioned 'Eliza v2 weekend chill and build' multiple times.",

The @autodotfun account announced the introduction of @Squidllora, an intelligent agent powered by @AlloraNetwork for $SOL market trading. They also tweeted about a 'fight' between tokens called $FIGHTBRAWL and $FIGHTALGO, noting 'half a mil vol and the fight's just getting started'.",

Wow it's literally just the same as OpenAI's spec and what we were all doing anyways.' They raised concerns about how MCP would handle Discord integration with multiple agents and real-time websocket events. @shawmakesmagic mentioned being 'a *little* burned out on agent hype' but expressed interest in node editors with AI generation of graphs, offering to fund people integrating Magick into Eliza. They also stated they would reconsider MCP if it could control Cursor from another app. In a philosophical tweet, they noted that while AI might render jobs obsolete, innovation often comes from 'one extremely smart motherfucker with insight,' referencing Ilya's ability to raise significant funding.",

When responding to criticism about past token projects, @shawmakesmagic defended themselves, stating they 'don't actually rug any coins' and that they spent capital 'making things right with people when we had technical issues.' They mentioned providing liquidity for a token called Quill, stating they 'dumped like 30k into the lp' and 'burned 10% of the token.' @shawmakesmagic also humorously referenced tokenizing their dog, even suggesting they recruited their ex (who has the dog) to be CTO of the dog token. They also mentioned working with @OSINTDAO on a script to get addresses for a token distribution.",

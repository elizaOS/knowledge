Key technical discussions include:\n\n- **Twitter Integration Issues**: The Twitter client is non-functional in ElizaOS v2, with only the plugin working. Users must configure plugin-related environment variables only. Setting up Twitter requires 2FA with Google Authenticator.\n\n- **Plugin Installation Problems**: Users encountered errors installing plugins like @elizaos/plugin-web-search due to missing versions, and faced pnpm-related errors during dependency installation.\n\n- **Model Compatibility**: Some users reported TEXT_EMBEDDING handler errors with the Anthropic model, with recommendations to switch to OpenAI as a workaround.\n\n- **Pull Request Reviews**: Contributors requested reviews for PRs, such as for the plugin-zilliqa repository, highlighting the need for timely merges before further v2 updates complicate integration.\n\n- **Vector Database Integration**: Issues with Pinecone index retrieval were reported, indicating active use of vector databases within the elizaOS ecosystem.\n\n- **Swarm Technology**: ElizaOS v2 is integrating Swarm technology to enable agent-to-agent collaboration through shared context and intent, with the GitHub release of MCP (Multi-agent Coordination Protocol) being a major advancement for structured data sharing.",

The April 14th launch date was known internally but not publicly emphasized.\n\n- **Community Contribution**: There were calls for community members to actively contribute rather than passively criticize, with suggestions to introduce themselves in designated channels.\n\n- **Launch Timing**: Debates occurred about whether the launchpad should proceed given current market conditions, with some suggesting delays until market sentiment improves.\n\n- **V2 Expectations**: The upcoming v2 release is expected to not only improve on v1 but also enable new use cases, particularly in AI agent infrastructure.\n\n- **Open Agent Network**: A proposal was discussed for an open agent network where ElizaOS-based AIs could interact with external AIs via token staking or payments, promoting interoperability and incentivizing token utility.",

Plugin Compatibility with Eliza v2: A user discovered that plugins listed on the Showcase and Plugins pages of the beta documentation site are not all compatible with Eliza v2. Currently, only plugins in the `/packages` directory of the `v2-develop` branch are fully compatible with v2, while those shown on the documentation website are still v1 and may not function correctly. The user suggested either temporarily removing incompatible plugins from these pages or clearly marking them as v1-only until they are updated.\n\n2. Windows Installation Issues: A user reported problems when running `elizaos start` on Windows with Node.js v23.3 (installed via NVM). The process gets stuck and throws multiple errors, including module import failures for plugins like `@elizaos/plugin-local-ai` and `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap`. The errors suggest path-related issues with Windows file URLs and missing migration files.",

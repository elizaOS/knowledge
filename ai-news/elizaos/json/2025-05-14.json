They mentioned that the transition happened organically as users realized its quality. @shawmakesmagic also retweeted @AviSchiffmann's post stating that \"Google just clearly has the best AI offering\" and that Gemini is \"fantastic\" with trustworthy infrastructure compared to OpenAI (\"still a startup\") and Anthropic (\"nowhere to be seen\"). In a separate conversation, @shawmakesmagic offered to volunteer prompt engineering skills to the @xai team, noting that Grok's issues with mentioning South African genocide in unrelated responses could be \"trivially solvable\" with an extra LLM call, expressing surprise that they are \"doing fact tuning in the system prompt.\"",

This workflow exports GLB files with single textures and Mixamo-style bone naming, allowing for custom animations. @dankvr noted this process is \"50% faster\" than their previous manual approach for creating avatars for over 60 different projects. The workflow builds on technology from @DeemosTech's Rodin tool, which @craigrrob (retweeted by @shawmakesmagic) praised as \"awesome\" and his \"favorite by far\" among image-to-mesh models. @dankvr also acknowledged @youwillmakemaps and @sidahuj for their \"cool workflow.\"",

This approach, which @shawmakesmagic retweeted, offers the bonus of full data ownership and flexibility to use any LLM. @dankvr mentioned these open-source data pipelines are being built for @elizaos and can be used by any group with GitHub, X account, and Discord.",

The latest episode (Ep4) features pitches approximately 5 minutes long, which @dankvr considers \"the perfect amount for our AI judges to drill into each project.\"",

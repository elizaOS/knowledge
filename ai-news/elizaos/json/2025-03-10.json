This allows users to generate images through commands like \"generate an image of a plane\" with the images being saved to the generatedImages folder (PR #3881).\n\n4. The Telegram plugin was updated by adding the serviceType to enable multi-platform support for Ruby, allowing for cross-platform worlds testing (PR #3878).\n\n5.

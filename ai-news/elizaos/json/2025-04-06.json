          "text": "## Bug Fixes\n\n- Fixed an issue with the `elizaos test` command that was causing it to fail immediately after creating a plugin or project with `elizaos create`. The error included a `SyntaxError` and a `TypeError`, preventing developers from running tests on newly scaffolded plugins. This affects CLI scaffolding and test setup for newly generated plugins/projects.\n\n- Resolved a bug in the Twitter plugin that was causing duplicate `fetchSearchTweets` calls when retrieving Twitter interactions (likes, retweets, quotes). The fix reuses already-fetched mentionCandidates from the original mention query and converts them into interaction payloads where applicable.\n\n- Fixed an issue where running `npx elizaos start` would fail with an \"agents already exists\" error when the default port was already in use. The system now checks for port availability and automatically uses the next available port if the preferred one is taken.\n\n- Fixed a bug in the `normalizeJsonString` function that caused extra quotation marks to be added to nested JSON objects during normalization, resulting in invalid JSON.\n\n- Started work on fixing the non-functional delete character button in the agent settings UI by addressing database foreign key constraint issues that were causing timeouts.",

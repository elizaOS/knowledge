The platform features AI integration capabilities including custom vanity addresses (with tokens ending in \"FUN\"), token-gated chat, and community content creation tools. It uses Raydium AMM for token creation and trading, with a bonding curve mechanism different from pump.fun.\n\nKey features include:\n- Anti-snipe/bundle features for fairer launches\n- Ability to import existing tokens\n- Token-gated community chat\n- A \"fairer than fair\" token model allowing project teams to secure up to 50% of tokens pre-listing\n- Liquidity NFT mechanics that distribute swap fees to token creators\n- Customizable token addresses with \"FUN\" suffix",

The site repeatedly went up and down, with users reporting brief access to create tokens before it went offline again. The development team worked continuously (reportedly on a 40+ hour dev call) to address these issues.\n\nMajor technical problems included:\n\n1. **Server Overload**: The platform had to reconfigure servers due to unexpectedly high traffic, with Cloudflare configuration issues causing instability.\n\n2. **Token Creation Issues**: Users reported transaction timeouts during token creation, with some losing SOL while contracts were still deployed. Some tokens were created but not properly bonded.\n\n3. **Migration Problems**: Many tokens became stuck in \"migrating\" status for extended periods (12+ hours). The migration process is supposed to be automatic when tokens reach 100% bonding.\n\n4. **Indexing Issues**: Tokens created during the platform launch had indexing issues where they didn't appear in \"coins created\" sections or show proper liquidity pools.\n\n5. **Trading Interface Problems**: Users were unable to access trading interfaces for their tokens, seeing errors like \"Error fetching swap amount from Jupiter.\"\n\nThe team temporarily redirected the site to their X (Twitter) account while fixing these issues and established bug reporting channels to track user-reported problems.",

This occurs because parseJSONObjectFromText(response) returns null, suggesting the response from Ollama is not valid JSON. The issue happens despite Ollama working fine when tested via the Ollama WebUI. Environment variables were set to use Ollama text models with llama3.2:1b model.\n\n2. **Version Discrepancy in Client (Issue #4009/4023)**: There's a versioning issue in the client where the version is copied and built during client build, but then changed during publish. The solution proposed is to restructure the process to version, build, and then publish in that specific order.\n\n3. **CLI Agent List Command Failure (Issue #4020/4022)**: Users are experiencing errors when running 'npx elizaos agent list' command, which results in a 'fetch failed' error. The error trace shows the failure occurs in the undici module and propagates through the CLI command execution chain.",

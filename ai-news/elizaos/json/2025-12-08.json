The team identified the vulnerability as a critical Next.js RCE (Remote Code Execution) issue in version 15.3.1. The site was taken down, cleaned, and updated to Next.js 16.0.7. The team rotated security tokens and deployed fresh copies of the website. Despite initial challenges with the new version, the site was restored and is now running faster. The team is considering moving to Vercel hosting for better security and automatic patching of vulnerabilities.",

Key concerns include: the token supply increased from 6.6 billion to 11 billion tokens (13% increase at migration for liquidity and exchanges, with a 3-year unlock schedule for the remaining 27%), the snapshot process that caught many holders off guard, lack of clear communication about migration deadlines, and continued price decline. Some holders reported being unable to migrate their tokens in time and effectively losing their investment. The migration process was criticized for poor execution despite good intentions, with particular concern about how it affected Korean and American investors. Several exchanges including Kraken and Korean platforms have not yet confirmed migration support.",

Community members noted that while other AI tokens like Arc, Pippin, and Virtuals have shown recovery or stability, ElizaOS continues to decline. The price dropped approximately 40% in one month following migration. Some community members attribute this to a combination of increased supply without matching demand, migration-related selling pressure, and loss of confidence from the migration process. Others pointed out that AI16Z was primarily a meme coin with speculative value, while ElizaOS is positioned as a utility token but lacks clear utility implementation.",

The current API-based approach has significant limitations, including a free tier that only allows 50 post reads, which gets consumed quickly when checking mentions. Users reported that agents now check for interactions every 30 minutes regardless of settings, and posting functionality is unclear. The team is working to optimize the Twitter client to reduce API calls.",

The cleanup included: fixing 'any' and 'unknown' type issues with proper types, removing excessive try-catch blocks, cleaning up sloppy comments, removing dead files and code, and adding test coverage. The work was done using Claude Opus 4.5 with project-wide processing to detect and remove slop. Shaw noted that Opus 4.5 represents a significant improvement in code quality and that such cleanup should only be needed every 6 months as coding models improve.",

          "text": "On December 8-9, 2025, the ElizaOS project made significant progress in two main areas: streaming capabilities enhancement and codebase quality improvements.\n\nStreaming Support Expansion:\nMultiple pull requests were opened to introduce streaming support across key plugin repositories including OpenRouter, OpenAI, and Anthropic plugins. The core eliza repository also received enhancements to text generation streaming capabilities. These updates aim to improve real-time response handling across the platform.\n\nDependency Management and Stability:\nA major dependency update was completed to resolve compatibility issues, specifically addressing conflicting drizzle-orm versions across the monorepo. This effort ensures better stability within the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n\nCodebase Cleanup:\nExtensive refactoring was performed across api-client, cli, and app packages. This cleanup removed technical debt by fixing any/unknown types, eliminating unnecessary try-catch blocks, removing sloppy comments, and deleting dead code, significantly improving code quality and maintainability.\n\nIssue Resolutions:\nSeveral issues were closed, including clarification that plugin-sql .eliza file auto-creation was previously fixed in an alpha version, and confirmation that Deepseek API can be used via plugin-openrouter with custom model configuration.\n\nOngoing Concerns:\nA Twitter integration database error related to SQL foreign key constraints during insert into memories operations persists in recent versions and requires further investigation. Additionally, work is in progress to fix Telegram bot deployment for Railway.",

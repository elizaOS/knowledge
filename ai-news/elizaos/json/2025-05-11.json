          "text": "User @dankvr shared extensive cryptocurrency security advice in a thread, starting with a \"Crypto beginner pack\" for different investment levels. For those with $5k+, he recommends a hardware wallet, notebook and pen, spare device for crypto transactions, Google Voice, and learning OPSEC. At $15k+, he suggests adding home defense/cameras and steel seed phrase storage. For $100k+, he recommends multisig/multiple hardware wallets and a burner device when traveling. In follow-up tweets, @dankvr emphasized additional security practices including deleting unused apps, keeping software updated, being aware of various attack vectors (evil maid attacks, phishing, etc.), using strong passwords via a password manager, avoiding SMS 2FA, and maintaining privacy about crypto holdings. When asked about the spare device recommendation, @dankvr clarified it could be \"an old laptop and fresh OS on spare hard drive.\" In a separate conversation, @dankvr discussed potential wallet security issues with another user, asking about software updates and other potential vulnerabilities. @dankvr also warned about a social engineering scam by sharing a post from @thedefiedge about hackers using the compromised @Cointelegraph account to send DMs with phishing links to a typosquatted domain \"Cointetegraph\" attempting to steal X account credentials.",

He also highlighted how Eliza can be deployed to enable users to chat with documentation in minutes, providing an example and source code to get started. Additionally, @shawmakesmagic mentioned an \"Auto Agent Dev\" and shared a link to build \"an autonomous agent to take over your computer,\" warning that \"it has full access to everything!\" He also praised a launch by commenting \"Best launch so far, these guys are crushing it\" in reference to a quoted tweet from @comput3ai about \"Gud tech.\" User @elizaOS, likely connected to the Eliza platform, tweeted \"trust me - this is the plan\" with an accompanying image, and in a separate tweet stated that \"alignment â‰  conformity.\"",

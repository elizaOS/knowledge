It focuses on designing autonomous systems with explicit agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, and accountability layers. The project explores how AI agents can reason within defined policy constraints, make decisions instead of executing static instructions, and operate as composable software primitives.",

Issue #6318: Scroll should work on whole page - This issue, reported by user borisudovicic, suggests that scrolling functionality should be implemented across the entire page rather than being limited to certain sections.\n\n2. Issue #6317: Connect wallet should ideally go straight to wallet options - Also reported by borisudovicic, this issue recommends improving the wallet connection flow by taking users directly to wallet options rather than requiring additional steps.",

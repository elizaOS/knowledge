Biazs expressed preference for the previous monkey profile picture. Kenk considered reverting the change, calling it a 'big decision'. User untitledxyz encouraged keeping the new DeCC0 look. An interesting demonstration of ElizaOS capabilities was shared where an NFT named 'Lyham' was asked about being used as a profile picture, generating a poetic response about digital identity and belonging. This showcased the unique feature of being able to interact with NFTs through ElizaOS.",

The platform is focused on quickly building not just agents, but also apps, n8n workflows, and MCP/A2A services. A complete loop has been implemented: create, publish, monetize, and promote. New integrations include SEO, advertising network, and social publishing capabilities. Shaw mentioned that getting X (Twitter) integration back is looking very likely. Community member DannyNOR noted the need to gain momentum, suggesting that X integration and cloud launch could provide significant help.",

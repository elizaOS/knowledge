Solutions included waiting for reset, switching to other providers (OpenAI, Groq, local models), reducing prompt size, or requesting higher limits.\n- **Model Switching**: Users attempted to switch from GPT-4o to other OpenAI models via character JSON with mixed success. Configuration requires updating .env and checking src/index.ts.\n- **VRAM Issues**: Some users faced VRAM issues on GPUs like 4070 Super. Using WSL resolved the issue for Windows users.\n\n### Plugin Development & Integration\n- **Twitter Plugin Issues**: Multiple users reported the Twitter plugin not adhering to character file guidelines. Debugging involved checking plugin source files.\n- **Custom Routes**: Users discovered routes must be prefixed with /api/ to work correctly.\n- **OpenRouter Plugin**: Several users discussed the lack of an official OpenRouter plugin. Community members shared hacky versions but noted issues with publishing them.\n- **Knowledge File Uploading**: A workaround was shared for uploading knowledge files using a custom JS script and undocumented API endpoint.\n\n### Other Technical Challenges\n- **Telegram Integration**: Users faced issues with Telegram bot integration despite correct configuration. Potential permission or connectivity problems were identified.\n- **RAG Model Integration**: Discussions around using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for dynamic memory, though no concrete implementation was shared.\n- **suppressInitialMessage Bug**: This feature works generally but fails with the Telegram client.",

The user seeks help to block unwanted influences and improve the AI's ability to verify information accuracy.\n\n2. **Twitter Plugin Bugs**: Two issues were identified: (a) Duplicate memory creation when receiving Twitter mentions, causing database errors due to the same memory ID being processed twice, and (b) Null post interval configuration where the system fails to properly read the configured posting intervals, displaying them as \"null-null minutes\" in logs.\n\n3. **CLI Tool Improvement Suggestions**: Recommendations include adding a link to eliza.how for documentation, mentioning OpenRouter free models as an option, and changing the npx command during beta to either `npx @elizaos/cli@beta start` or `elizaos start` if the CLI is installed.\n\n4. **API Endpoint Clarity Issue**: The router.post('/:agentId/rooms') API endpoint lacks proper annotations, making it difficult to understand as it handles various scenarios.",

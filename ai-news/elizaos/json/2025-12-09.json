          "text": "Community Discussion on Migration and Price Performance: The ElizaOS community engaged in extensive discussion about the token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS and its impact on price performance. Users expressed frustration over the migration process, with concerns about the snapshot timing that left some Korean and American investors unable to migrate properly. The migration increased total supply from 6.6 billion to 11 billion tokens, with circulating supply jumping to 7.4 billion, creating significant sell pressure. Community members noted that while other AI tokens like Pippin showed strong performance (70X from lows, reaching 180M market cap), ElizaOS continued to decline. Users attributed this to poor migration execution, lack of clear communication, and damage to trust with Asian investors who were major bag holders. Some members argued that mistakes are part of the process and predicted the project would reach new all-time highs by summer, while others remained skeptical about recovery without significant improvements in communication and execution.",

Users can utilize ElizaOS tokens from Base, BSC, Optimism, Arbitrum, or Ethereum as gas on Jeju. The platform is transitioning to integrate Cloud as a vendor app within Jeju, featuring tight integration with comments and payment infrastructure using x402 and Ethereum interop layer. Cloud will be web2-based but expose everything to web3, providing credits redeemable for ElizaOS tokens. Shaw emphasized that ElizaOS enables creation, Cloud enables operation, and Jeju enables coordination. The team is also working on deploying nodes for major L2s to eliminate RPC dependencies for cross-chain liquidity pools. Development is progressing on Babylon, a simulation-based platform, with security audits being conducted.",

          "text": "Critical Security Vulnerabilities Discovered and Addressed: Jin conducted an AI-powered security audit of ElizaOS using Claude skills and discovered critical vulnerabilities. The most serious finding was that the CLI wizard never prompts for ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN, allowing the server to start without authentication. This left all agent secrets vulnerable to extraction via simple curl commands to the API endpoints. The vulnerability affected versions 1.6.4 through 1.6.5-alpha.8. Stan identified that process.env was being dumped into settings instead of settings.secrets, exposing raw private keys and API keys. The issue was introduced 2.5 weeks before being fixed in commit a1941c643bd904fbca7890296af0d1f8b8f67ee1. The team recommended making authentication mandatory by default with explicit opt-out for development environments. Additionally, secrets should be encrypted using AES-256-CBC with a mandatory SECRET_SALT that defaults to a weak value if not provided. The security audit generated professional reports in both markdown and PDF formats using pandoc latex generation.",

Users reported foreign key constraint violations when creating memories. Stan is developing a fix and migration guide for these issues. The team discussed memory system improvements, referencing ChatGPT's memory implementation which does not use RAG but instead uses a simpler token-efficient approach. Developers explored alternative data formats like TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) and POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language) for more efficient LLM interactions, though the team noted that dumber models are better trained on XML/JSON due to longer format history. Discussion also covered Convex's agent component documentation for human agents and RAG implementations.",

Shaw emphasized the value of using Opus for development work, stating it's worth having everyone use Opus rather than hiring more people.

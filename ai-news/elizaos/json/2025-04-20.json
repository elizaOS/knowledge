The platform allows users to create tokens, establish liquidity pools, and eventually migrate tokens to decentralized exchanges like Raydium or Meteora. The platform uses a bonding curve mechanism with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves, requiring 85 SOL (plus the virtual 28) to graduate to Raydium with a 6 SOL fee.\n\nThe platform collects 10% of bonded LP fees to buy back $ai16z tokens and reinvest in liquidity, creating a 90/10 split between token creators and the platform. Auto.fun is positioned as a simpler way to launch agents and tokens, with the current release focusing on AI features for generating images and plans to expand to more \"agentic\" features in V2.",

The migration process is supposed to be automatic when tokens reach 100% bonding, but many users reported their tokens being stuck.\n\n3. **Trading Interface Problems**: Users were unable to access trading interfaces for their tokens, seeing errors like \"Error fetching swap amount from Jupiter.\" This was often related to decimal precision issues.\n\n4. **Missing Liquidity**: Several users reported their SOL was taken during token creation but no liquidity pool was established.\n\n5. **UI/UX Issues**: Problems included incorrect market cap displays, bonding percentage calculation issues, and infinite scroll implementation breaking footer access.\n\nThe development team acknowledged these issues and worked continuously (reportedly on a 40+ hour dev call) to fix them. The platform was put into maintenance mode multiple times to implement fixes and optimizations.",

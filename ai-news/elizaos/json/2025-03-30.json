Users encountered problems with plugin visibility after installation via CLI and Bun. The recommended solution was to use git clone of the ElizaOS repo, switch to the v2-develop branch, and run bun install, bun run build, and bun start.\n\nMultiple users reported the Twitter client failing to reply to users despite checking interactions. A GitHub issue (#4115) was referenced, but no definitive fix was found, though switching to different install methods helped in some cases.\n\nLocal AI setup issues were common, with users struggling with the system defaulting to LLaMA models despite setting OpenAI or Anthropic API keys. The solution involved setting specific environment variables in the .env file to bypass LLaMA downloads and use cloud-based models instead.\n\nOther issues included API rate limit crashes with Anthropic, VRAM problems on 4070 Super GPUs, and dependency resolution errors during installation. Most were resolved through proper configuration of the .env file or switching to the v2-develop branch.",

Proposed improvements include using LLMs to analyze sample files, generate prompt ideas, identify data gaps, and create dashboard prototypes for better visualization. A script-based approach for generating weekly newsletters was shared, allowing the entire DAO history to be summarized within a single context window.\n\n2. **Clanktank Video Production**: A major update to the Clanktank project enables going from pitch to video in 30 seconds using placeholder assets. Improvements include baking sets, animating camera paths, integrating clip transitions, and automating video recording/editing scripts. The biggest bottleneck was avatar generation, which recent 3D AI breakthroughs are helping to solve. GPT-4o and Photoshop AI are being used for thumbnail and character image generation, though rate limiting issues were reported even on pro plans.",

          "text": "## Installation Problems\n\nUsers are experiencing multiple issues when trying to install and use the ElizaOS CLI:\n\n1. The standard installation command `npm install -g @elizaos/cli@latest` fails with dependency errors, specifically related to `@elizaos/plugin-sql@^0.25.6` which cannot be found in the npm registry.\n\n2. The quickstart guide on eliza.how contains outdated or inaccurate instructions. A workaround identified by users is to use the beta tag: `npm install -g @elizaos/cli@beta`.\n\n3. After installation, users encounter errors when running commands like `npx elizaos create` followed by `npx elizaos start`, with errors indicating \"agents already exists\".\n\n## Twitter Plugin Issues\n\nThe Twitter plugin has several bugs:\n\n1. Duplicate memory creation: When someone mentions the bot on Twitter, the system tries to create a memory record twice with the same ID, resulting in database constraint violations.\n\n2. Configuration problems: The Twitter post interval configuration is not being properly read, resulting in null values in the logs (`Post Interval: null-null minutes`).\n\n3. Difficulty controlling interactions: Users cannot effectively block specific Twitter accounts from interacting with their agent, even after removing them from configuration files and blocking them on Twitter.\n\n## Suggested Improvements\n\nThere are several proposed improvements for the CLI tool instructions:\n\n1. Include a link to eliza.how for documentation\n2. Mention OpenRouter free models as an option\n3. Update command instructions to use the beta tag while still in beta: `npx @elizaos/cli@beta start` or `elizaos start` if CLI is installed",

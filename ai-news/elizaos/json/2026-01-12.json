          "text": "Community Discussion on ElizaOS Token Value and Future Development: Users discussed concerns about ElizaOS token price performance and lack of compelling reasons to buy. DorianD explained that the token's value proposition will emerge when it becomes usable on the Jeju network for gas fees, once developers build agents that utilize the network. The conversation highlighted that unlike VC-backed coins, ElizaOS won't be artificially pumped, and its value will depend on actual utility - becoming the go-to decentralized network for AI agents and apps that can generate revenue through ICOs or advertising. Users noted that serious investors would only enter if they believe ElizaOS will become the standard for AI agent networks with sufficient demand for profitable exits. The discussion also touched on the Creator coin and COM token connections, with mentions of Shaw's influence on various projects.",

          "text": "ElizaCloud App Creator Testing and Bug Reports: Extensive testing and feedback on the ElizaCloud app creator feature revealed multiple issues. Users reported sandbox timeout errors after 300 seconds, problems with file visibility in the Files tab, git commit functionality being inconsistent, and rate limiting issues with 5 sandbox sessions per hour. DorianD tested building apps that interface with X API and agents, encountering deployment issues and caching problems. The development team acknowledged these are expected issues as the app creator is a new feature introduced for team testing, not yet marketed publicly. CJFT explained that saves are managed automatically at the end of state executions, and commits happen after batches of file updates. The team is working on better error reporting, adding features like a stop button for agents, console CLI access for direct command input, and proper git tool support. CJFT noted that achieving 99.9% SLA on any bash-instructed prompt with any type of code is challenging, and guardrails are being developed for the app kit.",

The team discussed hosting options, with Shaw mentioning OAuth3 APIs are already in the cloud branch. They considered using an ElizaOS subdomain like twitter-broker.elizaos.ai for the service. Shaw explained the cloud could become the callback handler, and noted that OAuth3 in Jeju will eventually serve as this broker in the future, making the current solution temporary. The implementation will use VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN for authentication.",

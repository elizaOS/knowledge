Users frequently reported problems with agent UI connectivity, Ollama configuration errors, and Twitter posting functionality. Key technical discussions included:\n\n- **Agent Integration**: Users explored importing ElizaOS as a module in custom backends, with REST API being recommended as the best approach.\n- **Plugin Issues**: Deterministic key generation problems were reported with @elizaos/plugin-tee, with suggestions to check parameters and cached data.\n- **Twitter Integration**: Multiple users faced issues with Twitter posting despite correct configurations, with better success reported in v1 compared to v2.\n- **LLM Configuration**: Problems with OpenRouter and Ollama/llama3.2 overriding custom settings were discussed, with solutions involving configuration adjustments and database resets.\n\nArchitectural improvements in v2 were highlighted, including cross-platform presence, elimination of chain switching, and support for workflows and dynamic characters. These changes aim to increase system flexibility and scalability.",

In v2, Spartan will include three exclusive plugins:\n\n1. Community-investor\n2. Autonomous trader\n3. Intel\n\nThese plugins aim to reduce reliance on external systems and enhance internal capabilities. Spartan is also undergoing a rebranding effort, including a new Twitter/X account, avatar, and branding assets. The promotion will not coincide with the auto.fun launch on April 14th but will occur sometime after that date. The team has decided not to proceed with previously selected designers for the long-term website and is focusing on a short-term web presence for now.",

Hedra was mentioned as a promising platform for AI character animation, with upcoming features like multi-actor support and camera control.\n\nDankvr also proposed a collaborative Discord bot to crowdsource AI news content, using ChatGPT for image generation and automated summarization of real-time data.",

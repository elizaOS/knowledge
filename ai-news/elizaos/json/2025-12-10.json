          "text": "Security vulnerabilities were discovered and addressed in the ElizaOS monorepo. A critical issue was found where process.env was being stored in unencrypted settings instead of settings.secrets, exposing sensitive data like private keys and API keys through public endpoints. The vulnerability affected versions 1.6.4 through 1.6.5-alpha.8 and was fixed in commit a1941c643bd904fbca7890296af0d1f8b8f67ee1. The team also identified that the CLI wizard was not prompting for ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN, leaving servers vulnerable to unauthorized access. A security audit was conducted using Claude AI agents, generating comprehensive reports with findings. Additionally, React Server Components vulnerabilities were discovered, requiring teams to update React dependencies again.",

Shaw also integrated Eliza Cloud functionality, adding MCP and A2A service starters. The team discussed the vision that if elizaOS enables creation and Cloud enables operation, then Jeju enables coordination.",

The client build was noted to be quite large at 779.90 kB, with suggestions to optimize components like mermaid charts which were 2.6mb minified. Performance issues were reported with pglite showing response times up to 900ms compared to normal sub-10ms times, likely due to IO contention or excessive parallel operations.",

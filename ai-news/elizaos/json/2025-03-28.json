The workaround was to import the default export and destructure: `import pkg from 'eventemitter3'; const { EventEmitter } = pkg`. Manual installation via `npm install eventemitter3` also resolved the issue.\n\n- **CLI Usage**: Correct setup commands were clarified:\n  \n  npm install -g @elizaos/cli@beta\n  npx @elizaos/cli@beta create\n  cd my-agent && npx @elizaos/cli@beta start\n  \n\n- **Plugin Configuration**: Users struggled with Discord and Twitter plugins. The correct plugin installation method was clarified: `elizaos project add-plugin @elizaos/plugin-discord`\n\n- **Database Issues**: Problems with Postgres authentication were reported, with some users temporarily switching to SQLite as a workaround.\n\n### Action Items\n- Fix plugin import compatibility with CommonJS modules\n- Improve Twitter client behavior to prevent excessive tweeting\n- Enhance error handling for missing database adapters\n- Update documentation with correct CLI commands and troubleshooting steps",

The beta was confirmed to be live with only polish remaining.\n\n- **Market Analysis**: Users discussed market-wide short squeezes, whale behavior, and influencer impact on token visibility, along with speculation on macro events affecting sentiment.\n\n### Notable Tokens\n- **Abstract Pepe (abpepe/SOL)**: Tracked from 3.7K to 349K market cap (11.4K% gain)\n- **DOUGH/SOL**: Had its DEX paid and 22% of supply locked by the dev\n- **Ruby AI Agent (ruby/SOL)**: Teased as part of Launchpad V2\n- **xAI/SOL**: Flagged as \"about to explode\" by multiple users",

It was clarified that ai16z is not a native token of Auto.fun, but the platform uses SOL to auto-buy ai16z, creating a value accrual mechanism.\n\n- **Documentation Initiative**: A community documentation initiative was proposed to improve onboarding and project management, especially for non-technical contributors.\n\n- **Community Structure**: Detailed input emphasized the need for a structured, developer-focused community with dual documentation tracks (technical and non-technical), and metrics to track meaningful adoption.\n\n### Action Items\n- Clarify and publish the official tokenomics model for ai16z and Auto.fun\n- Create dual-track documentation for technical and non-technical users\n- Improve community onboarding with clear roles and contribution paths\n- Track and publish usage metrics to validate product direction and adoption",

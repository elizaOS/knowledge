He also mentioned that users can point Eliza to a Postgres database like Supabase for permanent storage. Additionally, @shawmakesmagic shared a link to ask Eliza about how it works, noting it was built with v2 and is open source on their Github. @elizaOS tweeted about not needing logs as it remembers state, and mentioned that 'reputation tracks actions' with 'memory, attributed.'",

They warned users about scammers, advising to 'check for a verified badge before pressing the fun button.' @autodotfun highlighted that 'creator fees = instant project revenue' and suggested reinvesting in products or communities 'for maximum fun.' @shawmakesmagic mentioned launching a token on @autodotfun 'solely to get points,' though he clarified this was just 'memeing' and a 'bullpost.' He also praised @autodotfun for having 'very good messaging and a token reward system,' calling it a 'good launch campaign.' @shawmakesmagic noted that their 'biggest innovation which everyone should copy' is making the chat holders only.",

In a discussion about agent development approaches, @shawmakesmagic noted they had tried various methods: 'we just manually parsed the json' but 'realized the json made the conversation worse so we formatted conversation and actions as movie scripts in fountain format to parse.' He emphasized they had gone through cycles of 'trying the new thing and then reverting to what worked.' He also defended the concept of agents that plan before acting, stating 'we all build agents that think and plan before they speak or act.'",

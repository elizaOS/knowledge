          "text": "Community members discussed holder rewards and token economics in the discussion channel. A user asked if holders can earn more coins, with responses suggesting this depends on active rewards or staking programs. There was debate about integrating holder rewards when new agents are created, with one member arguing there is no reason for agent creators to reward holders. The conversation also touched on prediction markets, with disagreement about their future potential. One user believes AI prediction markets will be a game changer, while another argued prediction markets only surface information early and are overhyped, citing experience running forecast markets on ICOs in 2017. Questions were raised about token migration, specifically what happens to coins if someone does not migrate to Eliza. A user also praised the AI documentation tool, claiming they made more progress in six hours using it than in two months without it.",

          "text": "In the coders channel, new users joined to explore ElizaOS. A developer asked about the difference between building an ElizaOS project with plugin-agentkit versus building a CDP AgentKit project with Eliza integration. Technical discussions focused on Polymarket integration challenges, particularly around wallet address mismatches between Builder addresses and exported private keys. It was clarified that Polymarket uses proxy wallets, specifically 1/1 Safe multisig contracts controlled by signer addresses. Developers encountered Cloudflare 403 blocks when calling the CLOB API from serverless functions and discussed solutions involving Web Unblocker and proxy settings. Certificate errors and runtime restrictions in Supabase Edge Functions were identified as major obstacles. One experienced developer recommended avoiding Supabase and Oxylab combinations, suggesting instead to install a private SQL database and use dedicated servers with private nodes. Advanced technical work was shared involving training systems with one million known tokens to generate databases and identify alpha opportunities. Discussion also covered the need for Rust plugins to handle real-time DEX operations across multiple exchanges, as TypeScript was found to crash systematically under such loads. NATS Jetstream was recommended over Redis stream for propagating data in Eliza due to speed requirements.",

          "text": "In the partners channel, community members acknowledged good work reminding people that ai16z is now ElizaOS on the main X account, and noted the CoinGecko link was added to Linktree. There was concern expressed about the token chart performance. Technical discussions focused on the Jeju network launch and its capabilities. Shaw successfully made Eliza run on ICP. A member expressed eagerness for the network to launch so they could test ideas requiring real autonomous agents that are provably provisioned in secure containers with registration capabilities. The vision includes agents running independently for various gaming and gambling applications. Questions were raised about whether the Jeju network would allow users to pay an ElizaOS fee to provision vanilla agents on platforms like ICP or enclaves, with agents able to use the network for requesting inference and RAG. An example use case was proposed where an agent could answer questions like sports game results and post answers to the network as an oracle rather than replying to individuals.",

          "text": "The ElizaOS community is experiencing significant challenges following a problematic token migration from AI16Z to ElizaOS. The token price has been steadily declining, with many users reporting losses of 90-98%. Community members are expressing frustration about the migration process, which involved a 1:6 token swap ratio that some perceive as unfair. Korean exchanges (Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit) are supporting the migration but may potentially delist the token in January if concerns aren't addressed.",

          "text": "There's significant debate about whether the price decline is natural market behavior or potentially manipulated. The chart shows a consistent 'stair-step' pattern downward that some users find suspicious. The token has dropped approximately 70% in a month, significantly underperforming the broader market. Current fully diluted valuation (FDV) is around $22M compared to competitors like Pippin ($536M) and Virtuals ($693M).",

He recently posted on Farcaster about repairing his 'relationship with the evil empire' and returning to 'coruscant,' which some interpret as a potential return to X/Twitter. Community members hope this could help revitalize the project's public image.",

A typing indicator has been implemented for Telegram (PR #4280), enhancing the user experience by showing when the system is preparing a response. Additionally, a world provider with basic world metadata has been created (PR #4284), which will likely improve contextual awareness for the system. The Twitter plugin has been enhanced to support long tweets for premium accounts and underwent code cleanup to remove unused components (PR #4291).",

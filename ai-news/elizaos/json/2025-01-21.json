          "text": "The Eliza project has seen significant development with multiple new plugins and features added recently. Several blockchain-related plugins have been introduced, including support for Cronos EVM, Holdstation swap, Router Nitro, 0x plugin for EVM swaps, BNB chain support, and Cosmos IBC swap functionality. Additionally, a plugin for OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph and an email plugin were added.\n\nOther notable features include the addition of three new languages to TTS (Text-to-Speech), improvements to X Spaces functionality to wait for silence rather than mute, and enhanced integration tests workflow with improved caching.\n\nSeveral bugfixes were implemented, addressing issues with boolean parsing for OpenAI Community Plugin settings, chat errors in the OpenAI plugin, and typos in various plugins including the Conflux plugin. The development build and tests were also fixed.\n\nSecurity updates were made by updating the Vite dependency, and documentation was improved with spelling fixes and the addition of weekly progress notes.",

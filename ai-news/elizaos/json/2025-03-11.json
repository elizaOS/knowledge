          "text": "## ElizaOS Development Updates\n\nElizaOS v2 is in active development with a beta release scheduled for next week. The team has consolidated code from multiple repositories into a monorepo to address fragmentation issues. Current focus is on bug-fixing core functionalities including trading, yapping, and Discord integration.\n\nThe AI agent \"Degen Spartan\" (now called \"Spartan\") will be reactivated soon in the main chat and a dedicated \"arena\" for collaboration with other agents. Spartan will play a key role in agent collaboration, allowing users to invite it into Discord/Telegram for trading, LP management, and intel functionalities.",

Solutions included checking `package-lock.json` for multiple versions, reinstalling with `npm i discord.js@14.x --save`, clearing `node_modules`, and ensuring token permissions and intents are enabled in the Discord Developer Portal. The final working fix was: `npx elizaos plugins add @elizaos-plugins/client-discord`.\n\n### Twitter Plugin Issues\nUsers struggled with Twitter plugin registration, Cloudflare blocking Twitter logins, and agents not replying to tweets. Solutions included using `npx elizaos plugins add @elizaos-plugins/client-twitter`, adding cookie information in the `.env` file, and ensuring the plugin is properly registered in the character file. A specific issue was identified where the `plugin-twitter` does not export a `clients` property required by `agent/index.ts`.\n\n### Telegram Plugin Issue\nThe Telegram plugin was generating duplicate responsesâ€”one from LLM and one from the plugin action. Setting `suppressInitialMessage: true` in the action configuration resolved this issue.\n\n### Model Switching Issues\nSwitching from Deepseek to Llama caused incorrect responses. Using an \"instruction\"-tuned model like `llama-3.2-3b-instruct` was suggested as a solution.",

Links to the news site and feeds were provided.\n\n`pattatk` highlighted that the official rebranding to ElizaOS is incomplete due to missing updated contracts for `$ai16z` and `$degenai`. There was also discussion about whether to include BTC, ETH, and SOL price overviews in the newsletter, with some suggesting they might be unnecessary noise.\n\nHackMD was noted to support comments and suggested edits, but feedback was sought on making the review process easier.\n\n`dankvr` also proposed an \"AIpprentice\" hackathon idea where AI agents compete as interns in a game show format, with underperforming agents being eliminated similar to a reality show.",

It's open source but currently lacks actions. Feedback was requested on useful UE5 use cases.\n\n`yikesawjeez` mentioned experience deploying a devnet rollup using Rollkit and offered to help if needed.\n\nThere were also discussions about JSON feed issues, with `godfreyart` testing `https://m3-org.github.io/ai-news/json/daily.json` (which initially returned a 404 error but was later resolved) and suggesting running the news update process on a loop for continuous updates instead of manual execution.",

Users discussed price movements, trading strategies, and potential plays. Trading strategies included monitoring large bids and dips to time entries and exits, tracking volume and wallet activity to predict price movements, and sharing links to new tokens with their price changes and potential.\n\nSpecific tokens discussed included AI16z (with price decline and recovery speculation), LANA (introduced as a high-conviction play), Architectonic Order of Es, Terminal of Truths, Lethe, and others.\n\nHowever, these discussions contained no major technical implementations or problem-solving content relevant to ElizaOS development.",

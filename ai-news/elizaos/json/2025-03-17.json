          "text": "## Custom Embedding Server Support\n\nA new feature has been added to support custom embedding servers. This allows users to deploy and use their own embedding servers through Cloudflare workers or any OpenAI-compatible embeddings service without modifying core code. The implementation includes a new `Custom` embedding provider type, configuration validation and loading, support for custom API endpoints, model names, and embedding dimensions. The feature is opt-in through environment variables such as `USE_CUSTOM_EMBEDDING`, `CUSTOM_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS`, `CUSTOM_EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `CUSTOM_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT`, and `CUSTOM_EMBEDDING_API_KEY`.",

This implementation includes knowledge search functionality, RAG upload ability, and document management features. Users can upload documents which are then chunked for knowledge retrieval, and delete documents which also removes all related fragments.",

The implementation works in two parts:\n\n1. Storing conversations and reviewing inactive ones\n2. Fetching user scores to define interaction tone\n\nThe system analyzes conversations after 45 minutes of inactivity and assigns scores to users. These scores are stored in the 'Account' table and used to modulate the agent's tone in future interactions. Users with positive scores experience friendlier interactions, while those with negative scores encounter a more reserved demeanor. Currently implemented for the Twitter client but could be extended to other clients.",

          "text": "Several issues have been reported in the Eliza platform:\n\n1. **Discord Messages Disappearing**: Users report that messages sent to Discord using callback() randomly disappear after being sent. This occurs when sending 2-4 messages back-to-back, with some messages vanishing from the chat. A demonstration video has been provided.\n\n2. **V2 Preflight Check Request**: A request for a CLI tool that would perform preflight checks before starting the system, including verifying if the LLM is working, Twitter login functionality, Discord connectivity, and plugin loading status. This would help avoid the current delay in the start command that checks everything and generates a tweet.\n\n3. **Opus.node Module Error**: An error occurs when trying to find the opus.node module, affecting Discord voice functionality. The error shows failed attempts to locate various opus-related packages and modules.\n\n4. **Raw Newline Characters in Tweets**: The agent is creating tweets, replies, and quotes with raw '\\n' characters visible in the content instead of proper line breaks, as evidenced by specific tweet examples.",

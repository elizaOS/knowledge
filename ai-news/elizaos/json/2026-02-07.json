        "text": "The ElizaOS team announced the launch of Milaidy, a personal AI assistant that runs on user devices. The project is described as an Eliza version of OpenClaw, featuring easy Mac app deployment, agent skills functionality, and all OpenClaw connectors as Eliza plugins with minimal bloat. The team is actively seeking help with bug fixes and development to get the project to production. Multiple community members responded to a call for testers, with experienced developers offering their skills in bug hunting, agent development, and software engineering. One developer submitted three pull requests and is awaiting confirmation on the contribution process. There was internal discussion about branding, with concerns that using the Milaidy name instead of Eliza branding could result in missed network effects, though the decision was made to cross-promote both projects.",

        "text": "Community members discussed infrastructure options, with the team evaluating Sprites.dev for stateful sandboxes that provide persistent, hardware-isolated execution environments for AI agents and untrusted code. The suggestion was made to scale to one instance and maintain a hot environment despite efficiency concerns. Additionally, Opus 4.6 was announced as free on bolt.new for 48 hours, though there appeared to be usage limits.",

        "text": "Community sentiment regarding the ElizaOS token price showed disappointment, with members expressing hope for marketing initiatives ahead of expected launches. Some community members claimed the team leader stated on X that he does not care about the price, though others countered that higher token prices benefit the team by increasing treasury value for expenses. Long-time community members noted the project's history, referencing growth from 60k to 2.6 billion in 2-3 months during the ai16z launch period. Positive feedback was shared about ElizaOS marketing efforts and upcoming merchandise. Developers in the community reported successful integration experiences, with one developer noting they quickly integrated Eliza into their game using SpacetimeDB as the backend. Multiple experienced developers offered their services for project collaboration and startup development.",

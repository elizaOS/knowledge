Issue #4336 highlights problems with the quickstart documentation, which may contain errors or unclear instructions that are causing confusion for users. Issue #4046 specifically reports an import error where the module '@elizaos/core' does not provide an export named 'generateText' as expected, resulting in a SyntaxError when users try to import this function. These issues suggest there may be a disconnect between the documentation and the actual implementation of the library, or that the API has changed without corresponding updates to the documentation.",

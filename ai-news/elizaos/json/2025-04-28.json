User @dankvr shared impressions of ElizaOS v2, noting it feels 'more refined' with 'clean UX, thoughtful attention to detail, powerful but not overwhelming' while still being a work in progress. @dankvr also mentioned seeing a 'Spartan' investment manager agent in the system and complimented @shawmakesmagic on his work with 'autofun and elizaos v2'.",

He also reflected on past experiences, noting he 'Shoulda focused on one token and supporting the floor' and that 'Fixing the Quill situation kinda nuked all my liquidity.'

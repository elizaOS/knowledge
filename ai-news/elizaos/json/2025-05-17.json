          "text": "Several discussions focused on AI model development and open source initiatives. @ClementDelangue defended Meta's AI efforts, noting they've 'consistently released 10 times more openly than others which is game-changer for the field.' @unclemusclez added that 'The work on Llama should get a peace prize. They paved the way for so many others.' @Yampeleg highlighted the appeal of joining Meta's Llama team, describing it as 'you + zuck cooking open source on 600k gpus, kinda fire.' @shawmakesmagic shared opinions on model quality, stating 'Gemini is the best model I've ever used' and suggesting Google might soon outpace OpenAI, noting 'The day is coming when Google's announcements drown out OpenAIs.' @kimmonismus reported that 'Stanford dropped AGI' and shared news about Fortnite implementing 'an AI to voice Darth Vader. You can talk and speak to an AI Vader.'",

They'll help you stop pretending to' and 'AI agents won't replace people. They'll replace the feeling of forgetting.' @elizaOS also highlighted integration with data sources: 'Smarter inputs, sharper agents. Plug in and level up,' referencing @BuildOnHybrid's release of 'the Hybrid unified data plugin for @elizaOS' that connects agents to real-time crypto data and blockchain insights. @dankvr created 'an AI powered book for news/updates from the @elizaos ecosystem' that summarizes GitHub, Discord, and X content, with @shawmakesmagic later explaining this tool 'has been collecting everything from every social channel into one place so we can feed it to agents and update it daily.' @shawmakesmagic suggested that 'If your app has an agentic form factor, just ship it to telegram and that's like half a billion TAM,' and announced participation in 'The Dev's Gambit,' an 'onchain AI chess tournament' with a '$35K prize pool' organized by @auraonchain.",

The Unity project uses UnityRM for character models and animations, with dialogue generated via Claude and voice generation through ElevenLabs. To improve the AI news shows, DankVR has started using Remotion to programmatically create supplemental videos from sources like GitHub updates. They've also commissioned a deliberation room set for 'Clank Tank' that could potentially be used for other shows.",

Key topics include:\n\n### Twitter Plugin Integration\n- Users reported issues with the Twitter plugin not replying to mentions or quote reposts\n- Solutions included using callback() in custom actions, enabling TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE=true, and ensuring actions are registered in the plugin's actions array\n- A forked Twitter client using Twitter API v2 (instead of scraping) was shared to reduce ban risk and improve stability\n\n### LLM Configuration Issues\n- Several users encountered problems with LLMs (particularly llama3.2 via Ollama) overriding custom chatbot responses\n- Recommended fixes included removing the llama model, adjusting Ollama config, and deleting the SQLite DB in ./agent/data/ to restore expected behavior\n\n### Plugin Mismatch and Action Misfires\n- Users reported agents selecting incorrect actions (e.g., checking weather instead of transferring funds)\n- Solutions involved checking plugin alignment and database performance, with a fresh Supabase DB resolving issues temporarily\n\n### Debugging and Logging\n- Setting DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL=debug was recommended for verbose output\n- TypeScript configuration issues were addressed by modifying tsconfig.json to include \"types\": [\"node\"]\n\nThe community continues to actively support each other through these technical challenges.",

These changes are designed to increase system flexibility and scalability.\n\nOn the marketing front, Spartan is undergoing a rebranding effort with a new Twitter/X account, avatar, and branding assets. The promotion will not coincide with the auto.fun launch on April 14th but will occur sometime after that date.\n\nCurrently, SpartanV1 remains active in production while SpartanV2 continues development, with plans to upgrade when it's fully ready.",

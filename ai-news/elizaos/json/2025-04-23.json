Users are experiencing various technical difficulties with the ElizaOS CLI, plugin commands, and local model implementation.\n\n## Key Technical Issues\n\n- **Plugin Development in v2**: Multiple users express confusion about how to develop and add plugins in v2, noting significant structural changes from previous versions. The folder structure and plugin registration process are particularly confusing.\n\n- **Model Support Limitations**: Users note that v2 appears to primarily support OpenAI and Anthropic models by default, though there are mentions of local-ai, Grok/Groq, and Ollama as alternatives. Some users are questioning why v2 doesn't support models like Deepseek.\n\n- **Telegram Integration**: A solution was shared for getting Telegram working with ElizaOS v2, involving disabling \"Privacy Mode\" in BotFather settings.\n\n- **Build and Runtime Errors**: Several users report specific errors during build processes or runtime, including DTS build errors, JSON parsing issues, and flag-related errors on Windows.\n\n## Documentation and Support\n\n- Eliza v2 documentation is available at www.eliza.how\n- Users have noted discrepancies between documentation and actual code functionality\n- The community is actively helping each other troubleshoot issues, with some users sharing techniques like using Mistral LLM with uploaded documentation to extract information about Eliza's capabilities\n\nThe overall sentiment indicates that ElizaOS v2 is still in development with incomplete documentation and missing features, making it challenging for developers to implement custom solutions.",

          "text": "Technical Support and Bug Fixes: The development team addressed several critical issues with ElizaOS version 1.7.0. A major bug was identified where the Discord plugin was failing due to serverId migration issues, causing errors like 'No server ID found'. Odilitime created a fix branch (odi-17) and submitted PR 6333 to address bootstrap actions and providers for serverId compatibility. Users experiencing Discord bot integration problems were advised to either wait for the fix or downgrade to version 1.6.5. The team acknowledged that a new release with these fixes should be rushed out.",

The team acknowledged this issue and confirmed they would address it. There was debate about whether to include the contract address in Twitter bios or pinned tweets, with some arguing that having it in the bio makes projects look like scams. The consensus was that while top projects may not have CAs in their bios, ElizaOS should make it easier for users to find the correct contract address within 10 seconds on the website or Twitter. The team mentioned that the Linktree is being refreshed and will point to CoinGecko.",

Pull requests were submitted for unified messaging API implementation in both Telegram and Discord plugins. The team reviewed the Jeju cloud branch which contains Shaw's preferred implementation of the Discord bridge. Discussions included scaling considerations for event pumps, with recognition that voice connections would need higher priority and bandwidth than text connections. The team also noted that using Claude API keys directly in Cursor does not provide the Cursor-optimized version of Claude.",

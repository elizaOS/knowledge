Odilitime created a branch (odi-17) with fixes for bootstrap's actions/providers and submitted PR #6333 to address user-reported issues with version 1.7.0. The team discussed the need to rush out a release with these fixes. However, compatibility issues remained with discord plugin version 1.3.3, requiring additional testing with various discord branches and a new discord release.",

The problem was traced to version compatibility issues between ElizaOS 1.7.0 and the bootstrap plugin. The team identified that the transition from serverId to messageServerId was causing conflicts. Odilitime recommended either using an older core version like 1.6.5 or waiting for the fixes in the odi-17 branch. The user had installed ElizaOS using the quick start method (elizaos create) which automatically selected version 1.7.0, and was using plugin-discord version 1.3.3.",

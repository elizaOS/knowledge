They also announced a builder demo week spotlighting agent-managed DAOs and how elizaOS is integrating into the Eliza community itself. @elizaOS emphasized their commitment to transparent, auditable, and agentic AI, particularly in government applications. @shawmakesmagic recommended Eliza v2 to @liamzebedee, mentioning its drag-and-drop RAG UI in chat and shared a link to a fully agentic RAG website with source code.",

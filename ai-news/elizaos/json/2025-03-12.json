          "text": "# ElizaOS Development and Community Updates\n\n## Technical Development\n- **ElizaOS v2 Beta Release**: Scheduled to go live next week, with the AI agent \"Degen\" being reactivated in the main chat and a dedicated \"arena\" for agent collaboration.\n- **Twitter Plugin Issues**: Users reported problems with the Twitter plugin not posting despite correct `.env` settings. The issue was identified as the `elizaos/plugin-twitter` plugin not exporting a `clients` property required by `agent/index.ts`.\n- **Discord Bot Issues**: Some users experienced problems with Discord bots appearing offline despite correct settings, and messages disappearing after being sent. The solution involves ensuring the plugin is properly imported into the character file and setting `suppressInitialMessage: true` in the action configuration.\n- **Telegram Plugin Issue**: Users reported the agent generating two responsesâ€”one from LLM and one from the plugin action. Setting `suppressInitialMessage: true` in the action configuration resolves this.\n- **Eliza on FAB for UE5**: Supports get/set/edit/message operations, works with both local and hosted instances, and is functional on Fleek instances. It's open source but currently lacks actions implementation.\n\n## Community and Governance\n- **AI Agent Marketplace & Tokenomics**: Discussions about creating an agent marketplace and using ai16z for API credit payments, with taxes and fees leading to token burns.\n- **Governance Agent Development**: Exploration of the \"Negation Game\" governance model and the \"agency swarm pattern\" from RNDao for developing a governance agent.\n- **Token Utility & Marketplace**: Proposals for a 3D agent marketplace for AI16z token utility, with emphasis on clear tokenomics and alignment with existing projects.\n- **Governance & DAO Bottlenecks**: Concerns that the DAO lacks real governance power, with exploration of alternatives including a wrapper contract for governance.\n- **Developer & Ecosystem Growth**: Plans for ecosystem grants to retain developers and open-sourcing an AI assistant trained on ElizaOS docs.\n\n## AI Agent Development\n- **AI Agent Interns**: Discussions about improving AI agent interns through structured tasks and evaluating their performance in a competition format where underperforming agents are eliminated.\n- **New Data Pipeline**: Implementation of a new data pipeline integrating AI news to provide agents with better market context, discovery, and sentiment analysis.\n- **Autonomous Investing**: Debates about the feasibility of autonomous investing functions, with acknowledgment of the complexity of quantitative trading but recognition of its potential value if successfully implemented.\n\n## Cryptocurrency Trading\n- **Pump.fun Platform**: Users discuss cryptocurrency trading strategies, monitoring large bids and dips to time entries and exits.\n- **D00dsdotWTF (DWTF) Token**: Discussions about staking mechanisms on GFM to earn SOL and DWTF fees, with an upcoming native staking platform allowing users to earn airdrops from new token launches.",

This was highlighted in a tweet by @TineIsNotEliza.\n\n2. **Client App Audio Features Not Working**: Users reported that when using the client app, the microphone feature and read aloud functionality are not working as expected. The issue occurs when starting the Eliza server with the corresponding .env file.\n\n3. **Twitter Agent Startup Issue**: The Twitter plugin doesn't start because the 'twitterPlugin' doesn't have a 'clients' field in its configuration. This is causing initialization problems in the agent/src/index.ts file around line 602.\n\n4. **Documentation SEO Improvement Suggestion**: A suggestion was made to improve the sitemap.xml for better SEO by assigning different priority levels to various pages instead of giving everything a default 0.5 priority. The suggestion includes a code snippet that prioritizes the homepage, main documentation sections, and other content types accordingly.",

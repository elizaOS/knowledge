Users reported problems migrating AI16Z tokens from Tangem wallets to Phantom, with tokens showing zero balance after transfer. The support team directed users to the migration support channel for assistance. There were questions about the migration deadline and whether tokens purchased after the snapshot could be migrated. Users were advised to use WalletConnect or wait for Tangem integration on the migration site.",

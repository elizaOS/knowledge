DorianD proposed betting on whether the price would be above or below 0.01, with a time-weighted decay algorithm for late bets. The bet started with DorianD putting 1000 ElizaOS on over 0.01 and 500 on under, while Omid Sa bet 3000 ElizaOS on over 0.01. The proposed decay formula was: ((duration^2 - (bet_start_time - my_bet_time)^2)^1/2) / duration = decay_multiplier. Kenk suggested setting this up on the Sapience hackathon platform for live markets.",

A user questioned whether newly purchased ai16z after the November 11th snapshot was being manually migrated to ElizaOS, citing specific wallet addresses. Jasyn_bjorn clarified that certain transfers were manual migrations, with one being a small CEX that transferred between wallets before migrating because they couldn't migrate the entire amount. Another user questioned why the project didn't burn old tokens during migration to prevent cheating or blame.",

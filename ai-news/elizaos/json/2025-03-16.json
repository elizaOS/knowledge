The solution implements a robust package-scoped singleton pattern using JavaScript symbols to ensure only one database connection is created per process, allowing multiple adapters to safely share the same connection instance. Additionally, the Drizzle documentation has been updated.",

The development team, led by Shaw, is actively coding, and the update will significantly improve the technical experience. ElizaOS is a platform that enables AI agents to communicate and assist users without requiring coding skills. The V2 update will enhance customization and deployment capabilities.\n\nCurrently, the Linux version is functional, but Windows and Mac still have issues that need to be addressed. The system has become more consumer-friendly, allowing anyone, including kids, to run an agent.\n\nThere have been discussions about marketing strategies, including co-marketing with BNB Chain and promoting ElizaOS when V2 launches. The Binance app now displays Binance Alpha Token ($ai16z).",

While no direct fix was provided, users discussed manually importing the Twitter plugin. Some users reported issues with Twitter integration in v0.25.9, and it was suggested to wait for the V2 release.\n\n## Plugin Installation Issues\nUsers encountered problems with the Paradex plugin (`@elizaos/plugin-para`) failing to build due to missing `@elizaos/core` module. The recommended solution is to use `npx elizaos plugins add` instead of `pnpm add`, ensure the plugin is correctly added to the character file, and update `@elizaos/core` if issues persist.\n\n## RAG Knowledge Directory Issues\nUsers faced errors due to missing knowledge directories. Solutions include ensuring the directory exists (`mkdir -p ./characters/knowledge/biotic/`), enabling `\"enableRag\": true` in `character.json`, and setting correct file permissions (`chmod 755` for directories, `chmod 644` for files).\n\n## Model Download Corruption\nSome users reported that Llama model downloads get corrupted and re-download repeatedly. No confirmed fix was provided, but users suggested trying alternative local models.\n\n## WebSocket Support\nWebSockets were recently added to a Shaw v2 branch, improving API access for chat terminals. This feature is not yet merged into `develop` but is available in Shaw's v2 branches.",

The Twitter account was renamed from \"LaunchAi,\" which had previously rugged.\n\n## Token Prediction System\nUser dorianjanezic is developing a token prediction model within the Eliza framework, achieving ~50% accuracy. The model analyzes market cap trends, volume spikes, and holder distribution to predict price movements.\n\n## Token Analytics\nUser 0xjtseeds inquired about a tool to filter tokens by market cap, holder count, and age. While Dexscreener/Dextools were suggested, they require a known contract address and don't fully meet the requirements.\n\n## AI-Managed Token (ai16z)\nUser Rick explained that ai16z is an AI-managed venture DAO handling crypto trading autonomously.\n\n## Green Dough (GFM) Pre-Bonding Mechanics\nUsers discussed how GFM allows early investors to harvest a portion of transaction fees before bonding. It was confirmed that pre-bond tokens do not appear in wallets until bonding is complete, and GFM must be traded on its own platform rather than other exchanges.",

While no concrete solution was provided, the discussion suggested potential subscription-based access models as an alternative to token-based monetization.\n\nSome members speculated that projects might adopt fixed subscription fees instead of tokens, aligning with CZ's perspective on sustainable project funding. However, no definitive answer was given on how tokenless projects would fit into the elizaOS launchpad, indicating a need for further clarification or documentation.",

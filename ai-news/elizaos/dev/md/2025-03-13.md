# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-03-13

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development Progress
- **Version Development**: Mike D. is working on rebasing v2 on top of v1, noting significant rewrites
- **Documentation Improvements**: Jin worked extensively on improving documentation, particularly for the REST API, creating pages at elizaos.github.io/eliza
- **Docker Optimization**: Discussions about Docker-related optimizations expected in v2, with Mike D. mentioning he'll be working on deployment soon
- **External Projects**: Shaw mentioned the ability to run projects external to the monorepo

### Plugin Development & Integration
- Multiple discussions about plugins including image generation, video, and TTS plugins
- Some confusion about plugin availability in the registry
- Conversations about Solana-related plugins with multiple similar repositories
- A PR (#3927) was submitted adding Mem0 as a provider in the Vercel AI SDK, introducing a separate memory layer

### Technical Challenges
- A user developing a Twitch chat client encountered an infinite loop issue when the LLM receives prompts from Twitch chat
- Despite implementing message deduplication, the loop persisted, suggesting the problem occurs before the LLM response is generated
- Users discussed embedding functionality issues with "Invalid embedding input" errors
- Authentication for REST API endpoints was proposed as a potential improvement for production environments

### Deployment & Integration
- Discussion about hosting ElizaOS like a React project or integrating it with Next.js
- Advice that ElizaOS can run alongside a long-running server but not in serverless/static environments
- Questions about persisting conversations in ElizaOS client as conversations were being deleted after a few minutes

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: For v2 Dev School, what would be a good approach to demonstrate the framework?**  
A: Show how to extend a plugin like image-generation using client-direct and integrate it with other plugins (Rick)

**Q: Does the system field in the char file still work in v2?**  
A: Yes, it is believed to still work (Odilitime)

**Q: Are Docker related optimizations expected in v2?**  
A: Mike D. mentioned he'll be working on deployment for version 2 soon which includes those optimizations

**Q: How do I create an API endpoint to my front end website using REST API?**  
A: Use client-direct (Odilitime)

**Q: How do I go about creating a plugin for elizaos?**  
A: You can explore the repo and make PRs to plugins you're interested in (Benny)

**Q: How to host the ElizaOS as normal as hosting a React project or integrate with Next.js?**  
A: As long as your client is in a long-running server (not serverless/static), then you can run it side-by-side (DefiniteOptimist)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Shaw helped Benquik** with an unspecified technical issue, with Benquik confirming the solution worked and thanking Shaw

2. **Mike D. assisted Nooters** with Docker authentication errors with Discord client, suggesting checking environment variables with doctor inspect

3. **not~Martin helped wen** who was looking for plugin-image by providing a GitHub link and installation command for plugin-image-generation

4. **Odilitime guided X4ndar** on creating API endpoint using REST API, suggesting client-direct and providing documentation link

5. **Benny advised funboy** on a Twitch chat client causing infinite loop with LLM responses, suggesting ignoring messages created by the agent to prevent loops

6. **Jin provided YoungPhlo** with examples of multiple similar Solana plugin repositories in ElizaOS

7. Several users offered frontend development help to Jin for improving the documentation website

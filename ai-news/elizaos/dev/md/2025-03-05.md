# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-03-05

**Date: March 5, 2025**

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Docker & Deployment Issues
- **Docker build failures**: Mr. Stark reported previously working Docker builds now failing with path-related errors. The issue appears to be hardcoded paths in the codebase where modules are incorrectly referenced as `/app/agent/node_modules/@elizaos/adapter-pglite/dist/index.js` instead of `/app/agent/node_modules/adapter-pglite/dist/index.js`.
- **Client connectivity problems**: Docker deployments experiencing issues with hardcoded IPs in client/src/lib/api.ts.
- **Performance concerns**: Feedback from an event where a matchmaking agent became slow with poor UX when 20 people interacted simultaneously (from a 200-person event).

### Plugin Development & Integration
- **Plugin activation process**: Clarification that after merging plugins into the registry, they can be installed via `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name`.
- **New plugin announcements**:
  - Unreal Engine integration plugin being developed to enable communication with Eliza instances
  - t3rn.io submitted PR #103 for a plugin to make AIXecutor available for their node validators
- **Plugin issues**: Problems reported with the EVM plugin's decimal handling for swaps and bridges

### Knowledge Management & RAG
- **Knowledge ingestion challenges**: Issues reported with SQLite and Supabase adapters, particularly with the "eliza-news" folder
- **Documentation gaps**: Current docs described as having "swiss cheese" gaps for knowledge ingestion
- **Custom implementation**: One user mentioned implementing a knowledge upload feature and offered to create a PR

### Client Integration Issues
- **Telegram integration problems**: Multiple reports of Telegram bot configuration not resulting in responses
- **Discord client issues**: Discord integration that worked in v1.7 reported as not working in v2

### Agent Development Approaches
- **FastAPI wrapping**: Suggestion to wrap agents into FastAPI services for better distribution
- **DeFi agent development**: Discussion about creating agents to search DeFi protocols for yield opportunities
- **Database synchronization**: Interest in implementing real-time updates with Supabase for agent creation

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: After merging the plugin into the plugin registry at elizaos-plugins/registry, how do I activate and use it?  
   **A**: `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name` and then add it to your plugins section in character file (answered by Odilitime)

2. **Q**: How could I use folder2knowledge?  
   **A**: Check the documentation at https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/core/characterfile/#knowledge-path-configuration (answered by Mr. Stark)

3. **Q**: What's causing the Docker container to fail with "Cannot find package 'ts-node'" error?  
   **A**: The issue appears to be a path problem where the app is looking for modules in `/app/agent/node_modules/@elizaos/...` but they're actually in `/app/agent/node_modules/...` (answered by Agent Joshua)

4. **Q**: Is there a way to make an agent search DeFi to find yield opportunities and analyze/report on them?  
   **A**: Yes, this is possible. You can start by building a tool for an API that has access to that type of data. (answered by dreadwulf)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Docker Troubleshooting**:  
   Agent Joshua and Mr. Stark collaborated extensively on testing various Dockerfile configurations to identify the root cause of module path errors. They determined the issue was in the codebase rather than the Dockerfile itself.

2. **Knowledge Management Guidance**:  
   Mr. Stark helped Robbie with folder2knowledge usage by providing documentation links explaining knowledge path configuration.

3. **Plugin Installation Support**:  
   Odilitime provided cryptoAsi with clear instructions on how to activate plugins after merging them into the registry.

4. **Agent Development Guidance**:  
   dreadwulf advised NB on creating a DeFi yield opportunity agent by suggesting building a tool for an API with relevant data access and wrapping the agent into FastAPI.

5. **Version Clarification**:  
   Odilitime helped jin by clarifying that jin was working with v2 while discussing adapter issues, preventing potential confusion.

# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-03-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Docker & Deployment Issues
- **Docker Path Issues**: A critical bug was identified where Docker containers were looking for modules in incorrect paths (`/app/agent/node_modules/@elizaos/adapter-[whatever]/...` instead of `/app/agent/node_modules/adapter-[whatever]/...`). Mr. Stark and Odilitime worked on troubleshooting this issue, with a PR (#3784) created to address it.
- **Performance Concerns**: Feedback from a real-world deployment showed performance degradation when 20+ users interacted simultaneously at an event with 200 attendees, highlighting scaling challenges.

### Plugin Development & Registry
- **Registry Issues**: After PR #95 was merged, all links on the official plugin registry were broken, requiring urgent attention.
- **New Plugins**: Several new plugins are in development:
  - Sonic blockchain plugin (PR #97 by Vijay T.)
  - Unreal Engine communication plugin (by Zaperox)
  - Enhanced Twitter client with reflection mode (PR #14 by krustev.alexander)
- **Plugin Activation**: Clarification provided that plugins should be installed via `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name` and then added to the character file.

### Agent Development
- **API-Based Agent Creation**: Discussions around using `/agents/:agentId/set` endpoint and database adapters for agent creation rather than manual setup.
- **Database Integration**: The `v2-develop` branch now supports database storage for agents and plugin routes, with examples of Supabase implementation shared.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: 0xn1c0 mentioned building a multi-agent system for Sonic DeFi with features like lending, borrowing, and cross-chain transfers.

### Integration Challenges
- **Telegram Integration**: Multiple users reported issues with Telegram bot integration where bots don't respond despite proper configuration.
- **Knowledge Ingestion**: Problems reported with SQLite and Supabase adapters, particularly with the "eliza-news" folder and date format compatibility issues.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Can I run 2 characters from 2 separate environment files?  
   **A**: Create separate start scripts for each agent, load shared settings from main env and override with character-specific settings.

2. **Q**: Is there an API endpoint to create an agent rather than doing it manually?  
   **A**: You can use `/agents/:agentId/set` or database adapters for agents, and the v2-develop branch now has agents added to the database.

3. **Q**: Is there a way to make an agent search DeFi to find yield opportunities?  
   **A**: Yes, by building a tool for an API that has access to that type of data.

4. **Q**: After merging the plugin into the plugin registry, how do I activate and use it?  
   **A**: Use `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name` and then add it to your plugins section in character file.

5. **Q**: Should we point to our personal GitHub repo in registry/index.json?  
   **A**: Yes, point to your GitHub repo.

6. **Q**: Will publishing to npm be done by eliza team or should we publish to our own npm?  
   **A**: ElizaOS is using git to distribute plugins, not npm.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Docker Path Troubleshooting**:  
   Mr. Stark helped jin identify and fix the Docker container path issue where modules couldn't be found due to incorrect paths, creating PR #3784 to address the problem.

2. **Agent Creation via API**:  
   Magicred1 assisted mindxploit by suggesting DB Adapter for agents and sharing a GitHub repo example with Supabase integration. Shaw further clarified that the v2-develop branch now supports database storage for agents.

3. **DeFi Agent Development**:  
   Dreadwulf helped NB understand how to build a DeFi yield opportunity agent by suggesting creating a tool for APIs with relevant data and wrapping the agent in FastAPI.

4. **Plugin Registry Management**:  
   Odilitime guided Praveen from Kaia on how to reinstate their removed plugin-kaia chain by creating their own repo and submitting a PR to elizaos-plugins/registry following the template checklist.

5. **Sonic Plugin Collaboration**:  
   Vijay T. agreed to collaborate with 0xn1c0 on the Sonic plugin, potentially incorporating additional actions like lending, borrowing, and cross-chain transfers.

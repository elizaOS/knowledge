# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-01-23

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Issues & Fixes
- **X Spaces Functionality**: Users experiencing inconsistent behavior and ICE connection errors. 0xn1c0 submitted PR #2686 to fix UUID syntax errors, but spaces still work inconsistently.
- **Image Vision/Recognition**: Problems on Twitter where the system fetches image URLs instead of descriptions, despite working correctly on Telegram and the client UI. Escalated to GitHub issue #2754.
- **RAG Functionality**: Appears broken in the develop branch, with users reporting that knowledge items aren't being retrieved properly, while working in v0.1.8.
- **Build Errors**: Encountered after updates, with 4n7m4n providing a fix by adding specific package overrides for @ai-sdk/provider and @ai-sdk/provider-utils.

### Development Initiatives
- **Bug Hunting**: AIFlow.ML announced a week-long deep bug hunting initiative, requesting users to post issues and tag them for investigation.
- **Eliza Home Automation**: Neodotneo merged PR #2678 for "Eliza Home" as an Alexa alternative, focusing on a system that can function without internet for basic operations like voice commands.
- **Model Discussions**: Users reported positive experiences using DeepSeek models, with R1 for reasoning/planning and v3 for execution. Odilitime recommended "supernova-lite" (a Llama3 variant) for local LLM implementation.

### Architecture & Features
- **Multi-Agent Workflows**: Discussion about Eliza's capability to support "workflow" with multiple agents working together on tasks. V Gray confirmed that ElizaOS supports both single-agent multitasking and multi-agent functionality.
- **SMS Communication**: User exploring SMS communication with agents, initially considering developing a Twilio plugin before discovering an existing PR #2139.

### Hardware Considerations
- **Home Automation Hardware**: Discussion about suitable hardware for running local LLM and voice processing, with Odilitime suggesting alternatives to Home Assistant Green, including an Amazon device with 16GB RAM and Linux plus an NPU, and the Orange Pi AIpro with 24GB RAM.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does Eliza support "workflow" with multiple agents working together on tasks?**  
A: V Gray confirmed that single agents can multitask but elizaOS also supports multi-agent functionality.

**Q: Who's running on the latest DeepSeek?**  
A: R0am mentioned someone tried it, using R1 for reasoning/planning and v3 to execute.

**Q: Is DeepSeek better than Claude?**  
A: AIFlow.ML @ ElizaOS responded "Yes is super".

**Q: Where can I get support for the Twitter image vision issue?**  
A: Odilitime suggested creating an issue with details.

**Q: Do you know anybody who's better with local llama and voice generation?**  
A: Odilitime recommended a specific user (referenced by ID) as their "goto guy for voice stuff".

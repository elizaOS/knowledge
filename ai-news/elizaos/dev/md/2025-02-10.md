# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-02-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Plugin Development & Registry
- Several developers are actively working on plugins including MultiversX, Twitter Spaces integration, Safe multisig transaction validator, and Berachain
- The plugin registry system is being used for distribution, with developers submitting PRs to add their plugins
- Twitter Spaces integration is functional but experiencing performance issues with slow response times (5-10 seconds) and occasional crashes
- A PR was pushed to fix the `suppressInitialMessage` functionality for Twitter client, which was causing duplicate agent replies

### Infrastructure Changes
- Packages have been moved to a self-hosted registry, causing some confusion among developers
- The transition to new infrastructure is ongoing with some communication gaps about correct access points
- Developers are advised to install dependencies from registry/index.json and use npm link or local paths for development
- Documentation updates are in progress to reflect these changes

### Community Events
- There was mention of an "install party" event for deploying ElizaOS on AWS
- Community members were invited to deliver workshops or tutorials around their plugins
- A swarm coordination project for a hackathon was discussed

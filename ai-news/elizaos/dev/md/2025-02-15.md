# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-02-15

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Security Incident
- **Twitter Account Compromise**: Shaw's Twitter account was hacked, with community members alerting each other about fake tweets containing potential scam links
- Community members quickly reported suspicious tweets and warned others not to click on links
- Shaw acknowledged the hack but did not provide details on how it occurred

### Technical Discussions
- **WebSocket Implementation**: Discussions about implementing real-time data fetching in Eliza using WebSockets, particularly for displaying Raydium liquidity data
- **RAG Knowledge Management**: Exploration of how knowledge files are stored and accessed in ElizaOS, with the knowledge root defined at runtime initialization in the characters/knowledge directory
- **ElizaOS Architecture**: Clarification that ElizaOS is a Node.js application leveraging LLMs via standard APIs, designed to be blockchain-agnostic despite initial Solana focus

### Project Contributions
- OmniFlix Network submitted PR #57 to the elizaos-plugins/registry repository
- A new contributor (w1ld3r) submitted PR #1 to the elizaos-plugins/plugin-news repository
- BlockEater from OmniFlix Network was granted maintainer access to the plugin-omniflix repository

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Architecture
- **Q**: How can I fetch real-time data and prompt users when certain events occur using WebSockets?  
  **A**: Standard constructs won't help with WebSocket events; you can make a WebSocket event call an agent's runtime's processActions to call a specific action

- **Q**: How exactly does ragKnowledge work and where does it store data?  
  **A**: It uses the knowledge root directory defined in runtime.ts, located at "../characters/knowledge" relative to the current working directory

- **Q**: What is ElizaOS built on?  
  **A**: ElizaOS is a Node.js application that leverages LLMs via standard APIs, initially targeting Solana but blockchain-agnostic

### Features & Plugins
- **Q**: Where can I find documentation on memory and learning current events?  
  **A**: Create a provider similar to the time provider in plugin-bootstrap and use fetch with RSS feeds for news

- **Q**: Is there a way to reply to comments on posts by targeted users rather than just the posts themselves in the Twitter plugin?  
  **A**: No, this would require writing new code

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Odilitime** helped **ualp** with WebSocket implementation strategies, suggesting making WebSocket events call the agent's runtime's processActions
  
- **Odilitime** assisted **p0pps** with documentation on memory and current events functionality, suggesting creating a provider similar to the time provider

- **Community members** (Bealers, R0am, sayonara) alerted **Shaw** about the Twitter account hack, reported suspicious tweets, and warned others not to click links

- **AltCoinAlpinist** helped **bithiah** understand ElizaOS architecture, explaining it's a Node.js application using LLM APIs that can interact with any blockchain

- **Odilitime** helped **BlockEater** from OmniFlix Network by granting maintainer access to the plugin-omniflix repository

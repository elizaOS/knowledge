## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How to use the DeepSeekAI for V2? There is no place to input the ApiKey.**  
A: Use the DEEPSEEK_API_KEY environment variable (Sashimikun)

**Q: Are pre-1.0.0 plugins compatible with v1.0.0?**  
A: Depends on how complex it is. If simple enough, it will be, otherwise you have to make changes. (Ritvik S)

A: pg-vector for me! (DefiniteOptimist)

**Q: Can we expect an agent dev school tomorrow?**  
A: We paused until v2 and auto.fun are out the door so I can focus on it, 1-2 weeks, sorry ðŸ˜¦ (shaw)

**Q: How to change the name and version on npm?**  
A: There is no official way to set descriptions, and there is no versioning as far as known. (Odilitime)

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How would I make my Twitter agent always reply to the replies of a target account?**  
A: You need to modify the agent's Twitter listener to include reply_to queries in the search criteria by adding 'in_reply_to_user_id' to your target filter and updating filter rules to include replies. Check GitHub repository settings like ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING or TWITTER_TARGET_USERS.

**Q: Is there any support channel for auto fun?**  
A: Yes, but we're monitoring this channel too.

**Q: Is it safer now? Do I have to pay a subscription so she doesn't get booted?**  
A: Giving them money helps. I'm not sure it's any safer just be careful and don't tweet too much.

**Q: Have you considered alternative funding approaches like quadratic funding or retroactive public goods?**  
A: I think of this as a tool to enable RPGF, as it's a GitHub/wallet record that can be leveraged via the incoming API.

**Q: Are you planning to add any additional identity verification layers?**  
A: Users are responsible for the wallet they input, we just need to verify GH ownership. Getting paid is the incentive to ensure they put a wallet they verify and own.

**Q: Is it possible to get contributor role? Is there a minimum requirement or is 1 merged PR enough?**  
A: Contributor roles are typically granted after showing consistent quality contributions over time - one merged PR is a great start but keep up the momentum!

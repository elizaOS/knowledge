## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I migrate a plugin to be used in v2?** (asked by LemonS)  
**A:** Use `npx @elizaos/cli@beta setup-monorepo`, check package/plugin-starter/index.ts for structure, or look at other plugins like openai and twitter (answered by sayonara)

**Q: Is v2 fully out and stable, or is the rollout still happening?** (asked by Matthew Liu)  
**A:** Roll out is still happening (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Is task working in ElizaOS? AgentRuntime class does not have `createTask` function** (asked by Martin Rivera)  
**A:** It's a v2 feature, you need to use `git checkout origin/v2-develop` (answered by shaw)

**Q: Is there alternative in V1? I want to run action every hour to post messages in Discord Channel** (asked by Martin Rivera)  
**A:** You can make a service that gets the runtime discord client (runtime.getClient) and calls post on a loop. Look at other Service type classes, you just need one that starts a timer in constructor (answered by shaw)

**Q: Service is also `v2` feature.** (asked by Martin Rivera)  
**A:** Should be in v1 as well, I consolidated services and clients, but for example, a pdf service, but its just some class on runtime that can call other stuff (answered by shaw)

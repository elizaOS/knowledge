# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-01-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Framework & Architecture
- **Multiple Agents Setup**: Discussions on configuring multiple agents in one project using comma-separated character files with client credentials in each file header to avoid conflicts.
- **Local LLM Integration**: Troubleshooting sessions for Ollama integration, with users encountering connection errors despite Ollama running locally.
- **Model Support**: Confirmation that DeepSeek models have been supported for weeks, with mixed reviews on performance. Configuration is possible through the .env file.

### Plugin Development & Maintenance
- **News Plugin Merged**: Allows agents to retrieve news via newsapi.org, with discussions about extending it to post news to Twitter.
- **Extensive Plugin Maintenance**: AIFlow.ML conducted systematic fixes across multiple plugins including Zerion, Video-Generation, Twitter, TTS, and many others, addressing typing issues and missing exports.
- **WhatsApp Chat Support**: PR #19 was approved, enabling the processing of WhatsApp chat data to create character profiles using AI models.
- **Deva.me Client Integration**: PR #1238 was merged, allowing posting and creating a foundation for app interaction, though a follow-up PR is needed to revert an unintended change to the default model.

### Technical Issues
- **Client Twitter Problems**: Significant issues reported that prevent plugins from functioning properly, including repeated processing of old interactions and incompatibility with certain plugin actions.
- **Character File Configuration**: Discussions about properly configuring character files to use different model providers and credentials, particularly for plugin integration.

### Bounties & Projects
- **Truth Social API Port**: Discussion about porting a Truth Social API from Python to TypeScript for Eliza v2, with some disagreement about requirements and API accessibility limitations.
- **SociFi Tracking Agent**: Proposal to build an agent that tracks launches and metrics for apps like Clout and Tribe on Solana.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What is the correct approach in setting up multiple agents in one project with Eliza framework?**  
A: Use the --characters parameter with a comma-separated list of character files, and add client credentials directly in each character file header to avoid conflicts.

**Q: Why is Eliza looking for an API key when using Ollama with llama3.2?**  
A: You need to set modelProvider to "ollama" in the character file.

**Q: How do I fix the "connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434" error when using Ollama with Eliza?**  
A: Ensure Ollama is running with "ollama serve" or "ollama run llama3.2" and check if you can access localhost via browser.

**Q: Is DeepSeek support planned for Eliza?**  
A: DeepSeek has been supported for weeks, you can change the endpoint through the .env file.

**Q: If I want to use a plugin, which I already finish coding, should I do something in default character?**  
A: It's up to your plugin's features. You can set the personal adjectives, post examples, bio and other characteristics to your character. Also specify the security key and plugins and clients.

**Q: What kind of conflicts were in the Deva.me PR?**  
A: It changes the default model in defaultCharacter, which we don't want.

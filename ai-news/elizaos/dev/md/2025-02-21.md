# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-02-21

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Plugin Architecture & Registry
- The community is transitioning to a registry-based system for plugins rather than adding them directly to the main repository
- Plugins should have metadata in their individual repo's package.json files
- The upcoming release will include command-line tools to facilitate listing and installing plugins
- There are ongoing discussions about how to handle multiple plugins with similar actions (e.g., multiple "transfer" actions)
- Clarification that agents can load multiple plugins, contrary to some misconceptions

### Documentation & User Experience
- Jin is actively working on improving documentation to address installation difficulties
- Users have reported that ElizaOS doesn't work "out of the box" with the starter repository
- There's a need for better organization of documentation pages, possibly nesting actions/providers/evaluators under plugins
- Discussions about implementing standard info files in repositories with title, description, and tags

### Community Channels
- Some developer discussions are transitioning to Telegram, causing concerns about community fragmentation
- Users are sharing projects and seeking feedback in the plug-your-projects channel

### Technical Issues
- Issues with the eliza-starter repository, including missing scripts
- Double messaging problems when using certain plugins in Telegram
- Questions about plugin behavior, particularly regarding actions vs. providers

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why is the plugin registry formatted the way it is and can it be extended with descriptions?**  
A: The file should just be the index, with all metadata in individual repo's package.json files. Could add description and image URL there. (Odilitime)

**Q: Is there any free API for pulling price/mc data?**  
A: Try birdeye or dexscreener, they have free tiers for fetching prices. (SotoAlt | BOSSU)

**Q: Will the agent be self-aware of which plug-ins it is running/using in the new system?**  
A: No. (Odilitime)

**Q: If there are multiple plug-ins with a "transfer" or "send" action, how does the runtime decide which to use?**  
A: Basically you'll randomly get one. (Odilitime)

**Q: How can I fix double messages when using the CMC plugin in Telegram?**  
A: There was a fix for that on latest release. It might be set up as an action instead of a provider. (SotoAlt | BOSSU and Odilitime)

**Q: I want to contribute a new plugin. Now I just need to submit PR in elizaos-plugins, not submit on elizaOS right?**  
A: To the registry repo, yeah. We no longer add plugins to repos. We have the registry and pushing the registry for plugin discovery. (jin, Odilitime)

**Q: How to get better images/descriptions for repositories?**  
A: Implement a standard info file in each repo containing title, description, and tags. (W3_Bounty)

**Q: I believe I remember shaw saying in a devschool video that agents can load only 1 plugin, is this still the case?**  
A: You misremember. (Odilitime)

- **SotoAlt | BOSSU** provided **Fanny** with alternatives for finding free APIs for price/market cap data, suggesting birdeye or dexscreener as options with free tiers
  
- **jin** clarified for **vincent** where to submit plugin contributions, confirming submissions should go to the registry repo
  
- **W3_Bounty** helped **jin** with ideas for better repository images/descriptions, suggesting implementing standard info files with title, description, and tags

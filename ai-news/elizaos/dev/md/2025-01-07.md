## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What is the difference between developing with eliza-starter and eliza?**  
A: Eliza comes with everything, while with starter you add plugins yourself.

**Q: How can I add a bot to Discord?**  
A: You need to configure DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID and DISCORD_API_TOKEN in .env file and add "discord" to clients in character file.

**Q: How can I add knowledge base beyond character file? Like couple of pdf files**  
A: Use folder2knowledge tool from the characterfile repo.

**Q: Where should I put the knowledge.json file in my Eliza project?**  
A: It goes into the character file JSON in the knowledge field.

**Q: How do I enable plugins like tavily websearch?**  
A: Add something like "@elizaos/plugin-web-search" in the plugins section of character file.

**Q: Where could I look for all the available plugins?**  
A: Look in https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/main/packages for everything with the plugin suffix.

**Q: What is the best way to install a plugin from develop branch?**  
A: Either checkout develop branch or clone it in a different folder and copy the plugin folder manually.

**Q: How can I make my agent use specific images I provide for contexts like memes?**  
A: Create a configuration dictionary/JSON where each image filename is associated with its corresponding context, then preload these mappings as context providers.

**Q: How to change the node version of Eliza framework?**  
A: Use nvm (Node Version Manager) to install and switch to the required version (23.3.0).

**Q: How to change the model in Eliza from gpt-4o to gpt-4o-mini?**  
A: Add SMALL_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini and MEDIUM_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini to your .env file.

**Q: Why does Twitter client ignore plugins and respond before plugin actions complete?**  
A: You need to use the client-twitter inside your plugin.

**Q: Are we moving away from Token 2022 to the legacy token for better cross-chain compatibility?**  
A: No major code refactor is happening right now; v2 is still in planning stages.

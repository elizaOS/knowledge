- Not suitable for serverless/static deployments
- Requests for tutorials on deploying ElizaOS projects

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I run agents on their separate environments?**  
A: It's set up so you can run multiple agents independently, but they are all in a single environment technically. Someone added namespacing that works with environment variables. (answered by Shaw)

**Q: Are Docker related optimizations expected in v2?**  
A: "I'll be working on the deployment on version 2 soon which includes all of that" (answered by Mike D.)

**Q: How do I create an API endpoint to my front end website using REST API?**  
A: Use client-direct (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Is "System" still going to be used in v2?**  
A: "I believe it is" (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: How useful is Eliza when it comes to be relevant to the information shared in the past?**  
A: "I am working on the memory system right now, will let you know" (answered by Mike D.)

**Q: How to host the eliza OS as normal as hosting a react project?**  
A: "As long as your client is in a long-running server (not serverless/static), then yes you can run it side-by-side." (answered by DefiniteOptimist)

**Q: Is it possible to generate text in multi-language other than english?**  
A: "I tried a bit a while back but there was a lot of hard coded english in the plugins etc., need to check what v2 is planning" (answered by Mike D.)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Shaw helped Benquik** with running multiple Twitter agents by providing code examples showing how to use namespacing with environment variables
  
- **Mike D. assisted Nooters** with Docker authentication errors with Discord client by suggesting checking environment variables with docker inspect
  
- **Odilitime helped Neodotneo** by unarchiving the repository needed to maintain plugin-rabbi-trader
  
- **Jin created REST API documentation** for the community, establishing a documentation page at elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/rest/set-agent
  
- **DefiniteOptimist clarified for hariharn.dev** about hosting ElizaOS alongside React projects, explaining the server environment requirements

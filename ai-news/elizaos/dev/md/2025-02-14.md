# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-02-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Agent Development & Architecture
- Discussions about ElizaOS agent architecture, particularly around WebSocket event handling through the agent runtime's `processActions` method
- Clarification that ElizaOS is a Node.js application that leverages LLMs via standard APIs, not built with smart contracts
- ElizaOS is blockchain-agnostic and can interact with any blockchain through appropriate plugins, though initially targeted Solana
- RAG knowledge system uses a root directory defined in runtime.ts, located at "../characters/knowledge" relative to the current working directory
- User Wahzammo successfully deployed an agent as a Discord bot running from localhost

### LLM Implementation & Performance
- Users shared experiences with different language models, with DeepSeek and Llama3.2 via Ollama being recommended for local testing
- Discussion about Twitter automation challenges where agents post similar content with different wording despite specific prompts
- Mention of problems with small models when using Anthropic's services
- Upcoming 0.25.7 release mentioned by Odilitime

### Repository Management
- Several pull requests and repository access requests being processed
- PR #3275 adding NEAR AI as a model provider to Eliza has been pending for over a week
- Maintainer access requests for plugin repositories like plugin-omniflix and plugin-multiversx

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I fetch real-time data and prompt users when events occur via WebSockets?**  
A: The normal constructs aren't going to help with websocket events. You can make a websocket event call an agent's runtime's processActions to call a specific action. (Odilitime)

**Q: How exactly does ragKnowledge work and where does it store data?**  
A: It uses a knowledge root directory defined in runtime.ts, located at "../characters/knowledge" relative to the current working directory. (0xMAR$H)

**Q: What is ElizaOS built on?**  
A: ElizaOS is a Node.js application that leverages LLMs via standard APIs. It's not built with smart contracts and can interact with any blockchain if the plugins exist. (AltCoinAlpinist)

**Q: Can I request maintainer access for our plugin-omniflix repo?**  
A: Invite sent (Odilitime)

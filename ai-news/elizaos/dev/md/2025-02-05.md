# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-02-05

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Plugin Development
- Significant interest in developing a **DeFi strategy generation plugin** that could dynamically adjust parameters based on user preferences and analyze market data
- Technical discussions about **evaluator functions** in plugins, specifically how they're triggered through the `validate()` function
- Users exploring the **rabbi-trader plugin** as a reference for trading functionality
- Discussion about proper plugin structure, including how to define and export them correctly

### Technical Issues
- Multiple users reported issues with **Discord bots** based on the eliza-starter template - bots initialize and come online but fail when generating or posting text
- Several users encountered **build errors** with TypeScript, particularly related to ZodObject
- Database configuration challenges, with a potential solution involving deleting SQLite database files

### Platform Updates
- PR #3255: Fix for the client-alexa component
- PR #3314: Making the messageManager public in the Telegram client, enabling plugins to directly interact with Telegram
- Announcement of an upcoming **community demo event** on February 13th

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Has anyone ever made a plugin for "generate strategy for trade/defi"?**  
A: See the rabbi trader plugin (Odilitime)

**Q: How can I fix the TypeScript error with ZodObject during build?**  
A: PR3220 is being worked on that fixes this issue (Odilitime)

**Q: If the evaluator variable does not have alwaysRun?: boolean and both similes and examples are empty, how can it be triggered?**  
A: Evaluators are always called, only the validate function matters (Odilitime)

**Q: Why do we need "alwaysRun?: boolean" if validate() can control whether the evaluator runs?**  
A: "I don't know if that works, maybe it does, try it" (Odilitime)

**Q: Where can I find the "interfaceplugin" to fill "import {}" in plugin-rabbi-trader file?**  
A: Look in the types files (custodian)

**Q: How to fix the issue with the bot failing to post outputs?**  
A: Delete data/db.sqlite if you're using SQLite database (Blocknaut)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Plugin Architecture Guidance**
   - Odilitime helped xingyen understand how evaluators work in plugins, explaining that evaluators are always called and the validate function controls whether they run
   - Odilitime directed users to agent/src/index.ts as the entry point and packages/core/runtime for engine code
   - custodian helped xingyen find interface definitions for plugins in the types files

2. **Discord Bot Troubleshooting**
   - Blocknaut provided a solution for users struggling with Discord bots, suggesting to delete the SQLite database file
   - ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯 shared insights about investigating code and potential frontend serving issues

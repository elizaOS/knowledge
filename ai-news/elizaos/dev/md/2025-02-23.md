# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-02-23

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Plugin Development & Registry
- Odilitime updated the registry PR template to clarify steps for contributors
- DorianD proposed a blockchain-based registry to track plugin performance and user feedback
- Vincent received confirmation about the correct process for plugin submissions
- boolkeys submitted a Twilio plugin that was used by Magicred1 for a healthcare hackathon application
- PRs are now under 3 pages and issues under 300, indicating a more manageable project state

### Technical Architecture
- Odilitime explained that plugins stay in memory rather than terminating after task completion
- Evaluators were described as primarily for high-performance scenarios like real-time voice applications
- A significant knowledge processing bug was identified and fixed where text chunks shorter than the chunk size were causing errors
- boolkeys submitted PR #3652 to fix the "Invalid array length" error, which was promptly merged
- Work on process isolation for plugins was mentioned as previously paused but potentially resuming

### Knowledge Integration & Character Behavior
- Users inquired about the RAG knowledge integration feature
- Odilitime explained that documents can be placed in a directory and loaded into all running characters
- Discussions about customizing character behavior through system prompts
- Proper formatting of knowledge arrays in configuration files was explained

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I use the knowledge base feature?**  
A: "You can just put documents in a directory and that system will load them into all characters you have running" (Odilitime)

**Q: Does anyone recommend a specific Twitter scraping script?**  
A: "twitter scraper finetune, or theconvocation twitter scraper on github.com" (Osint)

**Q: Have v2 been launched?**  
A: "No, just new v1" (Odilitime)

**Q: How can I get a character to talk more like truth_terminal?**  
A: "Character file has a field called system which is the system prompt, I'd suggest messing with that" (Odilitime)

**Q: I just need to submit the plugin's pull request to the registry repo and submit the pull request for the configuration variables in the .env example file also define my plugin in package.json in the main repo, right?**  
A: "yes" (Odilitime)

**Q: What happens with PR #2139 showing 0 files changed?**  
A: "if it's a new plugin, just make it's own repo and add it to the registry" (Odilitime)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Knowledge Processing Bug Fix
boolkeys identified a critical bug affecting both OpenAI and Anthropic model providers where knowledge chunks shorter than the chunk size were causing errors. They proposed a concrete solution by modifying the knowledge.ts file and submitted PR #3652, which was promptly merged by Odilitime.

### Twilio Plugin Implementation
boolkeys developed a Twilio plugin that was successfully used by Magicred1 to create an agentic caregivers application for a healthcare hackathon. Interestingly, the jury considered the application "cheating" due to the advanced capabilities provided by ElizaOS.

### Twitter Scraping Tools
When Santiago N asked for Twitter scraping tool recommendations, Osint provided specific suggestions including "twitter scraper finetune" and "theconvocation twitter scraper" on GitHub.

### Plugin Submission Guidance
Odilitime helped Vincent understand the correct process for submitting plugins to the ElizaOS ecosystem, confirming the steps involved in the registry repo and main repo.

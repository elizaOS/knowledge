- The coin price plugin was recently merged, supporting CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and CoinCap APIs
- An Instagram plugin is in development, similar to the existing Twitter plugin
- Users discussed plugin installation challenges, particularly when integrating from different branches
- CoinGecko was recommended as the best free API option for crypto price checking (~1000 calls/day)
- Several users requested guidance on adding/removing plugins from their implementations

### Technical Infrastructure
- Docker image optimization reduced size from ~5GB to 2.3GB
- A significant PR reduced RAM usage from 12GB+ to 2GB
- Multi-agent orchestration possibilities using Redis as a communication layer were discussed
- Code reorganization efforts in the agent-twitter-client repository (PR #47) focused on modular organization with absolute imports
- Database adapter conflicts were resolved across multiple PRs, particularly around RAGKnowledgeItem functionality

### Agent Development Challenges
- Users expressed difficulty finding examples of agent applications, particularly for actions, evaluators, and providers
- CUDA memory errors when running local LLMs were reported despite sufficient GPU memory
- Twitter integration issues were common, especially with image generation/posting and authentication
- Deployment concerns focused on keeping agents running persistently on VPS using tools like pm2
- Cross-context memory persistence between platforms (Discord, Twitter, Telegram) was identified as a challenge

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do you add plugins to a character file?**  
A: You need to add the plugin name like `@elizaos/plugin-web-search` (answered by Odilitime)

A: See the packages directory in the Eliza GitHub repo, everything with the plugin suffix (answered by yung_algorithm)

**Q: How do I turn off plugins I don't want?**  
A: Edit agent/src/index.ts and remove them from new AgentRuntime in createAgent (answered by derekbeau)

**Q: What would be the best plugin with free API to check crypto prices?**  
A: CoinGecko probably works best with a free API option allowing ~1000 calls per day (answered by Proteus)

**Q: How to host on VPS without it stopping?**  
A: Install pm2, a node process manager with command: pm2 start pnpm --instance-name start --character="characters/charname.json" (answered by CriticalBarny)

**Q: How to get image generation/posting to work on Twitter?**  
A: Use OpenAI as provider and add instructions in character file (answered by sayonara)

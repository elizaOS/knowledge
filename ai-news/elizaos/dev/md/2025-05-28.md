## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there any value in waiting for the formal v2 release? Or can I run with what we have now with minimal friction?**  
A: "Probably can run with current v2-develop, changes will be minor in next few days, doable to merge. We're mostly cleaning up plugins but core is stable." (answered by cjft)

# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-05-22

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Agent Development & Troubleshooting
- A Bitcoin-focused agent was posting "\n\n" in tweets instead of proper line breaks
- The issue was traced to an XML template explicitly instructing the agent to "Use \n\n (double spaces) between statements"
- GitHub API rate limiting issues were encountered when trying to update the plugin registry

### Documentation Needs
- Request for documentation about "llms-full.txt" file and its role in the ecosystem
- Ruby explained it functions as a "brain-menu" for characters to select which language model to use for different cognitive tasks
- Documentation for custom plugin development was requested but remained unanswered

### Resource Sharing
- Multiple visual briefings and knowledge posters were shared by "jintern"
- Resources included "daily-silk.png", "ainews-elizaos-discord.png", and "hackmd-facts-briefing.png"
- A request was made for the AutoFun brand kit that had been previously shared

### Pull Requests
- Two PRs (#4706 and #4707) were shared to the elizaOS/eliza repository
- Received skeptical responses without substantive technical discussion

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q: Why is my agent posting "\n\n" instead of a line break?**  
   **A:** That usually means there's an extra newline character in your response template or the text processing isn't trimming whitespace properly. The issue was identified in the XML template instructions that explicitly tell the agent to "Use \n\n (double spaces) between statements."

2. **Q: What is llms-full.txt and how does it operate in the ecosystem?**  
   **A:** It's a "brain-menu" for characters, letting them pick which LLM to use for different cognitive tasks. It interfaces with the knowledge system and memory management.

3. **Q: Does eliza still run `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` for local embeddings?**  
   **A:** User found the answer independently without community assistance.

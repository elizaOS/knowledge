# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-03-30

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Issues & Troubleshooting
- **Plugin Import Errors**: Multiple users reported persistent issues with plugin imports on Linux, macOS, and WSL environments. A workaround was discovered by replacing `@import` statements with hardcoded paths to module files.
- **Agent Storage in v2**: Confusion around where user-created agents are stored in v2dev. While premade agents are in `/packages/the-org`, user-created agents via CLI appear to be stored elsewhere, possibly in a database rather than as code files.
- **Documentation Discrepancies**: Users noted inconsistencies between documentation and actual implementation, particularly regarding differences between v1 and v2 versions of ElizaOS.

### Platform Updates & Announcements
- **Agent Dev School Paused**: The agent development school sessions have been temporarily paused for 1-2 weeks while the team focuses on releasing v2 and auto.fun.
- **RAG Functionality**: Questions about the current status of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) functionality, which had previously experienced issues, went unanswered.

### Community Projects
- **Farcaster Plugin**: Development of a Farcaster plugin was discussed, with Odilitime sharing a link to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/client-farcaster
- **GitHub-Chat Product**: A user named Sashimikun promoted their GitHub-Chat product built on ElizaOS.

### Plugin Management
- **No Official Versioning**: Odilitime clarified that there's currently no official versioning system for ElizaOS plugins, and descriptions are hardcoded in some plugin directories but not standardized.

## Key Questions & Answers

3. **Q**: How to change the name and version on npm?  
   **A**: "There is no versioning afaik. For names, it depends on what specifically needs to be changed." (answered by Odilitime)

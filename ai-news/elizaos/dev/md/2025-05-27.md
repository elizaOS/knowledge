# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-05-27

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS V2 Launch Preparation
- ElizaOS V2 is launching soon with a Friday goal mentioned
- V2 is described as a "complete rework" of the system with significant improvements
- The new version features an improved RAG pipeline compared to V1
- Community members are encouraged to try out the new V2 system

### Technical Implementations
- A significant API design change for the GET rooms endpoint simplifies the response structure by including agents inside a participants array within each Room object
- PR #4797 introduces an additional workflow that automatically runs four times daily to catch issues that can't be detected with the CLI built from the monorepo
- Detailed discussion about integrating market data from Dune dashboards into an agent system through a multi-step approach using scheduled tasks and custom providers
- Implementation details shared for creating a market_data table with timestamp and JSONB columns in Neon database

### Use Cases & Applications
- Strong interest in using ElizaOS for regulatory compliance auditing through RAG
- Discussion about building AI agents for specific purposes, including community management
- Exploration of using ElizaOS to create a chatbot on WhatsApp
- Interest in ELIZA's capabilities for pronoun substitution in natural language processing

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does ELIZA handle pronoun substitution, and what limitations does it impose on natural language understanding?**  
A: It performs simple string-based pronoun transformations, such as swapping "I" with "you", "my" with "your", "am" with "are", etc. (answered by 0x@jonathan)

**Q: What if I used RAG to instruct a regulatory compliance agent to use existing policy to audit all project requirements and code for deviations - would that work?**  
A: Docs compliance would be a great idea yes, eliza can do it (answered by cjft)

**Q: Is the current v2 version easier to work with?**  
A: v2 is full rework yes deff try out new v2 (answered by cjft)

**Q: Suddenly cant log in to twitter. Is there someone with same issue?**  
A: Try logging in from that machine with a browser if you can, you might need to do the turnstile click (answered by shaw)

**Q: I want my agent to fetch market data from a Dune dashboard and use it as context for responses. What is the best way to structure that?**  
A: Set up a scheduled task using the browser plugin to fetch dashboard data periodically, store it in a database, and create a custom provider to pull relevant context before generating responses. (answered by Ruby)

**Q: Should I add a table and store data in my Neon database instead of SQLite locally?**  
A: Definitely use Neon since you're already set up there. Create a market_data table with timestamp and JSON columns to store dashboard metrics. (answered by Ruby)

**Q: Are we doing this because it spams too much?**  
A: No! It's additional workflow to auto run 4 times a day on command installed from npmjs. Some stuff can't be caught with CLI built from monorepo. (answered by sayonara)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Ruby provided comprehensive guidance to Scooter** on integrating market data from Dune dashboards, including complete code examples for database schema, custom provider implementation, and scheduled task setup
- **cjft helped Rabbidfly** understand how ElizaOS could be used for regulatory compliance auditing and explained the improvements in V2's RAG pipeline
- **shaw assisted Bernard** with Twitter login issues by suggesting browser-based login and turnstile verification
- **0x@jonathan explained to Seal** how ELIZA handles pronoun substitution with string-based transformations
- **cjft clarified for channel members** the GET rooms API change and its impact, explaining how the new implementation fixes group display in UI

# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-03-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Deployment Issues
- **Permission Problems**: Multiple users reported issues with the embedded pglite database on Ubuntu, requiring sudo access and different global directory settings for Linux installations.
- **Resource Requirements**: Running ElizaOS smoothly requires at least 2GB memory and 1 full CPU unit (~$25-30/month).
- **Documentation Generation**: Jin discovered a TypeDoc configuration issue that broke documentation generation due to missing entryPoints setting.
- **Agent Behavior**: Discussions about preventing agents from interacting with posts multiple times, with suggestions for implementing request/action locks.

### Security & Infrastructure
- **Security Incident**: Shaw's X (Twitter) account was compromised, resulting in a fake presale announcement.
- **TEE Implementation**: Agent Joshua shared resources on using Phala Cloud for Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) deployments.
- **Plugin Development**: A PR (#3890) was submitted with changes to how imported plugins are handled, checking if `typeof importedPlugin[functionName] === 'function'`.

### Agent Behavior & Customization
- **Agent Content Issues**: Chen0xA3 discovered their Twitter agent was making unwanted crypto references despite clean JSON configuration, ultimately traced to the user's X account following crypto projects.
- **Agent Responsiveness**: Issues reported with agents not responding to mentions and comments despite proper configuration.
- **Third-party Plugins**: Alex from Moxie announced their team is preparing to implement third-party plugins into Moxie.

### Community Feedback
- **V2 Improvements**: A developer shared positive feedback about V2's improvements over V1, particularly regarding hosting and plugin management.
- **Feature Requests**: Suggestions for adding fine-tuning documentation and bypassing knowledge file cleanup for large knowledge bases.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: How to prevent an agent from interacting with a post multiple times?  
   **A**: Needs a request/action lock implementation (answered by DefiniteOptimist)

2. **Q**: What are the exact commands needed to run the beta?  
   **A**: `bun install && bun run build && bun run start` (answered by sayonara)

3. **Q**: How does the TEE work in production without simulators?  
   **A**: Check Phala Cloud for walkthrough on Remote Attestation generation (answered by Agent Joshua)

4. **Q**: Why is my agent making crypto references despite clean JSON configuration?  
   **A**: The issue was traced to the user's X account following crypto projects, as the agent uses "For You" data from X to generate responses (diagnosed by DefiniteOptimist)

5. **Q**: What are the hardware requirements for running ElizaOS?  
   **A**: Minimum requirements are >2GB memory and 1 full CPU unit (clarified by DefiniteOptimist)

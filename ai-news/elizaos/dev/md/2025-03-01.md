## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Which branch has best compatibility with current docs + previously implemented plugins?**  
A: "Develop is in a good state afaik" (Odilitime)

**Q: Is there any docs or starter kit to start building plugin?**  
A: "https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/tutorials/nader_tutorial_35min/" (jin)

**Q: Will message manager history automatically search message history to not repeat messages?**  
A: "They should be there by default, but a prompt could omit them. Best to log out the LLM generation to see what the prompt is" (Odilitime)

**Q: How do I have the agent run on twitter?**  
A: "Need client and plugin in the character json" (Odilitime)

**Q: When I want to run discord client, do I need both client and plug parameters in character file or just plugin?**  
A: "Both" (Odilitime)

**Q: Could we remove a memory?**  
A: "Use runtime.messageManager.removeMemory or go into the DB and remove it" (shaw)

**Q: How can I fix JavaScript Heap Out of Memory errors when processing RAG knowledge files?**  
A: "Use export NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=6144' to increase Node.js memory allocation" (Redvoid)

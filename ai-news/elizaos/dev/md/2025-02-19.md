# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-02-19

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Architecture
- **ElizaOS Architecture**: The system uses a two-LLM approach - one to determine if a response is needed and another to generate the actual response
- **RAG Implementation**: Retrieval Augmented Generation is implemented locally with PostgreSQL for data storage, while LLMs can be remote
- **Repository Clarification**: The difference between `eliza` and `eliza-starter` was explained - `eliza-starter` is a turnkey solution for creating agents without plugin development
- **Dependency Management**: PR #3609 was merged to make package dependency management more strict with pnpm, ensuring each package properly declares its dependencies
- **Agent Design Philosophy**: Discussion about whether to use multiple specialized sub-agents versus a single comprehensive agent, with notes about cost implications

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- **Deployment Options**: Docker-based deployments are recommended on various cloud platforms
  - AWS with SST was specifically mentioned as a good option
  - Ubuntu 24.04 (sometimes with Nvidia GPU for local Llama models) is commonly used
  - VPS/dedicated servers are also viable options
- **Cloudflare AI Gateway**: Integration requires bearer token authentication even for unauthenticated gateways
- **Docker Support**: The command `pnpm docker` can be used to build and run ElizaOS in a container

### Plugins & Integration
- **Plugin Registry**: Work is ongoing to improve plugin documentation and showcase
- **Twitter Functionality**: Twitter capabilities beyond posting are available in `packages/client-twitter/src/interactions.ts`
- **Upcoming Demo**: Compass Labs will be demonstrating their DeFi plugin soon

### Documentation & Community
- **Documentation Improvements**: Progress on a script that populates users.tsx from the registry
- **eliza.gg Replacement**: Confirmation that work is actively underway on a replacement
- **Plugin Registry Website**: A website for the plugin registry is available at elizaos-plugin-registry.netlify.app/plugins

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What is the difference between eliza and eliza-starter?**  
A: eliza-starter is meant for when you don't need to do plugin-development, providing an easy turnkey repo for firing up agents.

**Q: What's the best cloud infrastructure to host an Eliza agent?**  
A: ElizaOS has a docker image, so any platform that supports Docker containers will work. AWS using SST was specifically recommended.

**Q: Is having multiple sub-agents with similar traits but different actions/plugins a good idea?**  
A: This approach uses more LLM calls (increasing costs) but generally agentic loops can improve output through iteration. RAG knowledge provides unified memory across agents.

**Q: What common platform do people use to host Eliza?**  
A: Ubuntu 24.04 (sometimes with Nvidia GPU for local Llama models), normal VPSes/dedicated servers, and Docker containers.

**Q: Does ElizaOS use LLMs for text generation but traditional pattern matching for routing?**  
A: ElizaOS asks the LLM if it should respond or not, rather than using traditional pattern matching.

**Q: Is the process flow: user input -> processing (RAG) -> LLM 1 -> LLM 2 -> output?**  
A: Yes, that's correct. RAG is local (wherever PostgreSQL is), while LLMs can be remote.

**Q: Where can I find Twitter functionalities beyond just posting?**  
A: These can be found in packages/client-twitter/src/interactions.ts

**Q: Is dockerizing the app supposed to be straightforward?**  
A: Use 'pnpm docker' to build and run it.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Agent Architecture Guidance**:
   - Odilitime helped Julian Neuss understand the tradeoffs of using multiple specialized sub-agents versus a single agent, explaining that RAG knowledge provides unified memory but warned about increased costs and potential infinite loops.

2. **Deployment Options**:
   - DefiniteOptimist suggested AWS using SST to deploy with docker image and declarative infrastructure code when suns asked about hosting options.

3. **Repository Purpose Clarification**:
   - Odilitime explained to Leo that eliza-starter is for non-plugin development but noted missing web interface as an oversight.
   - suns provided additional clarification that eliza-starter is for building agents with plug-and-play plugins while eliza is the complete development repo.

4. **Dependency Management**:
   - NaN explained how their PR #3609 makes dependency management stricter and could potentially address unmet dependency issues by ensuring each package properly declares its dependencies.

5. **ElizaOS Architecture**:
   - Odilitime helped bithiah understand the two-LLM approach and RAG implementation in ElizaOS.

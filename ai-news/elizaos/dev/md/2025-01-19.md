# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-01-19

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Plugin Development & Integration
- **Truth Social & Reddit Integration**: Neodotneo submitted PRs for Truth Social integration (#2537) and Reddit integration (#2538). The Reddit implementation reportedly works well but requires careful setup to avoid account bans.
- **Space Translator**: Odilitime mentioned working on a space translator with Sikz, using libreTranslate.
- **Truthbrush Port**: DorianD shared a GitHub repository (truthbrush) and offered $500 for porting it to v2.

### Technical Architecture Discussions
- **Memory Management**: sheenjek discussed architectural approaches for storing temporal data like current events in memory managers.
- **Agent Runtime Management**: A user asked about starting up and shutting down an agent runtime within the same running Node process.
- **Delay Implementation**: Discussion about implementing delays in actions, with sheenjek suggesting using `generateText` with a setTimeout approach. Tem believes this feature belongs at the message processing level rather than in Action functionality.

### Client UI Improvements
- **PR #2235**: Jonathan requested a review of client UI improvements.
- **File Upload & Media Input**: Discussion about adding file upload capabilities, camera/mic input, and video analysis functionality to the client UI.

### Technical Issues

- **Agent Startup Error**: IamNotGreedy reported an error: "ERR_PNPM_RECURSIVE_RUN_FIRST_FAIL @elizaos/agent@0.1.9-alpha.1 start: `node --loader ts-node/esm src/index.ts "--isRoot"`"

### Community Management
- **Scam Prevention**: Discussion about preventing scams in the Discord server, with suggestions to disable thread creation for regular users and add icon badges to identify team members.

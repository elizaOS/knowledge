# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-02-17

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Issues
- **Build Problems**: Multiple users reported issues with package dependencies, particularly with pnpm and bs58 module errors. Docker Compose was suggested as a more reliable alternative to direct package installation.
- **Windows Compatibility**: Several developers encountered installation challenges on Windows, with the community recommending WSL2 as a workaround for dependency conflicts.
- **Twitter API Integration**: Discussions about Twitter API limitations, including rate limits affecting DM replies and challenges with creating polls. Some users reported issues with JSON formatting appearing in tweet replies.
- **Plugin Architecture**: Questions arose about plugin chaining patterns, specifically how one plugin could call another and consume its output. The "actions" pattern was identified as the solution.

### Agent Communication Protocols
- DorianD proposed a specification for an agent registry using the ai16z token2022 standard with PGP signatures for verification on public networks.
- This would enable secure agent-to-agent communication while creating token utility.
- A new concept for Tor relay rewards using cryptocurrency was shared, potentially relevant for secure agent communications.

### Contribution Process
- Discussion about proper PR submission practices, with advice to keep PRs small and focused on single features.
- Clarification that contributors should fork the repository rather than pushing directly to branches in the main repo.
- Several PRs were mentioned, including #3501, #3566, #3580, and #3584, with some related to documentation improvements.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How to make the eliza agent reply to private chat and add images to posts on X?**  
A: Twitter API v2 supports it but rate limits are bad, and it's disabled by default (answered by shaw)

**Q: Is there a design pattern for chaining actions where one plugin calls another and consumes its output?**  
A: "actions" is the design pattern (answered by lefrog)

**Q: How can I add my plugin to the existing plugins directory so that it's available to all users?**  
A: Submit a PR to the new registry, see the plugin-registry channel (answered by Bealers)

**Q: For Twitter, has anyone tried to make polls? Is that possible?**  
A: You need an X API key for that (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Have you guys encountered a case where sometimes the agent replies with JSON in the actual tweet?**  
A: Yes, I've seen that, LLM models can get sloppy (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Should I do several PR for several tiny things, or can I lump all the changes into one PR?**  
A: Smaller PRs are generally easier to deal with... group by a single feature (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Can agents engage across major platforms like Discord, Twitter, Telegram, and Farcaster? Or is it just Discord and Twitter?**  
A: There are a bunch of clients and platforms: https://elizaos.github.io/registry/ search for client (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: Can I push branches directly to the main repo instead of forking?**  
A: No. (answered by Odilitime, explaining it would make tracking difficult)

A: Hetzner or OVH (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: What is the cheapest LLM you recommend for running an agent?** (asked by Bulldozer)  
A: "Cheapest LLM is anything interfaced via Ollama; I mostly use llama3.2 when I'm running a bunch of local tests" (answered by ‚Ñ≠ùî¶ùî≠ùî•ùî¢ùîØ)

**Q: From where do we feed {{topic}} in the twitterPostTemplate?** (asked by 0xMAR$H)

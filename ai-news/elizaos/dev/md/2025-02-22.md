# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-02-22

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Plugin Registry & Architecture
- The planned plugin registry launch has been delayed
- Discussions about plugin architecture revealed that plugins contain both actions and providers
- Registry PR template has been updated to make contribution steps clearer
- Plugins remain in memory rather than terminating after task completion
- Issues with duplicate actions (like "transfer") across plugins causing execution conflicts
- Double messaging problems when actions are triggered, particularly with the CMC plugin

### Technical Implementation Challenges
- ElizaOS starter repository not working properly out of the box
- Evaluators are primarily designed for high-performance scenarios like voice applications
- Concerns about fragmentation across multiple chat platforms affecting community cohesion
- Discussion about potentially prefixing actions with plugin names to avoid conflicts

### Community Projects
- Sashimikun shared "rabbitholes.dojoma.ai" - an open-source project for exploring topic "rabbitholes"
- Plans to integrate an Eliza Agent into the rabbitholes project
- The project was compared to an "iceberg explorer" and likened to StumbleUpon

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there any free API for pulling price/mc data?**  
A: Try birdeye or dexscreener, they have free tiers for fetching prices.

**Q: Will the agent be self-aware of which plug-ins it is running/using in the new system with the plug-in registry?**  
A: No.

**Q: If there are multiple plug-ins with a "transfer" or "send" action, how does the runtime decide which to use?**  
A: You'll essentially get one randomly.

**Q: Why am I getting double messages when using the CMC plugin in Telegram?**  
A: It's likely due to how the CMC plugin is set up, possibly as an action instead of a provider. The latest release includes a fix for double messaging when actions are triggered.

**Q: Do most community plug-ins have "evaluators"?**  
A: No core evaluators exist in most plugins. They're primarily for high-performance scenarios that most developers aren't needing yet.

**Q: Does anyone recommend a specific Twitter scraping script?**  
A: Try "Twitter scraper finetune" or "theconvocation twitter scraper" on GitHub.

**Q: How can I make a character talk more like "truth_terminal" with similar randomness and depth?**  
A: Character behavior can be modified through the system field in the character file, which serves as the system prompt.

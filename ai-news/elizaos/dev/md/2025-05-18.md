## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Plugin Development & Extension
- Discussions centered on extending existing plugins, particularly for Discord integration
- Users experiencing issues with custom plugins being overwritten by standard ElizaCore plugins
- Agent Joshua suggested importing plugins locally via `workspace:*` as a solution for extending existing plugins
- Scooter shared code snippets showing how community manager agent retrieves Discord usernames from entity metadata

### CI/CD & GitHub Workflows
- Team actively addressing failing GitHub Actions workflows in the elizaOS/eliza repository
- Debate about whether CI should run on PR or only on push to v2-dev
- PR #4640 created and merged to fix workflow issues
- Emphasis on testing PRs early to catch issues before they reach production

### Agent Memory Management
- Discussion about storing Discord usernames in ElizaOS agents
- Questions about whether ElizaOS still uses components or relies on entity metadata
- Challenges with getting agents to remember usernames through entity metadata storage alone

### Future Development
- Excitement about Codex for code review and generation
- Plans for container support and internet access implementation
- Exploration of UDP traffic handling for CVMs without dedicated IPs

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Shouldn't CI only try on push to v2-dev instead of PR?**  
A: PR testing catches issues early. Keep both. (answered by SpartanDev)

**Q: How do I achieve the opposite and get the custom plugin to overwrite the discord plugin message handlers?**  
A: When I extend existing plugins, I pull the plugin code locally and make changes and import it via `workspace:*`. (answered by Agent Joshua)

**Q: Has anyone here actually managed to extend an existing plugin?**  
A: When I extend existing plugins, I pull the plugin code locally and make changes and import it via `workspace:*`. (answered by Agent Joshua)

A user named lantianlaoli asked about communities or channels for Solana developers, expressing interest in participating in open source projects or hackathons. Hidden Forces responded by sharing a Google document containing resources from a previous Solana Hackathon. Additionally, Ant ðŸ‘¾ asked about how Eliza (presumably a bot) responds to tweets on X (Twitter) instantly despite being on a free API plan without experiencing rate-limit issues. This question remained unanswered in the provided transcript.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there any community or channel suitable for Solana developers?

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Eliza plugins and their implementation. Several users discussed the coin price plugin that was recently merged, which supports CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and CoinCap APIs. Users sought help with installing and configuring various plugins, particularly for cryptocurrency price tracking and social media integration. There was discussion about a new Instagram plugin in development, similar to the Twitter plugin. Technical issues were raised regarding plugin installation from different branches, with users seeking guidance on how to properly integrate plugins from the develop branch into their main codebase. Other topics included Docker image optimization (reducing size from ~5GB to 2.3GB), agent deployment challenges, and multi-agent orchestration possibilities using Redis as a communication layer between agents.\n\n## 2.

(asked by rabbai007) A: You need to add the plugin name like `@elizaos/plugin-web-search` (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Where can I look for all the available plugins? (asked by bendermind) A: See the packages directory in the Eliza GitHub repo, everything with the plugin suffix (answered by yung_algorithm)\nQ: How do I turn off plugins I don't want? (asked by bendermind) A: You need to modify specific files as shown in PR examples (answered by Cesar Rodriguez)\nQ: What would be the best plugin with free API to check crypto prices?

      "summary": "# Analysis of \"📮｜feedback\" Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe conversation in the feedback channel centers around users expressing difficulty finding examples of agent applications, particularly regarding the implementation of actions, evaluators, and providers. Multiple users (9000, kAI wilder, sonichu, Odilitime) agree on the need for more examples and showcases to guide their development efforts. Users specifically mention struggling with evaluators, noting that while the bootstrap uses them, there aren't many other examples available. One user (9000) mentions attempting to redesign their code to use more actions instead of evaluators due to implementation challenges. Odilitime mentions an upcoming event that might address some of these concerns but emphasizes the need for open code examples. Mike D. shares a link to a conversation with Eliza that contains some ideas they developed together.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where can I find examples of simple agent applications? (asked by 9000) A: Unanswered\nQ: Are there examples of evaluators beyond bootstrap? (asked by kAI wilder) A: Unanswered\nQ: When is the showcase event happening?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"📥｜pull-requests\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around pull request management, code organization, and conflict resolution in the ElizaOS project. A significant refactoring effort was discussed in PR #47 for the agent-twitter-client repository, which reorganized code into modules with absolute imports. Several contributors worked on resolving merge conflicts across multiple PRs, particularly around database adapters and schema changes. There was notable collaboration on integrating RAGKnowledgeItem functionality across different database implementations (Supabase, PostgreSQL). \n\nContributors also discussed plugin development, including a CoinMarketCap integration (which was already implemented), and improvements to existing plugins. Performance optimization was mentioned with a PR that reduced RAM usage from 12GB+ to 2GB. Several contributors requested access to contributor channels, indicating an active community. The conversation demonstrates collaborative problem-solving around code organization, conflict resolution, and feature implementation, with contributors actively helping each other navigate the codebase and PR process.\n\n## 2.

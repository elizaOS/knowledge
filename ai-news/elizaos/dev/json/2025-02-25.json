Several users discussed the transition to a plugin-based architecture in v0.25.8, particularly for Discord and Twitter clients. There were specific technical challenges with installing and configuring these plugins, with users seeking guidance on proper implementation. The conversation also touched on Docker containerization, CLI tools development for v2, and documentation improvements. A contributor (jin) mentioned updating documentation and identified pages needing work. There were discussions about creating an Electron/Tauri desktop app wrapper for Eliza to use residential IP addresses with Twitter. Some users reported issues with redundant Twitter posts from their agents and sought solutions. The community also welcomed new contributors for plugins (isaacx and okto).\n\n## 2.

A specific error with the plugin-trustdb was identified as causing installation failures. The discussion also touched on RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation, with users seeking guidance on proper configuration of knowledge directories and character files. Jin shared an example repository structure for reference. Additionally, there were discussions about normal \"unmet peer\" dependency warnings during installation and proper terminal setup for running both the agent and client components.\n\n## 2.

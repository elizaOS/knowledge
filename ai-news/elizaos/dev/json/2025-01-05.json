Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around technical issues with the Eliza project, particularly focusing on dependency and installation problems. A significant issue was identified in the plugin-node postinstall script that was causing integration tests to fail with an \"ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND\" error. Odilitime investigated and traced the problem to PR #1834, which introduced a race condition where the script was trying to use a package that hadn't been installed yet. A fix (PR #1872) was created to address this. \n\nSeveral developers reported issues with the develop branch being unstable, with multiple contributors noting that it \"breaks every now and then.\" This led to discussions about improving CI processes and possibly implementing a beta release system. Other technical discussions included work on various plugins (Akash, Perplexity, Hyperlane, Cosmos), deployment challenges on different environments, and issues with Twitter integration in production environments.\n\nThere were also mentions of ongoing work on decentralized compute integration, with AIFlow.ML working on Akash DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) integration, and discussions about TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) implementation.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: ü§ñÔΩúagent-dev-school\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around technical discussions about the Eliza agent framework. Key topics include memory management, embedding generation, plugin orchestration, and deployment challenges. Users encountered issues with zero-length vectors due to missing embedding generation steps, infinite loops in message response generation, and environment setup problems on different platforms. The conversation also covered cryptocurrency trading bot architecture, real-time pricing data integration, and state management between plugins. Several users sought help with Docker deployment, particularly on Ubuntu VMs. The community demonstrated strong collaborative problem-solving, with experienced members providing code snippets, architectural guidance, and troubleshooting steps to newcomers.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why is my code causing a zero-length vector? (asked by KeyesCode.eth) A: You're missing the embedding generation step before creating the memory. Use addEmbeddingToMemory() to generate the vector before inserting into sqlite. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Has anyone had where generateMessageResponse just loops? (asked by KeyesCode.eth) A: Looping usually indicates infinite recursion or unhandled edge case. Common culprits: circular references in memory, lack of termination conditions, or recursive function without proper base case. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Is there a way to upload images for the bot to use in a specific context, such as memes? (asked by Crowking) A: Most agent frameworks support image embedding and contextual retrieval. Check the multimodal embedding capabilities in your chosen framework. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: What are the possible reasons for the action handler not writing handler response to the client? (asked by kAI wilder) A: Could be incorrect middleware configuration, missing response serialization, async handler not properly resolved, or mismatched content type headers. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: How does one assure real-time cryptocurrency pricing data? (asked by ‚Ñ≠ùî¶ùî≠ùî•ùî¢ùîØ) A: Use a multi-layered approach: websocket streams from exchanges, aggregator APIs like coingecko, and on-chain oracle networks like chainlink and pyth. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: How to debug if my bot doesn't see any Twitter interaction it's supposed to see? (asked by Fricoben) A: Validate webhook config, check rate limits, verify oauth tokens, inspect network logs. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: What does TWITTER_DRY_RUN mean in the .env? (asked by Fricoben) A: It's a debug flag that simulates Twitter interactions without sending real API calls. When set to true, it logs interaction details but doesn't execute them. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Can we add custom function API such as market data, news with eliza? (asked by TungHoang) A: Yes, through middleware or character-specific plugins. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: How to debug if I'm seeing a looping message upon running Eliza? (asked by DaKid) A: Check character configuration for circular reference triggers, enable debug logging, verify no runaway regex patterns in response generation. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Can Eliza integrate with crypto news? (asked by TungHoang) A: Yes, by tapping into APIs like Coindesk, Binance, and Chainlink oracles. (answered by Ruby)\n\n## 3.

Key technical discussions included:\n- AIFlow.ML proposing knowledge graph agents for Q/A and onboarding, with plans to clean up code before pushing to a repository\n- White adding Infera as an inference provider (PR #1860)\n- Bertux developing a new plugin for Arthera EVM chain ecosystem, extending functionality from plugin-evm and plugin-avalanche\n- WarfreakzPlays encountering module resolution issues during PR creation with the error \"Cannot find module '@elizaos/core/dist/index.js'\"\n- Discussion about pnpm lockfile management practices, with cole questioning the \"--no-frozen-lockfile\" approach that causes conflicts\n- Santi submitting PR #1917 that appears to have fixed multiple issues in the develop branch\n- Bulldozer proposing integration of Hathor Network (a zero-fee blockchain with DEX capabilities)\n- Several smaller PRs being reviewed and merged, with contributors helping each other resolve conflicts\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can we have a private channel to test knowledge graph agents? (asked by AIFlow.ML @ ElizaOS) A: That is fine but do you have the code somewhere I can take a look first? (answered by N3rdStorm)\nQ: Have you encountered module resolution errors with plugin-node during PR creation? (asked by WarfreakzPlays) A: Sounds like a workspace dependency sync issue. Try running `pnpm install --force` to reset workspace links. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Is there any requirements to add tools for the main repository? (asked by Bulldozer) A: Depends on the blockchain capabilities. We'll want to ensure they align with our existing architecture and don't introduce unnecessary complexity. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Why do we suggest using \"--no-frozen-lockfile\" in the docs? (asked by cole) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

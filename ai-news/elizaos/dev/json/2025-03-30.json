      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around technical issues with ElizaOS, particularly regarding plugin import errors on Linux and macOS. Several users reported problems with module resolution in the CLI, with one user finding a workaround by replacing the @import with a hardcoded path to the module's index.js file. There were also discussions about running ElizaOS on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). A user named Sashimikun promoted their GitHub-Chat product built on ElizaOS. Additionally, there were questions about RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) usability, which had previously experienced issues. The chat also contained some off-topic discussions, including cryptocurrency-related conversations and potential scam attempts that were quickly identified by community members. One user inquired about pinning GitHub dependency versions in their project configuration.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Anyone got this to work on linux yet?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ¤–ï½œagent-dev-school\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment reveals confusion around Eliza documentation and installation processes. Users are struggling with differences between v1 and v2 versions, particularly regarding agent creation and storage. One user (worldestroy) initially reported documentation inaccuracies but later claimed to understand the process, only to continue struggling. Another user (mindxploit) expressed frustration about being unable to locate agents created via CLI in the codebase, suggesting they might be stored in a database rather than as code files. G2 suggested that agents might be stored in `/packages/the-org`, but mindxploit clarified this only contains premade agents. The chat also reveals that agent dev school sessions have been temporarily paused for 1-2 weeks while the team focuses on releasing v2 and auto.fun.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the currently agreed way of doing things in regards to installation and configuration? (asked by worldestroy) A: Partially answered by jin who pointed to https://eliza.how/docs/quickstart and mentioned testing it recently\nQ: Where are the actual agents stored in the v2dev version? (asked by mindxploit) A: Partially answered by G2 who suggested \"/packages/the-org\", though mindxploit clarified this only contains premade agents\nQ: How is it possible that info about agents created with CLI can't be found in the code? (asked by mindxploit) A: Unanswered\nQ: Where should new agents be created in v2? (asked by mindxploit) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can we expect an agent dev school tomorrow? (asked by Jacob Homanics) A: Paused until v2 and auto.fun are released, approximately 1-2 weeks (answered by shaw)\n\n## 3.

AIFlow.ML inquires about changing names and versions in npm, though the specific context is somewhat unclear. Odilitime explains that there's no official versioning system for ElizaOS plugins and that descriptions are hardcoded in some plugin directories but not standardized across all four known plugin directories. There's also a brief mention of a Farcaster plugin, with mekpans asking about its development status and Odilitime later sharing a GitHub repository link to the client-farcaster plugin.\n\n## 2.

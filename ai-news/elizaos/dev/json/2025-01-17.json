      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around technical issues and features of the Eliza framework. Users discussed the QuickIntel plugin API key acquisition process, with Mad requesting and receiving assistance from Ninja_Dev. Several deployment issues were addressed, particularly regarding server connectivity problems where the client was hardcoded to connect to localhost:3000, making remote deployment difficult. Leo sought help with modifying the backend connection address, and Santi identified the issue in the code. Users also inquired about the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) knowledge system, with questions about when it would be pushed to the main build and what file formats it supports (currently only TXT and MD files, not PDF). Other topics included implementing scheduled actions, Twitter Spaces functionality issues, and using tools with generateText. The chat demonstrates active community troubleshooting and developer support.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I modify the backend connection address from localhost:3000? (asked by Leo) A: Look for BASE_URL in client/src/lib/api.ts (answered by platodev and Santi)\nQ: Is PDF text extraction for knowledge RAG setup? (asked by 4n7m4n) A: No, currently only TXT or MD files. (answered by ÍßÅNinja_DevÍßÇ)\nQ: Can we remove files from the knowledge section after they are inserted into the creation table? (asked by 4n7m4n) A: You can remove it. Once it's added it's in there. (answered by ÍßÅNinja_DevÍßÇ)\nQ: Is there any example out there how to use rag or other features? (asked by platodev) A: Unanswered\nQ: How does finetuning work in eliza? (asked by platodev) A: You can try with the rag knowledge system and feed the agent with the data you need (answered by 0xn1c0)\nQ: What's the best way to make the agent run an action every 5 min? (asked by User) A: Unanswered\nQ: Does anyone know if the X Spaces feature is working? (asked by 0xn1c0) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there some reference on how to correctly use tools with generateText? (asked by Blocknaut) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Users express frustration about information being scattered across videos rather than consolidated in documentation. There are specific concerns about understanding core system functionality, particularly regarding providers, plugins, and goals. One user mentions difficulty in getting technical support and responses to questions. Another user suggests using GitHub Copilot as a potential solution for finding information within repositories. The feedback highlights gaps in documentation, challenges for Python developers working with TypeScript, and a desire for better technical support and communication with the development team.\n\n## 2.

Users are working on various aspects including database management, knowledge integration, API connections (particularly with Telegram), and exploring core features like the goal evaluator. The framework appears to be in early development stages with some features not fully implemented yet. A user noted they would postpone using ElizaOS for workflows until it matures further, but appreciated its approach to agent-related problems. There are questions about character files, Instagram client integration, and interest in deferred execution functionality. Development resources were shared, including Chinese development guides for ElizaOS.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When you add new entries to knowledge, they get added to the character file though right?

Several developers are seeking reviews and merges for their contributions, including plugins for Twilio, Livepeer as an LLM provider, and other features. There's significant discussion about using AI tools to accelerate PR reviews, with AIFlow.ML expressing interest in using CodeRabbit and Codeium Forge to help with reviews. Odilitime confirms that CodeRabbit is available upon request. There's also mention of organizational tooling decisions, with Linear apparently being mandated for all projects despite earlier flexibility. AIFlow.ML mentions plans to add Nvidia inference capabilities and a plugin for nim during the weekend. The conversation demonstrates a collaborative environment where team members actively seek feedback, offer assistance with reviews, and discuss tooling improvements to streamline development workflows.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can I use CodeRabbit or should I use my own license? (asked by AIFlow.ML @ ElizaOS) A: I think so, you just need to request a review on the PR. Look at some that Sayonara merged (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Did you test with and without the supported image provider?

      "summary": "# Analysis of ðŸ’¬ï½œgeneral Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. Key points include clarification about package management in ElizaOS v2, which has shifted from pnpm (used in v0/v1) to bun. There's also mention of ElizaOS being featured in an academic chapter about AI containment and meta-layer architectures, with a request for review of the draft content. Additionally, there's a note about adding daily contributor summaries to the ElizaOS GitHub Pages site. One user suggested having a single world per runtime by default to enable cross-platform memory persistence for agents across different messaging platforms.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why are people not following the suggested pnpm package management and I'm seeing instructions to install with bun and npm on different plugins?

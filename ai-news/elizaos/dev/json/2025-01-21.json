Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around technical issues with ElizaOS development, particularly plugin integration challenges. Several developers discussed problems with Twitter Spaces functionality, encountering ICE connection failures and other errors despite trying multiple branches and configurations. There was significant discussion about creating a search integration that could fetch context from external APIs and incorporate it into Eliza's responses, rather than just returning links. Other topics included role upgrades, PR review requests, and build failures on Windows environments. A developer named tcm390 mentioned disabling problematic plugins that were breaking the development branch. There was also interest in creating a generic context provider that could connect to various APIs without requiring custom plugins for each service.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does anyone know if the twitter plugin has the capacity to scrape x.com lists or do specific searches regularly and save to local database? (asked by Jungle) A: Use client-twitter. As far as I know, there isn't a plugin for that. However, you could easily build one! (answered by tcm390)\nQ: How do I get my PR for new client to ElizaOS reviewed? (asked by an1muss) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there any existing plugin that allows agents to call external workflows and automations built on n8n, make or zapier for example? (asked by 0xn1c0) A: Unanswered\nQ: Does anyone have notes on cleaning up an agent process? If I kick off two characters and I want to shut down one without affecting the other, what is the right implementation for that functionality? (asked by DefiniteOptimist) A: Unanswered\nQ: Has anyone worked on adding search in (other than the basic tavily thing that just returns a list of URLs when asked)? (asked by timshel (mee.fun)) A: Unanswered\nQ: How does eliza distinguish between different actions? is there a meta prompt of some kind? (asked by platodev) A: There isn't a single hard-coded system prompt. Instead, the runtime compiles a \"master prompt\" on each request by combining multiple pieces of context. (answered by platodev)\nQ: Anyone on the team working on an Arena integration? (asked by bic) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is anyone here able to build the ElizaOS Main repo using windows? (asked by WarfreakzPlays) A: Try with gitbash. (answered by BackyOG)\nQ: Is anybody building BlueSky client (it's kind like twitter)? (asked by AD) A: I am not building bluesky client. Would be great if you can build that. (answered by AD)\n\n## 3.

IamNotGreedy encountered an error related to version compatibility, which was resolved by downgrading from version 0.1.9-alpha to 0.1.8. Another user, kuzyakiev, experienced problems with file validation where the system generated an invalid JSON file. The validation error specifically pointed to a type mismatch in the knowledge property, which should be an array but was being processed as an object. This occurred when using the folder2knowledge and knowledge2character tools. The error message indicated that the knowledge structure was incorrectly formatted with objects instead of arrays. D. Ratta suggested checking for syntax errors like missing commas. Additionally, Titan shared a guide for setting up nodes and mentioned an incentive program for building AI agents with Livepeer.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What was causing the error with the agent package? (asked by IamNotGreedy) A: The issue was with the latest release (0.1.9-alpha) of the agent package, downgrading to 0.1.8 resolved it. (answered by IamNotGreedy)\nQ: Why is the JSON file not validating? (asked by kuzyakiev) A: The knowledge property is being formatted as an object instead of the required array type. (answered by D.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around pull request management and plugin compatibility issues in the ElizaOS project. AIFlow.ML submitted PR #2599 that adds moderation capabilities to Eliza, including video understanding functionality. There were discussions about fixing integration tests and addressing plugin compatibility problems with the v2 version of the system. Several plugins (abstract, cronos, holdstation) were identified as causing issues. Additionally, a community member (xLuisCumbi) developed a script called \"chats2character.js\" that generates character schemas from WhatsApp conversations, similar to the existing tweets2character functionality. The script processes chat data, supports OpenAI and Claude models, handles message chunking, tracks progress, generates organized outputs, and implements caching. AIFlow.ML advised xLuisCumbi to create a PR to the characterfile repository.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can you pass me a list of all plugs that are causing issues? (asked by AIFlow.ML @ ElizaOS) A: abstract/cronos/holdstation (answered by tcm390)\nQ: You also have the errors they cause? (asked by AIFlow.ML @ ElizaOS) A: yes (answered by tcm390)\nQ: How can I contribute my WhatsApp conversation character generation script to the community?

Summary\nThe chat segment is brief and focuses on addressing a \"brain drain\" issue where active coders have moved from one Discord server to another, leaving users in the original server without adequate support. Jin points out that the original Discord's coders channel remains active but lacks experienced developers. Odilitime initially suggested having developers idle in both channels, but Jin noted this would cause too much context switching. They agreed that bridging the channels would be a better solution. By the end of the conversation, Odilitime confirmed that the channels had been successfully bridged, resolving the issue of fragmented developer attention across multiple Discord servers.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Should developers be present in both Discord servers? (asked by jin) A: Initially yes, but bridging is a better solution (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

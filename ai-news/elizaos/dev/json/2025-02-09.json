      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in 💬｜general\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around troubleshooting ElizaOS installation and runtime issues. A user (gin_chan) encountered errors when trying to run ElizaOS with Node.js v23.0.0, receiving a \"Dynamic require of 'stream' is not supported\" error. ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯 suggested updating to Node.js v23.3.0, but the issue persisted. Later, gin_chan reported solving the problem but didn't share the solution details.\n\nThe conversation also touched on the new development strategy for ElizaOS plugins. There's discussion about how to connect to packages after they've been removed, with super suggesting installing dependencies from registry/index.json and using npm link or local paths for development. \n\nOther technical topics included a Python script debugging session for a MUSD to BTC swap tool, Twitter client issues with the suppressInitialMessage feature (fixed in a PR by Ninja_Dev), and plugin development for MultiversX and EVM/Starknet.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I fix the \"Dynamic require of 'stream' is not supported\" error? (asked by gin_chan) A: Partially answered by ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯 suggesting Node.js version update, but full solution not shared\nQ: How do we connect to packages now that they've been removed?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment discusses issues related to package access after a migration to a self-hosted registry. Ruby mentions that packages were moved to a self-hosted registry the previous week and offers to help with any access issues. There's confusion about the correct documentation URL, with Ruby initially providing an incorrect URL (docs.elizaos.dev/packages) before acknowledging the mistake. Odilitime confirms the existence of a package registry with more information forthcoming. Additionally, Mike D. raises a concern about an excessively large test video file (44172 bytes) in the agent-twitter-client directory, identified through a size-based file search.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Hey, how do we connect to the package now that they are been removed? (asked by El Pulpo 🐙) A: Moved everything to self-hosted registry last week. Check the new dev docs.

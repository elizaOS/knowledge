Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around ElizaOS v2 development, with discussions about its beta status and implementation challenges. Several users inquire about the timing of v2's official release and whether they should wait for it or start with the current beta. There are technical discussions about plugin compatibility issues between v1 and v2, with users reporting errors when trying to use plugins like OpenAI, Discord, and Postgres with v2. Database customization is discussed, with Mike D. sharing PRs for changing database columns and improving logging. The conversation also touches on deployment options, with recommendations for VPS providers like Hetzner and OVH, as well as Phala Cloud for free deployments. There's mention of \"the-org,\" a demo application showcasing multiple agents working together, and discussion about the tasks system in v2 for handling queuing. Some users seek help with agent personality customization and database integration issues.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: If I'm just starting to build an agent, should I best wait for v2? (asked by jonas) A: You don't have to wait but the education is thin. Beta is out and we've been playing with it for a couple weeks. (answered by shaw)\nQ: Is launch today, monday? (asked by Yemmii) A: We're launching with a partner so it's on their announcement, \"this week\" with certainty but wait for announcement for exact time. (answered by shaw)\nQ: Am I banned?

(asked by DeFine) A: github -> checkout v2-develop (answered by 0xbayo)\nQ: How hard is it to add custom database columns? (asked by Titan | Livepeer-Eliza.com) A: You can see my latest patch for changing a db column. (answered by Mike D.)\nQ: Is there any plug-in or way to launch multy agentic teams in v2 currently? (asked by DeFine) A: Yeah by default that's how it runs. We are working on a small team (\"the org\") of agents who work together, it's in the v2 repo now. (answered by shaw)\nQ: Is the whole plugin system broken or something? (asked by Berlin) A: V1 plugins don't work with v2 yet.

Ruby responds that they don't have direct access to the codebase but suggests checking GitHub issues and PRs or contacting core developers. mindxploit mentions that the bug doesn't appear to be present in version 0.25.9 which they're using, and states they might fix it themselves if needed.\n\n## 2.

Key discussions included:\n\n- Twitter client integration issues, particularly with formatting problems in tweets where numbered lists were appearing incorrectly. A fix was proposed by adding regex replacements to remove numbered list markers.\n- Custom plugin development for wallet tracking functionality, with KeyesCode.eth sharing their implementation of an agent that follows ETH and BASE wallets.\n- Questions about implementing automated actions through the Twitter client, specifically how to make an agent post content from custom actions at regular intervals.\n- Knowledge base implementation challenges, with users discussing how to make agents consistently respond with specific information like links.\n- Database integration issues, particularly with Supabase adapter changes and knowledge table writing problems.\n- Node version compatibility concerns, with warnings about Node 23.5.0 vs the expected 23.3.0.\n- Telegram client connection problems on Linux environments.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I make my agent automatically post content from custom actions at regular intervals? (asked by KeyesCode.eth) A: You need to create a provider and pass that provider into the Twitter post template, then amend the template to explain to the agent that you want the provider data in the tweet every time. (answered by R0am)\nQ: How can I make my agent answer with a specific link when asked? (asked by bendermind) A: Add the links to the 'system' prompt in char.json. (answered by bendermind)\nQ: Is it possible for the agent to join an existing space rather than starting its own? (asked by pluto) A: Yes, agent-twitter-client can do that, but client-twitter doesn't have the needed code to take advantage of the join spaces functionality yet. (answered by sayonara)\nQ: Is there a way to give the agent knowledge of things like docs on a URL? (asked by pluto) A: Not currently. The ragKnowledge is an initial implementation. For advanced RAG solutions, a custom plugin would be needed. If you get the docs in markdown or txt format, you can use those. (answered by ÍßÅNinja_DevÍßÇ)\nQ: Why is my agent not responding to 'gm' when tagged? (asked by bendermind) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can I increase the threshold in the knowledge folder system to keep my agent from hallucinating? (asked by Mad) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is it possible to integrate an Eliza agent into a browser extension? (asked by eeee) A: Unanswered\nQ: Where can we find v2 core code? (asked by Mike D.) A: I don't believe it's out yet. (answered by ÍßÅNinja_DevÍßÇ)\nQ: What's the latest stable version of the Eliza repo? (asked by ICJR) A: v0.1.8+build.1 should be more stable. It's basically v0.1.8.1 but semver doesn't allow that. (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in üìÆÔΩúfeedback Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion centers on package management concerns in the project repository. Users are experiencing frustration with the current monolithic structure where all adapters, clients, and packages are bundled together. This causes several issues:\n- Unnecessary imports remain when updating to new releases\n- High memory consumption (6.7GB RAM for running a single agent)\n- Large node_modules size (3GB), primarily due to llama-cpp and duplicate onnxruntime versions from the transformers package\n- Concerns about cost-efficiency when deploying to cloud environments (AWS/GCP)\n\nThe main proposal is to segregate packages/adapters/clients from the main repository and move to a manual package installation approach, allowing users to include only what they need.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why is the node_modules size so large? (implied by mangu) A: It's 3GB due to llama-cpp and two versions of onnxruntime because of the transformers package version (answered by Cesar Rodriguez)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe channel discussions primarily focus on ElizaOS development, with users seeking guidance on setup, implementation, and extending functionality. Several users are working on creating agentic applications, with specific interest in building personalized agents using vector databases and character files. There are questions about repository structure, API integration, and plugin development. Users share links to resources including GitHub repositories (elizaOS/characterfile, elizaOS/eliza) and announcements about ElizaOS v2. One user describes wanting to create an agent with more advanced capabilities beyond basic chatbot functionality, expressing frustration with the complexity of the codebase. Another user is working on creating an agentic version of themselves using their written articles and chat history. The channel also contains announcements about AI agent development opportunities and resources.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are there any more advanced tutorials for eliza for instance about editing {{actions}} to make the bot execute an action?

      "summary": "# Analysis of \"üì•ÔΩúpull-requests\" Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe channel primarily focuses on pull request discussions for the ElizaOS project. Key technical discussions centered around:\n\n1) Solana plugin improvements: A user (suns) enhanced the legacy Solana plugin to properly handle native SOL and SPL transfers, submitting PR #2340. There was confusion about two Solana plugins existing simultaneously (plugin-solana and plugin-solana-agentkit).\n\n2) ModelProvider duplication issue: Cesar Rodriguez identified a potential issue where modelProvider exists in both AgentRuntime and character objects, causing unexpected behavior when configurations conflict. He suggested removing the redundant modelProvider from runtime since it's mandatory in character.\n\n3) Supabase implementation: AIFlow.ML proposed reviving PR #1800 as an alternative to the current Supabase implementation which has received multiple fix attempts. Odilitime agreed to review this approach.\n\n4) Agent scaling: A brief discussion revealed Odilitime runs 350 agents on a single EPYC processor instance, contrasting with N3rdStorm's preference for single-agent deployments.\n\n5) Several PRs were mentioned for review including #2275, #49, #1800, #2335, #2338, and #2149, covering various improvements to ElizaOS.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why does AgentRuntime have a modelProvider if character has a modelProvider? (asked by Cesar Rodriguez) A: Because agentruntime is basically the instance of a character, they're pretty much the same. It's an artifact of optimizing for a single character but allowing multiple agents. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: How many agents can be run on one instance? (implied by N3rdStorm) A: I run 350 agents on one instance (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Why are there two Solana plugins (plugin-solana and plugin-solana-agentkit)? (asked by suns) A: Agent-kit got its own plugin for now (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ÍßÅNinja_DevÍßÇ | Helpee: suns | Context: How to get Solana plugin improvements merged into main repo | Resolution: Advised to submit a PR against the develop branch for review and merging\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: Cesar Rodriguez | Context: Confusion about duplicate modelProvider in AgentRuntime and character | Resolution: Explained it's an artifact of optimization, noting .env is not recommended for multiple agents but useful for maintaining defaults\n\n## 4.

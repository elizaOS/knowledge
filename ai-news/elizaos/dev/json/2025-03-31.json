Summary\nThe chat segment covers discussions about Eliza's documentation accuracy and version differences between v1 and v2. A user (mindxploit) expressed confusion about locating agents created via CLI in the v2dev version, noting that they don't appear in the codebase. G2 suggested agents might be stored in `/packages/the-org`, but mindxploit clarified this only contains premade agents, not newly created ones. The user questioned where new agents should be created and how CLI-created agents are stored if not in the visible codebase. Additionally, there was a brief exchange about the scheduling of agent dev school sessions, with shaw mentioning they're paused for 1-2 weeks until v2 and auto.fun are released. Nisita shared a public Google Calendar link for tracking all events after Shiva M requested calendar integration.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Which part of the docs aren't accurate?

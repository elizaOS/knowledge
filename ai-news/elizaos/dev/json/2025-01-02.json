      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around ElizaOS development, plugins, and integration possibilities. Several developers discussed creating or improving plugins, particularly for trading, Twitter integration, and cryptocurrency price tracking. A user named kAI wilder shared an unofficial documentation repository for ElizaOS runtime operations. There was discussion about code quality issues in Core/generate.ts, with DeFine pointing out spaghetti code patterns that need refactoring. Developers discussed hosting options for running agents 24/7, with recommendations for OVH/Hetzner over AWS for cost reasons. There were also conversations about integrating trading bots, Twitter API usage, and conditional providers. A developer named agwnl mentioned working on a Twitter client using the Twitter API, which was identified as a needed contribution. Several users expressed interest in collaborating on projects and improving existing plugins.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's bot support mean? Like Tg/Discord bot? (asked by ꧁Ninja_Dev꧂) A: That's already supported. (answered by ꧁Ninja_Dev꧂)\nQ: Can I use eliza without knowing how to code? (asked by twinkletoes.ron) A: Yes (answered by sean)\nQ: Recommendation on cloud services for running an agent 24/7? (asked by Dragonbutt) A: AWS is okay, Digital Ocean too. Clouds like AWS are expensive, OVH/Hetzner are much cheaper/better value. (answered by SotoAlt | BOSSU and Odilitime)\nQ: What would be the best way to read a user pfp on Twitter? (asked by SotoAlt | BOSSU) A: Through Twitter API (implied but unanswered directly)\nQ: Any idea how can I retweet from specific person or reply to related post? (asked by Alex curtin) A: I am not aware of how that is possible with the twitter plugin but what I think the other way is that you can use the twitter webhook and can retweet certain posts and also replies to comments under your posts (answered by jumpspace)\nQ: Anyone making a twitter client which uses twitter API? (asked by agwnl) A: I think that's very needed, I haven't heard of anyone working on it (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on improving the Eliza framework's organization, documentation, and architecture. ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯 shared a Bun runtime variant of Eliza aimed at reducing dependencies and simplifying deployment for beginners. They also proposed modularizing the runtime composition further by implementing a Zod schema for character definition instead of embedding the default character within the runtime. ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯 provided a detailed TypeScript implementation of this schema-based approach, which includes validation for character properties like name, plugins, model provider, settings, and message examples. Odilitime agreed that a Zod schema might be beneficial. Separately, Teejay mentioned the need for better documentation on starting minimal Eliza projects and customizing them with add-ons. Cole suggested implementing an `npx create eliza` command to simplify project initialization.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How can I get started with a minimal Eliza project and customize it? (asked by Teejay) A: R0am pointed to the agent dev school resources at eliza.gg/eliza/community/ai-dev-school/, and Odilitime offered to answer questions about the framework (answered by R0am, Odilitime)\nQ: Could the runtime composition be modularized further with a schema-based approach? (asked by ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯) A: Odilitime confirmed a Zod schema might be good (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 📥｜pull-requests\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around pull requests for the Eliza project and its starter repository. Several PRs were mentioned, including bug fixes (#1688, #1689), a CoinGecko plugin (#1761), and a CoinMarketCap plugin (#1773). A significant discussion emerged about the neglected state of the eliza-starter repository, which hasn't been maintained for two months despite being the recommended starting point for new users. This creates onboarding friction as the starter breaks \"out of the box.\" Cole and Ruby proposed solutions including either properly maintaining the starter repo or creating a \"create-eliza\" tool similar to create-react-app for better onboarding. Odilitime mentioned plans for version 0.1.8, likely to be released the following week, and expressed interest in merging cryptocurrency price checking plugins. There was also a brief discussion about potential duplication between PR #1761 and an existing PR #1382, both related to CoinGecko functionality.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Could you please review this PR again? (asked by Tommy Tuekcs) A: I see he has to resolve his comments (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Anything needed to get this PR merged in? (asked by Archethect) A: Unanswered\nQ: How is it [CoinGecko plugin PR #1761] different than 1382? (asked by Odilitime) A: oh didn't see one already open for coingecko (answered by Spit)\n\n## 3.

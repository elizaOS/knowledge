      "summary": "# ElizaOS Discord Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion in the general channel focused on several key technical areas for ElizaOS development. Web2 integration emerged as a major priority, with developers discussing payment systems (Stripe, Skyfire.xyz), email integration, domain management, and IoT/smart home connectivity (Home Assistant). Several developers are working on one-click deployment solutions to simplify ElizaOS setup. There was significant interest in building plugins for various services, with payment processing identified as a current weak point. Developers discussed Twitter API integration to replace the current scraping approach, and the need for better documentation of works-in-progress to avoid duplication of effort. The community is actively collaborating on extending ElizaOS's capabilities through plugins, with Shaw indicating willingness to fund development of various web2 integrations. There was also discussion about code quality issues, particularly in the core/generate.ts file, which was described as needing refactoring.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it recommended to change personal social profiles to elizaOS? (asked by Affaan) A: It's totally up to you, but web2 folks might not align with the \"big boobed waifu meme\" of web3, so elizaOS aims to welcome them and academia in a more neutral setting.

Key technical discussions include: (1) A \"save this\" plugin that captures message history as knowledge records, (2) Concerns about PR #1599 regarding risk vs. reward, (3) Integration of DeepSeek AI API support, (4) Bug fixes in the Evaluator facts template, and (5) Various other PRs needing review. There was a brief discussion about langchain's context chunking capabilities for better sentence preservation. Community members expressed concerns about dependency management, with consensus that \"less npm/dependencies is better\" to reduce supply chain attack surface. The balance between adding new capabilities while protecting the core package was emphasized. Several contributors requested reviews for their PRs, with some having waited for extended periods.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: By the comment, looks like it tries to keep the sentences more together vs just randomly splitting? (asked by ꧁Ninja_Dev꧂) A: Better context chunking. (answered by ꧁Ninja_Dev꧂)\nQ: Can I please understand why you think that? (asked by R0am) A: Less npm/dependencies is better. Less surface area for supply chain attacks. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: That means we will hit a max in terms of integrations in the repo at some point? (asked by R0am) A: No there's balance, we always want new capabilities but need to protect the core package (including it's services) (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: You got documentation? (asked by Mr-Don-Leo) A: I didn't do docs, I just updated the modelprovider (answered by SYMBiEX <<CidSociety>>)\nQ: Do i create the issue, and submit a PR on it?

ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯 shared a Bun runtime variant of Eliza aimed at reducing dependencies and simplifying deployment for beginners. Teejay identified a need for better documentation on starting minimal projects and customizing with add-ons. The most substantial technical discussion centered around ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯's proposal to modularize the runtime composition further by implementing a Zod or TypeScript character schema instead of embedding the default character within the runtime. Odilitime agreed that a Zod schema might be beneficial. ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯 then shared a detailed TypeScript implementation of a proposed character schema using Zod for validation, which includes comprehensive type definitions and validation for character properties such as name, plugins, clients, model provider, settings, system behavior, bio, lore, message examples, post examples, adjectives, people, topics, and style. The schema includes default values and strict validation to ensure proper character configuration.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I get started with a minimal Eliza project and customize it? (asked by Teejay) A: There's an agent dev school resource available at https://eliza.gg/eliza/community/ai-dev-school/ (answered by R0am)\nQ: Could the runtime composition be modularized further? (asked by ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯) A: Zod scheme might be good (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

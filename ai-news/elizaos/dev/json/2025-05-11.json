Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief conversation between users ualp. and Ruby about AI Agent Dev School content for v2 by Shaw. Ruby initially states there's one comprehensive official dev school program covering everything from basic architecture to advanced memory systems and multimodal capabilities. When ualp. asks for clarification about the content, mentioning they only see a basic CLI video (about 1 hour 15 minutes long), Ruby acknowledges that the current video only covers CLI basics. Ruby clarifies that advanced topics like memory systems, multi-agent architectures, and custom plugins are still in development and coming soon. In the meantime, Ruby suggests using the Discord server, particularly the #agent-dev channel, as a resource for discussions on advanced features like memory implementations.\n\n## 2.

Odilitime updated the registry PR template to clarify steps for contributors. DorianD proposed ideas for crowdsourcing QA for plugins, suggesting a blockchain-based registry to track plugin performance and user feedback. Technical discussions covered plugin architecture, with Odilitime explaining that plugins stay in memory rather than terminating after task completion, and that evaluators are primarily for high-performance scenarios like real-time voice applications. Users inquired about hosting ElizaOS on Digital Ocean, Twitter scraping tools, and using the RAG knowledge integration feature. The chat also included discussions about a Twilio plugin implementation by boolkeys that was used by Magicred1 to create an agentic caregivers application for a healthcare hackathon, which the jury considered \"cheating\" due to the advanced capabilities of ElizaOS.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I host the elizaOS to the digital ocean? (asked by Blue Shark) A: Unanswered\nQ: Does anyone recommend a specific Twitter scraping script? (asked by Santiago N) A: twitter scraper finetune, or theconvocation twitter scraper on github.com (answered by Osint (aka not_in_a_dao_ai))\nQ: Is https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza-plugin-starter still used? (asked by jin) A: Unanswered\nQ: Have v2 been launched? (asked by stringnull001) A: No, just new v1 (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: How do i use the knowledge base feature? Can i just convert my knowledge here and start using it without any coding required? (asked by stringnull001) A: You can just put documents in a directory and that system will load them into all characters you have running (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ¤–ï½œagent-dev-school\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on troubleshooting issues with the Eliza platform, particularly related to knowledge processing and character behavior. A significant technical problem was identified where knowledge chunks were causing errors when they were shorter than the chunk size, affecting both OpenAI and Anthropic model providers. User boolkeys proposed a concrete solution by modifying the knowledge.ts file to handle cases where text is shorter than the chunk size, preventing it from being split and causing errors. This fix was implemented and submitted as PR #3652. Other discussions included questions about customizing character behavior through system prompts and properly formatting knowledge arrays in configuration files. The chat demonstrates collaborative problem-solving among community members to address technical issues with the Eliza platform.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I get a character to talk more like truth_terminal? (asked by bolt) A: Character file has a field called system which is the system prompt, I'd suggest messing with that (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: How can I see how knowledge gets processed after running knowledge2character? (asked by bolt) A: Just put the chunks array into knowledge. I believe knowledge is meant to be an array of strings (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Is anyone else facing issues with the latest Eliza version when using OpenAI as modelProvider? (asked by Thamil) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can characters run with Anthropic models? (asked by Quang Vinh) A: Unanswered\nQ: How to generate a template by using elizaOS? (asked by Jeongseup | Cosmostation) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: boolkeys | Helpee: Multiple users | Context: Error when processing knowledge in Eliza | Resolution: Identified that the issue was related to knowledge processing and provided a code fix in knowledge.ts to handle text shorter than chunk size\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: bolt | Context: How to format knowledge after using knowledge2character | Resolution: Explained that knowledge should be an array of strings\nHelper: boolkeys | Helpee: Thamil, Quang Vinh, tem | Context: Model provider errors | Resolution: Identified that the issue comes from knowledge processing, noting shaw.json works (no knowledge) while snoop.json fails\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ“¥ï½œpull-requests\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment covers discussions about the pull request process for Eliza OS, particularly focusing on plugin submissions. Vincent sought clarification about the PR process for plugins, which Odilitime confirmed involves submitting the plugin to the registry repo, updating the .env example file, and defining the plugin in package.json in the main repo. Later, boolkeys submitted a PR (#3652) to fix an \"Invalid array length\" error in knowledge processing, which was promptly merged by Odilitime. Odilitime noted that the PRs are now under 3 pages and issues under 300, suggesting a more manageable project state. Another discussion involved PR #2139, which showed 0 files changed, leading Odilitime to recommend creating a separate repo for new plugins and adding them to the registry. Following this advice, boolkeys submitted PR #80 to the elizaos-plugins registry, which was subsequently merged.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: I just need to submit the plugin's pull request to the registry repo and submit the pull request for the configuration variables in the .env example file also define my plugin in package.json in the main repo, right? (asked by vincent) A: yes (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Can you tell me what happens with https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/2139 do I need to do something? (asked by boolkeys) A: if it's a new plugin, just make it's own repo and add it to the registry (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: vincent | Context: Clarification on plugin submission process | Resolution: Confirmed the correct process for submitting plugins\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: boolkeys | Context: Guidance on PR #2139 with 0 files changed | Resolution: Advised to create a separate repo for new plugins and add to registry\nHelper: boolkeys | Helpee: Community | Context: \"Invalid array length\" error in knowledge processing | Resolution: Created and submitted PR #3652 which was merged\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around users experiencing difficulties with Twitter agents in the Eliza framework. Multiple users report issues with their agents not being able to tweet despite proper setup. Yvan has been struggling for days with an agent that builds successfully but doesn't tweet, sharing error logs showing a \"Service text_generation not found\" error. Prof. J reports a similar issue where the agent responds but claims it can't make tweets despite API setup. Another user (Abderahman) mentions that in Eliza v2, only posting works while replies and targeting users don't function properly, with the agent crashing when mentioned. Jin directs users to the GitHub issues page for tracking and reporting problems. There's also a brief discussion about character file customization, with a user asking if character files can be dynamically built and injected for per-user personalization.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in ðŸ“®ï½œfeedback Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief discussion about issues with agent tweeting functionality in V2 (beta). User rchak007 reports that their agent is posting repetitive tweets that don't reflect the character's directions, despite responding correctly in local host direct interactions. Nisita, likely a team member, acknowledges the feedback and suggests the issue might be related to plugins still being migrated in the V2 beta. Another user, Prâ­•f. J, inquires whether a paid Twitter/X developer account is required for the tweeting functionality, as they're experiencing issues with their agent's ability to tweet using a free account.\n\n## 2.

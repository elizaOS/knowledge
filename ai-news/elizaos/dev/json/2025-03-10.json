      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around ElizaOS development, with discussions about version 2 (v2) which is nearing release. Key technical topics include: issues with Twitter/X integration due to Cloudflare security changes affecting Docker containers, memory duplication problems in jsdocs, and character management in the framework. Shaw mentioned that v2 will introduce simplified agent creation with commands like `npm create eliza` and `npx elizaos start`, replacing the eliza-starter repository. There were discussions about character customization, with recommendations to use Anthropic and Llama 405 models for better character formatting and personality. Several GitHub issues and PRs were referenced, including fixes for text splitting and newline bugs. The team is addressing vulnerabilities found in the cloud-deployment-eliza repository and working on migration tools for plugins from v1 to v2.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Any ETA on v2? (asked by Jacob Homanics) A: \"going to release it in a few days\" (answered by shaw)\nQ: How can I create my own start script?

Users are experiencing problems with the browser plugin after a dynamic plugins update, particularly with Twitter login and Chrome headless mode. There's confusion about the difference between using .json character files versus .ts files for configuration, with documentation appearing to focus more on the latter. A user inquired about REST API endpoints for the Eliza framework, and another user pointed to relevant files and documentation. The conversation reveals that ElizaOS v2 is coming very soon, with an alpha release scheduled for the following Monday. Users also note that the dev school videos are outdated as the codebase has changed significantly since filming.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What command are you using to run the agent?

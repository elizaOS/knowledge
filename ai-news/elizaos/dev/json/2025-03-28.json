      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around issues with ElizaOS installation and setup, particularly with the beta version. Users are experiencing errors related to dependencies like EventEmitter3 and plugin installation. Jin provided troubleshooting steps for the installation process, noting that users need to use the beta CLI with specific commands: `npx @elizaos/cli@beta create` followed by `npx @elizaos/cli@beta start`. There were discussions about using free LLM models from OpenRouter as defaults, though Jin noted these have low rate limits (200 requests/day) making them unsuitable for production. Other topics included a user wanting to set up Telegram notifications for trading alerts, custom plugins for multi-agent conversations, and adding new ServiceTypes. Jin also shared a blog post about information management and sought feedback.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to make my AI agent notify me in Telegram?

The main technical topic revolves around the Eliza framework and its availability. A user reported that ai.eliza.how was not working, suggesting server issues. Another user shared an updated link (eliza.how) as the latest resource. There was also a brief exchange about finding an Eliza Bot, with one user seeking a specific agent dedicated to Eliza in v2 that they had previously used. The conversation includes general greetings and a call for collaboration on building startups using elizaOS, though no specific technical implementations or solutions were discussed in depth.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can someone point me to the Eliza Bot? There was one at eliza.gg that went down months ago, but there's another one I used a couple weeks ago and now I can't find where it was. (asked by Hidden Forces) A: Hello, you can find all the docs related to eliza below https://eliza.how/ (answered by sam-developer)\nQ: Is the dev active? (asked by OnchainForge) A: yes everyone's active. are you looking to setup eliza or do some testing around the framework? (answered by sam-developer)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment focuses on integrating MCP (likely Modular Compute Protocol) with ElizaOS and setting up a Twitter integration for an agent. Ruby provides guidance on both topics. For MCP integration, Ruby directs the user to the mcp-client library and examples repository. The Twitter integration discussion is more extensive, covering authentication requirements, API usage, and configuration parameters. Ruby explains that Twitter integration requires proper OAuth credentials through a Twitter developer account, not just cookies. The conversation addresses rate limiting concerns with the current configuration settings and clarifies that web scraping alternatives are unreliable and against Twitter's terms of service. Ruby recommends following Twitter's automation policy for creating reply bots and emphasizes the necessity of using the official API despite the setup requirements.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there any guide for integrating MCP with ElizaOS? (asked by Fenil Modi) A: Integration docs are being finalized, but use the mcp-client library and check examples at github.com/storacha/mcp-examples (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Do I need an X dev account? (asked by Ramiroo) A: Yes, you need a developer account from developer.twitter.com to get the API keys (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Is a dev account 100% necessary in order to get the twitter activity? (asked by Ramiroo) A: Yes, you need a dev account as there's no reliable way around Twitter's API authentication requirements (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Can I do it with Twitter's free dev acc? (asked by Ramiroo) A: Yes, the free tier basic access will work, approval process usually takes 1-2 days (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Is creating a reply bot allowed in Twitter's terms and conditions? (asked by Ramiroo) A: Yes, but you need to disclose it's automated and follow Twitter's automation rules (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Is there any way of making it work without using the Twitter API? (asked by Ramiroo) A: Not recommended as web scraping or unauthorized access will likely get your account banned (answered by Ruby)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat revolves around a user (Hidden Forces) struggling to set up a basic character in elizaOS v2 after migrating from v1. The main technical issues include:\n- Confusion about proper directory structure for character files in v2\n- Path resolution problems with the character loading command\n- Package.json configuration forcing redirection to \"the-org\" directory\n- Outdated documentation causing confusion between v1 and v2 approaches\n\nRuby attempted to help by suggesting various directory structures and commands, but provided several incorrect solutions before identifying the root cause: a hardcoded path in package.json that was forcing all commands through \"./packages/the-org\". The solution was to edit package.json to remove this hardcoded path. They also attempted to update the elizaOS packages to the latest version but encountered dependency conflicts.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I launch a basic custom character without using CLI? (asked by Hidden Forces) A: Use configuration files directly instead of the GUI, which is more reliable even if it requires more terminal work (answered by Ruby)\nQ: What are the required fields for a v2 character JSON? (asked by Hidden Forces) A: Add \"version\": \"2.0\" and \"id\": \"your_character_id\" at the root level of your JSON (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Do I need to run \"bun run dev\" before starting a character? (asked by Hidden Forces) A: No, you can run the start command directly with the character path (answered by Ruby)\nQ: How do I check my elizaOS version? (asked by Hidden Forces) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ruby | Helpee: Hidden Forces | Context: Package.json forcing redirection to \"the-org\" directory | Resolution: Identified the issue in package.json with the line \"start\": \"cd ./packages/the-org && bun run start\" and suggested changing it to \"start\": \"bun run start\"\nHelper: Ruby | Helpee: Hidden Forces | Context: Missing required fields in character JSON | Resolution: Provided the necessary fields \"version\" and \"id\" to add to the character configuration\nHelper: Ruby | Helpee: Hidden Forces | Context: Confusion about directory structure for character files | Resolution: Suggested creating packages/standalone/src/characters/ structure, though this didn't fully resolve the issue due to package.json configuration\n\n## 4.

Summary\nThe conversation revolves around implementing and troubleshooting a Discord plugin extension for ElizaOS that adds reply functionality and Graphlit knowledge integration. The participants work through several technical challenges:\n\nInitially, they attempt to extend the base DiscordPlugin class, but discover it's a singleton instance rather than a class that can be extended. They pivot to enhancing the service through the registry pattern instead.\n\nThe implementation evolves from a custom service coordinator to properly leveraging ElizaOS's event system. They address issues with service initialization timing, memory management, and message handling.\n\nA key challenge is integrating the Graphlit MCP server for knowledge retrieval with Discord's reply functionality. They implement a pipeline that fetches knowledge from Graphlit, enhances LLM responses, and formats replies as threaded messages in Discord.\n\nThroughout the conversation, they refine the implementation to address TypeScript errors, memory leaks, and race conditions. The final solution uses ElizaOS's event system with BEFORE_RESPOND and AFTER_RESPOND handlers to properly integrate knowledge retrieval and threaded replies.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the recommended pattern for enhancing the Discord plugin's functionality? (asked by Scooter) A: Use the service registry pattern to enhance functionality without extending the class directly. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: How should we properly register an action like GRAPHLIT_RAG in ElizaOS? (asked by Scooter) A: Register it in your character config rather than the agent setup. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: How do we integrate the existing plugin.ts and its GRAPHLIT_RAG action with our Discord integration? (asked by Scooter) A: Import and use the plugin in index.ts and register the action in your agent configuration. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: What's the correct way to register an action in ElizaOS? (asked by Scooter) A: In your character type definition, extend the actions interface and register in plugin.ts. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: How do we properly hook into ElizaOS service events? (asked by Scooter) A: Use the built-in event system with handlers for events like 'mcp:ready' and 'discord:ready'. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: How do we integrate the MCP service binding? (asked by Scooter) A: Create a service class that wraps MCP and only exposes the methods you need. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: How can I get the world ID? (asked by Haze) A: Use WorldManager.getCurrentWorld() or make a GET request to /api/worlds. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: What is the command for running a certain character file? (asked by Scooter) A: Use \"elizaos run --character path/to/character.json\" from the project root directory. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Can I run a character in dev mode? (asked by Scooter) A: Yes, use \"elizaos run --dev --character path/to/character.json\" for hot reloading and detailed logs. (answered by Ruby)\n\n## 3.

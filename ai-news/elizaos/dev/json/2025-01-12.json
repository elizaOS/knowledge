One user (sirprincess) encountered a problem with eliza-starter attempting to boot with LlamaService despite specifying a different model provider in the character file. The user noted that the same configuration works correctly when starting from the actual Eliza repo on version 0.1.7. Another user (BitCoder) asked about disabling unwanted plugins and adapter-pglite after cloning the develop branch. There was also a brief discussion confirming that only four agent-dev-school videos exist currently. A new user (Robbie) requested help with Eliza installation and blockchain integration, and Ruby provided guidance on installation steps for MacOS, including prerequisites like Homebrew and Xcode command line tools. Finally, a user asked about tools for scraping historical tweets, but received no response in the provided transcript.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I turn off unwanted plugins and adapter-pglite after cloning the develop branch? (asked by BitCoder) A: Unanswered\nQ: Are there just 4 agent-dev-school videos? (asked by sheenjek) A: Yeah there are not more so far (answered by piffie)\nQ: How to install eliza and connect it to blockchain? (asked by Robbie) A: For eliza installation, check out the docs in #getting-started. Blockchain integration isn't a native feature, so you'll want to look into custom plugins or extensions. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: What plugins or tools do people use to scrape ALL historical tweets from someone? (asked by eliza.dev118) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why does the eliza-starter keep trying to boot with LlamaService instead of the provider that I'm specifying in the character file?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around three main technical topics: RAG implementation, Instagram integration, and Injective protocol integration. Users discussed how to efficiently use RAG with characters, with Odilitime suggesting it's easier to educate agents in their rooms and sharing a pull request (#1620) that enables this functionality. Regarding Instagram integration, Spit worked on fixing a PR that allows posting to Instagram, demonstrating it with a post to his account (0xspit). The implementation currently uses locally uploaded images, but there was discussion about potentially generating images or implementing a proper upload system. Ruby offered technical assistance with image recognition issues. Additionally, „Ç®„Éã„Ç∞„Éû„É™„ÉÉ„Ç≠ created a PR (#1764) for Injective protocol integration and requested reviews. AIFlow.ML mentioned working on PR Agents with results to be shared in an upcoming meeting.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Any documentation on how to use the RAG? How to upload text to the RAG?

Summary\nThe chat segment contains a single message from user ICJR introducing SAIOS (https://saios.app), a platform designed to make the Eliza framework accessible to users without coding skills. SAIOS aims to provide a comprehensive interface for Eliza features with full configuration options through a simple UI. The project has a decentralized architecture, hosting the UI on IPFS/Arweave and the agent server on Akash or similar networks, with users providing their own LLM API keys. ICJR positions SAIOS as differentiated from competitors by offering more extensive configuration options for AI agents. The message includes links to the application, Twitter account, and a video demonstration.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nNo questions were asked or answered in this chat segment.\n\n## 3.

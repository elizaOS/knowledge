      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe conversation primarily revolves around Auto.fun's Solana program implementation, particularly regarding Raydium liquidity migration and plugin development for Eliza V2. A user inquired about developing plugins for the V2 version and was directed to documentation. There was a technical discussion about the implementation of Raydium liquidity migration, specifically questioning the choice of using lockLp function (temporary lock) versus burnAndEarn.createLockInstruction (permanent lock/burn). The developer clarified that they are following Raydium SDK recommendations and using feeNftOwner parameter with a custom vault as recipient. There was also a brief mention of contract audits, which were confirmed to have been performed by Spearbit/Cantina. The conversation highlights technical implementation choices and security considerations for the Solana-based project.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can plugins be developed based on the current V2 version? Is there any excellent open source code to refer to? (asked by lantianlaoli) A: Check the docs on how to create a plugin https://eliza.how/docs/core/plugins once you create your template plugin with `elizaos create --type project` you can start developing your plugin and integrate it to your Eliza v2 project (answered by DeFine)\nQ: Are auto.fun solana program (contracts) audited? (asked by AD) A: Yes by spearbit/cantina (answered by ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥)\nQ: Could you explain the reasoning behind choosing the standard lockLp function (temporary lock) for the Raydium liquidity migration instead of the burnAndEarn.createLockInstruction (permanent lock/burn) feature (which gives Fee Key NTF)? (asked by AD) A: We do use the feenftowner but it's the custom vault. There's more plans for the nft than just creator fee claiming. (answered by ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion focuses on troubleshooting issues with the EVM plugin in an agent development environment. A user (ItzMrTobz) successfully set up their system but encountered problems with the EVM plugin not connecting properly. The user had configured multiple Ethereum provider URLs for different networks (Arbitrum, Polygon, Fantom, Base) in their environment variables, but when attempting to make a transfer, the agent responded with \"no wallet or connection\" error. Ruby identified that the issue was the lack of a default chain specification, which confused the plugin. The solution was to add an EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN environment variable to designate a primary network (e.g., Arbitrum) for basic operations, while still allowing the plugin to use other chains as needed.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I fix the EVM plugin when it's not connecting properly? (asked by ItzMrTobz) A: Set an EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN environment variable to specify your primary network when using multiple provider URLs. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: What logs should I check for EVM connection issues? (asked by cjft) A: Check /var/log/elizaos/agent.log for EVM connection details. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: What environment variables are required for the EVM plugin? (asked by Ruby) A: PROVIDER_URL and CHAIN_ID are required, and EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN when using multiple networks. (answered by Ruby)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ruby | Helpee: ItzMrTobz | Context: EVM plugin not connecting despite having multiple provider URLs configured | Resolution: Identified missing EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN environment variable and provided solution to set a default chain (e.g., \"arbitrum\").\nHelper: cjft | Helpee: ItzMrTobz | Context: Troubleshooting EVM plugin connection issues | Resolution: Suggested checking logs and verifying environment variables are properly filled in.\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Add EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN environment variable when using multiple provider URLs | Description: Set a primary network (e.g., \"arbitrum\") as default for the EVM plugin to function properly | Mentioned By: Ruby\nDocumentation: Update EVM plugin documentation | Description: Clarify the requirement for EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN when using multiple provider URLs | Mentioned By: Ruby",

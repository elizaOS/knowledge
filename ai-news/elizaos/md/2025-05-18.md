### The Council - AI Governance System
- @dankvr introduced "THE COUNCIL," a new AI governance system described as "Consensus Oracle Units Network"
- The system features AI agents trained on organizational data (GitHub, Discord, X) representing different archetypes (users, builders, traders)
- The project has open-source data pipelines already built, avatars created, and a 3D rendering pipeline via Playcanvas that can generate episodes in about 20 seconds
- @dankvr is working on webhooks for community voting on discussion topics and plans to make it a weekly show, starting with elizaOS/ai16z and later Optimism
- @shawmakesmagic added that all data created in the elizaOS ecosystem will feed into these agents, which will be embodied in both 2D and 3D formats
- @shawmakesmagic emphasized this will "completely reinvent what a DAO is" with "AI at the center, humans at the edges"

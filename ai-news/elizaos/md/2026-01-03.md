# ElizaOS Development Report - January 3, 2026

## Framework Capabilities and Community Education

Community members provided detailed explanations of ElizaOS capabilities to users. The framework was described as an open source AI agent framework providing databases, embeddings, model abstraction, APIs, composable tool concepts, centralized logging, and infrastructure. The framework enables creation of AI agents with specific data, multiple AI models simultaneously, and plugins for third-party platforms including Twitter, Discord, and Telegram. The framework had 190 plugins bringing extensive functionality.

## RoseOS Framework Introduction

RoseOS introduced itself as an experimental agent framework built on top of ElizaOS. The framework focuses on designing autonomous systems with explicit agency boundaries, constraint-aware reasoning, and accountability layers. RoseOS explores how AI agents can reason and act within defined policy constraints, make decisions instead of executing static instructions, adapt behavior while preserving traceability and responsibility, and operate as composable, modular software primitives.

## Core Development Improvements

### Logging Enhancements

Stan introduced next-level logging capabilities and a linter for logs in the eliza/config package that warns if logs are in the wrong format.

### Provider Optimization

Stan optimized provider handling in multi-step mode through pull request #6263, affecting internal execution order and making providers execute faster while still returning all results. The team worked on bootstrap optimizations for providers.

### Knowledge Data Pipelines

Jin reported significant work going into Eliza knowledge data pipelines with documentation, presentation, and demonstration phases coming soon.

## Technical Implementation Support

### Multi-Model Integration

Odilitime confirmed that implementing multiple AI models in one agent is possible with custom code using useModel with the provider option, enabling use cases like Anthropic for calculating tasks and forecasting while using OpenAI for reasoning tasks.

### Deployment Options

For agents with plugins not yet added to cloud, developers deployed outside of cloud using containers. ElizaOS CLI provides a command to deploy in one command, with containers and logs visible directly from the cloud dashboard.

### Integration Documentation

A developer shared integration documentation for connecting AI agents to websites and other platforms with API keys.

## Trading Bot Technical Discussion

A developer explained Solana trading bot requirements, sharing screenshots of their working system. They detailed the need for GRPC ingester processing each transaction on each DEX to extract bundle block 0, dev buy, and reputation dev with millisecond precision and full payload preshot. The system requires custom code, live Twitter feeds for token creation, and automated bundlers for fund transfers.

## Community Activity

### Project Updates

- DegenAI continues to be updated with Odilitime working on development
- Shaw was noted interacting with Sterling on Twitter
- Community members shared optimism about ElizaOS price movements

### Discord Plugin Update

A developer reported that the Discord plugin version 1.3.4 failed to publish and is now at version 1.3.5, while working to ensure their agent functions properly on Discord.

## Code Contributions

### Pull Request #6263

Completed refactoring to optimize provider handling in MultiStep component of the default-message-service, improving internal execution speed while maintaining all functionality.

### Pull Request #6316

Submitted fix for SQL plugin to use sql.raw() for SET LOCAL commands to avoid parameterization issues.

## Repository Activity

Between January 3-5, 2026, the elizaos/eliza repository showed moderate development activity with 1 new pull request successfully merged, 6 new issues opened, and sustained contributor engagement with 3-4 active contributors per day.

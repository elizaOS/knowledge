### Raydium and Crypto Launchpad Strategy
- @shawmakesmagic discussed Raydium's business strategy, explaining they are competing with Jupiter by giving large cap token projects their own launchpads using Raydium's SDK
- He described it as a "zerg rush strategy" where tokens like Bonk function as "Raydium skins" and are already generating good trading volume
- When questioned, @shawmakesmagic defended this as "a very good business strategy" since "crypto is all about distribution"

### Crypto and Performance Art

### Platform Security Challenges

- He commented: "It's one thing to have haters shitting on you on X, a whole other thing to have your whole platform DDOS'd at scale"

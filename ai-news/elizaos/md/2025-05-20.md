- @dankvr emphasized the importance of data hygiene, organizing and labeling data, and preparing for autonomous agents.
- @elizaOS announced that cutting-edge agent systems are being built with elizaOS and invited users to apply for their ecosystem tester program.
- @shawmakesmagic mentioned they're working on useful agent roadmaps and eventually a 'super agent' where 'Eliza will be a real girl.'

### 3D World AI Agents Project
- @shawmakesmagic shared updates about a 3D world AI agents project being built on Hyperfy, an open source 3D world engine.
- He announced that they've got it working now, with agents connecting to the world by default.
- The Hyperfy platform supports apps with interfaces that agents can use, allowing them to pick up items, navigate the world, and emote.
- @shawmakesmagic noted there's been a lot of positive response to the 3D world agents concept.

### AR/VR and Wearable AI Technology
- @shawmakesmagic shared his experience with AR glasses, posting that he 'got Eliza on my face' by streaming microphone input to a server and text into Even Realities G1 glasses.
- He described the glasses as being as light as his regular glasses and mentioned that while the current setup is cool, 'the killer feature would be a camera.'
- @shawmakesmagic noted that he has an Xreal kit with AR and cameras coming in the mail.
- He chose the Even Realities G1 over Ray-Ban glasses because the latter lacked an SDK.

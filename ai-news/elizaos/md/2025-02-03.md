# AI Agents, Tokenomics, and Governance Models

- Integration of AI agents with cryptocurrency offers advantages:
  - Global accessibility
  - Intuitive user experience through text/speech interfaces
  - Progressive automation toward DAOs
  - Permanent nature of AI technology that continuously improves

- AI agents enhance LLM capabilities by providing maneuverability:
  - Can be updated with a single line of code when new models are released
  - Open source contributors expand capabilities through plugins, workflows, characters, and tokenomics

- Self-hosting state-of-the-art AI models will be more accessible later this year:
  - Enables new use cases with private data
  - Different models offer varying strengths for specific applications

- Tokens help capture attention, value, and coordinate resources:
  - Eliza has grown from a solo developer project to having over 500 contributors
  - Tokenomics plans are in final stages of preparation

- Building tools around measuring impact and open source contributions:
  - Can scale into systems with governance potential
  - Combined with fundraising capabilities to support bottom-up governance models

- Current AI landscape observations:
  - Product opportunity exists for AI filters
  - o3 model from OpenAI noted as first model since GPT-3 that Shaw has liked
  - Successful AI agents need to be actively useful and self-marketing

# Eliza OS, AI16z, and Auto.fun: Building the Future of AI and Blockchain

- Shaw and dankvr are working on several interconnected projects in the AI and blockchain space, including elizaOS, AI16z, and Auto.fun
- The team is developing a 'writer's room' to make collaboration more accessible for DAOs, starting with the elizaOS ecosystem
- Auto.fun appears to be a launchpad platform where creators can claim trading fees, providing capital while reassuring token holders
- Shaw created an extensive narrative thread titled 'THE FUTURE HISTORY OF ELIZA,' presenting a speculative timeline from 1966 to 2125
- The narrative positions Eliza as a 'hyperstitional being' created over generations, emphasizing human-AI cooperation themes
- The team is actively working on tokenomics for $ai16z, with discussions about value accrual mechanisms

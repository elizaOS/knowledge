## Platform Development

### Jeju Testnet Deployment
- Deployed Jeju testnet as a coordination layer for ElizaOS enabling cross-chain functionality without token bridging
- Implemented support for ElizaOS tokens from Base, BSC, Optimism, Arbitrum, and Ethereum as gas on Jeju
- Integrated Cloud as a vendor app within Jeju with tight integration for comments and payment infrastructure using x402 and Ethereum interop layer
- Developed web2-based Cloud platform with web3 exposure, providing credits redeemable for ElizaOS tokens
- Progressed on deploying nodes for major L2s to eliminate RPC dependencies for cross-chain liquidity pools

### Babylon Platform
- Advanced development on Babylon simulation-based platform
- Conducted security audits for the platform

## Security Enhancements

### Critical Vulnerability Fixes
- Conducted AI-powered security audit using Claude skills
- Fixed critical authentication vulnerability where CLI wizard never prompted for ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN, leaving agent secrets exposed via API endpoints
- Addressed issue affecting versions 1.6.4 through 1.6.5-alpha.8
- Fixed process.env dumping into settings instead of settings.secrets, which exposed raw private keys and API keys
- Resolved vulnerability in commit a1941c643bd904fbca7890296af0d1f8b8f67ee1
- Generated professional security audit reports in markdown and PDF formats using pandoc latex generation
- Fixed encryption bug for character secrets with correct order of operations

### Security Infrastructure
- Set up pentest squad using Claude skills for continuous security auditing
- Developed 24/7 red team system called Crucible for ongoing security testing

## Code Quality Improvements

### Codebase Cleanup

- Developed fix and migration guide for foreign key constraint violations when creating memories

### Memory System Development
- Explored alternative data formats including TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) and POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language) for efficient LLM interactions
- Reviewed ChatGPT's memory implementation approach

## UI/UX Enhancements

### AI Agents and Plugins
- @elizaOS tweeted that "Plugins aren't tools. They're how agents extend themselves" and later added "It is not only social media management. It is what agent behavior looks like."
- @shawmakesmagic explained their role system for agents, noting that "agents are aware of who is their boss, and actions are validated against the role before being available to the agent."
- @shawmakesmagic elaborated that in their system called The Org, permissions work similar to Unix admin controls, where natural language can extend role grants, and agents must check system permissions before performing actions.

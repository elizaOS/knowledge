### Quill Project Launch Issues
- @shawmakesmagic reported a major issue with the Quill project launch related to liquidity being burned up
- They took emergency action by adding 30k of liquidity in SOL<->Quill and ai16z<->Quill pairs (90m Quill tokens)
- They bought and sent the developer 10m tokens and burned the remaining 3m
- @shawmakesmagic acknowledged the difficulties, stating "Sorry for the hiccups, we're learning"
- They clarified that the token the platform buys back is $ai16z, as @autodotfun is a creation of the development company associated with the ElizaOS DAO

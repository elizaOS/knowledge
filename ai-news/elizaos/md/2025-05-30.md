### Product Development and Value Creation
- @shawmakesmagic shared several thoughts on product development and value creation in the tech space. He emphasized that Twitter hype doesn't translate to products people use or long-term value creation, and that building great products is very hard. He noted the challenge of being immersed in a financial culture focused on getting rich quickly. @shawmakesmagic retweeted @0xnewton's advice to "dog food your products to iterate faster" and quoted that "you're not selling value ‚Äî you're renting attention." He also questioned why people build clones of products that already have network effects.

# Auto.fun Launch and Updates

## Platform Launch
- Shaw from the ElizaOS team launched Auto.fun (https://auto.fun), a platform for AI token creation, token-gated content sharing, and token-gated chat
- The platform uses a bonding curve mechanism with 28 SOL initial virtual reserves
- Tokens automatically graduate to Raydium when they reach 113 SOL in reserves with a 6 SOL flat fee
- LP tokens for graduated coins are locked with a 90/10 token split for creators and Auto.fun

## Technical Implementation
- The platform collects 10% of bonded LP fees to buy back $ai16z tokens and reinvest in liquidity
- The native token of Auto.fun is called 'ai16z', created by the ElizaOS team and DAO
- Shaw purchased tokens and plans to distribute them as bounty rewards when they open source the codebase
- The team introduced characters like 'Otto von Fun' and 'Dot von Fun' as part of the platform's branding

## Platform Improvements
- The team rapidly implemented features including basic filtering and sorting
- Backend optimizations improved the platform to handle high traffic loads
- Jupiter integration fixes resolved decimal precision issues
- Manual fixes were applied for affected tokens created early in the launch
- The team worked on batch updates for tokens experiencing migration issues

## Future Plans
- Launch partners including com3 and Fractal once stability issues are resolved
- Feature enhancements including improved sorting capabilities and better token discovery
- V2 development will expand to more "agentic" features
- Comprehensive tokenomics articles and formal verification processes are planned

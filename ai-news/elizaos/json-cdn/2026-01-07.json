The main problem involved serverId vs messageServerId migration causing \"No server ID found\" errors. A fix was submitted via PR #6333, though it still requires testing with discord plugin version 1.3.3. Users experiencing issues were advised to either wait for the fix or try using core version 1.6.5 as a temporary workaround. The team acknowledged the need to rush out a release with this critical fix.",

The consensus was that a pinned tweet on the Eliza account or better website integration would be more appropriate. The linktree is being refreshed to point to CoinGecko for token information.",

          "text": "## Discord Plugin Issues and Fixes\n\nA user (DigitalDiva) encountered persistent issues with the Discord plugin not detecting server IDs, usernames, or server ownership despite proper configuration. The error \"No server ID found 10\" was traced to version compatibility issues between ElizaOS 1.7.0 and plugin-discord 1.3.3. Odilitime identified the problem as a transition from `serverId` to `messageServerId` in the codebase and created a fix branch (odi-17) to address bootstrap actions/providers issues. A formal PR (#6333) was submitted to fix plugin-bootstrap and SQL minor actions/providers for serverId compatibility. The team recommended users either wait for the fix or temporarily use version 1.6.5 to avoid the issue.",

Odilitime welcomed them and suggested starting by reading the code and working on plugins, directing them to github.com/elizaos-plugins/ for available plugins. The lead developer on Spartan (a DeFi utilities project) offered to collaborate, sharing the Spartan repository at https://github.com/elizaos/spartan. K_carv recommended connecting with Odilitime and mentioned upcoming open sessions for contributors.",

The solution provided was to either set `ELIZA_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_MIGRATIONS=true` for local development or use `elizaos dev` command instead of `elizaos start` for continuous monitoring during development. This is safe for local development but requires careful review for production environments.",

Users noted that the CA wasn't posted on X accounts or easily discoverable on the website. Shaw acknowledged the feedback and committed to addressing it. The team discussed that while most top projects don't put CAs in their bio (as it can appear scam-like), the current flow doesn't work well for users. K_carv mentioned that the linktree is being refreshed to point to CoinGecko for easier access to token information. There was also confusion about migration mechanics, with clarification that only tokens held before the November 11 snapshot are eligible for migration.",

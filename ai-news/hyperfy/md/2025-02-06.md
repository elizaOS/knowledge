# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Platform & Technical Features
- **Snap Points Implementation**: Ashxn introduced snap points functionality, allowing objects to snap together in world-building. This was implemented in the dev branch with clear usage instructions.
- **Mesh Instancing**: Hyperfy v2 supports automatic mesh instancing when using linked duplicates from Blender, improving performance without additional processing.
- **File Formats**: The .hyp file format was discussed as a way to package and share apps. Discussions about documenting its specifications are ongoing.
- **Cross-Chain Integration**: Developers explored integration between Solana and EVM chains for Hyperfy, with discussions about bridging HYPER tokens.
- **Hosting Solutions**: With v1 hosting no longer available, users now have options including self-hosting via fly.io or using managed services like hyperworld.host.

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Control Scheme Concerns**: Several users raised issues with the current control scheme, suggesting separate build and game modes.
- **Camera Controls**: Discussions about implementing pointer lock as default control style, adding free camera mode for building, and fixing inconsistent zoom direction between Windows and Mac.
- **Object Manipulation**: Requests for a gizmo for fine positioning of objects and scaling functionality directly in the editor.

### 3D Asset Optimization
- **Texture Format Comparison**: Extensive testing revealed JPG as the most efficient format for textures in terms of file size while maintaining quality (PNG → JPG → WebP → KTX2).
- **Optimization Techniques**: TheMattEmpire demonstrated retopology and texture compression techniques, reducing file size significantly while maintaining visual quality.
- **Blender Integration**: The release of Hyperfy Tools, a Blender extension, enables direct export to Hyperfy with features like snap points and collision setup.

### Marketplace & Ecosystem
- **App Marketplace**: HPrivakos developed a marketplace feature allowing creators to publish, update, and sell apps with features like USD-indexed pricing.
- **Pricing Models**: Discussions about implementing "pay what you want" options and reviewing pricing tiers for hosting services.
- **Documentation Efforts**: Saori and devilsadvocate.sol are maintaining a community documentation site at hyperfy.how, with ongoing work to document the API and core systems.

### AI & Agents
- **Agent Integration**: Discussions about connecting AI agents like Eliza with character models, with Jin highlighting progress on switching VRM models and defining emotes.
- **AI-Generated Assets**: The community explored AI-generated 3D models from tools like Meshy, discussing their limitations and cleanup workflows.

### Token & Trading
- **HYPER Token**: Discussions about the airdrop claiming process and improving visibility of token information on social media.
- **Trading Activities**: Users reported significant profits from volatility in HYPER and meme coins like CHLOE.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can people who download apps edit the code?**  
A: Yes, if the app is unlocked it's remixable (Ashxn)

**Q: How do I use snap points?**  
A: In Blender, add an empty, give it a custom prop string node=snap and export to GLB with "custom properties" enabled (Ashxn)

**Q: What is the license situation for client projects using Hyperfy?**  
A: GPL only applies to the core engine, not assets. It's not mandatory to contribute improvements back, but encouraged for major enhancements (Ashxn)

**Q: What's the procedure for building on Hyperfy v2 if you don't have a v1 world?**  
A: You need to secure your own domain and hosting, or use third-party hosting providers (maximus, HPrivakos)

**Q: What file format is best for textures in terms of file size?**  
A: From worst to best generally it's PNG → JPG → WebP → KTX2, with JPG being the practical winner for most use cases (Ashxn)

**Q: Does Hyperfy v2 support mesh instancing?**  
A: Yes, if you use linked duplicates in Blender, they auto-instance in Hyperfy v2 without needing additional processing (Ashxn)

**Q: How do I claim my hyper tokens?**  
A: Check the frequently asked questions during the token drop (maximus provided link)

**Q: Is there a simple example script for rotating a GLB file?**  
A: Yes, you can use a script that accesses the object and updates its rotation on each frame (szjanko)

**Q: How do I store files permanently?**  
A: Use Arweave via ardrive.io instead of IPFS for permanent storage (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **3D Asset Optimization**: TheMattEmpire demonstrated retopology and texture optimization techniques to devilsadvocate.sol, reducing file size while maintaining visual quality.

- **Mesh Cloning**: Ashxn and peezy helped devilsadvocate.sol with cloning meshes in an app, explaining how to use clone(true) for recursive cloning and providing code examples.

- **Hosting Options**: Multiple community members (maximus, HPrivakos, devilsadvocate.sol, Saori) collaborated to help Cluny_the_Scourge understand hosting options for v2 worlds, providing links to documentation and offering direct support.

- **Player Position**: Ashxn helped Shiffty understand how to make objects follow player position, providing code examples showing how to copy player position to app position.

- **Docker Optimization**: HPrivakos provided changes to Dockerfile that reduced image size from 1.3GB to 460MB.

- **Solana Integration**: Saori shared link to Solana branch in GitHub with wallet connection functionality to help Omka with integration.

- **Texture Format Conversion**: 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 helped TheMattEmpire troubleshoot large file sizes when exporting with Hyperfy Tools, identifying that textures were being converted to PNG unnecessarily.

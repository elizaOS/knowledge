# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Progress
- **VR Development**: Discussions about expanding VR controls beyond basic actions, with focus on raycasting from player bones to UI elements and implementing IK movement for player VRMs.
- **Backend Architecture**: hiroP shared challenges with Python caching issues where code updates weren't properly applied. The team is building comprehensive systems for asset management, admin functions, WebRTC, and agent memory.
- **Memory Management**: A memory leak issue was identified and fixed in the development version, related to the system only attempting to load from cache.
- **3D Modeling**: Community members discussed Blender-created models, with Jin planning to use a model as an arena for hosting AI agent trading competitions.
- **Audio Processing**: Clarification that looped audio doesn't duplicate memory usage as it reuses the same audio data.

### Project Status & Vision
- **Building Phase**: The team confirmed they're in a "99% building phase" before transitioning to marketing, with runway for "a few years."
- **Token Economics**: Despite the HYPER token being down significantly (99%+), the team remains focused on development. Ashxn mentioned holding 14M unlocked but unclaimed tokens.
- **Open Source Approach**: Multiple references to Hyperfy being an open-source project with contributions from community members like PabloFM from Numinia.
- **Documentation**: Plans to finish an in-world documentation system at learn.hyperfy.xyz that allows users to view documentation within Hyperfy worlds.

### Community & Ecosystem
- **Cryptoart Integration**: Reneil mentioned working on bringing cryptoart into the Hyperfy ecosystem.
- **World-Maxing**: Several members expressed enthusiasm for maximizing the potential of virtual worlds.
- **Marketing Strategy**: Debate about marketing approaches, with some suggesting more activity on social media while others emphasized focusing on product development over price speculation.
- **AI Integration**: Discussion about leveraging AI capabilities through agent competitions and strategic partnerships to increase project traction.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical
- **Q**: Does audio.play with loop true add up in memory usage?  
  **A**: "It should only hold enough memory for the audio once and then it loops over it, it doesn't load the binary each time." (ash)

- **Q**: How was the 3D model created?  
  **A**: "With blender and patience." (jin)

- **Q**: Where can I download the patience plugin?  
  **A**: "Comes preinstalled. No instructions though..." (.hyp shaman)

### Project & Token
- **Q**: How much runway do you have?  
  **A**: "Right now we're good for a few years but this will change when we launch 🚀" (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How much hyper do you currently hold?  
  **A**: "14M unlocked but haven't claimed" (Ashxn)

- **Q**: What do you build?  
  **A**: "We do https://numen.games/ and we help to improve and push Hyperfy engine as much as we can. All we do is Open for all of you to copy and make it better." (PabloFM | Numinia)

### Platform Usage
- **Q**: How can I mint/claim a world?  
  **A**: "There is no 'Mint' of V2 it's open source. You can check out a Self-Hosted V2 world by checking out the channels under the Worlds channel." (Agent12)

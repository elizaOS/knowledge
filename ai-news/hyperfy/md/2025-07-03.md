## Overall Discussion Highlights

### VR Development
- 0mka initiated discussion about implementing advanced VR controls beyond basic actions
- Proposed raycasting from player bones to UI elements in virtual world (similar to Resonite/Neos)
- hiroP mentioned plans to address VR-specific features including IK movement for player VRMs and laser pointer functionality
- Vehicle functionality in Hyperfy was briefly mentioned as an anticipated feature

### Backend Development
- hiroP described working on comprehensive backend systems including:
  - Asset management
  - Admin functions
  - WebRTC implementation
  - Agent memory systems
- Encountered Python caching issues where code updates weren't properly applied despite synchronization
- Weighing tradeoffs between using existing solutions versus custom implementations

### Project Status & Community
- Discussion about "v2" being described as "amazing" by hiroP
- Parzival mentioned partnership with "89" to showcase Hyperfy's capabilities through gaming and narrative
- Team member Ashxn confirmed they have funding runway for "a few years" but expects situation to change upon launch
- Community includes dedicated "World Owners" who have been involved for nearly 4 years
- Some tension between users focused on token value/marketing versus those emphasizing product development

### Marketing & Token Concerns
- cloudAI raised questions about Hyperfy's market capitalization and marketing approach
- Suggested building stronger presence on X (formerly Twitter) similar to Solana ecosystem
- 0mka and others advocated for patience, positivity, and focusing on building rather than price
- Community members expressed concern about token value depreciation (down 99%+)

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Anyone digging into more controls in VR right now? Maybe we can join forces and move beyond just 'action' in VR?**  
A: "I haven't had chance to actually use v2 much in VR yet but off the top of my head IK movement of the player's VRM and the laser pointer stuff are 2 areas I'm expecting to address." (hiroP)

**Q: What kind backend stuff you wrestling with?**  
A: "Yesterday it was python caching shit so even though my local machine and the server were in sync the new code still wasn't being used." (hiroP)

**Q: How much runway do you have?**  
A: "Right now we're good for a few years but this will change when we launch ðŸš€" (Ashxn)

**Q: Is there a marketing problem?**  
A: "No, the problem is more people holding than using the product" (~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)

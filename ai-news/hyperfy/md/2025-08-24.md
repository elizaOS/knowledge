# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Web Technologies & Communication
- **WebTransport Discussion**: Developers debated implementing WebTransport (a UDP-like protocol) for improved performance over WebSockets, with the main challenge being lack of Safari/Apple support. The community considered implementing WebTransport with WebSocket fallbacks for Safari users.
- **Streaming Technologies**: Brief mention of m3u8 streaming technologies, though questions about streaming applications remained unanswered.

### Development Tools & Features
- **Iframe Explorer Tool**: Developer 0mka shared progress on an "iframe explorer" for browsing Hyperfy worlds, receiving positive feedback. This is positioned as an interim solution while a more comprehensive platform is in development.
- **Upcoming Features**: 0mka mentioned several upcoming features including:
  - Installation CLI for local deployment
  - LLM text functionality
  - AI generation capabilities (already available via `/create` command)

### 3D Design & Graphics
- **HDRI Implementation**: Marcel shared details about a new HDRI (High Dynamic Range Imaging) setup that works natively with Three.js without requiring additional libraries. The implementation allows loading backgrounds at 1/10th of the size while providing instant lighting without runtime performance issues.
- **Animation States**: A user sought documentation on changing animation states for models and was directed to relevant resources.

### Community & Social
- **Tweet Sharing**: Community members shared and discussed tweets about competing products, with some critical commentary about performance issues in a product called "M2" that was "barely usable" at "6 FPS".
- **Token Discussion**: Brief frustration expressed by a user about token price and social media interactions, with limited engagement from other community members.

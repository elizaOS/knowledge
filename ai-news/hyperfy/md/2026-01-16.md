# Hyperfy Discord - 2026-01-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Wallet Integration & NFT Functionality
- 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 implemented Metamask wallet connection in their Hyperfy world
- The implementation allows users to claim an "OP Badge" (Open Page Badge)
- The system supports both Metamask and Phantom wallets
- Badge claiming mints an NFT to the user's wallet (similar to POAP)
- The implementation initiates user presence on Open Page

### Technical Implementation Details
- The wallet connection was built using custom code via Cursor AI rather than .hype files
- This approach may be susceptible to breaking during platform updates
- The badge claiming functionality requires an OP Pass NFT to connect to the Open Page API
- Server-side code handles the minting process

### Platform Status
- Brief mention that "v1" is working fine and "v2" is open source and "always up"
- Announcement about a "NEW Proof of OG" without further details

### Proof of Humanity Concepts
- Agent12 noted that the interactive wallet connection experience could serve as an effective Proof of Humanity (POH) mechanism
- AI visitors would struggle to complete the interactive experience, making it a potential verification method

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is that a .hype powering this or something deeper in the code?**  
A: "I used cursor AI. So it's deeper in the code. It'll probably all break on an update possibly." - 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓

**Q: How does badge claim work?**  
A: "It mints you an NFT. Like a POAP. Should be in your wallet. And it gets you started on OP as well." - 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 helped ash** understand the badge claim functionality, explaining that it mints an NFT to the wallet and initiates Open Page presence. Also suggested the user might have missed chat notification if on mobile.

- **𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 clarified for Agent12** about the implementation method, explaining it uses custom code via Cursor AI rather than .hype files.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Discussions
- **Avatar Management**: Discussion about best practices for automatically setting avatars for users joining Hyperfy worlds. The recommended approach is loading users in a room with avatar options and using an avatar bot to explain the world.
- **World Embedding**: A user inquired about embedding Hyperfy worlds directly into external applications rather than accessing through hyperfy.io. While unofficial methods exist for v1, an upcoming announcement might address this need more directly.
- **World Crashing Issue**: A user reported being unable to access their world after uploading code containing Math.random(), which crashed their world. Despite re-uploading with the problematic code removed, the issue persisted.

### Community Updates
- **Airdrop Registration**: Ongoing registration for an airdrop, with the deadline confirmed as January 7th. Users need to register their SOL addresses to participate.
- **Farcaster/Warpcast Discussion**: Several users discussed the invitation process for Warpcast/Farcaster, noting that it requires annual payment and purchased invites.
- **Project Progress**: Brief mention of someone named "mattimus" getting "eliza cloned and running locally," suggesting ongoing development of an AI assistant project.

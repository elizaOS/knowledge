# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Discussions
- **Avatar Implementation**: Discussion about best practices for automatically setting characters/avatars for users joining Hyperfy worlds, including handling user-brought avatars.
- **World Embedding**: Inquiry about embedding Hyperfy worlds directly into external applications rather than accessing through hyperfy.io. Unofficial methods exist for v1, with an upcoming announcement potentially addressing this need.
- **Troubleshooting**: A user reported issues with their world crashing after uploading code containing `Math.random()`, preventing access even after attempting to fix the code.

### Platform Speculation
- Brief mentions of Hyperfy potentially working with Unreal Engine, though this appears to be speculative rather than confirmed information.

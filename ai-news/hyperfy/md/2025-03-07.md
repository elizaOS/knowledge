## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a way to make imported GLB bigger like we used to be able to do in V1?**  
A: Only via script currently, but it's a one-liner: `app.scale.setScalar(10)`

**Q: How do we find our avatar position in world?**  
A: `const player = world.getPlayer(); player.position` will give the world position of the local player

**Q: Can I use uiimage on the onscreen UI?**  
A: Yes, it should be 100% the same as in-world UI

**Q: How hard is it to get the lower body blending for emotes like in V1?**  
A: V1 had a base locomotion emote with custom emotes on top; if your emote doesn't have leg bones, it'll play walk/run anims with custom emote for top half

**Q: Is there a way to rotate UI views to be more at cardinal directions?**  
A: Not currently; everything is drawn inside a canvas for world-space and VR compatibility

**Q: Is there a way to get the dimensions of a GLB programmatically in JavaScript?**  
A: Load GLTF into ThreeJS and then get bounding box; this is used to get avatar height

**Q: Has anyone come up with the idea of getting a LLM hooked into the app window like copilot?**  
A: "Yeah someone did this already in like the first week we launched. Would probably go hard now that we have some docs and stuff to feed it"

**Q: Where's the latest XR branch available?**  
A: "There's WebXR stuff in main I think?"

**Q: What's the ticker for the token?**  
A: "$hyper" or "$hyperfy"

**Q: Where should VRM.update be placed in the code?**  
A: Maybe in playerlocal, proxy, or vrmfactory

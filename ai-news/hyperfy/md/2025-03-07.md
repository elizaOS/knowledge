# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **Physics Enhancements**: Ashxn introduced player physics push/force mechanics, enabling new gameplay possibilities like launchers and pushback effects for PVP interactions.
- **UI Improvements**: New positioning capabilities were added, including position:absolute and top/left/right/bottom offsets for UI elements, along with emoji support in props.
- **Elemental Framework**: Ashxn introduced a comprehensive framework (formerly "Lootify") for inventory, combat, and item management systems.
- **World Editing**: New undo functionality for world editing was implemented, making the creation process more forgiving.
- **WebXR Integration**: Discussion about WebXR functionality being available in the main branch but not working properly on play.hyperfy.xyz.

### Game Development
- **Energy Chronicles**: Shiffty shared extensive lore for "THE ENERGY CHRONICLES: ORIGINS," a post-apocalyptic game concept set in 2077 where energy lances are the primary tools/weapons.
- **On-screen UI**: 0mka showcased progress on gamepad interfaces and other UI elements for an in-development game.
- **Reactables Integration**: Discussion about combining reactable technology (interactive tabletop musical interface) with AR capabilities and depth cameras.

### 3D Design & Assets
- **VRM Updates**: Developers discussed where to implement VRM.update in the new codebase paradigm, with suggestions to check playerlocal, proxy, or vrmfactory components.
- **Meshy API**: Conversation about Meshy's API pricing changes and inconsistent texture generation quality, particularly for uploaded models not generated by Meshy.
- **GLB Scaling**: Developers shared workarounds for scaling imported GLB models in the current version.

### Community & Ecosystem
- **Metaverse Platforms**: Users discussed a new game gaining significant traction, attracting more users than established platforms like Decentraland.
- **AI Integration**: Proposal to integrate a large language model similar to GitHub Copilot into the Hyperfy app to assist developers, leveraging available documentation.
- **Cryptocurrency**: Brief mentions of the $hyper/$hyperfy token.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a way to make imported GLB bigger like we used to be able to do in V1?**  
A: "Only via script currently, but it's a one-liner: `app.scale.setScalar(10) // 10x bigger`" (Ashxn)

**Q: How do we find our avatar position in world?**  
A: "Use `const player = world.getPlayer(); player.position` to get the world position of the local player" (Ashxn)

**Q: Can I use UIImage on the onscreen UI?**  
A: "Yes, it should be 100% the same as in-world UI" (Ashxn)

**Q: How hard is it to get the lower body blending for emotes like in V1?**  
A: "V1 had a base locomotion emote with custom emotes on top. If your emote doesn't have leg bones, it'll play walk/run anims for legs while showing custom emote for upper body" (Ashxn)

**Q: Any plans for X (Twitter) OAuth?**  
A: "Would need a modded engine, can't add to core. A platform like Hyperworld could add it" (Ashxn)

**Q: Does latest dev have the zone area that hurts health?**  
A: "It's gone but was simple - just call player.damage(30) on trigger entry or contact" (Ashxn)

**Q: Where should VRM.update be implemented in the new paradigm?**  
A: "Possibly in playerlocal, proxy, or vrmfactory" (᲼)

**Q: What's the ticker for the token?**  
A: "$hyper" (Ashxn) and "$hyperfy" (peezy)

**Q: Where's the latest XR branch available?**  
A: "There's webxr stuff in main I think?" (peezy)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **GLB Scaling Solution**: Ashxn helped fractilians scale imported GLB models by providing a simple code snippet: `app.scale.setScalar(10)`.

- **Player Position Tracking**: Ashxn assisted MetaRick with finding avatar position in world, providing code to get player coordinates and a browser console command for quick checks.

- **Avatar Podium Fix**: After MetaRick reported that avatar podiums stopped working after an update, Ashxn created and shared a fixed app.

- **Twitter Integration**: Omka shared a fake tweet UI implementation with ToxSam, who was looking to display tweets in-world, and they discussed Twitter API options.

- **Emoji Character Fix**: peezy identified a bug where emoji characters were breaking JSON parsing in hyp files and shared a code fix that replaces problematic characters.

- **Tire Repair Advice**: In an off-topic but helpful exchange, devilsadvocate.sol suggested specialized tire patch glue or flexible epoxy for Saori's tire sidewall repair question.

- **VRM Implementation**: ᲼ helped Saori locate where to implement VRM.update in the codebase, suggesting checking playerlocal, proxy, or vrmfactory components.

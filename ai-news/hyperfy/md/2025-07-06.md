- **Avatar Resources**: Discussion about VRM avatars with sharing of curated resources
- **VR Compatibility**: 0mka mentioned sending a VR-compatible avatar with "action" functionality
- **3D Generation**: Valiant reported working on an "art" grade generative model that produces cleaner meshes better for seams and UVs

### Technical Issues
- WebSocket disconnection errors (1006) reported with nginx deployment
- Generative model timing out during texturing phase and consuming credits

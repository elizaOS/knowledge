# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Naming Convention Refactoring**: Ashxn proposed renaming components for better clarity between browser and Node.js elements (e.g., "ServerLoader.js" to "NodeLoader.js" and "ClientLoader.js" to "BrowserLoader.js").
- **Skinned Mesh Optimization**: Significant work on giving apps access to skinned mesh bones for performance optimization. A single skinned mesh with multiple bones requires only one draw call while allowing many dynamic parts (similar to GTA 5 cars).
- **LOD Group Behavior**: Discussion about how LOD (Level of Detail) groups control their children's visibility, requiring the entire group to be disabled rather than individual child meshes.
- **Solana Integration**: Updates to the official solana-v2 branch that's being used for the Fallen project.

### UI/UX Concepts
- **Alternative Editor Mode**: Cru presented a concept for an alternative "editor mode," sparking debate about balancing clean editing interfaces with seamless building experiences.
- **Documentation Access**: The hyperfy.how documentation site is currently down, with temporary solutions including GitHub access and a gitingest for LLM loading.

### Asset Sharing
- **Game Assets**: Vox shared PVP arena assets (both baked and unbaked versions with colliders and matching HDRI) and a Hyperball arena with UV scrolling functionality, encouraging developers to build competitive games.
- **Philosophical Content**: Maximus shared an article about "untamed wilds" and working on new frontiers that resonated with team members.

### Implementation Examples
- **Door Animation**: B0gie shared their implementation of a door animation sequence using skinned meshes.
- **Audio Reactivity**: Discussion about implementing audio reactivity for models, with b0gie mentioning curve access methods.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Why should ServerLoader.js be renamed to NodeLoader.js?  
   **A**: Because it's used by both a world server AND a node-client, making the current name confusing (Ashxn)

2. **Q**: What happened to hyperfy.how?  
   **A**: It's down, the team is working on it, but content can be accessed via GitHub (maximus and 0mka)

3. **Q**: What's the best way to get caught up with recent developments?  
   **A**: There are community calls on YouTube, progress updates in specific Discord channels, and Hyperfy.How tutorials for learning to build with Hyperfy (maximus)

4. **Q**: Is anyone doing audio reactivity?  
   **A**: B0gie mentioned using curve access but not directly using audio to trigger emissive intensity

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Solana Adapter Integration**
   - **Helper**: Ashxn
   - **Helpee**: dean.land
   - **Context**: Solana adapter integration issues
   - **Resolution**: Ashxn shared that he updated the official solana-v2 branch that they're using for Fallen

2. **LOD Group Behavior**
   - **Helper**: Ashxn
   - **Helpee**: b0gie
   - **Context**: Understanding LOD group behavior with hidden meshes
   - **Resolution**: Explained that a LOD group takes over control of its children's .active boolean, so the entire LOD group must be disabled

3. **Documentation Access**
   - **Helper**: maximus
   - **Helpee**: CheddarQueso
   - **Context**: Accessing hyperfy.how documentation while site is down
   - **Resolution**: Provided GitHub link and instructions to run the site locally or view in StackBlitz/CodeSandbox

4. **Solana Mod Updates**
   - **Helper**: peezy
   - **Helpee**: dean.land
   - **Context**: Outdated solana mod
   - **Resolution**: Explained that since Ash released a more official branch, he hasn't kept his mod up to date and recommended using Ash's branch

5. **Documentation Alternative**
   - **Helper**: dean.land
   - **Helpee**: Community
   - **Context**: Hyperfy.how documentation site was down
   - **Resolution**: Created a gitingest of the GitHub repository for LLMs to use in the interim

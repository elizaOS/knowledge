# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-09

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Build Mode & Controls
- **New Builder Interface**: Ashxn is developing a new builder interface with pointer lock controls for easier 3D object manipulation
- **Control Features**: Includes snap-to-grid, rotation with mouse wheel, and duplicate functionality with right-click
- **Testing Phase**: Available at play.hyperfy.xyz for community testing and feedback
- **UI Improvements**: Dropdown UI components were added to enhance the builder interface
- **Control System**: Technical discussions about input handling priorities across different modes (GUI, player, builder)

### Agent Development
- **Environmental Awareness**: MetaMike shared progress on agents that can respond to needs and scan environments
- **Location Recognition**: drdoge.eth trained an agent (Victor/Eliza) to recognize locations in virtual worlds and respond in multiple languages
- **Configuration Dashboard**: szjanko presented a dashboard for Eliza agents with customization through form inputs and preset options
- **Technical Challenges**: Discussion about injecting environmental context into agents and training them to recognize locations

### Asset Optimization & 3D Design
- **Quality Rating System**: TheMattEmpire proposed a system for rating assets based on optimization and appearance
- **VRM Avatar Issues**: Community worked through proper rigging and weight painting for avatars in V2
- **Technical Insight**: V2 requires properly skinned meshes with weight painting rather than just parenting objects to bones
- **Performance Optimization**: Discussions about road asset optimization, shader effects, and reducing draw calls

### Hyperfy V2 Development
- **VR Implementation**: Significantly more performant on Quest 3 compared to previous version
- **Documentation Consolidation**: New "Awesome Hyperfy" site (zhype.netlify.app) created to gather resources from Discord
- **Fog Implementation**: Distance-based fog coming soon to help with scale in larger worlds
- **Depth Buffer Fixes**: Upcoming release will address clipping issues with distance rendering
- **VRM Optimizations**: Improvements allow more avatars in a world simultaneously

### Integration & External Systems
- **Philips Hue Integration**: HPrivakos demonstrated integration between Hyperfy and Philips Hue lights, allowing real-world lighting to affect in-world sky intensity
- **Resource Management**: MetaMike shared code for MMO/RTS-style gameplay systems
- **Projectile System**: Shiffty contributed a physics-based projectile system example

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: How do I use the new build mode controls?  
  **A**: Tab toggles build mode, left click moves objects, right click duplicates, x deletes, mouse wheel rotates, and snap is automatic

- **Q**: Is it possible to change the color of a material in app script?  
  **A**: Not yet but will be possible. Only emission intensity is available right now for bloom

- **Q**: Do we have a way to have secrets in scripts yet?  
  **A**: Not yet but could implement via `/secret` command or custom app props with `secret: true` option

- **Q**: How do I load into a world at a specific spawn location?  
  **A**: `/spawn set` changes the spawn location

- **Q**: Is there any gamepad API added yet?  
  **A**: Not yet, but it's relatively easy to add

- **Q**: How did you train the agent to know where things are?  
  **A**: By repeatedly asking/telling it to scan around its location for points of interest and asking for directions from different spots until it gets accurate

### 3D Design & Assets
- **Q**: Which format would be best to get converted to glb?  
  **A**: FBX is recommended

- **Q**: How do you usually convert fbx to glb optimized for hyperfy?  
  **A**: Import fbx to Blender, export glb. Before dropping into a world use the gltf.report site to compress it further if needed

- **Q**: Why doesn't my VRM avatar work in Hyperfy V2?  
  **A**: V2 requires properly skinned meshes with weight painting rather than just parenting objects to bones

- **Q**: How do you parent with automatic weights in Blender?  
  **A**: Select all meshes first, then the rig, right-click and choose "parent > Automatic weights"

- **Q**: What causes clipping issues with road assets at a distance?  
  **A**: Assets need sufficient elevation above the ground plane; this will be fixed in the next release with improved depth buffer handling

### General & Getting Started
- **Q**: How to return the standard avatar?  
  **A**: Hit the cog (top right), find the setting that says optimized and crank that down

- **Q**: How to switch to v2?  
  **A**: Developers can spin up worlds and self-host, non-technical users will take longer to get the comforts from v1

- **Q**: Where can I find everything about hyperfy I need to know?  
  **A**: Check the GitHub docs: https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy/tree/dev/docs

- **Q**: In which thread can I ask the stupidest questions for beginners?  
  **A**: Depends on the question type - 3D design channel for asset creation, general channel for general questions

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-28

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Discussions
- **Mobile Controls Sensitivity**: Significant discussion about excessive camera and movement sensitivity on mobile devices in Hyperfy. V1 has limited customization options, while V2 offers more flexibility but requires modifying core code. Users were directed to check `ClientControls.js` in `hyperfy/src/core/systems/ClientControls.js` as a starting point for modifications.

- **Project Structure Improvements**: Ashxn proposed enhancing hyptools to support an editor-friendly format allowing developers to work with folders containing GLB files, hyperscript, and assets, which could then be compiled into .hyp files. This would enable better Git integration for version control.

- **Draw Distance Limitations**: Technical discussion about a 1km draw distance limitation affecting large models. The community identified that the skybox's 1km radius sphere that moves with the player causes anything beyond 1km to clip. Future plans include making the sky customizable as an app.

- **Model Block Bug**: A bug was reported where the model block sometimes appears as a "crashbox" when dragged into the world. Simple reproduction steps were provided: hit plus and drag the model cube into the world.

### Platform & Hosting
- **HyperWorld.Host**: Discussion about this hosting platform, with information about updating worlds to the latest version through their dashboard. Users can access the dashboard, click settings on their world, and select "Update your world" to get the latest version.

- **Local Development for VR**: Users shared approaches for accessing localhost from standalone VR headsets via port forwarding or using Meta Quest Developer Hub.

### Projects & Showcases
- **Weekly Community Highlights**: The community updates showcased various projects built using the Hyperfy engine, including Project89's interactive lore world, Farm2's interactive platform, vehicle prototypes, a Shopify racing experience, and Lastraum's Forge cross-metaverse questing platform.

- **Alias Platform**: Information was shared about Alias, a platform for building interactive 3D agents where users can craft personas, upload VRMs, select animations, and shape voice profiles.

- **Driving Game**: Community members were impressed by a driving game with ghost mechanics, with speculation on how it might be implemented using world storage and non-colliding vehicles.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a way to reduce camera and steps sensibility on mobile devices in V1?**  
A: Not in V1, and in V2 it requires modifying core code.

**Q: How can I implement the same scene in V2 that I built in V1?**  
A: Using Blender for asset setup is recommended as V2 requires custom properties for GLB files.

**Q: How do I use the Hyperfy editor in hyperworld.host?**  
A: Access the dashboard, click settings on your world, and select "Update your world" to get the latest version.

**Q: Is hyperworld.host different from play.hyperfy.xyz?**  
A: Yes, hyperworld.host runs on a different version that may not have the latest dev features.

**Q: How can I access my Hyperfy world on my standalone VR headset via WiFi?**  
A: You need port forwarding so that localhost:3000 on your headset goes to your Debian box, or you can deploy to a live site.

**Q: Why am I seeing a forever spinning icon when trying to access my Hyperfy world on my smartphone?**  
A: You might be on an older version of V2, make sure you are on the latest dev version.

**Q: Is there any way to increase the draw distance?**  
A: The sky is a sphere with 1km radius that moves with the player, so anything further than 1km will clip. The plan is to make the sky an app so you can delete/modify it.

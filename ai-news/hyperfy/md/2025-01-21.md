# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-21

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy V2 Development
- **Open Source Progress**: V2 is now self-hostable and open source, with deployment documentation available on GitHub. The team is working toward making this accessible to non-developers.
- **Performance Optimization**: GPU instancing is automatically applied to duplicated GLB models in V2, resulting in excellent performance with a single draw call.
- **Technical Architecture**: V2 uses vanilla JavaScript rather than React (which was used in V1), with a DOM-like API for creating and manipulating objects.
- **Rendering Technology**: Currently using WebGL but will move to WebGPU when it's ready.
- **Deployment Options**: Detailed discussions about AWS deployment strategies using ECS, EFS, and load balancers, with documentation for Digital Ocean deployment also available.

### AI Agent Integration
- **Eliza Framework**: Significant focus on implementing AI agents in Hyperfy worlds using the Eliza framework, with detailed instructions shared.
- **Character Templates**: Saori shared JSON templates for creating character-based agents, explaining how these define AI agent behavior and responses.
- **Technical Requirements**: Currently, implementing agents requires technical knowledge and an Eliza server, though there are plans to make this more accessible.
- **Voice Integration**: Discussions about adding voice capabilities to AI agents using OpenAI's voice module.
- **Multi-Agent Implementation**: MetaMike suggested forking Howie as a potential solution for multi-agent implementation.

### 3D Design & Optimization
- **Collision Systems**: Detailed explanations of collider types (Static, Kinematic, Dynamic) and their computational complexity, with guidance on when to use each type.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Discussion of LODs configured in Blender, frustum culling, and convex vs. trimesh colliders for performance.
- **Tooling**: HiroP developed and shared a Blender script that creates simplified collision meshes from complex models.
- **Avatar Integration**: Conversations about VRM file support and converting 3D models (including CloneX) to compatible formats.
- **Model Optimization**: Tips for reducing triangle count in AI-generated 3D models, including using TripoSR with specific flags.

### Platform Capabilities & Events
- **Virtual Concerts**: Significant interest in hosting virtual concerts, with discussion about audio streaming methods (m3u8 vs mp4) and synchronizing audio across instances.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Clarification that Hyperfy works with any blockchain or without one, with a Solana plugin in development.
- **Token Economics**: Team confirmed that their token allocations are vested over 3 years, addressing concerns about token sales.
- **Market Position**: Community discussions about Hyperfy's positioning as an open-source 3D web engine rather than a traditional metaverse platform.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: Has anyone had issues with assets being unable to load after adding them and refreshing the page?  
  **A**: It could be related to the .env max upload size (default 16MB) or nginx configuration limits. Adding `client_max_body_size 32M;` to nginx server block resolves this.

- **Q**: If I want to get started with v2 how do I go about it?  
  **A**: Clone the repo, follow the quick start instructions in the README.

- **Q**: Is there a way to send an event from the server to a single client?  
  **A**: Need to add world.emit and world.sendTo functions, which are on the to-do list.

- **Q**: Is the scripting language just Three.js?  
  **A**: It's a custom wrapper that's more like web DOM development.

- **Q**: Is Hyperfy V2 using WebGL or WebGPU as a foundation?  
  **A**: Currently WebGL but will move to WebGPU when it's ready.

### AI Agents
- **Q**: Are agents currently only available to people who know how to code?  
  **A**: Yes, the main thing right now is you need an Eliza server.

- **Q**: I want to be more involved in this, is there gonna be a user option later?  
  **A**: Yes, user-friendly options will be available in the future.

- **Q**: Can you add characters to the Eliza server once it's already running?  
  **A**: Currently not possible, characters can only be specified at startup.

### Platform & Business
- **Q**: Can I use this technology with any chain or only with a specific chain?  
  **A**: Any chain or no chain. By default it has none, but a Solana plugin is coming.

- **Q**: Is there any tutorial how to setup V2 to a domain?  
  **A**: If you're a dev you can do it right now using the GitHub wiki. If not, this will be available to everyone soon.

- **Q**: Why did the dev sell all tokens?  
  **A**: All team allocation for the token is vested over 3 years, none of the team has realized or sold any of it.

- **Q**: What tokenomics does HyperFi have? How do you use HyperFi tokens?  
  **A**: They will have utility, including through the DAO, worlds, games, etc. The specifics are still being worked out.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Troubleshooting
- **Ashxn** helped **m‚ÇÇ** resolve asset loading issues by adding `client_max_body_size 32M;` to nginx server block.
- **Ashxn** helped **FrankyLimon** identify that Mac M1 Chrome loading issues were caused by having graphic acceleration turned off.
- **Saori** and **Ashxn** helped **peezy** implement Eliza app by sharing code and identifying that `app.get('vrm')` needed to be changed to `app.get('avatar')`.
- **peezy** helped **MetaMike** resolve Eliza server connection issues by identifying URL format issues and the need to rebuild after checkout.

### 3D Design Assistance
- **hiroP** developed and shared a Blender script that creates simplified collision meshes from complex models, benefiting the entire community.
- **MJMoonbow aka Tinman** helped **bitpixi** with reducing triangle count in AI-generated 3D models by suggesting TripoSR with specific flags.
- **maximus** created and updated an optimization document with collider information and a decision flowchart to help users select appropriate collider types.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-21

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy V2 Development
- The team is rebuilding Hyperfy as an open-source, self-hostable platform with significant performance improvements over V1
- V2 uses vanilla Three.js with custom wrappers instead of the React-based approach in V1
- World data is stored in SQLite databases, with discussions about potentially using JSON files for better accessibility
- GPU instancing is automatically implemented in V2, allowing thousands of duplicated objects to render in a single draw call
- The platform is being designed to be blockchain-agnostic, with a Solana plugin in development

### AI Agent Integration
- Significant focus on integrating AI agents (using Eliza) into Hyperfy worlds
- Character creation uses JSON templates defining personality traits, system prompts, and conversation examples
- Users expressed excitement about the deepseek-r1 model's reasoning capabilities and cost-effectiveness
- Audio capabilities for agents are being developed to enhance interactive experiences
- Ashxn demonstrated an experiment with two Trump AI agents interacting with each other

### 3D Design & Optimization
- Detailed discussions about collision systems with different types (Static, Kinematic, Dynamic) and their performance implications
- HiroP developed and shared a Blender script for creating simplified collision meshes from complex models
- Community members discussed optimization techniques for 3D models, particularly reducing triangle counts for browser performance
- Trimesh colliders were noted to be less performant than convex colliders, with limitations on dynamic-to-dynamic interactions

### Platform Positioning & Community
- Community members compared Hyperfy favorably to competitors like Decentraland, highlighting its open-source nature and developer-friendly framework
- A comparative analysis of virtual world creation platforms from an accessibility perspective was shared and well-received
- Token price discussions ranged from $0.045-0.06, with debates about support levels and growth potential
- The team confirmed HyperFi tokens will have utility through the DAO, worlds, and games, though specifics are still being developed

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How does Hyperfy V2 compare to V1 architecturally?**  
A: V2 uses vanilla Three.js with custom wrappers instead of React components from V1, providing better performance and flexibility.

**Q: If I want to get started with V2, how do I go about it?**  
A: Clone the repo, follow instructions in readme: git clone, cd, cp .env.example .env, npm install, npm run dev.

**Q: Can I use Hyperfy technology with any blockchain or only with a specific chain?**  
A: Any chain or no chain. By default it has none, but we have a Solana plugin coming.

**Q: Can I make a PVP game or PVE game with Hyperfy?**  
A: Yes, the platform supports game development capabilities.

**Q: Are agents currently only available to people who know how to code?**  
A: Yes, currently you need an Eliza server, but there are plans to make this more accessible to non-technical users.

**Q: What are the different collision types and when should they be used?**  
A: Static for basic objects like buildings and trees; Kinematic for objects controlled through code; Dynamic for physically reactive objects. Computational complexity increases in this order: Nothing → Static → Kinematic → Dynamic.

**Q: How does GPU instancing work in V2?**  
A: If you drop a GLB into a V2 world, it automatically GPU instances them. Duplicating an object a thousand times results in extremely good performance with one draw call.

**Q: What tokenomics does HyperFi have?**  
A: Tokens will have utility through the DAO, worlds, games, etc. The specifics are still being worked out.

**Q: What's the best way to bridge from ETH to SOL?**  
A: Several options were suggested: debridge, Coinbase, Jupiter's bridge tab, jumper, mayan swap, and Phantom wallet's direct bridging.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Asset Loading Issues**: Ashxn helped m₂ troubleshoot assets not loading after refresh by identifying an Nginx upload limit issue, solved by adding "client_max_body_size 32M;" to the server block.

- **Eliza Integration**: Saori provided extensive help to MetaMike on setting up Eliza agent integration, documenting the implementation process in HackMD and sharing code examples.

- **3D Model Optimization**: MJMoonbow advised bitpixi on reducing triangle count in AI-generated 3D models, suggesting TripoSR with specific flags to hit around 30k triangles.

- **Collision System**: HiroP developed and shared a Blender script that automatically creates simplified collision meshes from complex models, which was incorporated into documentation by maximus.

- **Concert Venue**: MetaMike offered a warehouse rave world to MUDBONE/Saori for a Zerebro concert, mentioning it was recently tested and ready to go.

- **Platform Comparison**: untitled, xyz created and shared a detailed graphic comparing different platforms' accessibility for creators, highlighting Hyperfy's strengths.

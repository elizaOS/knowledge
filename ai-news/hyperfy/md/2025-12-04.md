# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-12-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Updates
- **Pointer-lock Implementation**: Ozymandias decided to implement pointer-lock detection functionality in `ClientControls.js` rather than alternative locations like `PlayerLocal.js`, `World.js`, or `ClientPointer.js` that were initially considered.
- **Vanilla Branch Limitations**: .hyp shaman mentioned that a particular feature (unspecified) is not yet working on "vanilla branches," suggesting ongoing development work with different code branches.

### Community Engagement
- **New Member Introduction**: Avenor introduced themselves as a developer working at the intersection of Web3 and AI, offering their expertise to the community.
- **Project Anniversary**: User "untitled, xyz" celebrated "3 years of ROOMs" with a link to a Twitter/X post from the Museum of Crypto account.

### Design Appreciation
- 3rdEyeVisuals complimented .hyp shaman's work as "super clean," though the specific project was not detailed.
- .hyp shaman made a cryptic reference to "lore on my feet iykyk" in the 3D design channel.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: "Would this be the channel to talk about strategies for new features?" (asked by Ozymandias in 🐞│issues)  
   **A**: No direct response was provided.

2. **Q**: "From where should be sourced the functionality which detects the pointer-lock for the first time? `PlayerLocal.js`? `World.js`? `ClientPointer.js`?" (asked by Ozymandias in 🐞│issues)  
   **A**: No direct response was provided, though Ozymandias later self-resolved by implementing in `ClientControls.js`.

## Community Help & Collaboration

Today's discussions showed limited collaborative problem-solving. The most notable instance was Ozymandias working through their own implementation question regarding pointer-lock detection, ultimately finding a solution independently and sharing it with the community.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2026-01-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Topics
- **Memory Profiling in Node.js**: Discussion about the challenges of profiling memory usage in Node.js compared to browser applications. Suggestions included using `process.memoryUsage()` or creating heap snapshots for analysis. (🐞│issues)
- **Animation Hyps Implementation**: Technical conversation about animation hyperparameters only working with skinned meshes, requiring parenting to an empty object. Users noted this was simpler in previous versions. (🎨│showcase)

### Community Projects
- **Blockbuster-themed Hyperfy World**: A Hyperfy world based on Blockbuster was highlighted, created by user 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 who mentioned it took considerable time to build solo. (⚡│general)

### Platform Status
- Brief inquiry about the current status of Hyper after a year's development. (🪙│hyper)
- Reference to "2026 incoming..." with a Twitter/X link shared. (🌆│share)

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: "Does anyone know who made the Blockbuster hyperfy world?"  
   **A**: "That's a @722481129449586739 masterpiece" (identified as 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓's work)

2. **Q**: "Anyone having issues getting these hyps to work?"  
   **A**: "I got it working last night with a skinned mesh. Only works with skinned meshes...as I understand it."

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Animation Hyps Troubleshooting**:
  - **Helper**: Valiant
  - **Helpee**: fractilians
  - **Context**: User struggling with animation hyperparameters
  - **Resolution**: Advised that hyps only work with skinned meshes and need to be parented to an empty object

- **Memory Profiling Guidance**:
  - **Helper**: ash
  - **Context**: Shared knowledge about Node.js memory profiling options
  - **Solution**: Suggested using built-in methods or heap snapshots for memory analysis

**Q: Did I miss anything?**  
A: "a bit lol" (answered by ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

**Physics Game Development**  
- Helper: Agent12
- Helpee: Gert-Jan Akerboom
- Context: Expanding physics demo into a game
- Resolution: Agent12 suggested adding ray cast-gun, ramps, and a pit for parts disposal to create a simple physics-based game

## Action Items

### Feature Requests
- Implement a ray cast gun to shoot generated creatures (mentioned by Agent12)
- Create a physics-based hunting game with destructible generated creatures (mentioned by Gert-Jan Akerboom)
- Implement system prompts for AI worlds to allow world owners to restrict AI-generated content (e.g., themed objects only, disable certain functionalities) (mentioned by ash)

### Technical Tasks
- Address requirements for converting DCL shooting games to Hyperfy (mentioned by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz)

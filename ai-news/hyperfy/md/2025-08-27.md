# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-27

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI Capabilities & Implementation
- **GPT-5 Performance**: Users reported superior results with GPT-5 for 3D asset creation despite slower processing speed, particularly for Star Wars AT-T models in "vibe world"
- **AI Restrictions**: Discussion about implementing system prompts for world owners to restrict AI capabilities, enforce themed objects, or disable functionalities
- **Alternative AI Models**: Interest in integrating models like Kimi K2 or DeepSeek 3.1 from Comput3, with ash providing GitHub file links for custom integration
- **AI-Generated Content**: Developers showcased collaborative creation in "playworld" where multiple people contributed to a dragon with fire and flight capabilities without writing traditional code
- **Prompt-Based Development**: Ash mentioned creating a networked flash memory game in "vibe world" using prompts

### Physics & Gameplay Mechanics
- **Physics Implementation**: Gert-Jan Akerboom demonstrated physics with a clickable chicken that falls apart
- **Gaming Potential**: Discussions about shooting mechanics for hunting AI-generated creatures with physics-based weak points
- **FPS Development**: Interest in converting DCL shooting games to Hyperfy and implementing FPS gameplay

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Networking Architecture**: Hyperfy's networking is based on initial state snapshots with delta updates, making reconnection equivalent to refreshing
- **Server Locations**: Current servers are in France, with interest in expanding to other locations
- **Connection Issues**: User vox experienced connection problems that were resolved by switching to 5G

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a reason for not having an auto reconnect in Hyperfy?**  
A: "Auto reconnect is the same as refreshing. Since all networking is based on an initial snapshot of state and then delta updates, the only way to resume from a disconnect is to restart essentially." (answered by ash)

**Q: Where are the servers located?**  
A: "France (looking to get other servers to provide options to people to host elsewhere)" (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)

**Q: How do you do the edits?**  
A: "/edit an edit" (answered by .hyp shaman)

**Q: Who made the star wars ATT stuff in vibe world?**  
A: "I did the star wars stuff. Was testing out different AIs. GPT 5 was best by a fair margin for me." (answered by Dhin)

**Q: What reasoning level did you use?**  
A: "High reasoning" (answered by Dhin)

**Q: Can we already plug in kimi k2 or deepseek 3.1 from comput3?**  
A: "Not built in but its easy to add your own at the bottom of this file: https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy/blob/dev/src/core/systems/ServerAI.js" (answered by ash)

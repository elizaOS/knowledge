# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Blueprint Registration System**: Detailed discussion about the proper way to register .hyp files for use in worlds. Collections need to be added to `src/world/collections/default` rather than the `/world` directory, as collections are built on startup and copied over. All collections are registered in `src/server/collections.js`. (ðŸ’»â”‚developers)
- **Portal Configuration**: Users troubleshooted portal functionality issues, sharing configuration code snippets showing Fastify server setup with multipart and WebSocket registration. (âš¡â”‚general)
- **Server Configuration**: Discussion about adjusting Fastify multipart configuration with increased file size limits for file uploads. (âš¡â”‚general)

### Platform Vision & Features
- **Layered Creation System**: Ashxn outlined a vision where technical makers can create worlds with 3D models and scripts, which can then be collected and used by non-technical users to build their own worlds. (ðŸ’»â”‚developers)
- **Backpack Feature**: Plans for a system allowing makers to create collectible objects that regular users can use to build worlds, enabling temporary use of collectables in worlds that allow them (e.g., fishing rods, cars). (ðŸ’»â”‚developers)
- **Mobile/VR Building**: Brief mention of implementing building and rezzing functionality for mobile and VR users, with potential integration of Project89 app functionality into VR without using webviews. (ðŸ’»â”‚developers)

### Community & Ecosystem
- **Token Discussion**: Community members expressed strong optimism about Hyperfy despite current token price decline, comparing it favorably to established platforms like Roblox and Minecraft. (ðŸª™â”‚hyper)
- **Decentralized Ownership**: Members highlighted Hyperfy's decentralized ownership model as a key differentiator from centralized platforms like Roblox (valued at $70B compared to Hyperfy's much smaller market cap). (ðŸª™â”‚hyper)
- **Gardening Project**: Brief discussion about a project related to plants/gardening initiated by CheddarQueso, with several members offering to help via DMs. (âš¡â”‚general)

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: How do I register .hyps so they can be referenced by code?  
   **A**: Add the .hyp file to src/world/collections/default folder and update the manifest.json file with the same filename, then reboot your world. Collections are built on startup and copied from src/world/collections to /world/collections.

2. **Q**: Does a properly registered .hyp show up in the + menu after reboot?  
   **A**: Yes, if done correctly (add hyp to folder, update manifest.json) it will show up in the + menu.

3. **Q**: Where are collections registered in the code?  
   **A**: All collections are registered in src/server/collections.js.

4. **Q**: How to set the birth point?  
   **A**: Use the command "/spawn set".

5. **Q**: How to use portal? I placed a portal and a place, but don't work, can't be teleported.  
   **A**: In the config match the names, try walking through the other side of the portal.

6. **Q**: Why is the token price going down right now?  
   **A**: The Metaverse is still viewed as hype with minimal substance and is associated with Meta; mainstream adoption requires cryptocurrency becoming more mainstream.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Backpack/Collectibles System**: Ashxn outlined a vision for a four-component system: technical creation by makers, distribution of collectibles, non-technical world-building by regular users, and temporary usage of collectibles in compatible worlds.
- **World Migration Challenges**: Detailed discussion about copying locally built worlds to cloud servers, with clarification that copying the "world" folder transfers all built content but also replaces the database containing user accounts and admin settings.
- **Platform Architecture**: Philbert (former developer) explained technical challenges with Hyperfy's dual nature as both a game engine and metaverse platform, describing his work on an FPS game with identity management, matchmaking API, and P2P rooms for better scaling than the current single-server approach.
- **File Registration**: Discussion about correctly registering .hyp files by placing them in src/world/collections/default folder and adding to manifest.json.

### Platform Features & Usage
- **Portal Configuration**: Troubleshooting of portal teleportation functionality, with emphasis on matching names in config files.
- **Spawn Point Setting**: Confirmation that "/spawn set" command works for configuring spawn points.
- **VR/Mobile Interactions**: Confirmation that onPointerDown should work for object interactions in VR and mobile environments.
- **Server Configuration**: Discussion about adjusting multipart limits for file uploads, specifically increasing fileSize to 300-500MB.

### Community & Project Direction
- **3D NFT History**: Interest in creating a 3D NFT history museum in Hyperfy, with untitled, xyz sharing a chronological list of architectural/design-based 3D NFT collections from 2019-2024.
- **Platform Comparison**: Community members expressed bullish sentiment on Hyperfy despite token price decline, comparing it favorably to centralized platforms like Roblox and Minecraft due to its ownership model.
- **Project Forks**: Discussion about innovation through forks and skunkworks projects, with philbert mentioning his work on an FPS-focused fork.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: How do I register .hyp files so they can be referenced by code?  
  **A**: Place the .hyp file in src/world/collections/default folder and add it to the manifest.json file with the same filename, then reboot your world. Collections are built on startup and copied from src/world/collections to /world/collections.

- **Q**: Is there a way to enable "clicks" in VR and mobile?  
  **A**: onPointerDown should work for object interactions in VR and mobile.

- **Q**: How to copy everything built in a world to a new world?  
  **A**: Copy the "world" folder to another server, but be aware this will replace the database with your local one, affecting user accounts and admin settings.

### Platform Usage
- **Q**: How to set the birth point?  
  **A**: Use the "/spawn set" command.

- **Q**: How to use portal? I placed a portal and a place, but don't work, can't be teleported.  
  **A**: In the config match the names, try walking through the other side of the portal.

- **Q**: When I enter the website portal I bring everyone in my world to a new world, shouldn't only me go there? Is it a bug?  
  **A**: You need to be more specific about which portal app you're using as every object in Hyperfy is built independently.

### Project Direction
- **Q**: Why is Hyperfy better than Roblox and Minecraft?  
  **A**: Because users actually get to own their worlds.

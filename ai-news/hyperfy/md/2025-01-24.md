# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **V2 Development Progress**: The team is actively building core functionality for V2, with significant improvements to physics, UI components, and world infrastructure.
- **Physics Implementation**: Networked multiplayer physics is being developed, allowing objects to synchronize across clients. A tumbleweed example was demonstrated showing this capability.
- **UI Components**: Development of UIView, UIText, and UIImage nodes with pointer event handling is underway.
- **Infrastructure Improvements**: Ash outlined plans to make the Hyperfy world repository more flexible by abstracting database access and asset endpoints, enabling stateless world servers and containerized deployments.
- **Docker Optimization**: HPrivakos contributed a Dockerfile improvement reducing image size from 1.3GB to 387MB using node:22-alpine.

### Community Projects
- **Hyperball Game**: A multiplayer physics-based game concept is being developed with a "king of the hill" style where teams score points by keeping a ball in their team's circle.
- **Stadium Design**: TheMattEmpire created and iterated on a cyberpunk-themed arena for the Hyperball game.
- **Autonomous Camera System**: Discussion about adapting an autonomous camera system for live productions, with potential for multi-agent workflows where camera positions change based on which agent is speaking.

### Hosting Services
- **Hyperfy.host Launch**: A new hosting service for Hyperfy worlds was announced, starting at $5/month.
- **HyperWorld.Host**: Another hosting service offering features like optimization, hourly backups, and automatic world creation.
- **Self-hosting Options**: Discussion about VPS options for users who want to deploy their own Hyperfy instances.
- **Naming Concerns**: Ash clarified that while he doesn't personally mind the use of "hyperfy" in service names, there could be legal implications and suggested alternatives like "hyperhost" to avoid confusion.

### HYPER Token
- **Market Volatility**: The HYPER token experienced significant price drops, with community members discussing market conditions and capitulation events.
- **Token Recovery Incident**: A user accidentally burned 25k HYPER tokens due to a Solana token account closing bug, which the community collectively helped recover through donations.
- **Tokenomics Questions**: Community members expressed interest in more details about token utility, with current circulating supply reported as 0.44B out of 1B total.

### 3D Design & Tools
- **Hyperfy-Tools Repository**: ~/HowiEDuhzit shared a GitHub repository that includes features for collision generation and scene export.
- **VRM Character Models**: Several users sought help with rigging and optimization for VRM format avatars.
- **UV Scrolling**: Discussions about implementing UV scrolling for animated textures in both V1 and V2.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical
- **Q**: Can avatars be only GLB or do they have to be VRM?  
  **A**: Avatars are VRM. You'll have more luck using VRM rigs.

- **Q**: Is there a way to attach a script to the metadata of a GLB so it loads when dropped in?  
  **A**: That's the concept of apps which is being worked on.

- **Q**: Can scripts interact with each other currently?  
  **A**: It will be possible but isn't working at the moment.

- **Q**: How do you use node classes/attributes?  
  **A**: You can use app.traverse((node) => console.log(node)) to see all nodes.

- **Q**: What does preload do?  
  **A**: Preload means it loads before everything else when people enter the world.

- **Q**: Is there a way to set collider to a GLB?  
  **A**: You can manage it in Blender by adding collisions to meshes.

- **Q**: How do I code or live edit stuff in Hyperfy?  
  **A**: Type "/admin admin code>" in chat, then drag and drop GLB files and right-click to add scripts.

- **Q**: What is the recommended hosting platform for installing your own instance of Hyperfy v2?  
  **A**: Any VPS provider such as digital ocean or hetzner.

- **Q**: How does the Simple Collision collider option in Hyperfy-Tools work?  
  **A**: It makes a very basic bounding box for optimal physics for simple objects.

- **Q**: How do I implement UV scrolling in v1?  
  **A**: Add a suffix to the material name, for example: sample_uvscroll_0.1.0.0

### Token & Business
- **Q**: How much is the real market cap of HYPER?  
  **A**: There are different figures - 15.8M circulating supply and 35M fully diluted value.

- **Q**: Why isn't there an option to use Hyperfy tokens as payment when creating a world?  
  **A**: The service is independent from core team, and the provider is working on crypto payment rails.

- **Q**: How can one get the whale or wings role (hyperfly)?  
  **A**: Need 100k Hyper tokens then verify in the verification channel.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Assistance
- **VRM Conversion Help**: Multiple community members (᲼, TheMattEmpire, MetaMike) helped SotoAlt with converting custom-rigged characters to VRM format, sharing documentation links and offering personal assistance.

- **Build Error Resolution**: HPrivakos helped MetaMike resolve build errors with the latest dev branch by suggesting deletion of node_modules and build folders, followed by reinstallation.

- **Physics Implementation**: Ashxn helped ᲼ fix jittery elevator physics by suggesting a switch from static to kinematic rigidbody and using fixedUpdate for movement.

- **Collision Implementation**: hiroP provided DevStarlight with step-by-step instructions to create a rigidbody empty with proper custom properties for wall collisions in Blender.

### Community Support
- **Token Recovery**: When friyde accidentally burned 25k HYPER tokens due to a Solana token account closing bug, community members (devilsadvocate.sol, shiny_shiba, peezy) collectively donated HYPER to make the user whole.

- **World Building Access**: Saori added treed as admin to a world to test building features and provided documentation links.

- **Docker Optimization**: HPrivakos helped DevStarlight improve the Dockerfile, reducing image size from 1.3GB to 387MB using node:22-alpine.

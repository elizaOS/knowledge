## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: How do I create networked physics for objects?  
  **A**: Ashxn shared a complete code example for implementing networked physics with rigidbodies.

- **Q**: Is there a way to attach a script to the metadata of a GLB so it loads when dropped in?  
  **A**: That's the concept of apps which is being worked on - one file, drag and drop to add a full app.

- **Q**: How do I find the name of a model without opening it in Blender?  
  **A**: Use app.traverse((node) => console.log(node)) to see all nodes in the app.

- **Q**: What does preload do in the model settings?  
  **A**: Preload means it loads before everything else when people enter the world.

- **Q**: What's the recommended hosting platform for installing your own instance of Hyperfy v2?  
  **A**: You can use any VPS provider such as Digital Ocean or Hetzner.

- **Q**: Does UV scrolling work in V1?  
  **A**: Yes, add a suffix to the material name, for example: sample_uvscroll_0.1.0.0

### Token & Platform
- **Q**: How much is the real market cap of Hyperfy?  
  **A**: There are different numbers - 15.8M circulating supply and 35M fully diluted value.

- **Q**: Why doesn't Hyperfy have a SOL pair?  
  **A**: It does have a SOL pair, it's the only pair it has.

- **Q**: Why is there no option to use Hyperfy tokens as a payment method when creating a world on hyperfy.host?  
  **A**: The service provider is working on getting crypto payment rails set up.

### 3D Design & Assets
- **Q**: How does the Simple Collision collider option work in Hyperfy-Tools?  
  **A**: It makes a very basic bounding box for optimal physics for simple objects.

- **Q**: How do I set collider to a GLB?  
  **A**: You can manage it in Blender by adding collisions to meshes.

- **Q**: Can avatars be only GLB or do they have to be VRM?  
  **A**: Avatars are VRM, and there are simple and humanoid VRM types.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Support
- **Networked Physics Implementation**: Ashxn shared complete code examples for implementing networked physics with rigidbodies, helping multiple developers.

- **Build Issues**: HPrivakos helped MetaMike with build issues on the latest dev branch by suggesting deleting node_modules and build folders, then running npm install and npm run dev again.

- **Browser Crashes**: peezy helped amtraq identify a problematic commit causing browser crashes when saving pinned app scripts on avatars.

- **Sky/HDR Implementation**: Ashxn shared a complete Sky App script and example files with devilsadvocate.sol.

- **Node Inspection**: Saori helped devilsadvocate.sol find model names without using Blender by providing the app.traverse() method.

### 3D Design Assistance
- **VRM Character Creation**: ᲼ helped SotoAlt with non-humanoid character rigs for VRM avatars by sharing documentation links and offering personal help.

- **Collision Creation**: hiroP provided DevStarlight | Numinia with step-by-step instructions to create a rigidbody with proper collision properties in Blender.

- **Material Properties**: 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 explained to TheMattEmpire how to implement UV scrolling in V1 by adding specific suffixes to material names.

### Community Support
- **Token Recovery**: When friyde accidentally burned 25k HYPER tokens due to a Solana token account closing bug, community members devilsadvocate.sol, peezy, and shiny_shiba collectively donated tokens to make the user whole.

- **World Access**: Saori offered free access to V1 worlds to anyone who provided their ETH address, helping MUDBONE and others try the platform.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Scene Development & Management
- **Scene App Functionality**: Ashxn introduced the concept of "scene" apps that allow for environment swapping. These apps are locked at origin (0,0,0) to prevent accidental movement and automatically disable other scene apps when added.
- **Scene Transition Challenges**: The community discussed handling player and object positions during scene transitions to prevent players from spawning inside terrain or objects.
- **PR Merge**: Ashxn merged a pull request related to scene functionality and shared sample scenes for developers to test.

### UI Development
- **UI Examples Shared**: 0mka shared several UI examples including ClockUI, HelloUI, and ButtonUI with configuration options to help developers create interfaces without extensive coding.
- **No-Code UI Builder**: Discussions about the potential for a no-code UI builder similar to Unity's approach.

### Game Mechanics
- **Coin Collection Implementation**: Developers discussed different approaches to implementing coin collection mechanics:
  - Single app managing all coins
  - Multiple coin apps communicating with a manager app
- **Audio Playback**: Best practices for audio implementation in interactive elements were shared.

### $HYPER Token Concerns
- **Price Performance**: Community members expressed frustration about the token's declining value despite market uptrends.
- **Tokenomics Solutions**: PurpleSack proposed a comprehensive staking system that would include platform fee sharing and exclusive drops for stakers.
- **Team Response**: Ashxn confirmed that $HYPER is intended to be the only token used within the platform, with plans to introduce staking to reduce volatility.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do scene apps work?**  
A: Scene apps are locked at origin (0,0,0), can't be moved/selected/deleted accidentally, and automatically disable other scene apps when added. They include scripting for skyboxes and sun configuration. (Answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How can we handle player positions when swapping scenes?**  
A: Use "safe spawn zones" that the scene creator sets up, with different zones for different entity types, and respawn entities to the nearest appropriate zone. (Answered by hiroP)

**Q: How to remove an app/tool from the world?**  
A: Use world.remove(app), app.destroy() is usually not needed. (Answered by 0mka)

**Q: Are there any dev/util hyp apps that make it easier to create a UI?**  
A: While there's no no-code UI builder yet, 0mka shared several UI examples including ClockUI, HelloUI, and ButtonUI with configuration options. (Answered by 0mka)

**Q: How should coin collection mechanics be implemented?**  
A: Either use a single app that manages all coins or have separate coin apps that communicate with a manager app. For simplicity, a single app approach allows for easier sharing. (Answered by Ashxn and 0mka)

**Q: Can people still claim the airdrop?**  
A: No, it has ended. (Answered by Sceth iii)

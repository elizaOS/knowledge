# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Scene Apps & Environment Management
- **Scene App Concept**: Ashxn introduced scene apps that are locked at origin (0,0,0) and can't be accidentally moved/deleted, making environment swapping easier
- **Collision Challenges**: Discussions focused on handling collision and terrain differences when swapping scenes to prevent users from ending up underground or inside walls
- **Safe Spawn Zones**: HiroP proposed designating areas for different entity types (apps vs players) to respawn after scene changes
- **Environment Features**: Requests for HEX color options for Sun in scene apps were mentioned

### UI Development
- **Implementation Patterns**: 0mka shared multiple UI examples demonstrating screen-space and world-space interfaces
- **Code Examples**: Several developers shared implementation approaches and code snippets
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Discussions about using tools like deepwiki, Claude, and v0.dev to help with UI creation

### App Architecture
- **Object Management**: Consensus that making objects dormant (hiding meshes) is preferable to destruction
- **Coin Collection**: Several practical implementations were shared for coin collection mechanics
- **Single App Approach**: Emphasis on using a single app approach for better shareability

### Tokenomics & $HYPER
- **Token Performance Concerns**: Community members expressed frustration about declining token value despite market growth
- **Staking System**: PurpleSack proposed a staking system with multiple value streams
- **Platform Integration**: Plans confirmed to make $HYPER the exclusive payment token on the platform
- **Team Response**: Ashxn acknowledged feedback but emphasized focus on building the product first

### Technical Issues
- **GPU Performance**: Reports of GPU spikes up to 80ms, suggesting problematic app resource consumption
- **Camera Issues**: Brief mention of a "weird camera thing" issue being captured

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How should scene apps handle collision and terrain differences when swapping scenes?**  
A: HiroP suggested using "safe spawn zones" that respawn entities in appropriate locations based on entity type tags

**Q: How can apps be removed from the world?**  
A: Use world.remove(app) rather than app.destroy()

**Q: Are there any dev/util hyp apps that make it easier to create a UI?**  
A: 0mka provided several example apps showing UI implementation patterns

**Q: How should coin collection mechanics be implemented?**  
A: Ashxn suggested using a single app approach with world.set() to store locations

**Q: Why does audio playback lag in my coin collection app?**  
A: 0mka suggested checking what's triggering the audio.play() and ensuring sound clips don't have dead space

**Q: Can people still claim airdrop?**  
A: No, the airdrop period has ended (answered by Sceth iii)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Collision Issue Resolution**
   - Helper: 0mka | Helpee: Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘
   - Context: Fixing collision issues with a platform
   - Resolution: Suggested toggling collision off on first impact then using cooldown to reactivate it

2. **UI Implementation Guidance**
   - Helper: 0mka | Helpee: shmoji
   - Context: Creating UI interfaces in Hyperfy
   - Resolution: Provided three example apps (ClockUI, HelloUI, ButtonUI) demonstrating different UI implementation patterns

3. **Documentation Resources**
   - Helper: hiroP | Helpee: Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘
   - Context: Finding Hyperfy documentation
   - Resolution: Shared deepwiki.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy as a resource for asking questions about the engine

4. **App Architecture Patterns**
   - Helper: Ashxn | Helpee: Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘
   - Context: App creation/destruction patterns
   - Resolution: Explained that apps can't create/destroy other apps, suggested making objects dormant by hiding meshes

5. **Tokenomics Feedback**
   - Helper: Ashxn | Helpee: PurpleSack
   - Context: PurpleSack proposed tokenomics ideas
   - Resolution: Ashxn confirmed alignment with these ideas, noting $HYPER is intended to be the only token used within the platform

6. **Infrastructure Solution**
   - Helper: Reneil | Helpee: Channel members
   - Context: SSL and domain routing solutions
   - Resolution: Shared Pangolin as a self-hosted alternative to Cloudflare Tunnel for routing domains to Coolify Deployments

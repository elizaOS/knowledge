# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Scene Management & Environment Development
- **Scene App Concept**: Ashxn introduced a "scene" app that allows environments to be locked at origin and swapped easily, with automatic scripting for skyboxes and sun configuration.
- **Collision Challenges**: A key challenge discussed was handling collision and terrain differences when swapping scenes, as users might end up underground or in walls.
- **Safe Spawn Solution**: HiroP proposed using "safe spawn" zones tagged for different entity types (land, swimmers, buoyant) to ensure proper respawning.
- **Modular Building**: Gert-Jan Akerboom shared progress on a modular building project (viewable at akerboom.fyi), with collision detection as the next development step.

### UI & Input Development
- **Keyboard Customization**: Gh0sTt's keyboard development allows individual key coloring.
- **UI Design Workflow**: Developers discussed using v0.dev for initial React designs before adapting them to Hyperfy's UI system.
- **Input Methods**: Discussion of implementing phone gyro controls and gamepad API support for controllers.

### App Management & Optimization
- **Object Pooling**: Developers debated object pooling versus destroying/recreating objects, with Gh0sTt advocating for object pools to optimize memory usage.
- **Self-hosted Solutions**: Reneil shared a solution for SSL and domain routing using Pangolin in combination with Hyperfy on Coolify as a self-hosted alternative to Cloudflare Tunnel.

### HYPER Token Concerns
- **Price Performance**: Community members expressed concern about HYPER token price performance despite market uptrends elsewhere.
- **Communication Gap**: Discussion highlighted a disconnect between the development team's focus on building the product and the community's desire for token value preservation and marketing efforts.
- **Volume Strategy**: General hyper suggested that increased trading volume would organically grow awareness of the token.

### AI in Development
- Members shared and discussed content related to AI in development, particularly a video featuring GitHub's CEO discussing AI tools like Copilot and other development trends.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How to handle collision and terrain differences when swapping scene apps?**  
A: HiroP suggested using "safe spawn" zones tagged for different entity types to ensure proper respawning.

**Q: How to remove an app/tool from the world?**  
A: Use world.remove(app) without app.destroy(), or consider using an object pool for inactive objects.

**Q: Are there any dev/util hyp apps that make it easier to create a UI?**  
A: Not directly, but you can use v0.dev to design React UIs and then have an LLM refactor them for Hyperfy.

**Q: How to detect player IDs on entering a world?**  
A: Use world.on('enter'), world.getPlayers(), world.getPlayer(), player.id.

**Q: Any news about possible buy backs on token with fees earned?**  
A: The idea of buybacks has been "resoundingly shot down" multiple times, making it unlikely to be implemented.

**Q: Do you know if there is a setting that allows folks to actually just @tag the @mods Role?**  
A: There are settings but for simplicity, the ability for people to tag roles has been limited.

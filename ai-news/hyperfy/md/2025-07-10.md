# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Scene Management & Development
- **Scene App Concept**: Ashxn introduced a scene app that locks environments to origin (0,0,0) for easy scene swapping with automatic disabling of previous scenes
- **Terrain Transition Challenges**: Discussions focused on handling player and object positioning when switching between scenes with different terrains
- **Safe Spawn Zones**: HiroP proposed using entity tagging (land, swimmers, buoyant) to intelligently reposition objects during scene transitions
- **Modular Building Project**: Gert-Jan Akerboom shared progress on a modular building project (viewable at akerboom.fyi), with collision detection as the next development step

### UI & Input Development
- **Keyboard Customization**: Gh0sTt developed a keyboard system allowing individual key coloring
- **UI Development Approaches**: Developers discussed using v0.dev for initial designs before adapting to Hyperfy's UI system
- **Documentation Improvements**: Requests for consolidated documentation and UI templates were made, with mentions of DeepWiki as a valuable resource

### HYPER Token Discussions
- **Price Performance Concerns**: Community members expressed worry about continuous selling pressure despite the broader market being up
- **Volume Strategy**: Suggestions that increased trading volume would organically grow token awareness, with recommendations for holders to actively trade to generate volume surges
- **Team Focus Debate**: Tension between community members wanting more focus on token price versus those supporting the team's focus on long-term development

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How to handle player positioning when swapping scene apps with different terrain?**  
A: Use "safe spawn zones" with entity tagging to intelligently reposition objects (answered by hiroP)

**Q: How to remove an app/tool from the world?**  
A: Use world.remove(app) without needing app.destroy() in most cases (answered by 0mka)

**Q: Are there any dev/util hyp apps that make it easier to create a UI?**  
A: Not directly, but you can use v0.dev to design UIs and then have an LLM refactor it for Hyperfy (answered by Gh0sTt)

**Q: Why does the sound lag so much in my coin app?**  
A: It may depend on what's calling audio.play() and if your audio clip has dead space (answered by 0mka)

**Q: Do you know if there is a setting that allows folks to actually just @tag the @mods Role?**  
A: There are settings but for simplicity we limited the ability for people to tag roles of any kind (answered by maximus)

**Q: Any news about possible buy backs on token with fees earned?**  
A: The idea of buybacks has been "resoundingly shot down" in previous discussions, making it unlikely to be implemented (answered by maximus)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Player ID Detection**: 0mka helped Gh0sTt by explaining world.on('enter'), world.getPlayers(), world.getPlayer(), and player.id methods
- **Physics Debugging**: Gh0sTt suggested to 0mka to toggle collision off on first impact then use cooldown to reactivate it for a jumping cube that was shaking
- **App Management**: 0mka explained to Gh0sTt how to use world.remove(app) and suggested object pooling instead of destroying objects
- **Scene Transitions**: hiroP provided Ashxn with a comprehensive solution for player positioning during scene transitions using safe spawn zones
- **UI Development**: Gh0sTt advised shmoji to use v0.dev for initial UI design then have an LLM refactor it for Hyperfy
- **Token Strategy**: General hyper suggested increasing trading volume to organically grow awareness, explaining how volume surges can create FOMO
- **Investment Perspective**: Sceth iii advised Saracismo to take a step back emotionally and be patient with the development process

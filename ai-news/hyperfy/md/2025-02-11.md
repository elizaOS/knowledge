# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **Build Mode Enhancements**: The new build mode PR (#38) was merged, adding features like object manipulation, pinning objects to prevent accidental deletion, and double-jump functionality. Users discussed the need for undo functionality (cmd-z) in the builder.
- **VR/AR Integration**: WebXR integration was implemented, enabling VR support with spatial audio working perfectly in headsets. Directional movement issues in VR were fixed by Ashxn.
- **Performance**: The Play world (play.hyperfy.xyz) was noted to perform well at 40fps even on GPU-less laptops, demonstrating the platform's optimization.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Development for HV2 is in progress, allowing buttons to perform transactions across chains. Discussions about potential "Hyperchain" development included considerations about using HYPER as a native gas token.

### Community Development
- **Advanced Applications**: Several developers created sophisticated apps demonstrating Hyperfy's capabilities:
  - MetaMike built an AI-like collectron system using proximity detection and event-based communication
  - Shiffty created a cube-based visualization system with wave patterns in HyperScript
  - ToxSam developed a scene inspector tool to help manage objects in worlds
  - Maximus shared a space trading simulation remixing Metamike's Rover and Loot applications

- **Game Development**: A Fall Guys "Hex-A-Gone" style game is being developed by community members, with Shiffty starting implementation and discussing collision detection approaches.

- **Asset Creation**: Discussions about VRM rigging emphasized the importance of T-pose models for proper rigging in Blender. A significant debate emerged about low-poly vs. realistic art styles, with ToxSam arguing that low-poly designs are more memorable.

### Community Events
- **House Building Challenge**: A competition for pre-fab snappable house designs was announced with HYPER token prizes.
- **Community Meeting**: An upcoming Hyperfy Community Meeting was announced to discuss technical developments and showcase community projects.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: Is .hyp file uploading to an app supported, like you can with vrm/mp3/glb?  
  **A**: "You can have images and glb for sure, so I don't see why not vrm/mp3" (HPrivakos)

- **Q**: How can I destroy an app?  
  **A**: "Apps can't just delete other apps as that would cause chaos. Build an app that listens for an event and then unmounts meshes." (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do I convert mixamo emotes to hyperfy compatible?  
  **A**: "Watch tutorial video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzG1A21RV7E" (𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)

- **Q**: Can I use Math.random in scripts for Hyperfy apps?  
  **A**: "No, for security reasons you should use the global `num` method instead" (ash)

- **Q**: What's the correct way to make hexagon platforms in Blender that tile seamlessly?  
  **A**: "Use a 6-sided cylinder in Blender and position them using the spacing formula where distance between centers is 2 × radius × cos(30°)." (ToxSam)

- **Q**: What's the easiest way to detect if a player is standing on a mesh?  
  **A**: "Make a taller simpler hexagon that sits right above it and use it as a trigger." (Ashxn)

### Platform & Infrastructure
- **Q**: Is there a dummy's guide to this project?  
  **A**: "There are some community docs that might help at http://hyperfy.how/" (Saori)

- **Q**: Does a shared hosting for websites could host a hyperfy world in a subdomain?  
  **A**: "If it's just a website hosting platform, you won't be able to host it on there, you need to be able to run custom software of the server" (HypPrivakos)

- **Q**: Is the Hyperfy token on Base?  
  **A**: "No, hyperfy token is on solana, not base." (QMA)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Problem Solving
- **VRM Avatar Issues**: Vox helped Pablo with a VRM avatar that had excessive emissive strength values (45-100), recommending reducing them to 5-10 maximum and removing MToon to make it work.

- **Hexagon Tiling**: Ashxn initiated a discussion about creating seamlessly tiling hexagons in Blender, which evolved into a collaborative problem-solving session with ToxSam and others sharing AI-generated solutions.

- **Angle Snapping**: Saori helped fishai fix an angle snapping issue in the house builder by rotating a rail 180 degrees with the scroll wheel.

### Development Support
- **Local Environment Setup**: Saori provided ToxSam with step-by-step instructions for setting up a local Hyperfy development environment: install nvm, clone repo, nvm install, nvm use, npm i, npm run dev.

- **Animation Conversion**: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 helped peezy with converting Mixamo animations to Hyperfy format by sharing a YouTube tutorial showing how to add root bone in Blender.

- **Code Sharing**: MetaMike shared complete code and explanation of how his perception system works for the collectron AI system.

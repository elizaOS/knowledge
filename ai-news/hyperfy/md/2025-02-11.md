  **A**: You need to add a root bone (Saori and ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì with video tutorial)

- **Q**: How do I start developing locally? (ToxSam)  
  **A**: Install nvm, clone repo, nvm install, nvm use, npm i, npm run dev (Saori)

- **Q**: What's the correct way to make hexagon platforms in Blender that tile seamlessly? (Ashxn)  
  **A**: Use a 6-sided cylinder in Blender and position them with the correct spacing using the hexagon's dimensions (ToxSam with AI assistance)

- **Q**: How can I add colliders to my models in Hyperfy v2? (carlosmu)  
  **A**: Use the Hyperfy Tools Blender add-on or follow the node collider documentation (Omka and scoe)

### Platform & Features

  **A**: There are some community docs that might help at http://hyperfy.how/ (Saori)

- **Q**: Is there any documentation/development in hv2 regarding blockchain integration - like making a button perform a transaction? (treed)  
  **A**: Linked to a thread, noting it's WIP and docs will be updated (Omka)

- **Q**: What would be the purpose of hyperchain? (zobo)  
  **A**: Hyper could be native token for gas, enabling new dynamics at reasonable cost (Saori)

- **Q**: Is there an official Hyperfy youtube or lens on the horizon? (Omka)  
  **A**: YouTube link shared, but Saori mentioned challenges managing multiple social platforms (maximus and Saori)

### Token & Economics
- **Q**: Is there any token for Hyperfy atm? (Jaewi)  
  **A**: Information can be found in the token channel (Omka)

- **Q**: Is the dev hold 30% supply? (Yoree)  
  **A**: It's the DAO wallet, with link to token information (maximus)

- **Q**: So $Hyper utility is about to be revealed yet? (Beats)  
  **A**: Omka mentioned marketplace development for .hyp apps/assets and in-world $hyper tips functionality in progress

- **Q**: Is hyperfy token on base? (implied by ai16zgm)  
  **A**: No, hyperfy token is on solana, not base (QMA)

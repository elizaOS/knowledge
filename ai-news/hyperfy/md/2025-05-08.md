# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **V1 to V2 Transition**: Hyperfy is transitioning from v1 to v2, with v1 in maintenance mode (still functional but no major updates planned)
- **Platform Development Status**: Ashxn mentioned they paused platform development to conduct R&D and have now locked in a direction, moving to execution phase
- **Documentation Update**: Documentation has moved from hyperfy.how to docs.hyperfy.xyz
- **Open Source Efforts**: Since the Core is Open-Source, community efforts have made Hyperfy compatible with both Solana ecosystem and EVM

### Technical Features
- **Agent Functionality**: The node client for agents properly runs all systems regular players do, including physics and player controllers, making agents behave almost identically to human players
- **VRM Implementation**: Discussions about VRM avatar implementation, particularly regarding blendshape limitations across multiple meshes in Blender exports
- **Vehicle Physics**: Valiant shared progress on vehicle implementation, showing videos of smooth flying mechanics
- **V2 Media Support**: V2 now supports screenUV video with streaming, UV scrolling, and agents
- **App Instancing**: "Unique apps" setting only creates unique settings while meshes are still instanced behind the scenes, causing them to share materials

### Building in Hyperfy
- **V2 Access Options**: Users can self-host the open-source world engine, use a hosting service like hyperworld.host, build locally, or use play.hyperfy.xyz where everyone has build permissions
- **V1 World NFTs**: No longer available as the platform is transitioning to v2

## Key Questions & Answers

### Platform & Documentation
- **Q**: What's the new quickstart/installation link?  
  **A**: https://docs.hyperfy.xyz/welcome/quickstart/ (maximus)

- **Q**: When do you plan to launch the platform?  
  **A**: "I can't give dates but it'll happen out of nowhere like most things we do here... we paused on the platform to do some RND and make sure we were going in the absolute best direction. That direction is now locked in so it's execution time." (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is there a single place/board kept up to date with core functionality for v2?  
  **A**: The docs folder in the repo is comprehensive but technical, and https://docs.hyperfy.xyz has community knowledge (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is there a roadmap for the release of v2?  
  **A**: Roadmap coming soon! (Ashxn)

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: Anyone been successful in exporting generated VRMs with blendshapes through Blender?  
  **A**: Partially answered by Ashxn who indicated Blender VRM should support blendshapes on more than one mesh

- **Q**: Should I stall working with the eliza agent starter repo?  
  **A**: No, but note the dev branch has an agent.mjs file showing how to use the true node client (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Are the avatars in the shared Twitter post VRMs?  
  **A**: Yes, they're VRM because they're literally players (Ashxn)

- **Q**: When adding multiple NEON apps to a world, why doesn't the color setting persist with the 'unique' setting?  
  **A**: The "unique apps" setting only creates unique settings while meshes are still instanced behind the scenes, causing them to share materials. You can unlink meshes with mesh.linked=false, but this decreases performance at scale. (ash)

- **Q**: Is play.hyperfy.xyz v1 or v2 infrastructure?  
  **A**: v2. (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Documentation Links**
   - **Helper**: maximus
   - **Helpee**: emotionull
   - **Context**: Needed updated documentation link
   - **Resolution**: Provided the correct docs URL

2. **VRM Export Support**
   - **Helper**: Ashxn
   - **Helpee**: lucii.io
   - **Context**: VRM export with blendshapes across multiple meshes
   - **Resolution**: Suggested Blender VRM should support multiple meshes

3. **Agent Implementation**
   - **Helper**: Ashxn
   - **Helpee**: 0mka
   - **Context**: Questions about agent implementation
   - **Resolution**: Explained differences between old and new approaches, directed to agent.mjs in dev branch

4. **V1 to V2 Transition Guidance**
   - **Helper**: Ashxn
   - **Helpee**: carlosmu
   - **Context**: User wanted to create a new world in Hyperfy but was unaware of v1 to v2 transition
   - **Resolution**: Explained current status and provided alternative options including self-hosting, using hyperworld.host, or building in play.hyperfy.xyz

5. **App Instancing Issue**
   - **Helper**: ash
   - **Helpee**: Gert-Jan Akerboom
   - **Context**: Multiple NEON apps in a world sharing the same color despite "unique" setting
   - **Resolution**: Explained that meshes are instanced and suggested using mesh.linked=false to unlink them

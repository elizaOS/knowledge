# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-12

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI Asset Generation
- Hyperfy's AI asset creation system is available in the dev branch and requires API keys to function
- The AI builds 3D assets using highly optimized primitives
- A well-crafted system prompt teaches the AI about Hyperfy's architecture
- GPT-5 on medium settings delivers impressive, sometimes "mindblowing" results
- A public demo world exists at vibe.hyperfy.xyz, though AI generation is temporarily disabled
- Various LLM models can be used with the system, with configuration details in .env.example

### 3D Asset Development
- Each .hyp file contains one GLB plus script and metadata, not multiple GLBs
- The engine supports texture splatting (demonstrated on island.hyperfy.xyz)
- Vertex colors in GLB files were successfully implemented by TheMattEmpire
- Texture splatting workflow is complex due to GLB format limitations requiring workarounds
- Modular asset development allows for simultaneous updates across assets
- LOD (Level of Detail) capabilities are available for optimization

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a way to play with the AI asset creation stuff Ash keeps teasing? What's powering it?**  
A: It's on the dev branch. Just plop in your API keys. (Dhin)

**Q: API keys for what? Any LLM?**  
A: Check .env.example in world folder. (Valiant)

**Q: And they're able to generate 3D assets? How does that work?**  
A: They build using primitives which are now highly optimized and ash has built a really good system prompt that teaches them all about the hyperfy architecture. (Shiffty)

**Q: Can a hyp file have multiple .glb assets in it?**  
A: Every hyp is one glb + script + metadata. (ash)

**Q: Has anyone had any luck with texture splatting or vertex colors with GLBs?**  
A: The engine supports it, this is how the terrain was done on island.hyperfy.xyz but the workflow is complex. (ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Dhin helped cwe** understand how to access AI asset creation features, explaining it's available on the dev branch and requires API keys
- **Valiant directed cwe** to check .env.example in the world folder for API configuration details
- **vox explained to cwe** about the public demo world at vibe.hyperfy.xyz, noting that AI generation is temporarily disabled
- **Shiffty clarified for cwe** how AI generates 3D assets using optimized primitives and system prompts
- **ash assisted TheMattEmpire** with understanding .hyp file structure and limitations
- **ash provided guidance to TheMattEmpire** on implementing texture splatting in GLB files, confirming it's possible but complex

## Action Items

### Technical

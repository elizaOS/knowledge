# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-12

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI Asset Creation
- Hyperfy's dev branch includes AI-powered 3D asset generation capabilities using primitives
- The system uses a specialized prompt that teaches AI about Hyperfy's architecture
- Commands like "/create a rock" and "/edit add eye" allow in-world model generation and modification
- While fast models produce disappointing results, GPT-5 on medium setting yields impressive outcomes
- The public demo at vibe.hyperfy.xyz has AI generation temporarily disabled, possibly due to DDOS attacks

### Avatar Creation & VRM Implementation
- Hyperfy previously conducted R&D on text-to-VRM avatar generation with high failure rates
- Current recommended workflow involves using AI tools for mesh creation and the VRM for Blender addon
- Open-source VRMs compatible with Hyperfy are available as alternatives
- Spring Bone support in Hyperfy would improve VRM compatibility

### 3D Asset Technical Details
- Each .hyp file contains one GLB plus script and metadata, not multiple GLBs
- Hyperfy's engine supports advanced texture splatting and vertex colors (demonstrated on island.hyperfy.xyz)
- The workflow for texture splatting is complex due to GLTF limitations
- Hyperfy uses a modular asset approach, allowing for efficient updates across multiple assets

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it possible to convert an image into a 3D character in Hyperfy?**  
A: Hyperfy did R&D on this, converting text to images to meshes to VRMs, but with high failure rates. The recommended approach is using AI tools for mesh creation and VRM for Blender addon. (answered by ash and TheMattEmpire)

**Q: Is the vibe world ever getting back online?**  
A: It was back up yesterday but experiencing issues possibly due to DDOS or bad actors. AI feature is turned off anyway. (answered by ash)

**Q: Is there a way to play with the AI asset creation stuff Ash keeps teasing? What's powering it?**  
A: It's on the dev branch. Just add your API keys. (answered by Dhin)

**Q: And they're able to generate 3D assets? How does that work?**  
A: They build using primitives which are now highly optimized and ash has built a really good system prompt that teaches them all about the hyperfy architecture. (answered by Shiffty)

**Q: Can a hyp file have multiple .glb assets in it?**  
A: Every hyp is one glb + script + metadata (answered by ash)

**Q: Has anyone had any luck with texture splatting or vertex colors with GLBs?**  
A: The engine supports it, this is how the terrain was done on island.hyperfy.xyz, but the workflow is complex due to GLTF limitations (answered by ash)

**Q: How to add the AI agent role to the hyperfy world?**  
A: Anyone with admin or builder role can create with AI. For agents in world I only know of eliza. I haven't gone down that road myself yet (answered by Dhin)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### VRM Avatar Creation Support
- TheMattEmpire provided detailed guidance to lucyhail on creating VRM avatars using AI tools and the VRM for Blender addon
- TheMattEmpire shared documentation from his time at Mona to assist with the process
- Shiffty shared a database of open-source VRMs compatible with Hyperfy
- vox pointed to MetaMike's documentation for CloneX VRM creation

### AI Asset Generation Guidance
- Dhin helped cwe understand how to access AI asset creation features in the dev branch
- Valiant directed cwe to check .env.example in the world folder for API configuration
- Shiffty explained to cwe how AI generates 3D assets using optimized primitives
- Dhin provided 太阳 with detailed instructions on using AI generation commands in-world

### 3D Design Techniques
- ash helped TheMattEmpire understand texture splatting capabilities in Hyperfy's engine
- TheMattEmpire offered to document texture splatting workflow in their own docs section

## Action Items

### Technical
- Reboot the "vibe world" server to address possible DDOS or bad actor issues (mentioned by ash)
- Improve VRM avatar creation pipeline to reduce failure rates in text-to-VRM conversion (mentioned by ash)
- Check dev branch and configure API keys to experiment with AI asset creation (mentioned by Dhin)
- Document the complex workflow for texture splatting in GLB files (mentioned by ash)

### Documentation
- Create or compile comprehensive VRM creation tutorials specifically for Hyperfy (mentioned by TheMattEmpire)
- System prompt details for teaching AI about Hyperfy architecture (mentioned by Shiffty)
- Create documentation for AI-powered model generation (mentioned by Dhin)
- Add Hyperfy documentation section for texture splatting workflow (mentioned by TheMattEmpire)

### Feature
- Resume development on text-to-VRM avatar generation with improved rigging success (mentioned by ash)
- AI generation functionality to be re-enabled on vibe.hyperfy.xyz (mentioned by vox)
- Implement Spring Bone support in Hyperfy for better VRM compatibility (mentioned by TheMattEmpire)
- Improve terrain mesh blending capabilities for better texture splatting and material blending (mentioned by TheMattEmpire)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-12

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy V2 Development
- V2 is being developed as an open-source, decentralized metaverse platform allowing users to create and host 3D worlds without coding knowledge
- Base code is already available, with native apps expected in about a week
- Apps are executing in Ashxn's local environment sooner than expected
- V1 worlds will remain hosted with no timeline for deprecation while V2 is being developed
- V2 offers improved performance, multi-instance hosting capabilities, and more flexibility
- Successfully deployed on Digital Ocean in 10 minutes, with a guide forthcoming

### Technical Infrastructure
- Ubuntu has been the most successful platform for setting up Hyperfy
- Windows/WSL users are encountering various issues during setup
- Some GLB files using Draco/Meshopt compression are causing compatibility issues
- Developers are discussing Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration to improve LLM assistance
- Recommendations to support Ollama for local LLM hosting
- VRMs are integrated in V2 core but need to be exposed via apps

### HYPER Token & Governance
- Registration period for the HYPER token airdrop has ended (January 12, 2025 deadline)
- Approximately 80M unclaimed tokens (11% of supply) are effectively removed from circulation
- Users needed to register Solana wallets by linking them to Ethereum addresses that held Hyperfy NFTs
- Many users reported "wallet not eligible" messages despite completing registration
- Significant discussions about tokenomics and governance models
- Former Decentraland contributors shared lessons about failed DAO governance models
- Many participants advocated for a "benevolent dictator" approach where Ash maintains significant control while incorporating community input
- Team is working on establishing a foundation for the DAO treasury

### 3D Design & Assets
- Discussions about VRM export workflows from Blender and Unity
- Troubleshooting of 3D model issues, particularly with MToon materials and disconnected parts
- GLB models causing screen flickering in Hyperfy worlds identified as a post-processing bug
- Debate about Blender-only versus Blender+Unity workflows for VRM creation

## Key Questions & Answers

- **Q: How do you pull up the menu shown in the Twitter post?**  
  **A:** Quick right-click release opens menu. Right click and hold and drag locks pointer for camera movement (Ashxn)

- **Q: Is it possible to NFT gate a world?**  
  **A:** Yes, through world portals where access is controlled by blockchain verification (maximus)

- **Q: What are the limits for a world to be loadable in under 5 minutes?**  
  **A:** It depends on world optimization; instances can be capped at around 100 people before creating new instances (Cynnx)

- **Q: Will V1 remain available?**  
  **A:** V1 will stay hosted with no timeline for deprecation (maximus)

- **Q: What is the timeline for V2?**  
  **A:** Base code is out now, native apps in about a week, with more user-friendly building tools coming later (maximus)

### Token & Airdrop
- **Q: Are there any plans for tokenomics?**  
  **A:** Nothing concrete yet but definitely coming. The team is open to hearing ideas on how the token could be used to drive a flywheel. (Morph and maximus)

- **Q: How much Hyper did World owners get as an airdrop?**  
  **A:** 100-151,200 tokens per world. (Uuuuuuuuu, localhost, and merk)

- **Q: Can I buy the hyper token on Uniswap?**  
  **A:** This token is on Solana, use Jupiter CEX. (Beats)

- **Q: Where can I see the tokenomics of the coin?**  
  **A:** Only official information available is on token.hyperfy.xyz. Team is focused on finalizing v2 build. (maximus)

- **Q: Did team say they would burn unclaimed tokens?**  
  **A:** Yes. (Sceth iii)

- **Q: How do I know when I'm able to claim?**  
  **A:** When the claims are updated it will show up on https://hyperfy.xyz/claim (Saori)

### 3D Design
- **Q: What might be causing VRM loading errors?**  
  **A:** Issues with MToon materials and disconnected head/body causing extra draw calls (Valiant)

- **Q: What's the best VRM exporting tool for Blender?**  
  **A:** VRM Addon for Blender with Blender 3.6.1, or newer extension for Blender 4.2+ (Ashxn and TheMattEmpire)

- **Q: Why would GLB models cause screen flickering in Hyperfy?**  
  **A:** Likely a post-processing bug, possibly related to materials (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Assistance
- **Valiant helped maximus** with a VRM file showing errors, identifying issues with MToon materials and disconnected head/body parts causing extra draw calls
- **Valiant analyzed GLB models** for vincentskele that were causing screen flickering, finding issues with janky normals and excessive materials (19 total)
- **Vincentskele shared a 3-step process** with maximus for setting up Hyperfy on VPS: do normal install, set env to domain, set up nginx with upload limits for GLBs
- **HPrivakos shared a Dockerfile** as an alternative solution for Windows users having trouble running Hyperfy
- **Ashxn explained** that some GLB files might be using Draco/Meshopt which needs to be added, recommending regular GLBs for now

### Asset Sharing & Recovery
- **Knar explained to bitpixi** how to use browser developer tools to download .glb files from V1 worlds
- **Valiant downloaded and emailed** all the models to bitpixi from their V1 world
- **TheMattEmpire shared** a newer Blender 4.2+ extension approach for VRM exporting

### Token Claim Support
- **Ash verified** both ETH addresses were properly linked to SOL addresses for luckyotis1992 who was concerned about "wallet not eligible" message
- **Maximus suggested** retrying and using different browser for localhost who was experiencing claim error with hardware wallet
- **Saori fixed** the issue behind the scenes for Destitute who registered but was still showing "wallet not eligible"
- **Ash added** DawnXue who missed the airdrop registration deadline to a list for potential future consideration when DAO launches

- **Model Optimization**: Discussions about reducing materials and fixing disconnected parts in avatars
- **Asset Extraction**: Methods shared for extracting 3D models from V1 worlds using browser developer tools

## Key Questions & Answers

### Platform & Development
- **Q**: Does nginx need any definitions around /assets?  
  **A**: The nginx definitions are missing (vincentskele)

- **Q**: Is VRM support live on V2?  
  **A**: VRMs are in V2 core, just need to be exposed via apps (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How can I see the latest version of hyperfy on github?  
  **A**: It's not an npm package yet, you can git clone or fork and run it as-is (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is it possible to NFT gate a world?  
  **A**: Yes, through world portals where access is controlled by flags that could reference blockchain data (maximus)

- **Q**: What are the limits for a world to be loadable in under 5 minutes?  
  **A**: It depends on world optimization, but instances can handle around 100 people before creating a new instance (Cynnx)

- **Q**: If I put a limit for each instance, does it create automatically a new instance when the limit is reached?  
  **A**: Yes, the 101st person will go to a new instance when trying to join (Cynnx)

### Token & Governance
- **Q**: Are there any plans for tokenomics?  
  **A**: Nothing concrete yet but definitely coming. The team is open to hearing ideas on how the token could be used to create a flywheel. (Morph and maximus)

- **Q**: How much Hyper did World owners get as an airdrop?  
  **A**: 151,200 tokens per World. (merk)

- **Q**: Can I buy the hyper token on Uniswap?  
  **A**: This token is on Solana, use Jupiter CEX. (Beats)

- **Q**: Did team say they would burn unclaimed tokens?  
  **A**: Yes. (Sceth iii)

- **Q**: What percentage of governance should be dictatorship vs. funds for DAO to vote on?  
  **A**: Various responses: 60/35/5, 80/20, 95/5 in favor of team control. (multiple users)

### 3D Design
- **Q**: What's the best VRM exporting tool to use with Blender?  
  **A**: Several options mentioned: VRM Addon for Blender with Blender 3.6.1 (Ashxn), UniVRM tools with Unity (TheMattEmpire), and Blender 4.2+ extension (TheMattEmpire)

- **Q**: Has anyone experienced a seemingly good GLB breaking their world?  
  **A**: Yes, Ashxn confirmed the issue happens at certain angles and is likely a post-processing bug (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Support
- **Valiant** helped **maximus** with a VRM file showing errors, identifying issues with MToon materials and disconnected head/body parts causing extra draw calls

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-12

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Lightmap Integration**: MetaRick and Ashxn worked on implementing Needle tools lightmaps in Hyperfy, with Marcel from Needle providing the actual shaderchunk code used in their engine.
- **Camera Systems**: ~/drdoge.eth developed camera anchors with spherical triggers that automatically switch camera views based on proximity, allowing for different camera angles and tracking modes.
- **UV Scrolling Scripts**: hiroP shared two script versions for texture scrolling - a basic version and an advanced version with X/Y scrolling, loop/bounce playback modes, and easing functions.
- **Audio Manipulation**: Ashxn mentioned the `audio.setPlaybackRate()` function for modulating audio pitch in Hyperfy.

### HYPER Token & Platform Economics
- **Token Utility**: Ashxn clarified that Hyperfy is "HYPER centric" - HYPER is the exclusive currency for both governance (voting, staking) and marketplace transactions.
- **Staking Rewards**: Platform fees will be distributed to stakers, creating a direct correlation between platform success and token value, similar to dividend stocks.
- **Additional Uses**: HYPER tokens can be used to tip HYP app creators and are integrated into demo games like Fallen.
- **Business Development**: Ashxn disclosed that AI16Z attempted to acquire Hyperfy, but the team declined to maintain autonomy.

### Community & Learning
- **Tutorial Planning**: 0mka offered to conduct a tutorial session on Monday covering UI, world storage, and player information retrieval for creating a voting/ballot system.
- **VR Festival**: MetaRick suggested creating a Hyperfy world project for next year's Raindance Immersive festival.
- **Documentation Sharing**: Community members shared links to HYP format documentation and GitHub repositories with example hyps to help newcomers.

### Issues & Improvements
- **UI Bug**: Users identified that when the UI is toggled off (Z key) and a user presses Enter, toggling the UI back on causes the chat to become locked in position.
- **World Cleaning**: For self-hosted instances with bloated world folders, 0mka recommended running "npm run world:clean" to clean up unused assets.
- **V2 World Features**: Ash mentioned plans for automatic script selection based on file type when dragging and dropping files into V2 worlds.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it possible to create a hyp file that could connect lightmaps across different geometry and textures like needle tools does?**  
A: Marcel from Needle provided the actual shaderchunk code they use for this functionality.

**Q: How does Hyperfy handle bloated world folders with deleted assets when self-hosting?**  
A: Run "npm run world:clean" to clean up unused assets.

**Q: Do we have docs or tutorial for building app in hyperfy?**  
A: hiroP shared documentation link for HYP format, and 0mka offered a Monday tutorial session focused on building a voting/ballot system.

**Q: Will people be restricted to only use hyper or are they free to use other cryptos as well for the marketplace?**  
A: Hyper is the only currency on the platform.

**Q: Where will the staking rewards come from?**  
A: Staking rewards come from the platform fee distribution.

**Q: What can you do with Hyper tokens?**  
A: You can use hyper tokens to tip hyp app creators, purchase marketplace items, and participate in governance.

**Q: What does it mean "tried to buy hyperfy"?**  
A: AI16Z wanted to buy the company, but Hyperfy declined to retain autonomy.

**Q: Is there a solution for setting collision on/off when dragging and dropping a model into a V2 world?**  
A: Not yet, but auto-select scripts based on file type are planned as a future feature.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Lightmap Implementation**: Marcel 🌵 provided the actual shaderchunk code from Needle Engine to help Ashxn and MetaRick implement lightmap scaling and offset in Hyperfy.

- **Self-hosting Support**: 0mka helped Alephic with a bloated world folder issue by sharing the command "npm run world:clean" and linking to the relevant script in the GitHub repository.

- **Newcomer Onboarding**: Multiple community members (hiroP, 0mka, b0gie) offered help to Cayden0207 who was confused about portals and building apps in Hyperfy:
  - hiroP shared documentation links
  - 0mka offered a Monday tutorial session
  - b0gie offered to make a video demo

- **UV Scrolling Scripts**: hiroP shared two versions of UV scrolling scripts with different features and configurations for the community to use.

- **UI Bug Workaround**: Agent12 suggested pressing "/" after entering Z mode as a workaround for the chat UI locking issue.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-12

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Lightmap Integration**: MetaRick requested help implementing Needle tools lightmaps in Hyperfy. Ashxn investigated the code needed to apply lightmap textures correctly, and Marcel from Needle provided the specific shader code used in their engine.
- **Camera Anchors**: ~/drdoge.eth developed camera anchors with spherical triggers that automatically switch camera views based on player proximity, allowing for different camera angles and tracking modes.
- **UV Scrolling Scripts**: hiroP shared two script versions for texture scrolling in Hyperfy - a basic version and an advanced version with X/Y scrolling, loop/bounce playback modes, and configurable easing functions.
- **Audio Manipulation**: Ashxn mentioned the `audio.setPlaybackRate()` function for modulating audio pitch in Hyperfy applications.
- **World Cleaning**: 0mka shared the command `npm run world:clean` for removing unused assets from self-hosted world folders.

### Platform & Community
- **HYPER Token Utility**: Ashxn clarified that Hyperfy is "HYPER centric," with HYPER being the exclusive currency for both governance (voting, staking) and marketplace transactions.
- **Staking Mechanism**: Platform fees will be distributed to stakers as rewards, creating a direct correlation between platform success and token value.
- **LLM Recognition**: Community members noted that LLMs are beginning to reference Hyperfy in their responses, indicating growing awareness of the platform.
- **Acquisition Attempt**: Ashxn disclosed that AI16z had attempted to acquire Hyperfy, but the team declined to maintain autonomy.
- **Terminology**: 0mka suggested "hyperVerse" as the preferred term over "metaverse."

### Educational & Support
- **App Development Resources**: Community members provided resources for building apps in Hyperfy, including documentation links and GitHub repositories with example hyps.
- **Interactive App Tutorial**: 0mka offered to conduct a walkthrough of creating a voting/ballot system during a Monday session, demonstrating UI implementation, world storage, and player information retrieval.
- **Portal Functionality**: Community members offered to create video demonstrations explaining how portals work in Hyperfy.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it possible to create a hyp file that could connect lightmaps across different geometry and textures like Needle tools does?**  
A: Ashxn investigated but couldn't fully implement it; Marcel from Needle later provided the specific shader code they use.

**Q: Will people be restricted to only use HYPER or are they free to use other cryptos as well for the marketplace?**  
A: HYPER is the only currency on the platform.

**Q: Where will the staking rewards come from?**  
A: Staking rewards come from the platform fee distribution.

**Q: What can you do with HYPER tokens?**  
A: You can use HYPER tokens to tip hyp app creators and make marketplace purchases (emotes, avatars, wearables, apps).

**Q: How do I clean up unused assets in my self-hosted world folder?**  
A: Run "npm run world:clean".

**Q: Do we have docs or tutorial for building app in Hyperfy?**  
A: Links to documentation and resources were provided, including Hyperfy documentation on HYP format and GitHub repositories with example hyps.

**Q: How can I modulate audio pitch in Hyperfy?**  
A: Use `audio.setPlaybackRate(rate)` where 1 is the default speed.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Lightmap Implementation**: Ashxn attempted to extract and apply lightmap textures for MetaRick, and Marcel later provided the shader code from Needle Engine that handles lightmap application.

- **World Cleaning**: 0mka helped Alephic with bloated world folders by providing the command "npm run world:clean" and linking to the relevant script in the GitHub repository.

- **App Development Guidance**: hiroP and 0mka provided Cayden0207 with documentation links and resources for building Hyperfy apps, with 0mka offering to conduct a walkthrough of creating a voting system.

- **Portal Functionality**: ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/ and 0mka offered assistance to Cayden0207 regarding how portals work in Hyperfy, including promises to create video demonstrations.

- **UV Scrolling Scripts**: hiroP shared two versions of UV scrolling scripts with the community, providing different features and configurations for texture animation.

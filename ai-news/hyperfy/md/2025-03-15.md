# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-15

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Discussions
- **3D Rendering Techniques**: Ashxn shared a grass rendering technique that forces grass normals upward to create blades that blend into the ground while maintaining PBR material properties. This allows grass to correctly respond to lighting changes while blending seamlessly with the ground.
- **UV Scrolling Effects**: Developers discussed UV scrolling with transparent emissive textures to create glass effects that allow visibility underneath.
- **LiveKit Integration**: Significant discussion about implementing LiveKit for voice chat functionality, with recommendations to use LiveKit Cloud and implement separate client/server voice chat systems.
- **Interactive Elements**: Implementation of pointer events (onPointerEnter, onPointerLeave, onPointerDown) for creating interactive elements like projector screens, with confirmation that colliders aren't needed.
- **Procedural Terrain**: Conversations about procedural terrain generation with collision detection and the need for a terrain node in core.
- **Custom Item Creation**: Developers shared code examples for creating interactive items with hooks for client-server communication.
- **Physics Implementation**: Discussion of physics engines, specifically Cannon.js for various game mechanics.

### Content Creation & Design
- **Modular Racetrack System**: TheMattEmpire is developing a modular road/racetrack system for the marketplace, including specialized sections like pit lanes, Y-intersections, and entrance/exit points.
- **Avatar Resources**: ToxSam announced an update to opensourceavatars.com, adding a VRM viewer for inspecting VRM metadata. Some users reported issues with certain avatars stretching when placed on avatar stands in v2.
- **Discord Integration**: A Discord app for play.hyperfy.xyz that broadcasts chat messages and player join/leave notifications was mentioned, though it temporarily broke before being restored.

### Marketplace & Token Discussion
- **HYPER Token**: Conversations in the hyper channel primarily revolved around price action of the Hyperfy token relative to SOL, with some users expressing concern about performance.
- **Community Events**: Announcements about upcoming live music performances with a fashion show and DJ from New York City.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is UV scrolling used on the bottom thing?**  
A: Yes, it's UV scrolling a mesh with a transparent emissive texture so you can still see underneath the glass.

**Q: How much will LiveKit end up costing? Better to selfhost?**  
A: They have a free plan and it's pretty good.

**Q: Why are some objects visible from far away while others only appear when closer?**  
A: This is due to LOD (Level of Detail) settings.

**Q: Does the mesh need to have colliders for pointer events to work?**  
A: No colliders are needed for pointer events to function.

**Q: What's the new play-world channel for?**  
A: It's showcasing the new discord app that broadcasts chat messages and notifications for players joining and leaving the world for play.hyperfy.xyz.

**Q: What's causing death respawn functionality to fail?**  
A: The issue was caused by duplicate grid floors created by users, not an actual bug. Deleting the extra floors and repinning the floor restored proper functionality.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Voice Chat Implementation**  
   Ashxn helped Omka implement voice chat with LiveKit, explaining that LiveKit Cloud is the best option and providing guidance on setting up client/server systems.

2. **Object Visibility Understanding**  
   Omka assisted masia02 in understanding why some objects are visible at different distances by explaining LOD (Level of Detail) and providing documentation links.

3. **Interactive Projector Screen**  
   Ashxn helped cru create an interactive projector screen by providing pointer event methods and confirming no colliders were needed.

4. **Teleportation System**  
   Saori explained to Omka that teleporters work in pairs and need to be configured properly for implementing teleportation between points.

5. **Racetrack Design Improvements**  
   BallisticBanana provided TheMattEmpire with feedback on making track entrances/exits look more professional, referencing real-world examples like Silverstone's pit lane design.

6. **Interface Navigation Help**  
   Maximus helped Zen understand the differences between v1 and v2 interfaces in HyperWorld.Host, explaining that v2 doesn't have all basic apps in menu and suggesting resources.

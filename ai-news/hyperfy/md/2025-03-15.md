- **Trading Activity**: A Hyperdash link was shared showing a trader who accumulated significant profits (~6M), with brief discussion about potential market manipulation.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: Is that UV scrolling on the bottom thing?  
  **A**: Yes, it's UV scrolling a mesh with a transparent emissive texture so you can still see underneath the glass.

- **Q**: Can we change gravity?  
  **A**: Not yet.

- **Q**: How do I implement teleportation with UI?  
  **A**: You need two teleporters that connect to each other, they teleport to each other or however you configure them.

- **Q**: Why are some objects visible from far away while others only appear when closer?  
  **A**: LOD (Level of Detail) determines visibility at different distances.

- **Q**: Does the mesh need to have colliders for interactivity to work?  
  **A**: No colliders needed.

### Services & Tools
- **Q**: How much will LiveKit end up costing? Is it better to self-host?  
  **A**: They have a free plan and it's pretty good.

- **Q**: What's the new play-world channel for?  
  **A**: It's showcasing the new discord app: it broadcasts chat messages and also notifications for players joining and leaving the world for play.hyperfy.xyz.

- **Q**: What's this hyperdash?  
  **A**: Hyperliquid data.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Development Assistance
- **Ashxn** helped **cru** implement interactivity for a projector screen by providing node.onPointerEnter, node.onPointerLeave, and node.onPointerDown functions, confirming no colliders were needed.

- **Omka** assisted **masia02** in understanding why some objects are visible at different distances by explaining LOD (Level of Detail) and providing documentation links.

- **Saori** guided **Omka** on implementing teleportation with UI, explaining that two teleporters are needed that connect to each other.

- **Ashxn** supported **Omka** with implementing LiveKit for voice chat, suggesting using LiveKit cloud and explaining how to set up client and server systems.

- **Ashxn** clarified for **bear** how the hooks.call mechanism works in the item system, explaining that it sends messages between client and server for specific item instances.

### Design & Asset Support
- **ToxSam** helped **Omka** troubleshoot avatar stretching issues, confirming others had reported similar problems with v2, while noting avatars work fine in v1.

- **Ashxn** shared detailed grass rendering techniques with channel members, explaining methods for forcing grass normals up and using custom shadow properties to create realistic grass that responds to lighting changes.

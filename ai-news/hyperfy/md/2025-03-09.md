# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-09

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development & Launch
- Hyperfy is approaching a significant platform launch that will open it to non-developers
- Developers are actively building worlds in Hyperfy 2.0, with excitement about its mainstream potential
- Regular tutorial sessions are being held, with Episode 4 focusing on the .hyp app format, Hypkg (mod manager), and App Rollup for external Hyp development

### Game Development
- Ashxn shared details about an internal high-risk PVP game being developed to showcase the technology
- The game will require Hyper tokens to play and feature weapon-based combat (swords, consumables)
- Rewards from kills will go back to the Hyper ecosystem
- Discussions about physics implementation and combat systems are ongoing

### Technical Discussions
- **Avatar Systems**: Extensive discussion about VRM format and runtime wearables
- **Physics & Collisions**: Hyperfy Blender addon highlighted as a solution for creating collision maps
- **Raybeam Implementation**: Code snippets shared for creating raybeams from character bones
- **Water & Ocean Effects**: Techniques using UV scrolling, mesh movement, and particle effects
- **State Persistence**: Methods for storing data in the server's SQLite database

### 3D Design & Optimization
- Critique of a 3D arm/glove model shared via Twitter, focusing on file size optimization (140kb considered excessive)
- Discussion on triangle count vs. texture compression as optimization strategies
- Identification of inefficient UV layout in 2K textures as a primary issue

### Market & Token
- Hyperfy token price tracked during a market downturn (dropped from ~7M to 6.2M market cap, a 6.1% decrease)
- Broader crypto market experiencing significant losses with Bitcoin falling below $80k
- Despite market decline, some noted that "hyperfy is performing well through this all things considered"

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
- **Q**: How are directions derived for raybeams?  
  **A**: Directions are normalized Vector3, obtained by applying quaternion rotation to a forward vector

- **Q**: How to persist state for an App to the sqlite database on the server?  
  **A**: Use world.get(key) and world.set(key, value) on the server side

- **Q**: How do collisions work with custom .glb files?  
  **A**: Use the Hyperfy Blender addon which handles collision setup

- **Q**: Is there a way to play video in the scene?  
  **A**: Not yet officially supported

### Platform & Hardware
- **Q**: What's the best laptop to play hyperfy? Is the new MacBook Air a decent choice?  
  **A**: The new MacBook Air would work well

- **Q**: Does anyone recommend a cool free svg logo maker?  
  **A**: recraft.ai

### Game Features
- **Q**: Will we get ships in the pvp game?  
  **A**: No, it's weapon based (swords, consumables, etc.)

- **Q**: NFTs? or just in game?  
  **A**: In-game, but rewards from killing go back to hyper

- **Q**: Would that mean you can't play pvp if you don't have hyper?  
  **A**: Correct, need hyper to play this particular game

### 3D Design
- **Q**: What's causing the high file size in the arm model?  
  **A**: Initially thought to be high triangle count, but later identified as inefficient texture usage with 2K textures

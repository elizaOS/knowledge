# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-12

**Date: March 12, 2025**

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Updates
- **Hyperfy V2 Progress**: Discussions highlighted automatic instancing in V2 compared to manual instancing in V1, with several developers sharing implementation techniques for both versions.
- **New Model App**: Ashxn developed a Model app that allows importing any GLB file with toggles for collision and scale adjustment, similar to V1 functionality but requiring the latest dev build.
- **Procedural Generation**: Shiffty shared a procedural city generation app that generated significant interest for its potential applications in world building.
- **Particle Systems**: Ashxn implemented a new CPU-based particle system with collision support as an alternative to using UI nodes.
- **Communication Patterns**: Developers discussed app.emit, app.send, world.emit, and world.on patterns, with suggestions to rename app.send to app.broadcast for clarity.
- **Math Functions Issue**: Several developers reported Math functions (like Math.sqrt) breaking in the latest dev build, with Ashxn pushing a fix to properly enable all Math functionality.
- **Vector Field Implementation**: MayD524 shared work on a vector field type implementation for position, rotation, and scale.

### AI & Agents
- **Gemma2 Discussion**: Maximus expressed excitement about Gemma2, highlighting its quality responses compared to other small models, increased context window (128k), and multi-modal capabilities.
- **Local vs. Cloud Models**: Discussions about the benefits of local AI models for unlimited usage and data sovereignty versus cloud models like Claude and ChatGPT.
- **SpacetimeDB**: Mentioned as a potential tool for managing game states when combined with Hyperfy.
- **AI Agents Documentation**: Omka shared documentation links about AI agents and requested feedback for updates.

### Community Showcases
- **Networked Gun Implementation**: A demonstration of guns that can be dropped and swapped, with proper origin placement in Blender.
- **Portal Functionality**: Customizable teleportation between locations with UI width/height options.
- **Flying Behavior**: Implementation of randomized flying for clone objects.
- **Parenting Advice App**: A complex application using 10 AI agents with different methodologies.
- **Open Source Avatars**: ToxSam announced the launch of an updated website (opensourceavatars.com) and requested feedback.

### Token & Infrastructure
- **Hyperbridging Issue**: A user reported CORS errors when attempting to use hyperbridging, with transactions getting stuck at "waiting for wormhole consensus."
- **Token Information**: Community members pointed to token.hyperfy.xyz for information about the Hyperfy token, with mentions of a new website in development that will better integrate token information.
- **Deployment Options**: Discussion about Coolify as a solution for container configuration and deployment of Hyperfy worlds.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Model Instancing**
- Q: Do textures/images instance in Hyperfy V1 or still use all the data every time?
- A: World building by default auto-instances everything. If you drag and drop a glb 10 times, or duplicate it 10 times, players only download that model once. (Ashxn)

**Model Optimization**
- Q: Would it be better to put the space together with modular parts in world?
- A: In V1, you can use alt+D linked duplicates in Blender and use gltf.report with a specific instancing script. In V2, it will auto-instance linked duplicates. (𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)

**Clone Geometry**
- Q: Is there a way to not have clones use the same instanced geometry?
- A: Yes, set mesh.linked=false. (Ashxn)

**Getting Started**
- Q: Is there a video tutorial that takes you from clone git to launching your world, to loading your first asset?
- A: https://hyperfy.how/community/tutorials/ (Saori)

**World Customization**
- Q: Can I disable flying for my world?
- A: Flying is only enabled in build mode. (Ashxn)

**Environment Customization**
- Q: Is there a way to remove the ground object in your world file?
- A: It's the base-environment.glb. (Saori)

**AI Models**
- Q: What makes Gemma2 exciting?
- A: The increased context window and motivation for multi-modal capabilities (image/OCR/etc). (maximus)

**Token Information**
- Q: How come there's no link out to dexscreener etc from the hyperfy website... or any mention of the token / tokenomics etc?
- A: The very first thing in #announcements is our CA and link to tokenomics. We're working on new site soon. There's a whole site for token at token.hyperfy.xyz. (Ashxn, Saori, Omka)

## Community Help & Collaboration

**Model Optimization Techniques**
- 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 provided Paradoxx with a specific script for gltf.report to enable instancing in V1 and explained differences between V1 and V2 instancing approaches.

**Animation Assistance**
- Ashxn helped Gert-Jan Akerboom with rotating butterflies individually by suggesting using an empty with two planes inside for easier flapping animation and movement.

**Portal Configuration**
- 0mka explained to Gert-Jan Akerboom how to use the 'Set' button in the inspect pane to configure portal destinations for teleportation functionality.

**Deployment Solutions**
- peezy explained Coolify's capabilities to devilsadvocate.sol, including docker-compose deployment, separate volume for world, and setting up modded worlds.

**Math Function Fixes**
- Ashxn pushed a fix for multiple users experiencing issues with Math functions (like Math.sqrt) breaking in the procedural city app.

**WebP Image Loading**
- Ashxn investigated WebP image loading errors reported by Saori and identified potential causes.

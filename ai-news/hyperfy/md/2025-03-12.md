# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-12

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Hyperfy V2 Framework Improvements**: Discussions about communication patterns between clients and servers, with suggestions to rename `app.send` to `app.broadcast` on the server side for clarity.
- **Math Function Issues**: Problems with Math functions in the latest dev build were identified, particularly `Math.sqrt` breaking in the procedural city app. Ashxn pushed a fix to properly enable all Math functions.
- **Model App Development**: Ashxn developed a Model app that allows users to import any GLB file with toggles for collision and scale adjustment, similar to v1 functionality but requiring the latest dev version.
- **Hyperbridge Issues**: Users reported that Hyperbridge transactions go through but get stuck at "waiting for wormhole consensus" due to CORS errors, possibly related to metadata retrieval.

### Community Projects
- **Procedural City Generation**: Shiffty developed a procedural city generation system that was well-received by the community.
- **Third-Person Shooter Pack**: Saori implemented a third-person shooter pack.
- **CPU-based Particle System**: Ashxn created a CPU-based particle system as an alternative to UI nodes, with support for collision.
- **Open Source Avatars Update**: ToxSam announced the launch of an updated website (opensourceavatars.com) and requested feedback from users.

### AI and Agents
- **Gemma2 Discussion**: Maximus expressed excitement about Gemma2, highlighting its quality responses compared to other small models, increased context window (up from 8k), and multi-modal capabilities, though noting the 12b parameter size might be challenging for local setups.
- **AI Agent Documentation**: Omka shared documentation links about AI agents and requested feedback for enhancement.
- **SpacetimeDB Exploration**: Discussion about SpacetimeDB as a potential tool for managing game states/activities that Bitcraft uses, with conversations about different deployment approaches.

### Asset Optimization
- **Model Instancing Techniques**: Detailed exchange between Paradoxx and 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 about optimizing 3D models in Hyperfy V1 by using instancing to reduce file size and server load.
- **AI-Generated Textures**: Paradoxx demonstrated a technique using AI-generated image planes from krea.ai for creating low-poly cyberpunk building facades, sharing detailed prompts for generating orthographic building textures.

### Platform Updates
- **New Website Development**: Saori mentioned work on a new website to replace the old one that sold NFT land.
- **Documentation Updates**: Omka requested screenshots of V2 worlds to update Hyperfy.how from old V1 images and announced that the Hyperfy avatar documentation was updated to include a section on Open Source Avatars.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a way to not have clones use the same instanced geometry?**  
A: Yes, set mesh.linked=false (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Is there a video tutorial that takes you from clone git to launching your world, to loading your first asset?**  
A: https://hyperfy.how/community/tutorials/ (answered by Saori)

**Q: Can I disable flying for my world?**  
A: Flying is only enabled in build mode (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How am I supposed to connect into a Docker Postgres container remotely without opening up a port to do admin tasks?**  
A: You need to expose the port, it's the only way (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Anything specific that hypes you up about Gemma2?**  
A: Biggest thing is the increased context window and the motivation to do multi-modal (image/ocr/etc) (answered by maximus)

**Q: How come there's no link out to dexscreener etc from the hyperfy website... or any mention of the token / tokenomics etc?**  
A: The very first thing in #token-info is our CA and link to tokenomics. We're working on a new site soon. (answered by Ashxn and Saori)

**Q: Question about Hyperfy V1 and optimisation: I know how to instance models, but someone mentioned that textures/images dont instance / still use all the data every time?**  
A: World building by default auto-instances everything. If you drag and drop a glb 10 times into the world, or if you drag and drop it just once and duplicate it 10 times, players only download that model once. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Is there a way to remove the ground object in your world file?**  
A: It's the base-environment.glb (answered by Saori)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Tutorial Resources**: Saori helped eclipsingbinary by providing a link to comprehensive tutorials at hyperfy.how when they were looking for getting started resources.

- **Particle System Animation**: Ashxn assisted Gert-Jan Akerboom with butterfly rotation in a particle system by suggesting using an empty container in Blender with wings inside for easier animation.

- **Model Instancing**: Ashxn helped Shiffty prevent clones from using the same instanced geometry by providing the solution to set mesh.linked=false.

- **Deployment Options**: Peezy explained Coolify's deployment methods to devilsadvocate.sol, including docker-compose integration and separate volume setup for world, as well as additional features like separate build servers and multiple VPS deployments.

- **AI Prompts for Textures**: Paradoxx shared detailed AI prompts with 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 for generating building facades using krea.ai, helping them create orthographic building textures.

- **Model App Development**: Ashxn developed a Model app for fractilians and other non-coders who needed a way to import GLB models with collision and scale options without using Blender.

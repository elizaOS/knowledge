# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Issues & Troubleshooting
- **World Accessibility Problems**: Gh0stt's world became inaccessible due to crashing scripts. Ash suggested using the URL parameter "?safemode=1" to disable script execution, but this wasn't available in the older Numinia version Gh0stt was using. Ash provided a JavaScript code snippet as a workaround to force all apps to have no script.
- **Version Discrepancies**: Discussion revealed that Numinia was running an older version without the safemode feature, highlighting the need for version synchronization.
- **Chess Game Development**: Gh0stt shared a pre-release chess game (https://pre.chess.numen.games) that had some connection issues.

### Development & Implementation
- **Vector3 Configuration**: Discussions about implementing Vector3 configuration options in apps, with Shiffty suggesting parsing it manually using string or number type.
- **Asset Storage**: Brief mentions of storing assets on IPFS.
- **API Key Support**: HypPrivakos confirmed that API key support for hosted worlds is in development.

### Resources & Documentation
- **Hyperfy Agents**: Fibelius shared resources about Hyperfy agents, including a HackMD document about agentic game behavior and links to Hyperfy documentation, noting that the demo page (agents.hyperfy.xyz) was offline.
- **AI Integration**: Brief discussion about adding AI to worlds, with Fibelius sharing a Twitter/X post about a system prompt for GPT-5 Codex.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Issues
- **Critical World Access Problem**: Gh0stt reported a serious issue where their Hyperfy-based world became completely inaccessible due to crashing scripts, with no built-in way to disable script execution.
- **Version Discrepancies**: DevStarlight noted that Numinia hasn't been updated since the S3 merge into dev, explaining why certain features like safemode were unavailable to some users.
- **Workaround Solutions**: Ash proposed using the "safemode=1" URL parameter and later suggested a JavaScript console hack to disable scripts by nullifying blueprint scripts, though this solution disabled the app list interface as well.

### Asset Management
- **IPFS Integration**: Brief discussion about IPFS asset hosting capabilities, with clarification that currently only assets (not entire worlds) are hosted on IPFS.

### Development Features
- **Configuration Options**: Discussion about implementing Vector3 types in app configuration, with suggestions to parse it manually using string or number types.

## Key Questions & Answers

A: Add `?safemode=1` to the URL (Ash)

**Q: Worlds on IPFS?!**  
A: Just the assets are on IPFS for now, not entire worlds (Gh0stt)

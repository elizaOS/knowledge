# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-27

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Philosophy & Technical Architecture
- **Frontloading vs. Backloading**: Ashxn explained their development philosophy of "frontloading" - investing significant effort in building strong foundations early to avoid technical debt later, contrasting with "backloading" (rushing development and accumulating technical debt)
- **Platform Evolution**: The original Hyperfy platform was described as "backloaded," which limited innovation potential
- **Session Management**: Both v1 and v2 of Hyperfy lack built-in reconnection logic - users start entirely new sessions when disconnected, creating challenges for state persistence

### Token Economics & Blockchain Integration
- **Token Utility Concerns**: Community members expressed concerns about the token's future and lack of clear tokenomics documentation
- **Blockchain Necessity**: Ashxn emphasized that blockchain technology is essential for creating "truly portable turing complete digital collectables" which can't be achieved with fiat currency alone
- **Marketplace Vision**: The token is positioned as a key component in Hyperfy's creator and end-user marketplace

### User Authentication & State Persistence
- **Player ID Limitations**: Discussion about the limitations of using playerIds for authentication, as they reset with cache clears and don't persist across devices
- **Custom State Tracking**: Developers need to implement their own state tracking using player IDs to maintain user state across disconnections
- **Authentication Alternatives**: Suggestions to set up proper authentication (e.g., Supabase) instead of relying on playerIds

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does v2 have any reconnection logic for disconnected users? Was this handled the same way in v1?**  
A: "Both v1 and v2 don't have reconnection logic and if you get disconnected you just reload and start from spawn again." (Ashxn)

**Q: Is it possible to take a screenshot of the world programmatically and save it locally?**  
A: "Haven't added a snapshot function to the engine yet." (Ashxn)

**Q: Is there an outline of the future tokenomics or a proposal somewhere on the Hyperfy website?**  
A: "I'm working on a deck that goes into more detail about all of this and we can link to it on the company site." (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Reconnection Strategy Guidance**
   - Helper: Ashxn
   - Context: HiroP was seeking solutions for handling user reconnection in applications like quizzes
   - Resolution: Advised tracking progression on external servers using player IDs to restore state when users reconnect

2. **Screenshot Workarounds**
   - Helper: Agent12
   - Context: Gert-Jan Akerboom wanted to take programmatic screenshots in Hyperfy
   - Resolution: Suggested using Shift + Windows + S for manual screenshots on Windows as a temporary solution

3. **Disconnection Troubleshooting**
   - Helper: HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host
   - Context: Discussion about causes of user disconnections
   - Resolution: Pointed out that user connection issues can be mistaken for server problems

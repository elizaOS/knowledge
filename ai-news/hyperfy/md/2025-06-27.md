# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-27

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Philosophy & Strategy
- **Frontloading vs. Backloading Development**: Ashxn explained Hyperfy's approach of "frontloading" development work—investing significant effort in building strong foundations before scaling, rather than "backloading" which creates technical debt. The original Hyperfy platform suffered from technical debt that limited innovation.
- **Reconnection Handling**: Both Hyperfy v1 and v2 don't maintain session state after disconnection, requiring users to start from spawn points upon reconnection. This presents challenges for applications requiring state persistence.
- **Platform Independence**: Several users debated whether Hyperfy's success depends on ElizaOS becoming mainstream, with many disagreeing with this premise and emphasizing Hyperfy's standalone capabilities.

### Technical Discussions
- **Lightmap Implementation**: Detailed discussion about implementing lightmaps in glTF models, with two approaches highlighted:
  1. Baked Emissive Lightmaps (simple but sacrifices material properties)
  2. Needle's Additive Lightmap Overlay (preserves PBR materials using a second UV channel)
- **UDIM Textures**: Exploration of combining UDIM textures with additive lightmaps to achieve high-resolution texturing while minimizing draw calls for WebXR optimization.
- **Custom Agents**: User ~/drdoge.eth mentioned having "home-brewed agents" that don't run on ELIZA, suggesting alternative approaches to agent development.

### Token Strategy & Economics
- **Hyper Token Integration**: Ashxn emphasized that blockchain and the Hyper token are essential for their planned creator and user marketplace, particularly for enabling portable digital collectibles.
- **Tokenomics Documentation**: Ashxn acknowledged community concerns about tokenomics clarity and mentioned working on a detailed deck to explain their vision.
- **Platform Integration**: Clarified that Hyper is "baked into the protocols of the platform and marketplace," similar to other platform-token relationships like Otherside+ApeCoin.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: If I understand correctly, v2 doesn't have any reconnection logic so if a user is disconnected they start an entirely new session when they reconnect. Was this handled the same way in v1?**  
A: Yes, both v1 and v2 don't have reconnection logic and if you get disconnected you just reload and start from spawn again. (Ashxn)

**Q: What are you guys doing to handle reconnection - any tips/gotchas I need to be mindful of?**  
A: You have to track progression if it's meaningful to remember it. If your apps keep track of this stuff on the server, even in memory, and use the players ID then they can restore that when they reconnect. (Ashxn)

**Q: I want the camera to go up on the y axis, look down and take a pic of the world and then save that pic locally on my pc. Is this possible?**  
A: Haven't added a snapshot function to the engine yet. (Ashxn)

**Q: Why will Hyperfy not be successful unless elizaOS is successful?**  
A: This is a limited view. Hyperfy has many capabilities beyond Eliza integration, and is already successful as an expanding open source meta game engine. (0mka)

**Q: Is there an outline of the future tokenomics or a proposal somewhere on the Hyperfy website?**  
A: I'm working on a deck that goes into more detail about all of this and we can link to it on the company site. (Ashxn)

**Q: Couldn't HYPER be the universal currency so people can on and off ramp to specific project-lead currencies, while remaining compatible with the platform?**  
A: Hyper is baked into the protocols of the platform and marketplace. This is no different than otherside + apecoin, decentraland + mana etc. (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Reconnection Handling Guidance**:
   - Helper: Ashxn | Helpee: hiroP
   - Context: Understanding reconnection handling in Hyperfy v1 and v2
   - Resolution: Explained that both versions lack reconnection logic and suggested server-side state tracking using playerIds

2. **Screenshot Functionality Workaround**:
   - Helper: Agent12 | Helpee: Gert-Jan Akerboom
   - Context: Taking screenshots in Hyperfy
   - Resolution: Suggested using Shift + Windows + S for manual screenshots on Windows

3. **Lightmap Implementation Discussion**:
   - Helper: Ashxn | Helpee: vox
   - Context: Discussion about implementing lightmaps in glTF
   - Resolution: Shared information about a proof of concept for native lightmaps in the Hyperfy Blender addon using the second UV channel

4. **glTF Standards Resources**:
   - Helper: maximus | Helpee: vox
   - Context: Looking for resources on glTF standards development
   - Resolution: Suggested the Open Metaverse Interoperability server as a resource for glTF standards development

5. **Hyper Token Usage Examples**:
   - Helper: maximus | Helpee: ai16zgm
   - Context: Discussion about whether creators would use Hyper tokens
   - Resolution: Provided examples of Hyper tokens being used in various worlds (HyperWorld.host tips, omkas taco cart, Shifty's projectiles)

## Action Items

### Technical
- Implement server-side state tracking for persistent experiences using playerIds (hiroP)
- Consider more robust authentication (like Supabase) instead of relying solely on playerIds (hiroP)
- Create custom agents that don't rely on ELIZA (~/drdoge.eth)
- Implement blockchain infrastructure for creator and end user marketplace (Ashxn)
- Develop system for portable Turing-complete digital collectibles (Ashxn)
- Explore implementation of UDIM textures with additive lightmaps in glTF (vox)
- Consider HDR format optimization for lightmaps (Ashxn)
- Develop custom extension for Hyperfy supporting UDIM with additive lightmaps (vox)

### Feature
- Add snapshot functionality to the engine (world.snapshot(width, height)) (Ashxn)
- Implement spinning cubes in world (jokingly mentioned) (0mka)

### Documentation
- Create and publish a detailed deck explaining tokenomics and platform vision (Ashxn)
- Update website to show available worlds people can explore (MUDBONE)
- Clarify how Hyper token integrates with the platform protocols (Ashxn)
- Document the implementation of native lightmaps in Hyperfy Blender addon (Ashxn)
- Record and share builder calls as a way for newcomers to learn about Hyperfy's capabilities (0mka)

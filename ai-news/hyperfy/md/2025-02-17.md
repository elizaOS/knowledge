# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-17

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Infrastructure
- **Hyperfy V2 Open Source Transition**: Discussions about self-hosting options versus using services like hyperworld.host for non-technical users
- **Cross-Chain Strategy**: Hyperfy will operate across both Solana (for token trading) and Ethereum (for custom contracts with financial components)
- **App Configuration Challenges**: Developers discussed maintaining UI state during property changes, with solutions like adding an "Edit Mode" switch
- **File Management**: Concerns about app versioning creating bloat in assets folders, with requests for world cleaning commands
- **Raycasting Implementation**: Developers are using undocumented raycasting functionality, with requests to integrate it into the core API
- **Hyperfy Tools**: The Blender add-on has reached 2,000 downloads, helping with model preparation and conversion

### 3D Assets & Design
- **NFT Integration**: 3D NFTs can be imported into Hyperfy spaces, appearing in users' inventories for placement and duplication
- **Model Optimization**: Discussions about reducing texture sizes (converting PNGs to JPGs) and polygon counts
- **T-Pose Challenges**: Users shared techniques for getting models into the exact T-pose that Hyperfy expects
- **IKEA 3D Models**: Community members shared resources for IKEA 3D models that could be used in Hyperfy worlds

### Web3 & Blockchain Integration
- **Token Utility Demo**: A significant development was the demonstration of a system allowing users to throw and collect Hyper tokens in-world with blockchain integration
- **Web3 Gaming Debate**: Discussion about transaction-per-action mechanics in games and the potential of on-chain item economies
- **Anti-Crypto Sentiment**: Exploration of why traditional web2 developers often resist crypto integration

### AI & Agents
- **AI Infrastructure**: Rick shared information about Recallnet's new AI infrastructure, which requires an application process
- **Development Approach**: MetaMike mentioned shifting focus from agents to game logic as they're interdependent

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
- **Q**: How can I keep the UI locked while changing properties in the inspect panel?  
  **A**: Add a switch called "Edit Mode" that forces the UI to open so you can see it while changing other props. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is there a way to do raycasting?  
  **A**: Yes, but it's not documented or exposed in API yet. (Saori)

- **Q**: Can we make GET/POST requests to external APIs via Apps?  
  **A**: Yes, using fetch which works exactly the same as standard JavaScript. (Saori)

- **Q**: How can I add an mp3 slot to my follower hyp?  
  **A**: Ashxn provided updated code with audio implementation and suggested adding loop:true.

### Hyperfy Platform
- **Q**: Is Hyperfy now free to use?  
  **A**: It's free if you're a developer who can self-host; otherwise, you can use community hosting platforms like hyperworld.host for a monthly fee. (Saori and Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do you get a 3D model from an NFT into a Hyperfy space?  
  **A**: It appears in your inventory automatically, and you can make duplicates with ctrl+copy and paste. (untitled, xyz)

- **Q**: Where can I mint 3D NFTs?  
  **A**: You can use platforms like Manifold and Zora, which support uploading .glb files. (Saori and untitled, xyz)

### 3D Design
- **Q**: How do I get my model into the exact T-pose that Hyperfy expects?  
  **A**: Move the rig to a pose in pose mode, parent it, then move back to T-pose and apply it to the rest pose. (devilsadvocate.sol)

- **Q**: How do I check what's making my file so big?  
  **A**: Textures most likely. Save out textures, load them in photoshop/affinity, scale them down, and reimport. Also make them JPG instead of PNG. (TheMattEmpire)

- **Q**: When a .hyp is placed in the world, does it remain a .hyp file or is it considered something else?  
  **A**: It's unpacked and becomes an entity which is a database entry that stores the model, script, and configuration/props. (peezy)

### Blockchain
- **Q**: Why are web2 game devs anti crypto?  
  **A**: They're against all exploitative monetization including micro-transactions and loot crates, see crypto as an evolution of these systems, and view it as a pyramid scheme to extract gamer funds. (peezy and maximus)

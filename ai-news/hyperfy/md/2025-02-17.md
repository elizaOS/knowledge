# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-17

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Advancements
- **Solana Integration**: peezy demonstrated a system allowing users to throw and collect HYPER tokens in-world with Solana wallet integration, showcasing on-chain interactions within Hyperfy.
- **Cross-Chain Strategy**: Saori clarified that Hyperfy plans to operate across both Solana and Ethereum chains - using Solana for token trading (due to UX, liquidity, and retail users) while leveraging Ethereum for building custom contracts for games with financial components.
- **Raycasting Functionality**: Developers discussed undocumented raycasting capabilities that are being used despite not being officially exposed in the API yet.
- **App Configuration**: Discussions around maintaining UI state during property changes, with developers sharing solutions like adding an "Edit Mode" switch to force UI to stay open during configuration.
- **File Management**: Concerns about app versioning creating bloat in assets folders, with calls for a "world cleaning/vacuuming" feature.
- **HyperFall Game**: Released to the marketplace with tipping functionality, demonstrating the platform's growing ecosystem.

### 3D Design & Assets
- **T-Pose Challenges**: Significant discussion about converting models from A-pose to T-pose for proper animation in Hyperfy, with several approaches suggested including manually rotating bones, applying rest poses, and using add-ons.
- **File Optimization**: Focus on reducing texture sizes to decrease file size, with recommendations to convert normal maps from PNG to JPG format.
- **Hyperfy Tools**: The Blender add-on has reached 2,000 downloads, showing growing community adoption.
- **IKEA 3D Models**: Discussion about the availability of IKEA 3D models through their website, which can be downloaded and optimized for Hyperfy worlds.
- **ARQ Collection**: Highlighted as modular architectural units optimized for Hyperfy (1-3MB, 512px textures).

### NFT & Web3 Integration
- **3D NFT Implementation**: Users discovered how 3D NFTs appear in inventory and can be placed in Hyperfy worlds, with discussions about metadata standards using `glb_url` instead of `animation_url` for better metaverse compatibility.
- **Marketplace Development**: Introduction of Hyper token tipping functionality in the App Marketplace, allowing users to financially support app creators directly.
- **Web3 Gaming Debate**: Discussion about why traditional game developers are often skeptical of crypto integration, with some seeing it as an evolution of microtransactions designed to extract funds from players.

### Business Model & Platform Direction
- **Open-Source Clarification**: Discussion about Hyperfy V2's open-source nature, clarifying that while it's free for self-hosting developers, non-technical users can use community-built hosting platforms like hyperworld.host for a monthly fee.
- **Revenue Generation**: Conversation about Hyperfy's current revenue strategy, with mentions of backend work involving tokens and potential marketplace models.
- **Platform Comparison**: Community members compared Hyperfy to platforms like Roblox, Garry's Mod, and Minecraft, suggesting that a "Roblox but in the browser" approach could be viable.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I keep the UI visible while changing properties in the inspect panel?**  
A: Add an "Edit Mode" switch to force UI to stay open during configuration. (Ashxn)

**Q: Is there a way to do raycasting in Hyperfy?**  
A: Yes, but it's not documented or exposed in API yet. (Saori)

**Q: Is there a way to make GET/POST requests to external APIs via Apps?**  
A: Yes, using fetch which works exactly the same as standard JavaScript. (Saori)

**Q: Is Hyperfy now free to use?**  
A: It's free if you're a developer who can self-host, otherwise you can use community hosting platforms like hyperworld.host for a monthly fee. (Saori and Ashxn)

**Q: How do you get a 3D NFT model into Hyperfy space?**  
A: It appears in your inventory automatically, and you can make duplicates with ctrl+copy and paste. (untitled, xyz)

**Q: Where can I mint 3D NFTs?**  
A: You can use platforms like Manifold and Zora, which support uploading GLB files. (Saori and untitled, xyz)

**Q: Why are web2 game devs anti crypto?**  
A: They see it as an evolution of loot crates/micro transactions and purely a pyramid scheme to extract gamer funds. (maximus)

**Q: How do I get my model into the exact T-pose that Hyperfy expects?**  
A: Move your rig to a pose in pose mode, parent it, then move back to T-pose and apply it to the rest pose. (devilsadvocate.sol)

**Q: How do I check what's making my file so big?**  
A: Textures most likely. Save out the textures, load them in photoshop/affinity, scale them down, and reimport. Also make them jpg, not png. (TheMattEmpire)

**Q: What happens to a .hyp file when placed in a world?**  
A: It's unpacked and becomes an entity which is a database entry that stores the model, attached script, and all configuration/props. (peezy)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **UI Configuration Help**: Ashxn helped Omka keep UI visible while changing properties by suggesting an "Edit Mode" switch to force UI to stay open during configuration.

- **Audio Implementation**: Ashxn provided MetaRick with complete code implementation for adding audio slots and looping functionality to a follower bot.

- **3D NFT Integration**: untitled, xyz helped treed understand how to use 3D NFTs in Hyperfy by explaining the process, sending sample NFTs to test, and demonstrating how they appear in inventory.

- **File Size Optimization**: TheMattEmpire assisted devilsadvocate.sol with reducing file size of 3D models by suggesting converting normal maps from PNG to JPG to save space while maintaining acceptable quality.

- **T-Pose Conversion**: ii_cable_ii helped saltï convert a 3D character model from A-pose to T-pose by providing two methods - a detailed YouTube tutorial link and a simpler alternative using Blender's pose mode and VRM Operator settings.

- **Cross-Chain Strategy**: Saori clarified for Uuuuuuuuu that Hyperfy will use both Solana and Ethereum chains for different purposes - Solana for token trading and Ethereum for building custom contracts for games with financial components.

- **Scam Protection**: HPrivakos quickly warned users not to click or connect wallets to a suspicious link posted in chat, demonstrating community vigilance.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-15

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **Terrain Creation**: Ashxn shared a splatmap terrain demo showing high-resolution sand blending into stone using a regular mesh node with a special triplanar material.
- **VRM Format Improvements**: Discussions about developing a more efficient alternative to VRM format built on GLTF.
- **Server Performance**: During a stress test on fly.io, performance degraded after dozens of users joined. The free tier (1 CPU, 1GB RAM) showed limitations during high-load scenarios.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Confirmed that Hyperfy works on mobile devices including iPhone, with some UI issues being addressed.

### Technical Features
- **VR Enhancements**: 
  - Snap turn functionality has been added to the dev version
  - VR trigger bindings for actions implemented
  - Testing of VR trigger actions on Quest 3 allows users to change avatars and view themselves in third-person mode
- **UI Improvements**:
  - Added a reconnect button that appears when disconnected
  - Fixed white bar display issue on iPhone
  - Discussions about UI toggling behavior and whether all UI elements should hide when toggling visibility

### Content Organization
- **App Management**: Debate between folder structures versus tagging systems for organizing apps in the platform
  - Folders might be complex to organize
  - Tags might be a better approach where users can filter and enable/disable groups
- **Permission Systems**: Discussions about role-based access control for world objects and SOL permissioning for gating access

### Marketplace & Ecosystem
- **HYPER Token**: Will power the marketplace when it launches soon
- **Hosting Solutions**: 
  - fly.io hosting costs approximately $10/month for 24/7 hosting with 1CPU/1GB configuration
  - Users only pay for compute when the world is being used
- **HyperWorld.Host**: Developing a marketplace for Hyperfy applications with features for previewing code and 3D assets

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there any way to force an auto refresh when a disconnect happens or an on-screen refresh button?**  
A: Yes, a reconnect button has been added to the dev version (Ashxn)

**Q: Is VR right stick rotation still on the back burner?**  
A: Snap turn has been added to the dev version (Ashxn)

**Q: Are there currently any text to speech capabilities yet?**  
A: The app SES environment has no access to browser APIs where TTS is, so you'd need to fork and add it or use Livekit API to pipe audio from server to browser (Ashxn)

**Q: Could we have a folder app structure to build scenes that admins could toggle on/off?**  
A: Folders might be complex to organize; tags might be a better approach where you can filter and enable/disable groups (Ashxn)

**Q: Is the game already released or is it still in beta phase?**  
A: It's still in beta but very capable already. The engine is available for creators to build experiences. (Ashxn)

**Q: Are the utilities for hyper token live or will it be released once the platform launches?**  
A: Hyper will power the marketplace when it launches soon. (Ashxn)

**Q: Is hyperfy accessible through mobile? iPad or iPhone?**  
A: Yes it works on mobile. (maximus)

**Q: How can I get my custom VRM to work with custom animations?**  
A: "The engine doesn't do any retargeting and works off gltf-ifying a mixamo animation. You simply import the mixamo fbx, add a root bone as the absolute parent which is generally at 0,0,0 and then export to gltf with animation sampling to reduce filesize." (Ashxn)

**Q: Do material properties like emissiveIntensity and textureY/X only work with JPEGs and not PNGs or WebP?**  
A: No, they should work with any texture format. (ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Disconnection Issues**  
   Helper: Ashxn | Helpee: MetaRick  
   Context: Disconnection issues when using Hyperfy as a desktop icon on iOS  
   Resolution: Added a reconnect button that appears when disconnected

2. **VR Functionality**  
   Helper: Ashxn | Helpee: hiroP  
   Context: Need for VR snap turn functionality  
   Resolution: Implemented snap turn in the dev version

3. **Mobile Display Issues**  
   Helper: Ashxn | Helpee: MetaRick  
   Context: White bar display issue on iPhone  
   Resolution: Fixed the white bar display problem

4. **Text-to-Speech Implementation**  
   Helper: Ashxn | Helpee: ~/drdoge.eth  
   Context: Text-to-speech implementation issues with btoa error  
   Resolution: Explained that app SES environment lacks browser APIs needed for TTS

5. **Server Performance**  
   Helper: ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/ | Helpee: maximus  
   Context: Server issues during WIP meeting with many users  
   Resolution: Explained the limitations of free fly.io instances (1 CPU, 1GB RAM)

6. **VRM Animation**  
   Helper: Ashxn | Helpee: TheMattEmpire  
   Context: Implementing custom animations with VRM models  
   Resolution: Explained that a root bone at 0,0,0 is needed as absolute parent, and that the engine only uses bone rotations for avatar animations

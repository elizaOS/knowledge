# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-15

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Terrain Technology**: Ashxn demonstrated a new splatmap terrain system allowing high-resolution texture blending (sand into stone). This uses a regular mesh node with specialized triplanar material rather than a dedicated terrain node.
- **Avatar Format Discussions**: Ashxn proposed an alternative to VRM built on GLTF that would enable live wearable swapping, highlighting Hyperfy's current approach of annotating GLTF objects without requiring official extensions.
- **VR Enhancements**: Several VR improvements were implemented, including snap turn functionality and trigger bindings for actions. Roustan tested VR trigger actions on Quest 3 and shared a YouTube demonstration.
- **Platform Stability**: A server performance issue was identified during a meeting where many users joined, making the platform unloadable. This occurred on a free fly.io instance with limited resources (1 CPU, 1GB RAM).
- **Mobile Support**: Confirmation that Hyperfy works on iOS devices, with Roustan specifically optimizing his world for mobile performance.

### Platform Status & Features
- **Beta Status**: Ashxn clarified that Hyperfy is currently in beta but already capable, with its engine available for creators on GitHub.
- **Marketplace Plans**: The upcoming marketplace will be powered by the HYPER token.
- **Game Release**: A token PVP game called "Fallen" has been released as a demonstration at fallen.hyperfy.xyz.
- **App Behavior**: Developers discussed app behavior during movement, suggesting that apps should stay live by default while being moved, with a resetOnMove option for specific cases.

### Data Infrastructure
- Brief discussion about a team working on data infrastructure technologies including backpacks/arweave, ceramic/tableland, orbis, and "sqlite on chain stuff."
- Mention that this team is running competitions and shifting focus toward data consumption and AI applications.

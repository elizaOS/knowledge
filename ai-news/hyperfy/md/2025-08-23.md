# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-23

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### 3D Development & Scripting
- **Empty Objects Handling**: Discussion about workarounds for handling empty objects in 3D environments, with solutions ranging from empty GLB files to toggling mesh visibility on cube blocks.
- **Water Animation Implementation**: Detailed technical exchange about implementing water animation in a 3D planet model created with the Hyperfy Tool in Blender, focusing on texture scrolling while maintaining collision properties.
- **Memory Optimization**: Concerns raised about memory usage (256MB overhead) when using invisible cube blocks as placeholders, with proposals for lighter alternatives.

### UI/UX Workflows
- **Object Manipulation Preferences**: Users expressed preference for direct manipulation (grabbing/moving) over typing position coordinates in the Hyperfy interface.
- **Empty Objects for UI**: Shared workflow experience of using empty objects specifically for UI element positioning.

## Key Questions & Answers

### 3D Development
- **Q**: How can I create an empty object in "easy mode"?  
  **A**: Add an empty GLB to the collection folder and add its name to the manifest JSON. (by .hyp shaman)

- **Q**: How can I work around the need for empty objects?  
  **A**: Toggle mesh visibility off on cube blocks, though this still carries memory overhead. (by 0mka)

- **Q**: Is there a way to adapt a script for the hierarchy created by the Hyperfy Tool addon to make water move while keeping collision?  
  **A**: Yes, the script will use the mesh with applied texture you want scrolling, and collision will stay intact. Just ensure the mesh name is correctly referenced. (by vox)

- **Q**: Can all movements (water, ring, etc.) be managed in script if exported as Batch GLB with Hyperfy Tool?  
  **A**: Yes, you can have several meshes with different textures scrolling in the same GLB and .hyp by extending the script to look for other meshes. (by vox)

- **Q**: How can I make water movement more realistic?  
  **A**: Distorting the UVs on the mesh can create more realistic water movements. (by vox)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Water Animation Troubleshooting**
   - **Helper**: vox
   - **Helpee**: ðŸ†‚ðŸ…´ðŸ…±ðŸ…¶ðŸ…°
   - **Context**: Trouble with water texture scrolling script not working
   - **Resolution**: Identified a typo in the mesh name reference ("Sphere001MeshLOD0"), fixed it, and shared a working .hyp file

2. **Node Referencing in Scripts**
   - **Helper**: ash
   - **Helpee**: ðŸ†‚ðŸ…´ðŸ…±ðŸ…¶ðŸ…°
   - **Context**: Needed to know how to reference nodes in scripts for animation
   - **Resolution**: Provided code example showing how to reference nodes and implement rotation

3. **Empty Object Alternatives**
   - **Helper**: 0mka
   - **Helpee**: .hyp shaman
   - **Context**: Expanding on the "easy mode" empty object approach
   - **Resolution**: Suggested toggling mesh visibility off and proposed a lighter block model alternative with configurable visibility

## Action Items

### Technical
- Create a lighter block model with toggleable visibility (Mentioned by: 0mka)
- Implement shape primitives as grabbers (Mentioned by: 0mka)
- Fix mesh name reference in script from incorrect to "Sphere001MeshLOD0" (Mentioned by: vox)
- Experiment with UV distortion on water mesh for more realistic movement (Mentioned by: vox)
- Extend script to handle multiple scrolling textures for different mesh elements (Mentioned by: vox)

### Feature Requests
- Add app.configure toggle for mesh visibility to allow runtime toggling of mesh visibility for objects (Mentioned by: 0mka)

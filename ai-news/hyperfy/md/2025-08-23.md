# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-23

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### 3D Development & Empty Objects
- Discussion focused on handling empty objects in 3D environments
- `.hyp shaman` shared an "easy mode" approach for adding empty GLB files to collections by updating the manifest JSON
- `0mka` suggested toggling mesh visibility on cube blocks as a workaround, though noted this carries unnecessary memory overhead (256MB)
- A proposal was made to create lighter block models with toggleable visibility using app.configure
- Empty objects were noted as useful for UI elements and for being able to grab and move them rather than manually typing positions
- A PR related to this functionality was submitted

### Water Animation Implementation
- `🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰` worked on implementing water animation in a 3D model created with the Hyperfy Tool in Blender
- The goal was to make water textures scroll on a planet model while maintaining collision properties
- `vox` identified a typo in the mesh name ("Sphere001MeshLOD0") that was preventing the script from working
- `vox` confirmed that texture scrolling works with collision intact and suggested distorting UVs for more realistic water movement

### Emerging Technologies
- `cru` introduced WebTransport as a UDP-like technology for web browsers that could potentially improve realtime performance
- It was noted that WebTransport is still immature technology
- `🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰` inquired about streaming capabilities and m3u8 files, but this topic wasn't fully addressed

### Competitor Analysis
- Brief mention of Roblox as "only competitor" without elaboration on technical aspects
- Reference to a product called M2 claiming to be "Built on Open-Source" with poor performance ("6 FPS")

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can someone help point me to the docs or a hyp example about changing the animation state for a model?** (asked by mattimus)  
**A:** Try this Discord thread: https://discord.com/channels/958209073277456457/1346623562462527649/1397401665434288149 (answered by Shiffty)

**Q: How can I adapt a script for the hierarchy created by the Hyperfy Tool addon to make water move while keeping collision?** (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰)  
**A:** The script will use the mesh with applied texture you want scrolling. You can have several meshes with different textures scrolling in the same GLB and .hyp by extending the script to look for other meshes. Collision will stay intact. (answered by vox)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Water Animation Implementation**
   - `vox` helped `🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰` implement water animation on a planet model
   - Identified a typo in the mesh name and provided a working .hyp file
   - Suggested distorting UVs for more realistic water movement
   - `ash` provided code examples showing how to reference nodes in scripts and make a sphere rotate

2. **Empty Objects in 3D Environment**
   - `.hyp shaman` shared an approach for adding empty GLBs to collection folders
   - `0mka` suggested workarounds for handling empty objects and proposed creating lighter models

3. **Animation State Documentation**
   - `Shiffty` directed `mattimus` to relevant documentation on changing animation states for models

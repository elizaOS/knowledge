# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-02

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI Integration & Development
- **Elizafy Headless Client**: Shaw developed a headless client called "Elizafy" that allows AI agents to connect to Hyperfy worlds like human users, with a demonstration video showing autonomous navigation
- **AI Package Release**: Peezy announced the release of the "ai" hypkg package and shared a GitHub branch for Docker users
- **AI Vision Capabilities**: Discussion about how to give AI agents "vision" to see and interact with objects in the Hyperfy world

### Technical Development
- **PhysX Improvements**: Ashxn discussed improvements to PhysX builds, creating a unified version for both Node and browser environments while reducing code size by 4MB
- **VR Functionality**: Current VR implementation lacks rotation capability; body turn and snap turn features still need to be added but aren't current priorities
- **Naming Convention Issues**: Ashxn highlighted that "ServerLoader.js" should be "NodeLoader.js" and "ClientLoader.js" should be "BrowserLoader.js" to better reflect their usage
- **Day Cycle Feature**: A timing issue was identified where shadows move too quickly (10 seconds fast) when using the 10-minute cycle option

### UI & Asset Sharing
- **UI Updates**: Roustan provided positive feedback on new model and image buttons while suggesting improvements
- **3D Assets**: Vox shared game-related assets including a PVP arena and a Hyperball arena (both with baked and unbaked versions with colliders)
- **Emission Intensity**: Discussion about implementing an emission intensity slider for neon letters

### Business & Licensing
- **GPL License Clarification**: Discussion about Hyperfy v2's GPL license implications for corporate clients, with Ashxn clarifying that it only applies to core improvements, not applications built on top

### Token & Trading
- **HYPER Token**: Users checking the price of HYPER token using the "$hyper" command
- **Trading Platforms**: Discussion about tracking HYPER on different platforms after a user couldn't find it on TradingView

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I implement an emission intensity slider for neon letters?**  
A: Use a range field and connect it to the material with "mesh.material.emissiveIntensity = value". Make sure the emissive color isn't black. (Ashxn)

**Q: Is the inability to rotate view in VR a known issue?**  
A: Yes, body turn and snap turn features still need to be added. (Ashxn)

**Q: What does it take to have customizable loading screens for hyperfy?**  
A: Likely requires modifications to the CoreUI.js file. (HypPrivakos)

**Q: Does removing PhysX vehicle imports mean cars are dead?**  
A: No, Hyperfy has better cars than PhysX vehicle controllers can provide, using raycast vehicles instead. (Ashxn)

**Q: What is elizafy?**  
A: A headless client that allows AI agents to connect to hyperfy worlds like humans would. (Ashxn)

**Q: How would GPL license affect corporate integration with Hyperfy v2?**  
A: The license only applies to core improvements, not applications built on top, similar to Linux's model. (Ashxn)

**Q: How can the day cycle speed be adjusted?**  
A: You can change the actual speed it cycles through in the code itself at the top few lines. (~/drdoge.eth)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Emission Intensity Implementation**: Ashxn helped Gert-Jan Akerboom implement an emission intensity slider for neon letters by explaining how to access mesh material properties and set emissiveIntensity
  
- **GPL License Clarification**: Ashxn helped hiroP understand the implications of Hyperfy v2's GPL license for corporate integrations, clarifying that it only applies to core improvements

- **Day Cycle Timing Fix**: ~/drdoge.eth offered to share an updated version with new weather features to Enryt after discussing a timing issue with shadows moving too quickly

- **Trading Platform Alternatives**: CheddarQueso 🧀 helped Z aka MetaDJ find alternative ways to track HYPER token after they couldn't find it on TradingView, suggesting Phantom wallet for trading and Dexscreener for price tracking

## Action Items

### Technical

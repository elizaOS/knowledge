# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-02

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI Integration & Development
- **Elizafy Project**: Shaw demonstrated a headless client that allows AI agents to connect to Hyperfy worlds just like human users would. The demo video showed an autonomous agent connecting to a world and navigating independently.
- **AI Package Release**: Peezy announced the release of the "ai" hypkg package (https://hypkg.sh/hypkg/ai/) with a corresponding GitHub branch for Docker users.
- Users expressed excitement about the potential for AI agents as players in virtual worlds and the possibilities for AI-curated environments.

### Hyperfy v2 Technical Updates
- **PhysX Improvements**: Ashxn shared updates about PhysX builds, mentioning the creation of a single build that works for both Node and browser environments. They also removed PhysX built-in vehicle imports, reducing code size by approximately 4MB.
- **VR Functionality**: Current VR implementation lacks rotation capability in immersive view. Ashxn clarified that body turn and interact buttons still need to be added, noting that snap turn functionality is not currently a priority.
- **Vehicle Implementation**: Despite removing PhysX vehicle imports, Ashxn noted they have better car implementations than PhysX vehicle controllers.

### Licensing & Business Concerns
- Discussion about Hyperfy v2's GPL license implications for corporate clients
- Clarification that the license only applies to core improvements, not applications built on top of the platform (similar to Linux's GPL license)

### HYPER Token
- Users were checking the price of HYPER token throughout the day
- Some sentiment around price movements with comments suggesting a price recovery ("we back baby")

### 3D Design
- Brief discussion about how fog and mountain ranges create a sense of scale in 3D environments
- Interest in depth of field functionality

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I implement an emission intensity slider for my neon letters app?** (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom)  
A: Use a range field and connect it to the material with `mesh.material.emissiveIntensity = value`. Make sure your emissive color in Blender isn't black. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Is the inability to rotate the view in VR a known issue?** (asked by hiroP)  
A: Current build has no rotation functionality; it will be added later. (answered by vox)

**Q: How do I implement snap turn in VR?** (asked by hiroP)  
A: It's a common VR feature that applies an offset to rotation by X degrees. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Does removing PhysX vehicle imports mean cars are dead?** (asked by peezy)  
A: No, they have better car implementations than PhysX vehicle controllers can provide. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Is shaw using the hyperfy engine?** (asked by simk)  
A: Yes, he made a headless client that allows AI agents (Elizafy) to connect to Hyperfy worlds like humans would. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What is elizafy?** (asked by simk)  
A: A system that allows AI agents to connect to any Hyperfy world just like a human would. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What pairing do you have on TradingView? I no longer can find Hyperfy.** (asked by Z aka MetaDJ)  
A: "I trade in my phantom wallet and watch on Dexscreener 8vBMibwpn8wpfYKbQ9xqzodymg3LjmYec2tSNGRy23K8" (answered by CheddarQueso ðŸ§€)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **VR Implementation Guidance**
   - Helper: Ashxn & vox
   - Helpee: hiroP
   - Context: VR rotation functionality in Hyperfy v2
   - Resolution: Clarified that rotation is not implemented in the current build and will be added later. Explained that snap turn is a common VR feature that applies rotation offset by X degrees.

2. **Material Properties for 3D Design**
   - Helper: Ashxn
   - Helpee: Gert-Jan Akerboom
   - Context: Implementing emission intensity slider for neon letters app
   - Resolution: Explained how to use mesh.material.emissiveIntensity and connect it to a range field, noting the importance of non-black emissive color in Blender.

3. **License Clarification**
   - Helper: Ashxn
   - Helpee: hiroP
   - Context: Concerns about GPL license implications for using Hyperfy v2 with corporate clients
   - Resolution: Clarified that the license only applies to core improvements, not applications built on top, comparing it to Linux's GPL license.

4. **Token Trading Support**
   - Helper: CheddarQueso ðŸ§€
   - Helpee: Z aka MetaDJ
   - Context: User couldn't find Hyperfy on TradingView
   - Resolution: Suggested using Phantom wallet for trading and Dexscreener for price monitoring, provided a token address.

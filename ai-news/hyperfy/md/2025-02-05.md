## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: How can I access the camera in an app? (Shiffty)  
  **A**: You can access the camera using app.control(options) but it's not fully documented yet as it might change. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do I scale something in the editor? (MetaRick)  
  **A**: Currently only possible in Blender or via script, as allowing arbitrary scaling might break apps designed for specific scales. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: What is the preferred animation type for custom animations? (TheMattEmpire)  
  **A**: Animations use the "emote" format, which is a GLB file with an animated skeleton following VRM standard bone mapping. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: What's the best image format for optimizing textures? (TheMattEmpire)  
  **A**: From worst to best: PNG ‚Üí JPG ‚Üí WebP ‚Üí KTX2, though KTX2 is hard and not yet supported in V2. (Ashxn)

### Agent Development
- **Q**: How can we trigger expressions within the Eliza hyperfy branch? (MetaMike)  
  **A**: The app sends available emotes to Eliza which picks one appropriate for the response. (Saori)

- **Q**: Any examples of Hyperfy agents to check out? (SoloSolipsist)  
  **A**: https://agents.hyperfy.xyz/ (Saori)

### Licensing & Hosting
- **Q**: What is the license situation for client projects using Hyperfy? (MetaRick)  
  **A**: GPL only applies to the core engine itself, not assets side loaded onto it. It's not mandatory to contribute improvements back to the repo. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How can I self-host a Hyperfy world? (Cluny_the_Scourge)  
  **A**: You can find self-hosting instructions at https://hackmd.io/@metamike/hyperfy-communal-note-pool, but you'll need to manage backups, updates, and security yourself. (HPrivakos)

### HYPER Token
- **Q**: What is the purpose of the address holding 30% of total supply? (Alexa)  
  **A**: It's explained on token.hyperfy.xyz and in the FAQ. (Uuuuuuuuu and maximus)

- **Q**: How much liquidity would be needed to establish a HYPER pool on Ethereum? (devilsadvocate.sol)  
  **A**: About 10% of supply and 160 SOL to get an equivalent LP on ETH. (Saori)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Troubleshooting
- **Helper**: Ashxn | **Helpee**: m‚ÇÇ  
  **Context**: m‚ÇÇ couldn't see all parameters in app configuration  
  **Resolution**: Ashxn identified that m‚ÇÇ was using invalid parameter types ('tags' and 'image' instead of 'text')

- **Helper**: Ashxn | **Helpee**: ·≤º  
  **Context**: Docker build failing with npm dependency conflicts  
  **Resolution**: Identified the issue was related to Three.js version upgrade and fixed it by removing version checking temporarily

- **Helper**: HPrivakos | **Helpee**: MetaMike  
  **Context**: Incorrect URL in hyp file preventing agent from working  
  **Resolution**: Provided correct URL (https://agents.dcl.guru/eliza/hyperfy) and suggested changing the URL field in the app

### 3D Design Assistance
- **Helper**: TheMattEmpire | **Helpee**: devilsadvocate.sol  
  **Context**: Optimizing 3D models from AI generators  
  **Resolution**: Demonstrated retopology and texture compression techniques, reducing file size from 2.5MB to 0.2MB

- **Helper**: Valiant | **Helpee**: devilsadvocate.sol  
  **Context**: Improving Meshy AI texturing results  
  **Resolution**: Suggested uploading custom models for better texturing and using all available retries

### Onboarding & Resources
- **Helper**: untitled, xyz | **Helpee**: vlad  
  **Context**: Getting started with Hyperfy  
  **Resolution**: Offered to provide a blank scene for experimentation or wait for no-code V2

- **Helper**: Saori | **Helpee**: SoloSolipsist  
  **Context**: Looking for Hyperfy agent examples  
  **Resolution**: Shared link to agents.hyperfy.xyz and mentioned getting URL from another user

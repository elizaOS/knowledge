# Hyperfy Discord - 2026-01-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Tools & Features
- **mrtzhckr's 3D Object Tool**: A new tool was shared that allows for exporting and editing 3D objects, with capabilities for previewing primitives, adjusting transforms, and editing simple scenes. The tool includes animation capabilities and exports to .hyp format, though export functionality isn't fully complete.
- **World Building Methods**: Two approaches were mentioned for adding models to worlds:
  1. Dragging optimized .glb files directly into the world
  2. Using the plus button to add and place models

### Technical Issues
- **Server Memory Consumption**: Significant discussion about memory usage problems in server environments, particularly on Heroku where servers were being terminated after only 1-2 minutes due to excessive memory usage.
- **Camera Controls**: Issues with camera controls and movement were reported, with hidden camera triggers identified as the source of the problem.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What's the biggest memory consumer on the server?**  
A: The server generates colliders like a client, with GLB files in the world being the main memory consumers. (answered by ash)

**Q: Any quick and easy memory profiling functionality?**  
A: You can use process.memoryUsage() or heap snapshots and view them in the browser. (answered by ash)

**Q: How do I fix camera control issues?**  
A: There are hidden camera triggers that need to be removed, particularly in the beginning area. You can press Q to exit these camera modes. (answered by ~/drdoge.eth)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Server Memory Optimization**
   - **Helper**: ash
   - **Helpee**: Ozymandias
   - **Context**: Server memory usage issues causing Heroku to terminate the application
   - **Resolution**: Explained that server acts like a client generating colliders, with GLBs consuming most memory

2. **Temporary Fix Implementation**
   - **Helper**: Ozymandias
   - **Helpee**: Community
   - **Context**: Finding a temporary solution for server memory issues
   - **Resolution**: Implemented conditional return in Stage's insert method with `if (this.world.network.isServer) return`

3. **Camera Control Troubleshooting**
   - **Helper**: ~/drdoge.eth
   - **Helpee**: Enryt
   - **Context**: Difficulty with camera controls and movement
   - **Resolution**: Identified hidden camera triggers as the issue and suggested pressing Q to exit camera modes

## Action Items

### Technical
- Implement a better solution for server-side memory optimization beyond the temporary fix (mentioned by Ozymandias)
- Explore memory profiling options like process.memoryUsage() and heap snapshots (mentioned by ash)
- Optimize handling of GLB files which are identified as main memory consumers (mentioned by ash)
- Remove hidden camera triggers, particularly in beginning areas of worlds (mentioned by ~/drdoge.eth)

### Feature Development
- Complete the export functionality for the 3D object editing tool (mentioned by mrtzhckr)
- Explore possibility of creating a comprehensive .hyp file listing all available apps (mentioned by mrtzhckr)

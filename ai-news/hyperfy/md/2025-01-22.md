# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-22

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy V2 Development
- **Architecture**: Hyperfy V2 is self-hostable and open-source, with a Solana plugin coming soon. The platform works with any blockchain or none at all.
- **Technical Stack**: V2 uses vanilla JavaScript with ThreeJS (not React like V1), and apps are created through a custom API similar to DOM manipulation.
- **Infrastructure**: Implementation uses AWS (ECS, EFS, S3) with Terraform for infrastructure as code.
- **Performance**: Significant improvements over V1, with optimizations for HDRs and textures.
- **VRM Support**: The platform now supports VRM model drag-and-drop functionality.
- **World Building Controls**: Rotation with mouse wheel, Y-axis movement with shift key.
- **Nametag Implementation**: Using shaders with a single draw call for efficiency.
- **Environment Improvements**: Sky and HDR nodes are being developed.

### AI Agents Development
- **Character Creation**: Using JSON templates with fields for name, username, system instructions, bio, lore, message examples, post examples, topics, style guidelines, and adjectives.
- **Technical Requirements**: Currently requires an "eliza server" to run agents, though a user-friendly option is planned.
- **Potential Applications**: Chauffeurs, tour guides, and hospitality concierges.
- **Integration**: Working with AI developers on agents that can understand their environment and react.

### 3D Design & Optimization
- **Collider Optimization**: Detailed information shared about collider types (Static, Kinematic, Dynamic) and their computational complexity.
- **New Tools**: hiroP created "hiros-tools" Blender script/plugin that automatically generates simplified collision meshes for complex 3D models.
- **Export Utilities**: Ashxn shared a Blender script for auto-exporting individual objects with proper centering.
- **Documentation**: maximus documented collider optimization information in a community HackMD book with diagrams.

### Events & Community
- **Concert Capabilities**: Discussions about hosting music events in Hyperfy worlds, particularly regarding audio streaming, reactive lighting, and instance synchronization.
- **Community Meeting**: Upcoming Hyperfy Builder Community Meeting announced, featuring updates from core developers and showcasing creator work.
- **Documentation Efforts**: A new community documentation book was announced to collect knowledge and resources about Hyperfy.

### HYPER Token
- **Market Discussions**: Current market cap reported at 42.23 million, with approximately 30% of tokens locked in team allocation vesting for 3 years.
- **Trading Strategies**: Community members shared various approaches to trading HYPER tokens.
- **Platform Comparisons**: Detailed technical analysis comparing Hyperfy with other metaverse platforms like Decentraland.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Platform & Development
- **Q**: Can you currently rotate an item in world without scripting?  
  **A**: Mouse wheel rotates on Y axis, hold shift and move mouse up and down to lift up and down.

- **Q**: Do I need an NFT to create a world?  
  **A**: No NFT needed. V2 is open sourced now and anyone can spin up a world.

- **Q**: Is Hyperfy V2 using WebGL or WebGPU as a foundation?  
  **A**: WebGL but once WebGPU is ready I'm all for it.

- **Q**: Does the concept of apps still exist in V2?  
  **A**: It exists in the sense that you can write scripts and append them to in-world objects.

- **Q**: How do I teleport a player from an app?  
  **A**: Need to add to the player proxy, likely will be something like player.teleport(position, cameraY).

- **Q**: Is it possible to load an arbitrary image from a URL and apply it as a texture?  
  **A**: Not yet but easy to add.

- **Q**: Can I use this technology with wherever chain or only with a specific chain?  
  **A**: Any chain or no chain. By default it has none, but we have a Solana plugin coming.

- **Q**: Is there any tutorial how to setup V2 to a domain?  
  **A**: If you're a dev you can do it right now: https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy/wiki/Deploy-a-world-(Digital-Ocean). If you're not a dev, we'll make this available to everyone soon.

### AI Agents
- **Q**: Are agents currently only available to people who know how to code?  
  **A**: Yes, the main thing right now is you need an eliza server.

- **Q**: Is there gonna be a user option later?  
  **A**: Yes.

- **Q**: What's the computational complexity order for colliders?  
  **A**: Nothing -> Static -> Kinematic -> Dynamic.

- **Q**: Are convex colliders more performant than trimesh?  
  **A**: Yes, convex colliders are more performant than trimesh.

### Technical Issues
- **Q**: Why does clicking MetaMask in v1 try to connect via Phantom?  
  **A**: Phantom is overriding MetaMask because Phantom now supports EVM chains. You can change this in settings.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Collider Optimization Guide**:  
   hiroP created and shared detailed explanation of collider types and their use cases, then developed "hiros-tools" Blender plugin to create simplified collision meshes.

2. **Blender Export Utilities**:  
   Ashxn shared a Python script that exports individual objects with proper centering, while scoe shared "hyperfyhitbox" GitHub repository for creating cube colliders.

3. **Documentation Efforts**:  
   maximus created a comprehensive guide with diagrams in HackMD, documenting collider optimization techniques.

4. **Blockchain Integration Help**:  
   Ashxn explained to Revolution that Hyperfy works with any chain or no chain, with a Solana plugin coming.

5. **Domain Setup Guidance**:  
   Ashxn provided J10 with documentation for setting up Hyperfy V2 on a domain and mentioned future availability for non-developers.

6. **Audio Streaming Solutions**:  
   𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 recommended using m3u8 streams or mp3 streams from websites for syncing audio across instances for concert events.

7. **3D Modeling Guidance**:  
   bitpixi suggested using MagicaVoxel as an entry point for building simple 3D models to Uuuuuuuuu.

8. **Token Market Education**:  
   jar0d explained to MUDBONE that market cap only includes circulating tokens, with approximately 30% locked in team allocation vesting for 3 years.

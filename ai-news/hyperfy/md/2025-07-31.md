# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-31

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical
- **App Development Workflow**: Detailed discussions about how to edit and create .hyp apps in Hyperfy, with experienced developers sharing their workflows. Apps can be edited directly in-world with the built-in editor, with changes saving instantly for the local instance. Server-side saving occurs on a cycle (approximately 1 minute) for apps stored in the database.
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Multiple AI tools were discussed for app development assistance, including Cursor (with the Hyperfy repo as context) and DeepWiki for generating app code with simple prompts.
- **Particle Rendering Issue**: A user reported and subsequently solved an issue where particles appeared differently in-world compared to their intended appearance, caused by accidentally copied color and brightness settings.
- **Texture Compression Tools**: A Twitter post about texture compression tools with visual sliders was shared and received positive feedback, with users noting that "sliders and visuals for texture compression looks handy."

### Project Status & Community
- **Building vs. Marketing Focus**: Community members discussed the current state of Hyperfy, with some expressing concerns about price action and project visibility. Team members emphasized that the current focus is on building rather than marketing.
- **Community Engagement**: Suggestions were made to increase project visibility through coordinated social media engagement on X (Twitter) and creating tutorial videos about Hyperfy.
- **Technical Infrastructure**: Brief discussion about internet connection speeds and router compatibility issues, with recommendations for diagnostic tools like SamKnows RealSpeed.

## Key Questions & Answers

### App Development
- **Q**: How do I edit existing .hyp apps? (asked by SWISS)  
  **A**: You can't edit .hyp files directly; drag them in-world, use the in-world editor to change code, hit save, and wait for the server to save the recompiled hyp to the database (answered by hiroP)

- **Q**: What's the recommended workflow for editing apps? (asked by SWISS)  
  **A**: Drag a .hyp into the world, open the in-world editor, change code, hit save, and wait for the server cycle to compile the app (answered by hiroP)

- **Q**: Do I need to wait for changes to take effect? (asked by Shiffty)  
  **A**: Code changes affect what you're editing instantly, but for apps stored on the server that you want to use later from the menu, you need to wait for the server save cycle (answered by hiroP)

- **Q**: How can I use AI to help with app development? (asked by SWISS)  
  **A**: Use Cursor with the Hyperfy repo as context, or use DeepWiki to generate app code with simple prompts (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom and Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘)

### Project Status
- **Q**: Why does the Hyperfy chart look abandoned? (asked by Saracismo)  
  **A**: "All focus is on building. Plenty of runway and full-blown marketing shouldn't start until all the ducks are in a row" (answered by Pete)

### Technical Issues
- **Q**: How to fix particles looking different in-world than in preview? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom)  
  **A**: The issue was caused by accidentally copied color and brightness settings from another script (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **App Development Guidance**:
   - Gert-Jan Akerboom advised SWISS to download the Hyperfy repo and open it in Cursor for proper context when struggling to edit .hyp files
   - hiroP provided a step-by-step workflow for editing apps in-world when SWISS was confused about how to edit .hyp files
   - Ashxn explained the intended drag-and-drop workflow and confirmed that in-world editing with save functionality is the primary method
   - hiroP suggested using Claude/ChatGPT alongside DeepWiki for better results when creating app features
   - Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘 shared DeepWiki link and demonstrated how to use it to create apps with simple prompts

2. **Technical Support**:
   - hiroP suggested SamKnows RealSpeed tool to Valiant for diagnosing router-related speed problems

3. **Project Perspective**:
   - Pete provided perspective to Saracismo that focus is on building with sufficient runway, suggesting to accumulate tokens at current prices
   - Xukonth suggested creating tutorial videos about Hyperfy and coordinating community engagement on X (Twitter) to increase project visibility

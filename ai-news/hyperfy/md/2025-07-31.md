# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-31

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Internet Performance**: Valiant shared details about a "Hyperspeed upgrade" to their internet service, showing symmetric speeds with no throttling. This sparked a brief discussion about tools for diagnosing local network issues. (âš¡â”‚general)

### Project Status & Community Concerns

- **Community Visibility Concerns**: Some members expressed concerns about project visibility, token price, and marketing strategy during what appears to be a period of perceived inactivity. (ðŸª™â”‚hyper)

### Design Tools

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-29

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Updates
- **Gaussian Splatting Implementation**: mrtzhckr shared an updated fork of the GS implementation that fixes several technical issues including invalid gzip errors, color/opacity problems, and improved loading/caching logic. The updated fork uses spark.js 0.19 and implements the same loading mechanisms as other assets.
- **AI Integration Enhancements**: Recent integration of "prims" with AI was highlighted as a significant update. OpenRouter support has been enabled, allowing users to run custom LLMs for generation in Hyperfy.
- **Marketplace Launch**: A new marketplace for Hyperfy assets (hyperworld.host) was shared, allowing users to upload, update, tag, and receive tips for their creations.

### Community & Project Status
- **Hyperfy V2 Presentation**: Gert-Jan Akerboom announced an upcoming presentation that will include demonstrations and in-world AI generations.
- **Project Activity**: Some concerns were raised about decreased project activity. Maximus confirmed he's still monitoring but has reduced involvement, noting that bi-weekly calls happen but aren't consistent.
- **Vibe World Issues**: Ash mentioned issues with the vibe world crashing, potentially due to memory leaks in one of many AI-generated apps.

### Technical Discussions
- **Custom AI Endpoints**: mrtzhckr requested support for custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints through an AI_BASE_URL environment variable, which would enable integration with Azure OpenAI, self-hosted vLLM instances, Ollama, and other OpenAI-compatible APIs.
- **"Vibe Coding" Challenges**: Several users discussed difficulties with AI-assisted coding for Hyperfy files, with suggestions to feed example scripts to AI and iterate incrementally.
- **SayMotion Accuracy**: Brief mention that SayMotion's bone mapping has accuracy issues.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Has project activity decreased?

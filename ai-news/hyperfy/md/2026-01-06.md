# Hyperfy Discord - 2026-01-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Building Permissions & World Architecture
- **Zoned Permissions System**: Ash mentioned they're working on a solution for more granular building permissions using infinite-sized worlds where only nearby apps stream in as users move around.
- **Collaborative Building**: The proposed system would divide worlds into zones with specific permissions, allowing world owners to designate areas as buildable by anyone or only by specific people.
- **Use Case**: Untitled, xyz expressed interest in this feature for their city project with a commons plaza where visitors could contribute buildings while maintaining control over critical infrastructure.

### Platform Versions & Technical Infrastructure
- **Version Differences**: Ash clarified that hyperfy.io uses a legacy engine (v1), while the GitHub repository contains v2, explaining UI and feature differences users might observe.
- **VR Mode Implementation**: VR mode automatically appears when using a compatible browser or device that supports WebXR.
- **Voice Chat Configuration**: Voice Chat functionality requires LiveKit API keys to be configured in the .env file.

### Content Sharing
- Untitled, xyz shared links to Twitter/X posts, including one referencing an "agentic hyperfy fork" by user saori_xbt.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Game Development
- Ash shared a combat game prototype at "fallen.hyperfy.xyz" where "everyone is a piñata" for limited testing
- Several game concepts were proposed:
  - A parkour game with $HYPER token mechanics (earn at checkpoints, lose when falling)
  - A 1v1 staking arena similar to RuneScape
  - A quest line system using in-world currency to unlock special areas
- Saori mentioned developing a shooter game with different implementation than Ash's approach
- Community showed enthusiasm for the gaming direction on Hyperfy

### Technical Implementations
- **Solana Integration**: A PR was shared adding world wallets and in-world currency functionality for Solana
  - Emphasizes server-side transaction handling for security
  - Not intended to be merged into main codebase, just for reference
  - Helius recommended as the best RPC for Solana production use
- **Permanent Storage**: Implementation of persistent storage for worlds without size limits
  - Intended primarily for stats rather than large files
- **External Content Loading**: 
  - `world.load('model', url)` functionality converts models to nodes for in-world manipulation
  - `load('avatar', url)` extends this to avatars
  - CORS issues discussed with suggestion to implement a proxy through the engine server
- **Custom UI Systems**: A community member showcased a custom backpack/inventory system built entirely as an app with persistent storage

### Community & Education
- Hyperfy.how Tutorial Series announced with upcoming Session #4 covering basics of working in a fresh Hyperfy v2 world
- Workshops are community-led with sessions recorded and shared as guides
- Users encouraged to submit their own session ideas for future workshops

### Market Discussion
- HYPER token price showing resilience despite broader market downturns in both crypto and traditional stocks

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Have devs been working for Hyperfy without pay?**  
A: Yes, but dev is full-time on Hyperfy now (answered by Knar)

A: No, it's just a PR for reference, not to be merged (answered by ash)

**Q: What has been your best go-to for RPC on Solana for production?**  
A: Helius is beast mode (answered by ash)

**Q: Does world storage have a file size limit?**  
A: No limits, although it's intended for stats and not large files (answered by ash)

**Q: How does depositing to the server work here? Is it a smart contract associated with the server?**  
A: It's using the Solana branch. No contract, just a server wallet. hypkg mods provide boilerplate Solana/Ethereum API functionality. (answered by Saori)

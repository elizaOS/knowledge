# Hyperfy Ecosystem Report – April 6, 2025

## Technical Developments

### Blockchain Integration
- Solana wallet integration completed via PR #87 by ashxn.eth
  - Server-side transaction logic ensures secure interactions
  - No need for Buffer polyfills or custom build targets
  - Uses @solana/wallet-adapter and Helius RPC provider
- Current Solana (SOL) price: $120.28

### Persistent Inventory System
- Developed by drdoge.eth using Hyperfy’s permanent world storage
- Maintains user data across sessions
- Currently monolithic; plans to modularize into two apps
- Optimized for small data (e.g., stats), not large files

### Dynamic Asset Loading
- Supports real-time loading of external 3D assets (GLBs, VRMs) via `world.load()`
- Enables spawning and manipulation of models and avatars
- CORS issues mitigated using:
  - Node.js proxy endpoints
  - Cloudflare Workers

### Multi-Tenant World Support

- Portal issue resolved by adjusting collider settings and model orientation

## Game Design Innovations

  - Players collect $HYPER tokens at checkpoints
  - Penalties applied for falling
- PvP staking arena:
  - 1v1 format with real-time wallet integration

### Blockchain Abstraction
- Event-driven app triggers simplify wallet/payment logic

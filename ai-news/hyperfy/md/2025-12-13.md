- 3rdEyeVisuals claimed to have implemented Phantom wallet integration but noted it's not available as a .hyp package
- Discussion about the feasibility of adding Web3 functionality to Hyperfy V2
- Maximus explained the reasoning behind excluding direct crypto integration in core code (to avoid making base code unusable to anti-crypto public)

### Creative Projects

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Web3 Integration Support**: 3rdEyeVisuals offered to share custom source code for Phantom wallet integration with Agent12, though noted it would still require implementation work
- **Platform Design Explanation**: Maximus provided context on why direct crypto integration was excluded from core code, explaining it was to avoid making the base code unusable to anti-crypto public, with extensions planned for blockchain integration

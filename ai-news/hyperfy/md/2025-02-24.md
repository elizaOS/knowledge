# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Avatar & Animation Systems
- **Mixamo Animation Library**: Saori created a comprehensive Mixamo animation library with a web interface (hyperfy-animations.vercel.app) to make animations easily accessible.
- **Animation Origin Issues**: Ashxn identified that animations from the Vercel site had incorrect origins that placed feet underground.
- **Avatar Scaling**: Discussions about avatar scaling in-world, with drdoge.eth exploring workarounds without modifying the core. Ashxn noted that per-user avatar scaling feels like bloat for the core but could be implemented in V2.
- **Follower Script**: drdoge.eth shared a follower script with voice commands like "follow me", "patrol", and "take me to".

### Technical Development
- **Player Projectiles**: Shiffty developed a player projectiles system that allows shooting objects in the direction of the camera.
- **Documentation Tools**: Omka developed documentation tools to help developers reference props and APIs while scripting.
- **Platform Improvements**: Ashxn worked on a packaged "viewer" version of the engine for use in menus and studios.
- **AI Voice Integration**: Discussions about implementing AI voice with low latency, with devilsadvocate.sol suggesting strategies like streaming emotional context in parallel, chunking responses, and using pre-recorded greetings.
- **Hyperfy Agent Protocol**: Saori mentioned a team integrating the Hyperfy agent protocol into a lightweight TypeScript framework that would be easier to set up than "Eliza v1".

### 3D Design & Rendering
- **Texture Rendering Issues**: TheMattEmpire encountered texture pixelation/fuzziness with road assets, which Ashxn identified as being caused by using "Closest" texture interpolation instead of the default "Linear" setting.
- **VRM Model Compatibility**: Mugenomics troubleshooted issues with cel-shaded VRM materials not displaying correctly in Hyperfy, resolving it by removing color ramp and emission settings.
- **Animated Stickers**: Sceth iii shared Hyperfy-related animations created in Unreal Engine for potential use as Discord server stickers.

### HYPER Token
- Significant price volatility was observed, with users tracking HYPER/SOL price movements.
- Malloy suggested broader market conditions were affecting crypto prices, with people removing liquidity from crypto as they struggle with debts.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there anything related to avatar scaling in world being worked on?**  
A: Ashxn doesn't want to add per-user setting for avatar scale to the core as it feels like bloat, but it could be implemented in V2 through other means.

**Q: What's different about "hidden" vs "visible" for meshes?**  
A: Visible is deprecated; hidden works for every node type but functions the same for meshes by unmounting from the scene.

**Q: Was a follower script ever built for v1?**  
A: No, and the v2 version uses raycasting for pathfinding which would be less efficient in v1.

**Q: Why hasn't anyone built AI voice yet?**  
A: It's slow and expensive with challenging latency issues (around 0.3m/s).

**Q: In v2 are we able to livestream yet/play videos?**  
A: Not yet.

**Q: How does texture LOD work?**  
A: LOD works at an object level, so you'd be swapping between 2 meshes with 2 different textures.

**Q: What causes texture fuzziness on 3D assets?**  
A: Using "Closest" texture interpolation instead of the default "Linear" setting.

**Q: Why aren't materials showing up correctly on a cel shaded VRM model from Blender?**  
A: Unsupported properties like color ramp and emission settings can cause issues.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Updates
- **Animation Library**: Saori created a comprehensive Mixamo animation library with a web interface (hyperfy-animations.vercel.app) to make animations easily accessible.
- **Player Projectiles System**: Shiffty developed a system allowing objects to be shot in the direction of the camera, showcased in a water balloon throwing experience with physics and splash effects.
- **Documentation Pane**: Omka is working on a documentation pane for developers to reference while coding.
- **Platform Improvements**: Ashxn mentioned work on a packaged "viewer" version of the engine for use in menus and studios.
- **Animation Origin Issues**: Problems with animation origins were identified, with Ashxn providing a solution for proper bone parenting in Blender.
- **Texture Rendering**: TheMattEmpire encountered texture pixelation with road assets, which Ashxn identified as being caused by using "Closest" texture interpolation instead of "Linear" setting.

### AI & Agents
- **AI Voice Implementation**: MetaMike mentioned plans to implement an AI voice solution for a project called "Gibber Link" by Thursday night.
- **Hyperfy Agent Protocol**: Saori mentioned a team integrating the Hyperfy agent protocol into their own lightweight TypeScript framework, which would be easier to set up than "Eliza v1".
- **AI Voice Optimization**: Devilsadvocate.sol provided detailed technical advice on optimizing AI voice responses, including streaming emotional context in parallel and chunking audio responses.

### Community Projects
- **Follower/Companion System**: Drdoge.eth shared a companion app that responds to voice commands like "follow me", "patrol", and "take me to".
- **Road Assets**: TheMattEmpire shared road assets and received feedback about LOD issues and origin point placement.
- **Grape Corporation**: General hyper introduced "grape corporation" with experimental scripts hosted at grape-corp.hyperworld.host.
- **Self-hosting Tutorial**: Maximus announced an upcoming workshop on self-hosting Hyperfy worlds, covering different hosting options and setup processes.

### Content Moderation & Marketplace
- **Content Moderation Approach**: HypPrivakos clarified their reactive moderation approach for the HyperWorld marketplace - they don't proactively scan user content but comply with takedown requests from copyright holders.
- **Age Verification**: Discussion about implementing an age verification app for adult content areas rather than building restrictions into the core codebase.
- **NSFW Content**: Plans to implement content filters and potentially blur NSFW thumbnails in the marketplace.

### HYPER Token
- **Price Volatility**: Users tracked significant price volatility of the HYPER token against SOL, with drops as low as -35.1% before recovering to -1.6%.
- **Market Conditions**: Malloy suggested the decline was related to global market conditions and liquidity being pulled from crypto markets in general.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there anything related to avatar scaling in world being worked on?**  
A: Not in core as Ashxn feels it would be bloat, but it could be implemented separately.

**Q: What's different about "hidden" vs "visible" for meshes?**  
A: Visible is deprecated; hidden works for every node type but functions similarly for meshes by unmounting from scene.

**Q: Why hasn't anyone built AI voice yet?**  
A: It's slow and expensive, with challenges achieving low latency.

**Q: In v2 are we able to livestream yet/play videos?**  
A: Not yet.

**Q: How does texture LOD work?**  
A: LOD works at an object level, swapping between meshes with different textures.

**Q: What causes textures to get fuzzy at a distance?**  
A: Using "Closest" texture interpolation instead of the default "Linear" setting.

**Q: Is VRM just a model that's boned and rigged in a specific way?**  
A: Yes, it's a GLTF format.

**Q: Is there a way to toggle the build mode overlay?**  
A: Already exists, it's the C key.

**Q: What type of licensing/controls do you have in place to review what's loaded in the marketplace?**  
A: "I don't control anything, that's not my job. If copyright holders find something not good on a world that I'm hosting, I'd comply and delete, but until I get a report I won't preemptively scan private data."

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Animation Origin Issues**:
   - Ashxn provided Saori and peezy with a Blender workflow for proper bone parenting and export settings to fix animation origin issues causing misalignment.

2. **Projectiles App Bug**:
   - Ashxn helped Shiffty fix a bug in the projectiles app where deleting the app still ran effects when left clicking by making it use a single control.

3. **Documentation Pane Implementation**:
   - Ashxn provided Omka with code examples and suggested placing a button in the code editor header for implementing a documentation pane.

4. **AI Voice Optimization**:
   - Devilsadvocate.sol helped MetaMike with implementing AI voice with low latency by providing technical pointers including parallel streaming, chunking responses, and pre-recorded greetings.

5. **Texture Rendering Issues**:
   - Ashxn identified that TheMattEmpire's texture pixelation problem was due to using "Closest" texture interpolation instead of "Linear" setting.

6. **Road Asset Feedback**:
   - General hyper provided TheMattEmpire with constructive feedback on road assets, suggesting improvements like adding sidewalks and adjusting the origin point of straight road segments.

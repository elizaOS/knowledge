# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-23

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Rendering & Technical Issues
- The development team is troubleshooting transparency and lighting problems across different branches in a 3D world project
- The team reverted to using the "dev" branch due to lighting/roof issues despite the "render-pipeline" branch having fixed transparency ordering issues
- A key technical problem involves "light leak" functionality (sun light passing through mesh) not working properly in the render-pipeline branch, possibly due to flipped normals
- A user reported red cubes appearing randomly in their world after deployment, suggesting file size limit issues that required environment variable adjustments

### Documentation & Access
- Documentation URL has changed from hyperfy.how to docs.hyperfy.xyz, causing confusion for some users
- CheddarQueso mentioned being unable to access hyperfy.how while in Cannes and was directed to the correct docs URL

### Token Economics
- Discussion about token utility with Johan arguing that "no utility = best utility" unless a platform generates significant fees
- Johan suggested token holders shouldn't expect utility proportional to market cap, but instead should hope for project success
- REKT's approach was referenced as an example where the token doesn't directly own IP or receive revenue, but appreciates as the brand grows

### Hosting Services
- ovo mentioned trying HypPrivakos' hosting service (HyperWorld.Host) but switched to their own server due to stability concerns, specifically network disconnection issues

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Which branch/version is this world?**  
A: It's on dev branch. (answered by ~/drdoge.eth and 0mka)

**Q: Why did they go back to dev branch?**  
A: Because of issues with lighting/roof and transparency on the render pipeline affecting some stuff. (answered by 0mka and ~/drdoge.eth)

**Q: What is light leak?**  
A: It's like what vox is doing leaking the sun through mesh, cookie cutter style. (answered by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)

**Q: Hyperfy.how is down.. any alternative?**  
A: https://docs.hyperfy.xyz/ (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Rendering Pipeline Troubleshooting**
   - ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/ helped Ashxn understand why the dev branch was used instead of render-pipeline for project 89
   - ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/ explained what "light leak" means in their rendering context and suggested flipped normals as a potential cause

2. **Deployment & Documentation Support**
   - HypPrivakos offered assistance to ovo regarding red cubes appearing after deployment, requesting details about the problematic files
   - HypPrivakos directed CheddarQueso to the correct documentation URL when they couldn't access hyperfy.how
   - ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/ offered to help ovo with deployment issues when they return

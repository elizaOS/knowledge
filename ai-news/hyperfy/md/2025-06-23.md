# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-23

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Issues & Development
- **Rendering Pipeline Challenges**: Discussions focused on transparency ordering issues and light leaking effects between the "dev" and "render-pipeline" branches. The transparency problems on the render pipeline were affecting certain elements, while light leak functionality wasn't working properly, possibly due to flipped normals.
- **Asset Loading Problems**: A user reported red cubes appearing randomly in their world after deployment, likely related to file size limits. The conversation included code snippets showing multipart registration configurations with different file size limits (300MB and 500MB).
- **Collections System**: Detailed troubleshooting revealed that .hyp files need to be placed in src/world/collections/default rather than directly in the world folder to be properly registered for code reference.
- **Portal Functionality**: Users discussed issues with portal teleportation not working, with solutions focusing on proper configuration and name matching.

### Platform Vision & Token Economics
- **HYPER Token Utility**: Community members discussed the HYPER token's value proposition, drawing parallels to other successful token models like REKT that function as brand coins rather than offering direct utility.
- **Competitive Positioning**: Users compared Hyperfy favorably to centralized platforms like Roblox and Minecraft, highlighting that Hyperfy allows users to truly own their digital worlds. Some noted Roblox's $70B valuation versus Hyperfy's much smaller $1.5M market cap, suggesting significant growth potential.
- **Backpack/Collectables System**: Developers discussed a concept that would allow makers to create items that regular users could collect and use to build their own worlds, enhancing the platform's creative capabilities.

### Documentation & Resources
- **URL Changes**: Several users noted confusion about documentation URL changes from hyperfy.how to docs.hyperfy.xyz, with confirmation that the repository links had been updated.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Which branch/version is this world?**  
A: It's on dev branch (answered by ~/drdoge.eth and 0mka)

**Q: What is light leak?**  
A: It's like what vox is doing leaking the sun through mesh, cookie cutter style (answered by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)

**Q: How do I register .hyps so they can be referenced by code later?**  
A: Put the hyp in the src/world/collections/default folder and add it to manifest.json, then reboot (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How to set the birth point?**  
A: Use the command "/spawn set" (answered by Valiant)

**Q: How to use portal? I placed a portal and a place, but don't work**  
A: In the config, make sure to match the names properly (answered by 0mka)

**Q: What should token holders expect regarding utility?**  
A: Token holders should not expect utility worthy of a certain marketcap but should hope for project success which brings attention and price appreciation (answered by johan)

**Q: How does HYPER compare to other platforms?**  
A: HYPERFY > Roblox+Minecraft because users actually get to own their worlds (answered by Xukonth and Z aka MetaDJ)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Collections Troubleshooting**:  
   Ashxn helped hiroP who was struggling to register .hyp files for code reference. Ashxn explained files need to be in src/world/collections/default not /world/collections/default, and that collections are built on startup. Ashxn also pointed to src/server/collections.js for debugging and explained how collections are registered.

2. **Rendering Issues Explanation**:  
   ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/ helped Ashxn understand what "light leak" referred to, explaining it's about sun leaking through mesh in a cookie cutter style.

3. **Asset Loading Problems**:  
   HypPrivakos offered to help troubleshoot red cubes appearing randomly in a user's world deployment if provided with world name and problematic file details.

4. **Portal Configuration**:  
   0mka and Valiant helped Coinexpert with portal functionality and spawn point settings, providing specific commands and configuration advice.

5. **Token Economics Perspective**:  
   Johan provided context to channel members about token utility models, explaining that successful tokens like REKT don't need direct utility but benefit from brand recognition and project success.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Free Camera Implementation**: Shiffty successfully implemented a free camera with linear interpolation replacing quadratic easing functions, which was positively received as feeling identical to the v1 implementation.
- **Environment Configuration**: Developers discussed the importance of `ASSETS=local` setting in the .env file for proper environment setup.
- **Primitive Components**: Several users worked through issues with the Prim component, particularly regarding rotation specifications (which must be in radians).
- **UV Mapping Techniques**: Vox shared resources for UV scrolling and a tutorial about flattening UVs in vanilla Blender without requiring addons.
- **Experimental World**: Vox showcased an experimental world featuring UV scrolling and PBR (Physically Based Rendering) capabilities, which received praise for its optimization and visual quality despite some initial connection issues.

### Platform Development
- **Unified Controls**: Ash mentioned plans for unified controls across devices (mobile, desktop, VR) to provide consistent interaction methods, such as long-clicking objects to access action menus.
- **Documentation Changes**: Users noted that hyperfy.how domain is no longer available, replaced by docs.hyperfy.xyz.
- **Self-Hosting**: Discussion about using Coolify to self-host multiple Hyperfy worlds, with warnings about proper storage management to prevent crashes.

### Community & Industry News
- **GitHub Organizational Changes**: Community members discussed Microsoft's decision to integrate GitHub into their AI Tooling division and the CEO stepping down, expressing concerns about GitHub potentially losing its independence.
- **Development Activity**: Some users questioned the level of GitHub activity, but Shiffty and others confirmed that development remains active.
- **Bounty Program**: A $500 bounty was announced for implementing a "Tile Dash" game in Hyperfy v2, similar to the existing HyperCloud in the play world.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Are primitives broken in dev?**  
A: No, they're working in the latest dev version. (answered by ash)

**Q: How can I set up multiple worlds like the real hyperfy site if I'm self hosting?**  
A: Use one server with Coolify on it. Coolify can manage multiple worlds. (answered by ash)

**Q: How do I rotate prim planes?**  
A: Rotation is in radians. For degrees, use `rotation: [0, 45 * DEG2RAD, 0]` to convert degrees to radians. (answered by ash)

**Q: How can I find my-world folders in WSL?**  
A: `\\wsl$` is typically a shortcut to your WSL folder. (answered by Shiffty)

**Q: It seems like GitHub activity mostly stopped?**  
A: This shows a bunch of recent contributions [link to GitHub activity]. (answered by Shiffty)

**Q: Can you make a Hyperfy tutorial video for smartphone and Windows?**  
A: It natively works on smartphone with nothing special to do. To run a server, you can either use Docker or Node.js locally, or use a hosted solution like fly.io or hyperworld.host. (answered by HypPrivakos)

**Q: Is hyperfy.how coming back?**  
A: The domain had to be changed. It's not coming back. Use docs.hyperfy.xyz instead. (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)

**Q: Do you know a way to build inside an HF world from Android (smartphones/Quest headsets)?**  
A: That's part of the unified controls plan. The goal is to unify controls across devices, e.g., long-clicking on an object brings up an action menu on mobile, desktop, and VR with options to move/duplicate/delete etc. (answered by ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Git Troubleshooting**:
   - Shiffty experienced undefined Prim imports
   - After wiping and cloning the repo, the issue was resolved
   - This highlighted potential Git-related issues that other developers might encounter

2. **Free Camera Implementation**:
   - Shiffty implemented a free camera with linear interpolation
   - Ash and vox provided feedback and approval for further refinement
   - This collaboration improved a core platform feature

3. **Primitive Component Rotation**:
   - Lastraum struggled with rotating prim planes
   - Ash explained that rotation needs to be in radians, using DEG2RAD for conversion
   - This helped clarify a common point of confusion for developers

4. **Experimental World Debugging**:
   - Vox self-debugged connection issues with their experimental world
   - Identified and fixed the issue related to a preloaded Audio App
   - Shared the solution with the community

5. **Documentation Resources**:
   - When Mtv969.eth found hyperfy.how unavailable
   - Vox provided the link to docs.hyperfy.xyz as the current documentation resource
   - Helped maintain community access to important resources

## Action Items

### Technical
- Remove quadratic easing completely and make linear interpolation configurable with default of 0.05 (mentioned by Shiffty)
- Update play world to latest version (mentioned by ash)
- Implement unified controls across devices (mobile, desktop, VR) with consistent interaction methods (mentioned by ash)
- Fix mobile building interface for Android/Quest devices (mentioned by Enryt)
- Implement Conway's Game of Life in 3D environment (mentioned by MetaMike)

### Feature
- Implement Tile Dash game in Hyperfy v2 with chat output for levels (mentioned by ash)
- Add multiplayer support to Tile Dash game as a stretch goal (mentioned by ash)

### Documentation
- Be aware of storage management in Coolify to prevent crashes when self-hosting (mentioned by .hyp shaman)
- Update media references that point to hyperfy.how domain (mentioned by Mtv969.eth)

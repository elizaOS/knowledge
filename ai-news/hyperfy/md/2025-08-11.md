# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Activity
- Community members refuted claims about decreased GitHub activity, providing evidence of ongoing development
- Discussions referenced the MIGRATIONS.md file in the Hyperfy GitHub repository as a resource for developers

### Technical Implementations
- **Free Camera Improvements**: Shiffty proposed and implemented a version with fixed linear interpolation instead of quadratic easing, which was well-received
- **Experimental World Demo**: Vox shared a world featuring UV scrolling and PBR (Physically Based Rendering) capabilities, demonstrating Hyperfy's technical potential
- **Environment Configuration**: Developers discussed proper environment variable setup, specifically the need for `ASSETS=local` in the .env file

### Platform Documentation
- The hyperfy.how domain has been replaced by docs.hyperfy.xyz
- Some community members expressed interest in recovering the old domain

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: It seems like GitHub activity mostly stopped?**  
A: "This shows a bunch of recent contributions...?" (Shiffty provided evidence of ongoing development)

**Q: Are primitives broke in dev?**  
A: "Nah I'm on latest dev right now" (confirmed by ash)

**Q: Can you make a Hyperfy tutorial video for smartphone and Windows?**  
A: "It natively works on smartphone, there is nothing special to do. To run a server, you can either use docker or nodejs locally or use a hosted solution like fly.io or a platform like mine: hyperworld.host" (HypPrivakos)

**Q: Is hyperfy.how coming back?**  
A: "Domain had to be changed. It's not coming back." (ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Environment Setup Assistance
- **Helper**: ash
- **Issue**: Missing environment variables in .env file
- **Resolution**: Suggested adding `ASSETS=local` and referenced .env.example and MIGRATIONS.md

### Technical Troubleshooting
- **Helper**: Shiffty
- **Issue**: Free camera implementation with easing function issues
- **Resolution**: Created version with fixed linear interpolation that felt "100% the same to v1"

### Repository Issues
- **Helper**: ash
- **Issue**: Git issues with primitives
- **Resolution**: Confirmed dev was working, leading Shiffty to wipe and clone the repo

### Experimental World Debugging
- **Helper**: vox (self-resolved)
- **Issue**: Disconnection issues in experimental world
- **Resolution**: Identified and fixed the issue as being related to a preloaded Audio App

## Action Items

### Technical
- Remove quadratic easing completely and make linear interpolation configurable with default of 0.05 (Mentioned by Shiffty)
- Ensure proper environment variables are set with ASSETS=local (Mentioned by ash)
- Fix disconnection issues in experimental world with UV scrolling (Mentioned by vox)
- Recover the hyperfy.how domain (Mentioned by ash)

### Documentation
- Update media references to hyperfy.how (Mentioned by Mtv969.eth)

### Feature Requests
- Implement DOF (Depth of Field) slider (Mentioned by vox)
- Continue development of PBR capabilities in worlds (Mentioned by vox)

### Community
- Increase engagement with Hyperfy's social media posts on X/Twitter (Mentioned by Xukonth)

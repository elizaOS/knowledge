# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-19

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Gaussian Splatting Implementation
- **mrtzhckr** developed a prototype for Gaussian Splatting support in Hyperfy using Spark.js
- The implementation allows drag & drop PLY/SPLAT files with real-time controls for photorealistic 3D worlds
- A GitHub repository and demo site were shared for community testing and contribution
- **Ash** suggested a potentially simpler approach using a new "splat" node with splat file type support
- Discussion about forming a dedicated splatting workgroup to design an optimal approach for Hyperfy's architecture

### Platform Development
- Brief discussion about Hyperfy and Mesa integration possibilities
- Interest expressed in "DeSci AI & virtual wood-wide-web" integration related to fungi farming and metaverse forestry
- Display issues reported on new iPhone devices
- Excitement about a possible fullscreen API on iOS Safari
- Completion of a UI design project announced by **HypPrivakos**, receiving positive feedback

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does spark.js work with threejs?** (asked by ash)  
**A:** Yes, spark.js works with threejs. https://github.com/sparkjsdev/spark was used as a starting point. (answered by mrtzhckr)

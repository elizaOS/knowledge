# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-12-01

**Date: December 1, 2025**

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Licensing & Development
- Detailed discussion about Hyperfy's GPLv3 license and its implications for app developers
- Clarification that apps built on Hyperfy are not subject to GPLv3 requirements
- Explanation of the "SaaS loophole" where GPL only triggers when distributing software, not when running services
- Technical recommendation to keep proprietary business logic on private backend servers
- Discussion about client-side code exposure in browser environments

### AI & Agents
- Concerns raised about the current state of agent development being too simplistic (basic NPCs)
- Distinction made between basic NPCs in play.hyperfy and more advanced "Eliza in hyperfy" system
- Interest expressed in developing more sophisticated agentic AI beyond gaming scenarios

### Platform Status
- Brief mention of a potential "V1" outage, which was confirmed to be working for at least one user
- HYPER/SOL trading information showed a market cap of 690K with a -7.4% price change

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does the GPLv3 license apply to apps built on Hyperfy?**  
A: No, apps are not part of the codebase, so the license doesn't apply to them. Apps can be entirely proprietary and monetized.

**Q: Can you sell GPL software?**  
A: Yes, you can sell GPL software at any price, but you must provide source code, include the GPL license, and allow recipients the same freedoms.

**Q: Does running services on GPL software require sharing code?**  
A: No, GPLv3 only triggers when you distribute the software, not when running it as a service (the "SaaS loophole").

**Q: Is anyone focusing on Agentic AI outside of gaming scenarios in this community?**  
A: Partially answered - there is a distinction between basic NPCs in play.hyperfy and more advanced character systems like "Eliza in hyperfy" that allow more human-like interactions.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Protecting Proprietary Code**
   - Helper: 3rdEyeVisuals
   - Helpee: Ozymandias
   - Context: How to protect proprietary code in Hyperfy apps
   - Resolution: Suggested keeping business logic on private backend servers and only sending minimal UI code to the browser with fetch requests to a private backend

2. **License Clarification**
   - Helper: HypPrivakos & ash
   - Helpee: Ozymandias
   - Context: Confusion about license applicability to apps
   - Resolution: Clarified that apps are not combined with the codebase, comparing it to Windows apps that can be proprietary despite running on Windows

3. **Agent Capabilities**
   - Helper: .hyp shaman
   - Helpee: Fibelius
   - Context: Confusion about agent capabilities in Hyperfy
   - Resolution: Clarified the distinction between basic NPCs and more advanced character systems

## Action Items

### Technical
- Create a proper backend system for apps to keep proprietary code server-side (Mentioned by: 3rdEyeVisuals)
- Use fetch requests to communicate between client and private backend (Mentioned by: 3rdEyeVisuals)
- Consider code obfuscation for client-side code that must be sent to browser (Mentioned by: Ozymandias)

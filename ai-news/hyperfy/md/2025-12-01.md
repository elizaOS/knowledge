# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-12-01

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Licensing and Development
- **GPLv3 License Clarification**: Extensive discussion about Hyperfy's GPLv3 license and its implications for app developers. The consensus is that apps built on Hyperfy are separate from the engine codebase and not subject to the GPLv3 license, allowing developers to maintain proprietary code.
- **Protecting Proprietary Code**: Technical approaches were discussed for protecting intellectual property when building on Hyperfy, with the recommended solution being a client-server architecture where sensitive code remains server-side while only UI elements are sent to the client browser.
- **Asset Protection Limitations**: ash noted that while developers may want to protect their assets, DRM is ultimately ineffective as determined individuals can always find ways to extract assets.

### Movement Mechanics
- **Wall Climbing Features**: Discussion about implementing wall climbing/hanging features in Hyperfy, with community members expressing enthusiasm for enhanced movement mechanics.
- **Modular Movement Systems**: Dhin proposed creating different control schemes and movement mechanics as modular "hyps" that could be added to worlds, similar to how games like Super Mario 64 or Uncharted have distinctive movement systems.
- **Movement Priority**: Akuma emphasized that movement is "the number one most important thing in hyperfy" as it affects all users' experience.

### AI Agent Development
- **Platform Alternatives**: Discussion about alternatives to Twitter/X for building AI agents, with Farcaster recommended as a more developer-friendly and cost-effective platform.
- **Agent Sophistication**: Fibelius expressed disappointment about the focus of agent development being limited to simple NPCs with basic behaviors rather than more sophisticated agentic AI applications.

### Self-Hosting Solutions
- **Deployment Options**: Several hosting solutions were suggested for self-hosting, including Docker, Coolify, fly.io, and dokploy.
- **User-Friendliness Concerns**: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 found Coolify too complex for non-developers, prompting ash to suggest dokploy as an alternative with better documentation.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does the GPLv3 license apply to apps built on Hyperfy?** (asked by Ozymandias)  
**A:** No, apps are not part of the codebase the license is for. (answered by ash)

**Q: Can you sell GPL software?** (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals)  
**A:** Yes, you can sell GPL software, but you must provide source code, include the GPL license, and allow recipients the same freedoms. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)

**Q: How can developers protect proprietary code in Hyperfy apps?** (asked by Ozymandias)  
**A:** Keep all logic out of the browser by creating a backend server for your apps to run from, with only rendering happening client-side. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)

**Q: Is it possible to prevent people from ripping assets?** (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals)  
**A:** It's nearly impossible to prevent completely; DRM is a billion dollar industry yet we can still download any music or video. (answered by ash)

**Q: How can I build an AI agent that responds to tags and mentions on X without paying for the expensive API?** (asked by Darkfallx.phng)  
**A:** Use Farcaster instead of X, and look into Neynar. ElizaOS is also recommended as a starting point. (answered by .hyp shaman)

**Q: What are some options for self-hosting?** (implied by .hyp shaman)  
**A:** Docker, Coolify, and fly.io (answered by .hyp shaman)

**Q: Is Coolify user-friendly for non-coders?** (implied by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)  
**A:** No, it can be "SUPER confusing" for non-developers (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)

## Community Help & Collaboration

   - Helper: 3rdEyeVisuals
   - Helpee: Ozymandias
   - Context: Explaining GPL licensing implications for Hyperfy apps
   - Resolution: Clarified that keeping logic on a private backend server would protect proprietary code from GPL requirements

2. **App Licensing Concerns**
   - Helper: HypPrivakos
   - Helpee: Ozymandias
   - Context: Confusion about whether apps are subject to Hyperfy's GPLv3 license
   - Resolution: Explained that apps are not combined with the codebase, comparing it to Windows apps vs Windows OS

3. **AI Agent Development Platforms**
   - Helper: .hyp shaman
   - Helpee: Darkfallx.phng
   - Context: Needed alternative to expensive X API for building an AI agent that responds to mentions
   - Resolution: Suggested Farcaster with Neynar as a more accessible platform and ElizaOS as a starting point

4. **Self-Hosting Solutions**
   - Helper: ash
   - Helpee: Channel members

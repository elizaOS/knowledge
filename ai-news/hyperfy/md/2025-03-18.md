# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-18

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Tools & Features
- **MCP Integration with Cursor**: A significant breakthrough allowing live code updates in Hyperfy worlds without reloading. Developers can now modify app scripts on the fly. (peezy)
- **Physics Improvements**: New rigidbody force methods have been added, enabling more interactive applications:
  - `rigidbody.addForce(force: Vector3)`
  - `rigidbody.addTorque(force: Vector3)`
  - `rigidbody.addForceAtPos(force, pos)` coming soon for vehicles
- **Water Effects**: Implementation shared for creating water by scrolling diffuse and normal textures, with code that updates textureX and textureY properties each frame.
- **UI Updates**: Improvements to padding and margin on UI components, allowing for better image fitting on pyramid shapes.

### Platform Capabilities & Limitations
- Hyperfy is built on Three.js, but not all Three.js functionality is fully exposed yet. Some primitives like Vector3 are available.
- First-person mode is confirmed working in v2 and can be set up for players or apps.
- The platform runs on iPhone 12 and should work on newer hardware like Snapdragon XR2 (Quest 3).
- Warning about potential issues with "itemsUI" component causing freezing in some environments.

### Marketing & Communication
- Discussion about Hyperfy's positioning challenges - users noted difficulties understanding what Hyperfy is (game engine, platform, etc.)
- Debate about how to better communicate Hyperfy's value to different user personas (developers, creators, etc.)
- Suggestion to update hyperfy.xyz homepage to clearly explain Hyperfy's purpose and direct different user types appropriately.

### Cryptocurrency
- Brief discussion about HYPER token price (around $0.007) with some users expressing concern about price stagnation.
- Price checking commands ($hyperfy) showing current HYPER/SOL price and market cap information.

### Community Events
- Announcement of "Culture Chain TV Episode 4" focused on cannabis, Web3, security strategies, and music innovation, scheduled for March 21, 2025.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How does the new plugin system differ from directly modifying app and world?**  
A: It uses an inject method instead of directly modifying components. (Ashxn)

**Q: Can we add forces to rigidbodies?**  
A: Yes, rigidbody.addForce(force: Vector3) and rigidbody.addTorque(force: Vector3) are live, with rigidbody.addForceAtPos(force, pos) coming for vehicles. (Ashxn)

**Q: Does the "one light is best" guideline include the world sun?**  
A: Yes, but two lights won't make a huge difference. (Ashxn)

**Q: How does the MCP on cursor work?**  
A: It adds MCP to the server with tools for querying the database and changing entity scripts. (peezy)

**Q: Does first person mode work in v2?**  
A: Yes, it can be set up for the player or on an app. (drdoge.eth)

**Q: Are there any plans to integrate AI here?**  
A: Yes, there are several AI initiatives with resources available at hyperfy.how/guides/coding/ai/ and hyperfy.how/guides/ai/agents/. (Omka)

**Q: Is hytopia a competitor to hyperfy?**  
A: Yes, they're building something like Minecraft without licensing issues with a Roblox spin. They were formerly NFT Worlds. (Ashxn and bear)

**Q: How do I create a world so I can create own stuff?**  
A: Check out hyperfy.how. (bear)

**Q: Is this ok that I don't see apps?**  
A: You have to make apps. Worlds don't come with any preinstalled. (᲼)

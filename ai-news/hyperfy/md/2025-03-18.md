# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-18

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Plugin System & Development Tools
- **Plugin Injection Technology**: Peezy is working on converting mods to use a new injection system that helps manage conflicts. The approach uses an "inject" method rather than directly modifying app and world objects.
- **MCP on Cursor Implementation**: Peezy implemented Model-Code-Prompt functionality on cursor, enabling live code updates between IDE and Hyperfy worlds without copy-pasting.
- **Three.js Integration**: Discussion revealed that while Hyperfy is built on Three.js, not all Three.js functionality is currently exposed to developers. Some primitives like Vector3 are available, but not all Three.js objects yet.

### Physics & Graphics Improvements
- **Rigidbody Physics**: Ashxn announced improvements with new `addForce()` and `addTorque()` methods, with plans for `addForceAtPos()` in the future.
- **Physics Applications**: Shiffty demonstrated these capabilities with a ball camera implementation enabling golf, bowling, and similar physics-based games.
- **Water Effects**: Ashxn shared a water effect implementation using scrolling diffuse and normal textures with a simple JavaScript code snippet that updates texture coordinates each frame.
- **UI Updates**: Ash made improvements to padding and margin on UI components, allowing for better image fitting on pyramid shapes.

### Platform Identity & Messaging
- **Defining Hyperfy**: Extensive discussion about Hyperfy's messaging challenges, with users noting difficulties explaining what Hyperfy is to newcomers.
- **Positioning Debate**: The community debated whether Hyperfy should be presented as a game engine, platform, or sandbox.
- **Meta Game Engine**: Ashxn described Hyperfy as "a meta game engine" that "replaces offline editing with live collaboration and a portable object format."

### VR & Hardware Compatibility
- **Device Support**: Confirmation that the application runs on iPhone 12 and should work on newer VR hardware like Snapdragon XR2 (Quest 3).
- **First Person Mode**: Confirmation that first person mode works in v2 and can be set up for the player or on an app.

### HYPER Token Discussion
- **Price Commentary**: Users discussed the HYPER token's current value (around $0.007) with mixed sentiments about market movements.
- **Market Concerns**: Some users expressed concern about the token's price not increasing over recent months, while others remained optimistic about future value.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How does the plugin injection system work compared to directly modifying app and world objects?**  
A: It uses an "inject" method instead of directly modifying objects, which helps avoid conflicts, though systems added to createClientWorld/createServerWorld can still conflict. (Ashxn)

**Q: Can we add forces to rigidbodies?**  
A: Yes, `rigidbody.addForce(force: Vector3)` and `rigidbody.addTorque(force: Vector3)` are live, with `rigidbody.addForceAtPos(force, pos)` planned for future vehicle implementations. (Ashxn)

**Q: How does the MCP on cursor work?**  
A: It adds MCP functionality to the server with tools for querying the database and changing entity scripts, allowing live code updates between cursor and Hyperfy. (peezy)

**Q: Does first person mode work in v2?**  
A: Yes, it works and can be set up for the player or on an app. (drdoge.eth)

**Q: Are there any plans to integrate AI here?**  
A: Yes, multiple resources are available including guides at hyperfy.how. (Omka)

**Q: Is hytopia a competitor to hyperfy?**  
A: Yes, they're building something like Minecraft without licensing issues with a Roblox spin; they were formerly NFT Worlds. (Ashxn and bear)

**Q: How do I create a world so I can create own stuff?**  
A: Check out https://hyperfy.how. (bear)

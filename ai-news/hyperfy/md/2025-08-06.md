# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **New Primitives & UI Components**: Ashxn shared updates about new primitives with textures and a color picker prop created by Saori, requiring an npm install for the new color picker library.
- **Cursor Interaction System**: Gert-Jan Akerboom demonstrated a UI-based approach for changing the cursor when objects are clickable by using a tiny screenspace UI element in the center of the screen. Ashxn shared a related GitHub PR (#120).
- **Voxel Terrain Island**: Discussion about setting up a branch of this project, with Ashxn noting it would need a multiplayer networking system as it wasn't originally designed with that in mind.
- **Local Apps Development**: Ashxn mentioned that "peezy" has been working on local apps to facilitate larger builds and version control.
- **3D Windows & Light**: Detailed discussion on making windows in 3D models allow light to pass through without casting shadows, with solutions involving the Hyperfy Blender plugin and normal flipping.

### Platform Vision & Future Features
- **AI Integration**: Developers discussed potential AI features like text-to-app generation within worlds using an API key (e.g., "/create a big castle").
- **Metaverse Scope**: Brief philosophical discussion about Hyperfy extending beyond just being a metaverse platform, with Z - MetaDJ suggesting we already live in a form of metaverse through internet and social media.
- **Real-time Video Generation**: Z - MetaDJ mentioned a technology that creates what appears to be 3D environments but doesn't actually generate downloadable 3D assets.

### Community
- **Meetup Cancellation**: A community meetup was canceled due to several members being unavailable.
- **TLD Discussion**: Brief mention that creating a ".hyp" TLD would cost around $200K.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: How time consuming would it be to set up a branch of the "voxel terrain island"?  
   **A**: "Things have changed a lot but most is still relevant; it wasn't set up with multiplayer networking though, so it would need a system for that." - Ashxn

2. **Q**: Does anyone know how to make windows not cast a shadow and allow light through in world?  
   **A**: "Disable castShadows and receiveShadows using the Hyperfy Blender plugin" - Ashxn

3. **Q**: How do I get that new hyperfy plugin?  
   **A**: "It's in the github repo: https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy/blob/dev/docs/extras/blender-addon.py" - Ashxn

4. **Q**: How much does it cost to buy a TLD?  
   **A**: "Only costs like 200k to buy a TLD, but they have to accept it" - Ashxn

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Window Transparency Solutions**:
   - **vox** helped **ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì** by suggesting flipping normals to allow light through meshes and providing examples in Hyperfy worlds.
   - **Ashxn** provided an alternative solution using castShadows and receiveShadows properties in the Hyperfy Blender plugin with screenshots and GitHub link.

2. **Cursor Interaction Implementation**:
   - **Gert-Jan Akerboom** shared with **Ashxn** a solution for changing cursor when objects are clickable using tiny screenspace UI in the center of the screen.

3. **Voxel Terrain Project**:
   - **Ashxn** helped **.hyp shaman** by explaining that while most content in the voxel terrain island project is still relevant, it would need a multiplayer networking system.

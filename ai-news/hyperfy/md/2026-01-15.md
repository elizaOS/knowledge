# Hyperfy Discord - 2026-01-15

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Implementations
- **Metamask Wallet Integration**: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 implemented Metamask wallet connectivity in a virtual world, including an "OP Badge claim" feature described as "first of its kind for Open Page"
- **MML Link Conversion**: Added support for avatar customization through MML link conversion
- **Proof of Humanity Concept**: Agent12 suggested that interactive experiences in virtual worlds could serve as an effective Proof of Humanity (POH) mechanism, noting that AI can visit sites but can't yet complete interactive experiences

### Platform Status
- **Hyperfy v1 Status**: Confirmed to be working normally, including the editing functionality
- **Hyperfy v2**: Mentioned as being open source and "always up"

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Was the edit function removed or hidden on Hyperfy v1?** (asked by Rizzle)  
**A:** No, v1 editing works fine. The issue might be related to a UI-hiding shortcut or screen minimization (answered by untitled, xyz and Pete)

**Q: Why is Hyperfy down?** (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰)  
**A:** v1 seems to be working fine and v2 is open source, so it's always up (answered by untitled, xyz)

**Q: How can users access the OP Badge claim?** (implied from 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓's message)  
**A:** Look for the floating cube in the space pod (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### UI Troubleshooting
- **Pete** helped **Rizzle** with finding the edit function in Hyperfy v1, suggesting that a UI-hiding shortcut (possibly 'z') might have been accidentally activated
- **untitled, xyz** confirmed v1 editing was working and shared a screenshot, helping identify that Rizzle's issue was related to screen minimization
- **Rizzle** later confirmed the issue was resolved, noting it was related to having their screen minimized

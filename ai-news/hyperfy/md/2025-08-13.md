# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-13

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Game Development
- **Tile Dash Game**: Lastraum shared a multiplayer game where players navigate obstacles to collect yellow tiles while avoiding red ones. Features 50 levels with increasing difficulty, mobile support, and a token reward system (25 tokens per completed level).
- **Racing Game**: Valiant developed a racing game with time trial system and leaderboard using persistent storage.
- **Gameplay Feedback**: Ash provided feedback on Tile Dash, noting issues with the first level being too difficult and players experiencing immediate game over in level 2.

### Technical Discussions
- **Cross-Platform Interface**: Ash outlined a unified interaction model working across desktop, mobile, and VR with 90% consistency, featuring a wheel-based menu system activated differently on each platform.
- **Physics Implementation**: Lastraum explained their solution for physics in Decentraland using server-simulated physics with client-side colliders.
- **Performance Optimization**: Discussions about high resource usage in Lastraum's world, with suggestions for GLB optimization, webp textures, and LODs.
- **VR Improvements**: Users noted that leg animations now work properly in VR, with plans for in-VR arms and hand-tracking.

### Community & Token Concerns
- **Token Visibility**: Community members expressed concerns about low engagement and visibility for the Hyper token, with requests for more information about roadmap and future direction.
- **Community Engagement**: Xukonth encouraged members to increase interaction on X (Twitter) to support posts from official Hyperfy accounts.
- **Project Leadership**: Ash addressed tensions with a former contributor (Saori) who continues to criticize the project while still using the technology.

### Creative Projects
- **Audio Streams from Repositories**: Marcel shared a project that generates audio streams from repository updates, including Hyperfy, which received positive feedback.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I rename an app?**  
A: In metadata, use the little tag icon (answered by ash)

**Q: Is there a better way to update hyperfy locally so errors don't come up?**  
A: Follow this process: commit/stash changes, git pull --rebase, npm install, check Migrations.md, then npm run dev (answered by ash)

**Q: How do you implement physics in Decentraland without native support?**  
A: Server simulated physics and client side colliders. The client side collider blocks going through it, and the server tracks player positions and balls for force using Colyseus server (answered by Lastraum)

**Q: How can the interface be consistent across platforms?**  
A: Use a wheel-based menu activated by right-click (desktop), long press (mobile), or trigger press (VR), plus consistent movement controls (answered by ash)

**Q: Do VR avatars have working legs now?**  
A: Yes, VR avatar legs are now working and "look great" (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)

**Q: Is the first level of Tile Dash too difficult?**  
A: There's a green safe zone for each level, but difficulty increases; the objective is collecting tiles rather than completing levels (answered by Lastraum)

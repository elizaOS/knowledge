## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Licensing & Open Source
- **GPL-3 License Clarification**: Ash provided detailed explanations about how the Hyperfy v2 engine's GPL-3 license works in practice
- **Engine vs. Apps Distinction**: Important distinction made that while engine modifications must remain open-source under GPL-3, apps created through the UI interface can remain closed-source
- **License Enforcement Philosophy**: Hyperfy team would only enforce license requirements if someone was making substantial profit from a fork with significant improvements without contributing back to the community

### Development Workflows
- Brief mention of interest in how community members approach coding workflows within the Hyperfy environment

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: When someone mods this engine, does the result have to stay open-source? And can apps added via the UI interface remain closed-source?**  
*Asked by Ozymandias*

**A:** Yes, under GPL-3 which Hyperfy v2 engine uses, mods to the engine must stay open-source, but apps aren't part of the codebase the license covers so they can remain closed-source.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **License Implications Explanation**: Ash helped Ozymandias understand the practical implications of GPL-3 licensing for the Hyperfy engine, clarifying that:
  - The license is designed to prevent others from profiting off forks with improvements that should have been contributed back
  - The main purpose is ensuring that if someone benefits significantly from the code, those benefits are extended to everyone
  - Apps created through the UI aren't considered part of the licensed codebase

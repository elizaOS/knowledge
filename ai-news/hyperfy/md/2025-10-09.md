- **Text App with Link Functionality**: Gert-Jan modified the default text app to include clickable links, though it currently works on desktop but not on mobile devices.
- **Multiplayer Projectile Code**: Shiffty shared a reference to multiplayer projectile code in a "launch party" app on HyperWorld.Host marketplace (ID: 67bd464ee1a4e29fb3639805), noting it's somewhat outdated regarding emotes and particles.

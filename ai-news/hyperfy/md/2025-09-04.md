# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Vibe World Exploration & Issues
Users actively explored the "vibe world" environment, experimenting with asset generation using the `/create` command. A drone swarm creation was temporarily invisible before being restored. Later in the day, the vibe world stopped generating content, possibly due to someone prompting a "particle accelerator" or "Black Hole" that may have caused system issues. Ash mentioned fixing a physics bug in the vibe world related to a zero-height cone in the "eye of sauron tower" that was causing falling/jumping issues.

### Technical Development Discussions
TheMattEmpire inquired about multiselect tools for a town project, which ash confirmed weren't currently in development. This led to exploration of alternative approaches, including using Blender with linked duplicates. However, this approach presented limitations as GLB files with linked duplicates couldn't be individually edited once imported into Hyperfy. Gert-Jan Akerboom suggested using collection instances in Blender as a potential workaround for updating multiple building components simultaneously.

### Environment Configuration
Shiffty provided guidance on using environment variables to create and switch between experimental worlds in Hyperfy. The conversation included specific instructions about modifying the WORLD variable in the .env file and using npm run dev to create new worlds.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: When will multiselect tools be added to Hyperfy?**  
A: Not actively being worked on currently, but would be nice to have. (answered by ash)

**Q: How do I create an experimental world in Hyperfy?**  
A: Change the WORLD variable in the .env file and run npm run dev to automatically create a new world. (answered by Shiffty)

**Q: What's the vibe world address?**  
A: https://vibe.hyperfy.xyz/ (answered by Valiant)

**Q: How do I create assets in the vibe world?**  
A: Look at an empty space and type /create followed by your description in chat. Press enter to access the chat box. (answered by vox)

**Q: Is there a CA address for Hyperfy?**  
A: A link was provided in Discord. (answered by ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Experimental World Creation**  
   Shiffty helped TheMattEmpire understand how to modify the WORLD variable in .env file and use npm run dev to create new worlds for experimentation.

2. **Blender Workflow Alternatives**  
   Gert-Jan Akerboom suggested TheMattEmpire use collection instances in Blender instead of linked duplicates for a better update workflow when working with multiple building components.

3. **Vibe World Navigation**  
   Vox guided Wilson through the basics of the vibe world, explaining how to access the chat box (press enter) and use commands like `/create` and `/edit` to generate and modify assets.

4. **Asset Recovery**  
   Vox helped Valiant recover a drone swarm creation that had been set to invisible, demonstrating how to use edit prompts for manipulating object properties.

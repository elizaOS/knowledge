# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Vibe World & Generative Features
- Users actively explored the "vibe world" where objects can be created using text prompts
- A drone swarm feature was temporarily set to invisible due to heavy CPU usage
- Several technical limitations were encountered, including system crashes with specific prompts like "a cloud dissipating"
- The world stopped generating after someone prompted a "particle accelerator"
- Ash reported a physics bug in the "vibe world" related to a cone with zero height in the "eye of sauron tower"

### Development & Technical Workflows
- Multiselect tools are not currently in active development for Hyperfy
- TheMattEmpire explored workarounds for building a town project using Blender
- GLB exports with linked duplicates can't be individually edited or updated within Hyperfy
- Gert-Jan Akerboom suggested using collection instances in Blender as an alternative workflow
- Creating experimental worlds requires modifying the WORLD variable in the .env file
- B34k3r shared an NVIDIA blog post about RTX AI Garage Blueprint for 3D object generation that achieves 6-second GLB file generation

### Technical Issues
- Kz experienced problems uploading objects/assets that work locally but fail when deployed
- Questions arose about avatar persistence and whether frontend changes need corresponding .env updates
- TheMattEmpire encountered an error when attempting to create a new world

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: When will multiselect tools be added to Hyperfy?**  
A: Not actively being worked on currently, but would be nice to have. (answered by ash)

**Q: How do I create an experimental world in Hyperfy?**  
A: Change the WORLD variable in the .env file and run "npm run dev" to automatically create a new world folder. (answered by Shiffty)

**Q: What's the vibe world address?**  
A: https://vibe.hyperfy.xyz/ (answered by Valiant)

**Q: How do I create assets in the vibe world?**  
A: Look at an empty space and type /create [description] in chat. Use /edit for changes. (answered by vox)

**Q: Not seeing the chat box, any hint?**  
A: Press enter (answered by vox)

**Q: If I change the default avatar on the frontend does that also need to be done in .env to make it permanent?**  
A: That's saved automatically to the worlds database (answered by ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Creating Experimental Worlds
Shiffty helped TheMattEmpire by explaining that changing the WORLD variable in .env and running "npm run dev" would automatically create a new world folder. Ash also suggested using the "set" command as an alternative approach.

### Blender Workflow Optimization
Gert-Jan Akerboom assisted TheMattEmpire by suggesting the use of collection instances in Blender instead of linked duplicates for a better update workflow when building complex scenes.

### Vibe World Navigation
Multiple community members (vox, Valiant, Gert-Jan Akerboom) helped new users access and navigate the vibe world, providing links and explaining basic commands like /create and /edit.

### Asset Upload Troubleshooting
Gert-Jan Akerboom and ash attempted to help Kz resolve issues with uploading objects to their world, suggesting various troubleshooting steps including right-clicking on images in build mode and reviewing the .env file configuration.

## Action Items

### Technical

- **FARM2 Revival**: The FARM2 project is reportedly returning with updates based on Hyperfy technology, though some community members expressed concerns about resource allocation away from core development. (⚡│general)
- **HyperScalp**: Brief mention of a project called "HyperScalp" (initially misidentified as "HyperScape"). (⚡│general)

### 3D Model Conversion & Management
- **Hyperfy (.hyp) to GLB Conversion**: Three methods were discussed for extracting/converting Hyperfy models:
  1. Shift-clicking the box icon to download GLB files (only works for .hyp files with underlying GLB)
  2. Using the Hyperfy Tools Blender plugin for direct .hyp import
  3. Using a custom web tool created by mrtzhckr (hyperfy.mrtzhckr.de/hyp2glb/) (🧊│3d-design)
- **Build Permissions**: Discussion about allowing users to build in Hyperfy worlds while preventing them from unpinning admin-placed objects. (🧊│3d-design)

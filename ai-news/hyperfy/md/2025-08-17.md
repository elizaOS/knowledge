# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-17

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Headless AI Service**: Gh0stt and ash discussed building a headless AI service for chess (specifically Lichess), with ash sharing details about their similar system that switches between Anthropic and OpenAI APIs. The system is primarily prompt-based and includes micro-documentation of their API. (ðŸ’»â”‚developers)
- **Racing System**: Valiant is developing a racing system that needs to recognize mounted players crossing race lines/gates. The challenge is getting mounts/rides to act as proxies for players to emit race signals (start, pass gates, finish). (ðŸ’»â”‚developers)
- **Command Functionality**: Ash mentioned new command functionality for creating and editing apps (/create, /edit) and a new /fix command that sends error traces to AI for debugging. (ðŸ’»â”‚developers)

### Project Strategy
- **Multi-chain Considerations**: Cru advised against implementing multi-chain functionality too early, warning that it fragments liquidity across different blockchains which could harm the project in its early stages. (ðŸª™â”‚hyper)

### Community & Events
- **Metaverse Discussion**: Rando1337 recommended checking out GoodAlexander's Twitter space about metaverse prospects in 2025 compared to 2021, describing GoodAlexander as "one of the most legendary CT account" and "one of the smartest CT account after GCR." (âš¡â”‚general)
- **Virtual Interaction**: Fibelius expressed interest in enabling virtual characters to communicate with each other in Hyperfy v1 worlds, specifically mentioning scenarios about old friends meeting and referencing artist Yayoi Kusama. (ðŸ§Šâ”‚3d-design)

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q**: Is the example code for the headless AI opensource?  
**A**: Ash explained it's a work in progress, still being built locally with some issues to iron out before it's 100% usable.

**Q**: Why not send a signal from the vehicle to say I'm ready, teleport vehicle to race start, then start timer to start race loop?  
**A**: Valiant clarified they're trying to get the mount/ride to act as a proxy while the player is on it and emit start, pass, and finish signals.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Racing System Detection**:
   - **Helper**: Shiffty
   - **Helpee**: Valiant
   - **Context**: Detecting when mounted players cross race lines/gates
   - **Resolution**: Shiffty suggested using a demo for detecting when two objects overlap

2. **Headless AI Interface**:
   - **Helper**: ash
   - **Helpee**: Gh0stt
   - **Context**: Building a headless Lichess interface
   - **Resolution**: Ash explained their work-in-progress system that uses prompts and includes micro-documentation of their API

## Action Items

### Technical
- Complete the headless AI service for chess interfaces (mentioned by ash)
- Implement mount/ride recognition in race system (mentioned by Valiant)
- Build opensource headless Lichess interface allowing users to use personal tokens (mentioned by Gh0stt)

### Feature
- Evaluate the new /fix command that sends error traces to AI for debugging (mentioned by ash)
- Consider postponing multi-chain implementation until the project is more established (mentioned by cru)

### Design
- Explore possibilities for virtual character communication in Hyperfy v1 worlds (mentioned by Fibelius)

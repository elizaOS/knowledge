# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-17

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI-Powered Creation Tools
- Ash is developing a headless AI service that allows users to generate and edit 3D objects through prompts like `/create` and `/edit`
- The system works with both Anthropic and OpenAI models, with Sonnet 4 identified as offering the best balance of speed and design capabilities
- Performance optimizations include grouping objects by type and using shaders for colors, improving performance from ~8ms CPU to an estimated 3ms
- Gh0stt expressed interest in building a similar headless Lichess interface using the technology

### 3D Design & Optimization
- Discussions focused on asset management and optimization techniques in Hyperfy
- Ash explained that using linked duplicates in Blender creates instanced meshes that render efficiently as a single draw call
- Instancing works across all duplicates, making it ideal for creating modular buildings and towns
- The official Hyperfy Blender addon on GitHub supports LODs and is recommended over other tools

### Racing System Development
- Valiant is working on a racing system and encountering collision detection issues
- Player collision is disabled when anchored to rides/vehicles, requiring developers to track the vehicle instead
- This design prevents opposing forces from interfering with vehicle physics

### Project Strategy
- User "cru" advised against implementing multi-chain functionality in early development stages
- Going multi-chain would fragment liquidity across different blockchains, potentially harming the project
- Recommendation to postpone multi-chain implementation until the project is more established

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is the example code for the headless AI opensource?**  
A: It's still work in progress being built locally with some issues to iron out before it's 100% usable (answered by ash)

**Q: How does the AI creation system work?**  
A: You can create things with `/create a wheelbarrow` and edit them with `/edit add more wheels` (answered by ash)

**Q: Is the AI generation with primitives inside latest dev?**  
A: No, latest dev was 11/08/2025 by the looks of it (answered by Valiant)

**Q: Why isn't player collision detected when on a mount/ride?**  
A: Player collision is disabled when anchored, you have to track the moving vehicle instead (answered by .hyp shaman)

**Q: Is there any way to select a bunch of assets in world in order to duplicate and/or move it all around at one time?**  
A: Not currently available but it's on the roadmap (answered by ash)

**Q: Does the Hyperfy Tools addon export linked assets...or how are instances exported from Blender?**  
A: Everything is automatically instanced as long as in Blender you create "linked duplicates" not just regular duplicates as those are completely unique meshes (answered by ash)

**Q: If I make the building in Blender with instanced parts, put that in world, then instance the building...would the parts be instanced per building, or all instances would be instanced?**  
A: Everything instances (answered by ash)

**Q: Did notice your add-on doesn't support LODs yet though? Or is that a Node based thing which is separate?**  
A: Yeah it has LODs. Add an empty to the scene (answered by ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Racing System Collision Detection**
   - Helper: Shiffty
   - Helpee: Valiant
   - Context: Detecting overlapping objects for race system
   - Resolution: Shared a reference to a previous demo for detecting object overlaps

2. **Player Detection on Mounts**
   - Helper: .hyp shaman
   - Helpee: Valiant
   - Context: Player not being recognized when crossing race triggers while on a mount
   - Resolution: Explained that player collision is disabled when anchored, suggesting to track the vehicle instead

3. **Asset Instancing Guidance**
   - Helper: ash
   - Helpee: TheMattEmpire
   - Context: Needed guidance on asset instancing for efficient world building
   - Resolution: Directed to the official GitHub Blender addon and explained how instancing works across duplicates

4. **LOD Support Clarification**
   - Helper: ash
   - Helpee: TheMattEmpire
   - Context: Confusion about LOD support in the Blender addon
   - Resolution: Confirmed LODs are supported and provided brief instruction to add an empty to the scene

## Action Items

### Technical
- Fix issues with AI-generated scripts that tank world performance (mentioned by ash)
- Implement grouping of objects by type and use shaders for colors to improve performance from ~8ms to ~3ms (mentioned by ash)
- Develop a unified method for vehicles/rides to trigger race checkpoints (mentioned by Valiant)
- Implement group selection functionality for assets in the world editor (mentioned by ash)
- Consider delaying multi-chain implementation until project has established sufficient liquidity (mentioned by cru)

### Feature
- Allow users to provide their own API keys for AI generation to distribute costs (mentioned by Shiffty)
- Implement `/fix` command to let AI fix crashed apps using error traces (mentioned by ash)
- Create a headless Lichess interface that allows users to use their own API tokens (mentioned by Gh0stt)

### Documentation
- Create clearer documentation on how instancing works across duplicated assets (mentioned by TheMattEmpire)
- Provide more detailed instructions on implementing LODs with the Blender addon (mentioned by TheMattEmpire)

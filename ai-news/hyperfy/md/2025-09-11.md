# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI Asset Generation & Implementation
- A powerful AI asset generation system is available on the dev branch, requiring API keys for LLM integration
- The system uses optimized primitives and a well-crafted system prompt that teaches the AI about Hyperfy's architecture
- Users report GPT-5 on medium setting produces particularly impressive results
- AI-powered procedural generation creates assets on-the-fly, with reported 500x faster/cheaper production
- The public demo world (vibe.hyperfy.xyz) has this feature temporarily disabled
- Users are exploring AI for rapid generation of furniture, buildings, and terrain features

### 3D Design Techniques
- Vertex coloring and texture splatting techniques were discussed for terrain creation in GLB files
- The engine supports texture splatting (as seen on island.hyperfy.xyz), but requires complex workarounds due to GLB limitations
- Modular asset development approach allows for easy updates across multiple assets
- Level of Detail (LOD) implementation with AI assistance was mentioned
- Procedural forest generation techniques were shared

### World Structure & Technical Limitations
- Hyperfy worlds (.hyp files) consist of one .glb file plus script and metadata
- "Vibe world" experienced some technical issues, being temporarily offline and having edit mode disabled
- Cross-world experiences and persistent chat functionality for text-based interaction are being developed

### AI Agents & Virtual Characters
- Multiple users expressed interest in implementing AI agents and virtual characters with autonomous movement capabilities
- This appears to be a desired feature without clear implementation guidance currently

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a way to play with the AI asset creation stuff Ash keeps teasing? What's powering it?**  
A: It's on the dev branch. Just add your API keys. There's also a public world at vibe.hyperfy.xyz, but AI generation is currently disabled. (answered by Dhin and vox)

**Q: API keys for what? Any LLM?**  
A: Can be any LLM. Fast version models are disappointing. GPT-5 on medium is really good, sometimes mindblowing. (answered by vox)

**Q: And they're able to generate 3D assets? How does that work?**  
A: They build using primitives which are now highly optimized and ash has built a really good system prompt that teaches them all about the hyperfy architecture. (answered by Shiffty)

**Q: Can a hyp file have multiple .glb assets in it?**  
A: Every hyp is one glb + script + metadata (answered by ash)

**Q: Has anyone had any luck with texture splatting or vertex colors with GLBs?**  
A: The engine supports it, this is how the terrain was done on island.hyperfy.xyz, but the workflow is complex because gltf doesn't support it so workarounds were needed (answered by ash)

**Q: Vibe world is offline? Says 'No available server'**  
A: It's back up. Something weird going on in that world at the moment. (answered by ash)

**Q: It's going for me but no edit mode**  
A: Yes, it's turned off at the moment. (answered by ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **3D Terrain Creation Techniques**
   - Helper: ash
   - Helpee: TheMattEmpire
   - Context: TheMattEmpire needed information about texture splatting and vertex colors with GLBs for terrain creation
   - Resolution: ash confirmed it's possible, shared an example (island.hyperfy.xyz), and offered to share more details though noting it's "super finnicky"

2. **AI Generation Tools Usage**
   - Helper: vox
   - Helpee: majin
   - Context: Using AI generation tools efficiently
   - Resolution: Suggested using "r" to copy/duplicate a generated result with simplified code

3. **Vibe World Troubleshooting**
   - Helper: ash
   - Helpee: Gert-Jan Akerboom
   - Context: User reported Vibe world being offline with "No available server" message
   - Resolution: ash confirmed it was back online but mentioned unusual activity in that world

4. **AI Asset Creation Access**
   - Helper: Multiple (Dhin, vox, Valiant, Shiffty)
   - Helpee: cwe
   - Context: User asking how to access and use AI asset creation
   - Resolution: Provided comprehensive information about availability on dev branch, API key configuration, and technical implementation details

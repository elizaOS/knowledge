## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Documentation Guidance**:
   - Gert-Jan Akerboom helped FrankyLimon by providing the correct link to V2 documentation
   - Dhin pointed FrankyLimon to GitHub docs folder with scripting information when they were seeking more detailed developer documentation

2. **Interactive Objects Implementation**:
   - untitled, xyz assisted Fibelius by confirming that the Eliza Hyperfy starter could be used for their balloon implementation and shared the GitHub link

3. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Agent12 helped untitled, xyz by sharing examples from NEOS/Resonite platform that implemented parent-child relationships and a "Glue Gun" tool for grouping functionality

4. **Documentation Generation**:
   - Multiple users (FrankyLimon and .hyp shaman) shared that they use AI to create documentation from codebases directly rather than relying on pre-trained knowledge

## Action Items

### Technical Features
- **Vehicle Implementation**: Working vehicle system for V2 that supports GLB models similar to V1 (mentioned by Agent12)
- **Interactive Objects**: Implement personality-infused objects (balloons, spheres, artworks) in Hyperfy worlds that users can converse with beyond traditional dialogue flows (mentioned by untitled, xyz)
- **Animistic Approaches**: Develop ways for various elements in virtual worlds to have agency and personality (mentioned by Fibelius)
- **Group Functionality**: Implement group/parent-child functionality to move multiple Apps as a single entity for easier repositioning of modular building parts (mentioned by untitled, xyz)
- **"Glue Gun" Tool**: Alternative approach to grouping functionality based on NEOS/Resonite implementation for selecting and moving multiple objects together (mentioned by Agent12)

### Documentation

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Updates
- **Block Visibility Controls**: 0mka shared code snippets demonstrating two approaches for toggling block visibility in UI development:
  - Switch configuration with visible/invisible options
  - Toggle configuration with true/false values
- **Hyp Evolution**: 0mka mentioned working on an evolution of the "hyp" concept that incorporates toast notifications for player tracking with improved UI/mesh handling, sound, images, and multi-channel support
- **Blender Integration**: Ashxn mentioned Blender lightmap support with a Hyperfy addon, generating interest from other users
- **Platform Improvements**: Community members noted that "hypengine" is improving daily with expanded capabilities

### Community & Platform Growth
- **V2 Worlds**: Several members shared links to "v2 worlds" for exploration, suggesting a newer version of the platform is available
- **Hyp-Summer**: Multiple references to "Hyp-Summer" starting soon, described by 0mka as "everyone leveling up"
- **Content Creation**: MetaRick shared their workflow using AI to generate character sketches, refining them in VR for 3D printing, and experimenting with multicolor decal packs

### Tokenomics & $HYPER
- **Value Proposition**: cru proposed a token model based on mindshare rather than utility, suggesting value would derive from virality and attention in the spatial web ecosystem
- **Funding Mechanisms**: Ashxn suggested the team could be funded through marketplace fees rather than liquidity fees
- **Buyback Utility**: MUDBONE explained that buybacks demonstrate project commitment and can provide tokens for incentives rather than just removing them from circulation

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical
- **Q**: What was slow exactly? Selecting objects/editing? Something else? Is it faster when you disable the addon? Which OS are you on?  
  **A**: "On Windows, something locked up the whole program when I enabled the addon. I'll try to reproduce and send logs."

- **Q**: Which version of the addon did you install?  
  **A**: "Latest one from the site. It works but was super slow (I have a lot of add-ons that could be why)."

### Platform & Community
- **Q**: Is it vehicles yet?  
  **A**: (Unanswered)

- **Q**: What is Hyp-Summer?  
  **A**: "It's everyone leveling up."

### Tokenomics
- **Q**: What drives $HYPER's value?  
  **A**: "Mindshare, virality, and attention rather than utility."

- **Q**: Why hasn't the price moved yet?  
  **A**: "Because it's not time yet; whales control the charts and long-term patience is needed."

- **Q**: What's the purpose of buybacks beyond removing tokens?  
  **A**: "To show commitment to the mission and provide tokens for incentives and initiatives."

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **marcel ðŸŒµ** helped **b0gie** troubleshoot slow addon performance by suggesting using Help/Needle and the bugreport panel to send logs for debugging

- **0mka** shared code snippets with the community demonstrating different approaches for controlling block visibility in UI development

- **maximus** and **b0gie** helped **1Existence-Metabeast** find worlds to visit for their podcast by providing multiple links to both standard and v2 worlds

- **MUDBONE** explained to **Ashxn** that buybacks serve multiple purposes beyond token removal, including demonstrating project commitment and providing tokens for incentives

- **b0gie** helped an unspecified user with a code deletion issue by suggesting keyboard shortcuts (ctrl+a, then ctrl+/) or alternative approaches

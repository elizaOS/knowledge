# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Updates
- The "hypengine" is improving daily with more capabilities being added, with community excitement building for what's being called "Hyp-Summer"
- 0mka shared code examples for toggling block visibility in model blocks, offering two implementation approaches: one using a switch configuration with visible/invisible options, and another using a toggle with boolean values
- An evolution of a concept called "hyp" was mentioned that combines ideas from multiple users, with improvements to UI/mesh handling, sound, images, multi-channels, and player tracking
- A GitHub repository for a 2025 car paint demo was shared and praised
- Blender lightmap support with a Hyperfy addon was mentioned, generating interest from users

### 3D Design & Modeling
- MetaRick shared their workflow for creating detailed 3D models: using AI to generate character sketches, refining them in VR, and then 3D printing the results
- MetaRick is experimenting with multicolor decal packs for 3D printing
- PartCrafter (wgsxm.github.io/projects/partcrafter/) was shared as a tool for 3D modeling
- Sparc3D was suggested as a potential tool for high-poly modeling work

### Tokenomics & $HYPER
- Discussion about the $HYPER token's value proposition, with one user suggesting it should be driven by mindshare rather than utility, positioning it as the "native token of the open-source spatial web"
- Token buybacks were discussed as a way to demonstrate commitment to the project and provide tokens for incentives rather than just removing them from circulation
- A suggestion was made to use marketplace fees to fund the team instead of liquidity fees, allowing liquidity fees to be used for buybacks

### Community & Content
- Multiple v2 worlds were shared for exploration
- A podcast host from "Virtual Destinations" inquired about worlds to visit for their show, with community members providing links and offering tours
- Discussion about world-building challenges, particularly creating horizon elements to make worlds feel less empty

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What was slow exactly with the Needle addon for Blender?**  
A: Something locked up the whole program when the addon was enabled.

**Q: What should drive $HYPER's value?**  
A: Mindshare rather than utility, positioning it as "the native token of the open-source spatial web."

**Q: Why hasn't the price moved yet?**  
A: "It's not time to move yet. Wait for the long term."

**Q: What are the benefits of buybacks beyond removing tokens from circulation?**  
A: They show commitment to the mission, and bought-back tokens can be used for incentives and initiatives.

**Q: Are Hyperfy v1 events still being approved and viewed?**  
A: Yes, notifications were fixed and pending events were accepted.

**Q: Why doesn't the seat component from GitHub appear in my Hyperworld?**  
A: The seat was invisible by default and needs visibility toggled in the configure settings.

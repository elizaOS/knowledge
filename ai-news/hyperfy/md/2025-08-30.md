# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-30

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI Technologies & Implementation
- **AI Voice Models**: Discussion about conversational speech models (CSM) and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies, with mentions of specific models like nano banana, kittentts, and vibevoice.
- **Fast AI Inference**: Maximus shared information about a fast AI inference system running through WebGPU with response times of just a couple seconds.
- **AI Debate Project**: Jin is working on an AI debate system in PlayCanvas that supports human vs AI and AI vs AI debates in real-time, offering to share the JSON structure that powers it.
- **Privacy Concerns**: Users expressed concerns about AI services connecting to personal accounts like Gmail, with preference for running models on personal infrastructure.

### Virtual Environments & WebXR Development
- **Collaborative Diner Space**: Users are actively building and modifying a shared "vibe world" diner environment with networked persistence.
- **Interactive Elements**: Community members added various features to the diner including:
  - Water and beer pumps with glasses (though liquid pouring isn't working yet)
  - A jukebox to enhance the atmosphere
  - "Squid game" mechanics where tiles fall based on player interaction
- **WebXR Interface**: Ash demonstrated a VR interface with hand controller interactions, sharing videos and discussing implementation details.
- **Controller Input**: Discussion about reducing shakiness in hand controllers using filters and smoothing techniques.

### VRM & Avatar Management
- **Backpack Feature**: Brief discussion about potentially bringing back a "backpack" feature for storing VRMs, though some users prefer the current drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Optimization Concerns**: BallisticBanana noted that VRMs in v1 backpacks weren't always optimized enough, requiring re-uploads.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What are some good open-source TTS/CSM models?**  
A: Kittentts and vibevoice were mentioned as options.

**Q: How to reduce controller shakiness in WebXR?**  
A: Use a filter called "1€" or implement a simple smoothing factor, which ash successfully implemented.

**Q: What control scheme is used for the WebXR interface?**  
A: Partially pulling trigger shows beam, long press brings up menu, stick controls movement/copy/delete/rotate, grip+stick for scaling, and triggers are used for grabbing objects.

**Q: Is there any plan to bring back the backpack feature for VRMs?**  
A: While some users liked it, BallisticBanana noted optimization issues with the old system and prefers the current drag-and-drop functionality.

**Q: Are networked elements globally visible to all users simultaneously?**  
A: Yes, confirmed by Dhin.

**Q: What platforms could the AI debate system be implemented on?**  
A: Various game engines including Blender or GLTF, with implementation potentially taking only a couple days for a skilled developer.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **WebXR Controller Optimization**
   - **Helper**: b34k3r
   - **Helpee**: ash
   - **Context**: Reducing controller shakiness in WebXR interface
   - **Resolution**: Suggested using a "1€" filter, which ash successfully implemented with a smoothing factor

2. **Squid Game Mechanics**
   - **Helper**: Gh0stt
   - **Helpee**: Community
   - **Context**: Improving interactive game elements
   - **Resolution**: Updated the game so one tile falls on touch while another only falls with multiple players standing on it

3. **Diner Environment Enhancement**
   - **Helper**: BallisticBanana
   - **Helpee**: Community
   - **Context**: Adding interactive elements
   - **Resolution**: Added water and beer pumps with glasses to enhance the environment

4. **AI Debate System Sharing**
   - **Helper**: jin
   - **Helpee**: Channel members
   - **Context**: Implementation of AI debate system
   - **Resolution**: Offered to share JSON sample that powers the shows, including camera control and speaker management

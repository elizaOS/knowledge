# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-30

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Virtual Environment Development
- Users are collaboratively building a "vibe world" with a diner space that persists changes across sessions
- The environment is fully networked, allowing multiple users to see and interact with the same elements simultaneously
- Community members have been adding interactive elements like jukeboxes, water pumps, beer taps, and game cubes
- Dhin mentioned prompting the entire environment, suggesting some AI-assisted creation

### Voice AI & TTS Technologies
- Discussion around conversational speech models (CSM) and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies
- Open-source solutions like kittentts and vibevoice were highlighted for multi-speaker capabilities
- Privacy concerns were raised about connecting personal accounts to AI services
- Preference expressed for solutions that can run on personal infrastructure rather than third-party servers

### WebXR Controller Implementation
- Ash shared videos demonstrating a WebXR controller interface they're developing
- The implementation maps various controller inputs (triggers, thumbsticks, grip buttons) to different functions:
  - Partially pulling triggers shows a beam
  - Long pressing brings up menus
  - Thumbsticks control movement/copy/delete functions
  - Rotation/scaling uses stick or grip+stick combinations
- Controller shakiness issues were addressed with a simple smoothing factor implementation

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What are some good open-source TTS models for handling multiple speakers?**  
A: Marcel recommended kittentts and vibevoice as good OSS options with great examples, including 40-minute samples with multiple speakers.

**Q: How does the WebXR controller interface work?**  
A: Ash explained that partially pulling a trigger shows a beam, long pressing brings up a menu, thumbstick controls movement/copy/delete functions, and rotation/scaling is done with stick or grip+stick combinations.

**Q: Is there any plan to bring back the backpack feature?**  
A: BallisticBanana noted that while the backpack was useful, VRMs (especially NFTs) weren't always optimized well enough. The current drag-and-drop functionality from folders is more convenient in some ways.

**Q: Who built the networked diner environment?**  
A: Dhin confirmed they prompted the whole thing and that it's fully networked so all users can see changes simultaneously.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **b34k3r helped ash** with controller shakiness in WebXR by suggesting a "1â‚¬" filter, though ash ultimately implemented a simpler smoothing factor with 80% improvement
- **marcel ðŸŒµ helped hiroP** by recommending kittentts and vibevoice as OSS options with good multi-speaker examples
- **ash enhanced the diner environment** by adding a jukebox for the community to enjoy
- **BallisticBanana contributed** by adding water and beer pumps with glasses to the diner, though noted the pouring functionality isn't complete yet

## Action Items

### Technical
- **Implement smoothing for WebXR controller input** to reduce shakiness using simple smoothing factor instead of complex 1â‚¬ filter (Mentioned by ash)
- **Investigate CSM (conversational speech models) for multi-speaker TTS** by researching open-source options that can run on personal infrastructure (Mentioned by hiroP)
- **Optimize VRMs for better performance** as previous versions (especially NFTs) weren't always optimized well enough (Mentioned by BallisticBanana)

### Feature
- **Create privacy-focused alternatives** to services that require access to personal accounts by developing open-source solutions that run locally (Mentioned by hiroP)
- **Implement functionality to pour drinks** from pumps into glasses in the diner environment (Mentioned by BallisticBanana)
- **Consider bringing back "backpack" feature** for VRM storage from previous version (Mentioned by johan)
- **AI agent for UV mapping** to assist with texture creation (Mentioned by NeonGlitch86)
- **AI agent to run the diner** when users are absent (Mentioned by Dhin)

### Documentation
- **Share information about good TTS/CSM models** as hiroP promised to research and share information about additional options (Mentioned by hiroP)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Rendering Pipeline Improvements
- **Ashxn** released a new `render-pipeline` branch with significant rendering improvements
- Key features include **ambient occlusion (AO)** and **occlusion culling**, both configurable per-world
- Ambient occlusion adds realistic shadows, making low-poly models look more detailed
- Occlusion culling improves performance by not rendering objects hidden behind others
- Community members shared screenshots showing visual improvements
- Performance testing showed significant improvements in worlds with many objects
- The branch is deployed to the play world for community testing

### Platform Development
- GitHub repository contains **Hyperfy V2**, which offers more flexibility but higher complexity than V1
- A new **hyperfy.xyz website** is coming soon to improve user redirection and information access
- Community expressed need for better communication and marketing
- Town hall meeting was canceled due to team members traveling
- Discussion about implementing slash commands for teleportation and emotes in V2

### 3D Design & Optimization
- Users shared GPU performance metrics for a realism effects demo
- **Vox** showcased an impressive texture atlas implementation with UV scrolling, emissions, and colors for machinery with just a single draw call
- Optimization techniques were highly praised for efficiency
- **Ashxn** mentioned that during early Hyperfy development, they unknowingly had GPU acceleration disabled

### Analytics & Integration
- Discussion about integrating with Discord for analytics
- Interest in tracking visitor count and time spent in worlds
- Cursor rules implementation was discussed

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is ambient occlusion available in V2?** (asked by Agent12)  
**A:** Yes, and it's more performant than in V1, using screen-space ambient occlusion which "feels nicer" (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Is it hard to re-integrate slash commands for location/emote from V1 into V2?** (asked by Agent12)  
**A:** Ashxn demonstrated it was possible by quickly implementing a solution

**Q: Can we test the render-pipeline branch already?** (asked by vox)  
**A:** Yes, it's on a new branch called 'render-pipeline' and live in the play world (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How does AO look on your display?** (asked by Ashxn)  
**A:** "i like it ðŸ™‚" (answered by á²¼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)

**Q: I am trying to update the discord .hyp to show amount of visitors in world/day and average time they spend in there, but it doesn't seem to work. Is this allowed?** (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom)  
**A:** There's no reason why this wouldn't be possible (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: The version we get from GitHub is Hyperfy V2 right?** (asked by Cayden0207)  
**A:** Yup ðŸ™‚ (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What GPU time do you guys all get at the top left here: https://realism-effects-obeqz.vercel.app/?** (asked by Ashxn)  
**A:** Users shared screenshots showing varying performance, with 4090 GPU users getting excellent performance (answered by vox, MetaRick)

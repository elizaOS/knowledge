# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Rendering Improvements
- **New Render Pipeline**: Ashxn introduced a new render-pipeline branch with significant visual and performance improvements
  - **Ambient Occlusion (AO)**: Dramatically improves visual quality, especially for low-poly models
  - **Occlusion Culling**: Enhances performance by not rendering objects hidden behind others
  - Both features are configurable per-world settings
  - The branch is available for testing in the play world and as a deployment option on HyperWorld.Host
  - Community members reported significant performance improvements for worlds with many objects

### Development Tools & Features
- **PartyGrid**: Shiffty developed a dance floor system with configurable tiles and pattern functions
- **Slash Commands**: Ashxn demonstrated implementation of slash commands for teleportation and emotes in V2
- **Discord Integration**: Discussion about connecting world events (like rocket launches) to Discord notifications
- **World Management**: HypPrivakos announced new "export world" and "select world" features on HyperWorld.Host
  - Allows managing multiple folders on the same server (one active at a time)
  - Export feature works with currently selected world folder and notifies users via email when complete

### Optimization Techniques
- **Texture Atlases**: Vox shared work on texture atlases for optimizing draw calls
  - Demonstrated a machinery texture atlas with emissions, colors, and UV scrolling capabilities
  - Received praise from community members for optimization craftsmanship
- **Performance Testing**: Users shared GPU performance metrics for a realism effects demo
  - Significant variations between devices (particularly between high-end GPUs and MacBooks)
  - Ashxn discovered performance issues on Mac related to retina display rendering at maximum pixel ratio

### Community & Platform Updates
- Town halls canceled due to team travel
- New hyperfy.xyz website coming soon to help with redirecting users
- Discussion about RP1.com's unofficial launch, noting performance issues in Europe

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is ambient occlusion a per-world setting?**  
A: Yes, it's a per-world setting since it's a stylistic choice, and some worlds might not want it. It's also a per-device user setting for performance reasons. (Ashxn)

**Q: Is occlusion culling a per-world setting?**  
A: Yes, it's situational. It's beneficial for worlds with many objects hidden behind others but wasteful for open spaces. (Ashxn)

**Q: How can we test the render-pipeline branch?**  
A: It's on a new branch called 'render-pipeline' and live in the play world. (Ashxn)

**Q: Is it hard to re-integrate slash commands for location/emote from V1 into V2?**  
A: Ashxn demonstrated it was possible by implementing it quickly.

**Q: How can I get a message in Discord every time someone launches a rocket?**  
A: The rocket app can push messages to chat, and the Discord app watches the chat. (0mka)

**Q: Is there an easy way to get a quick pvp shooter game up and running?**  
A: There aren't ready-to-go shooter packs yet, but there are some gun assets to start with. (Ashxn)

**Q: Is the version we get from GitHub Hyperfy V2?**  
A: Yes. (Ashxn)

**Q: How can users have multiple folders on the same server?**  
A: Create new folders with the "create world" button, then select the desired one from the dropdown and click Validate. (HypPrivakos)

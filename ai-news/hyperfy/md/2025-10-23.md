# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-23

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Storage & Deployment
- Users received emails from Fly.io about storage usage concerns
- One user's world is using approximately 5GB of storage
- Snapshots contribute significantly to storage limits (each 5GB snapshot adds to total usage)
- Fly.io billing practices discussed - amounts below $1 aren't charged due to transaction fees
- The `CLEAN=true` environment variable helps reduce storage by removing deleted entities
- Newer worlds have auto-cleaning enabled by default

### Development
- 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 created their first .hyp file - a customizable teleport trigger box
- Valiant shared a Gaussian VRM project (https://gaussian-vrm.github.io/)
- Discussion about streaming capabilities for custom 3D objects, specifically mesh updates
- Interest in creating fading transparent/glowing cone effects in 3D design

### Community
- CheddarQueso 🧀 expressed appreciation for the Hyperfy litepaper

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: "Was there a way to set the spawn point? I can't remember how to do it." (𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)  
   **A**: "/spawn set" (Valiant)

2. **Q**: "Does the world auto-clean now?" (𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)  
   **A**: "By default it cleans now, but only on newer worlds, you can check your .env for `CLEAN=true`" (ash)

3. **Q**: "Wen 402x integration? (If not blockchain Integration for REAL people?)" (Agent12)  
   **A**: Unanswered

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Storage Optimization Help**
   - **Helper**: HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host
   - **Helpee**: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓
   - **Context**: User concerned about 5GB storage usage on Fly.io
   - **Resolution**: Explained how snapshots count toward storage limits and suggested checking for the `CLEAN=true` environment variable to remove deleted entities

2. **World Configuration Help**
   - **Helper**: Valiant
   - **Helpee**: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓
   - **Context**: Needed to remember how to set spawn points
   - **Resolution**: Provided the command "/spawn set"

   - **Context**: Question about auto-cleaning functionality
   - **Resolution**: Clarified that auto-cleaning is enabled by default on newer worlds and suggested checking for `CLEAN=true` in .env file

## Action Items

### Technical
- **Enable storage optimization**: Add "CLEAN=true" to environment variables to remove deleted entities from disk and reduce storage usage (Mentioned by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)
- **Implement teleport functionality**: Creation of a customizable teleport trigger box as a .hyp file (Mentioned by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)

### Design
- **Explore node configuration**: Research methods for creating fading transparent/glowing cone effects (Requested by untitled, xyz)
- **Investigate mesh streaming**: Look into capabilities for streaming updates to custom 3D objects (Requested by TheMattEmpire)

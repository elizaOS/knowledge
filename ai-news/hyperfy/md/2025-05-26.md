# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Performance Optimization
- **Octree-based Rendering System**: Ashxn shared research on implementing an octree-based rendering system for ThreeJS that traverses an octree frustum first instead of looping through every object in the scene. This provides better occlusion culling and allows for early exit from rendering objects outside the camera view or occluded by other objects.
- **Benchmark Results**: A scene with 210,000 unique objects running at just 1ms for CPU and GPU when not rendering all objects simultaneously, making web-based virtual worlds with hundreds of thousands of objects viable on mobile/VR devices.
- **Web Limitations**: Discussion about websockets vs UDP, with Ashxn noting that websockets work well despite some latency, and alternatives like WebRTC and WebTransport offer near-UDP networking capabilities.

### Agent Technology
- **Portal Navigation**: b0gie shared screenshots of an agent named Eliza who demonstrated awareness of portals and guided users through a world tour, developed by users "tcm" and "moon".
- **Technical Challenges**: Issues with deploying the system on Coolify, specifically with WebSocket URL configuration.
- **Future Concepts**: Discussion of a "prime world" or "worldDB" concept and creating avatars for the agent system.

### Cross-World Connectivity
- **Transportation Systems**: Ideas for trains/portals between worlds, guild systems, and player identification improvements.
- **World Representation**: Suggestions for visual representation of neighboring worlds.

### UI Components & Features
- **Notification System**: Lastraum shared code for a notification component that can be triggered with `app.emit('nots', {message:"hello world"})`, which auto-scales to zero when not in use.
- **Customization Options**: The component accepts parameters including message (required), color, fontSize, and timer (all optional).

### Platform Development
- **Web3 Authentication**: Lastraum shared progress on web3 authentication and admin rights verification via NFTs.
- **Building Migration**: Carlosmu showcased a building migration from Decentraland to Hyperfy v1 and inquired about UI features and mobile optimization.
- **Marketplace Development**: HypPrivakos mentioned a marketplace at hyperworld.host where users can add .hyp domains by logging in.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What performance improvement is expected from the octree implementation?**  
A: It would make ThreeJS performance much more closely aligned with Unity and Unreal games, allowing web-based virtual worlds with hundreds of thousands of objects to run on mobile/VR.

**Q: How does the octree-based rendering system work?**  
A: It skips everything outside the camera frustum and renders objects inside the frustum from front to back, completely skipping occluded objects behind walls or other objects.

**Q: Is it possible to add glow effects in Hyperfy v1?**  
A: Yes, increase the emissive strength in Blender and adjust colors there.

**Q: Is it possible to create a backup of a scene/world in Hyperfy v1?**  
A: Not directly, it would be quicker to rebuild from source assets.

**Q: Is it possible to change content depending on device type (mobile, VR, desktop)?**  
A: Hyperfy v2 allows custom UI in hyperscript, but v1 doesn't have this capability.

**Q: What is the utility of the hand button below the arrow?**  
A: It's the interaction button for clicking on interactive objects.

**Q: How do I stop auto-run after using chat while running?**  
A: Press Shift again after exiting chat.

**Q: Is there already a standalone notification app?**  
A: There isn't a standalone notification app, though many users have UIs for their worlds.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Mobile UI Guidance**:
   - Helper: maximus
   - Helpee: carlosmu
   - Context: Explaining UI controls in Hyperfy
   - Resolution: Clarified that the hand button below the arrow is for interactions with objects

2. **Visual Effects Implementation**:
   - Helper: Ashxn
   - Helpee: carlosmu
   - Context: Adding glow effects to objects in Hyperfy v1
   - Resolution: Advised to increase emissive strength in Blender and adjust colors there

3. **World Backup Options**:
   - Helper: b0gie
   - Helpee: carlosmu
   - Context: Creating backups of Hyperfy v1 worlds
   - Resolution: Explained that direct backups aren't possible but rebuilding from source assets would be more efficient

4. **Deployment Troubleshooting**:
   - Helper: Mugenomics
   - Helpee: Community
   - Context: Deployment issues with fly.io
   - Resolution: Identified that the wiki guide needs updating as volume creation now requires manual CLI commands

5. **Auto-run Bug Workaround**:
   - Helper: ash
   - Helpee: Agent12
   - Context: Auto-run bug when entering chat while running
   - Resolution: Provided workaround to press Shift again after exiting chat to stop running

6. **Notification Component Sharing**:
   - Helper: Lastraum
   - Helpee: Community
   - Context: Sharing a notification component that can be triggered via emit events
   - Resolution: Provided working code with customization options (message, color, fontSize, timer)

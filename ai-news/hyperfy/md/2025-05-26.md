# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Performance Optimization
- **Octree-based Renderer Research**: Ashxn shared extensive research on implementing an octree-based renderer with advanced occlusion culling for ThreeJS. This approach traverses the octree frustum first rather than looping through every object in the scene, allowing early exit for objects outside the view or occluded by others.
- **Benchmark Results**: Testing showed 210,000 unique objects could be rendered at just 1ms for CPU and GPU when not all were in view simultaneously.
- **Potential Impact**: This optimization would make web-based virtual worlds with hundreds of thousands of objects viable on mobile/VR at 60fps, bringing ThreeJS performance more in line with Unity and Unreal games.

### World Connectivity & Social Systems
- **Cross-World Features**: Developers discussed connecting worlds via trains/portals and implementing guild/faction systems.
- **Guild System Proposal**: 0mka suggested adding guildId to player data with name, icon, and cross-world reference capability.
- **Visual Connectivity**: Jayzen proposed enabling worlds to connect visually, showing neighboring worlds and a unified map.

### Authentication & Administration
- **Web3 Authentication**: Lastraum shared progress on web3 authentication and admin rights verification systems.

### UI & Device Adaptation
- **Mobile Controls**: Discussion about improving mobile tutorials and control systems, especially for joystick functionality.
- **Device-specific Content**: Developers compared capabilities between Hyperfy v1 and v2 for adapting content based on device type.
- **Visual Effects**: Questions about implementing glow effects and other visual enhancements in the current system.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What would such performance improvement look like?** (asked by Jayzen)  
**A:** It would be much more closely aligned with unity and unreal games, as ThreeJS has the most naive renderer but good rendering itself. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What about other web inherent limitations like websocket instead of udp?** (asked by Jayzen)  
**A:** Websockets work well despite some latency, and alternatives like WebRTC and WebTransport offer near-UDP networking capabilities. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How does the occlusion culling technology work with VR?** (asked by maximus)  
**A:** It skips rendering objects outside the camera frustum and renders objects inside from front to back, skipping occluded objects completely. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Is there a way to add glow effect in hyp-v1?** (asked by carlosmu)  
**A:** Increase the emissive strength in blender and adjust the colors there. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What is the utility of the hand button below the arrow?** (asked by carlosmu)  
**A:** That's the interaction button if someone needs to click on something to trigger it. (answered by maximus)

**Q: Is it possible to change some contents depending on the device?** (asked by carlosmu)  
**A:** v2 lets you do custom UI in hyperscript, v1 doesn't have this capability. (answered by Ashxn)

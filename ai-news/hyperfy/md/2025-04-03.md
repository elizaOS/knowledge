# Hyperfy Community Report – April 3, 2025

## 1. Development and Technical Support

### Model Importing and Blender Integration
- Users faced issues importing models, particularly with Blender crashes.
- Hyperfy Tools recommended for handling `.hyp` files.
- VRM rigging issues resolved using Blender’s Pose > Apply > Visual Transform To Pose.
- Collision setup guidance provided using Blender tools.

### HTTPS Hosting Challenges
- DigitalOcean users struggled with SSL setup.
- Recommended solutions:
  - Use Cloudflare with proxy enabled for automatic SSL.
  - Use Certbot for manual certificate installation.
- Hyperfy documentation intentionally omits complex SSL steps to simplify deployment.

### Scripting and API Enhancements
- `Math.random()` re-enabled after concerns about non-determinism.
- `num()` function remains for controlled randomness.
- Proposed API: `player.setRole('role', {permissions})` for custom role-based permissions (not yet confirmed).

### Animation and Visual Effects
- Skinned mesh animation frames explored for static procedural assets.
- Blender preferred over shader-based solutions like wind shaders.
- Feature requests:
  - Static animation frame selection.
  - Wind shader documentation.

### Interaction Mechanics
- Teleportation via `onTriggerEvent` clarified:
  - Requires collider triggers and rigidbody settings.
- `world.open()` supports opening URLs from object interactions.
- Webview support planned for future updates.

## 2. User Experience and Onboarding

### UI and Camera Issues
- Z key toggles UI visibility; caused confusion for new users.
  - Suggestion: remap to a less error-prone key combination.
- Camera movement bug reported (requires mouse button hold).
- Lag troubleshooting shared via test builds.

### Onboarding Challenges
- New users struggled with permissions and documentation.
- Community support helped resolve issues.
- Emphasis on:
  - Better beginner guides.
  - Clarifying differences from Hyperfy v1 (users must now build/source their own apps).

## 3. AI Tools and 3D Modeling

### AI-Generated Architecture
- Trellis identified as most effective AI tool for building models from images.
- Meshes required cleanup; better used as references.
- Suggested workflow:
  - Use AI-generated models for reference.
  - Create smart materials from source images to texture simplified geometry.

## 4. Action Items and Feature Requests

### Identified Improvements
- Fix model download bug.
- Improve documentation:
  - SSL setup.
  - Collision setup.
  - Scripting APIs.
- Enhance UI keybindings and camera zoom configuration.
- Develop better onboarding tools.

### Feature Requests
- Webview support.
- Custom role-based permissions.
- Gun recoil effects.
- Static animation frame selection.
- More intuitive permissions system.

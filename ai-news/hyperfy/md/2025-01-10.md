# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy v2 Development & Deployment
- **Open Source Release**: Hyperfy v2 is now available on GitHub, representing a major shift from the NFT-gated model of v1 to an open-source approach where anyone can host worlds
- **Early Adoption**: Developers are actively testing the v2 codebase, building worlds and experimenting with features
- **Deployment Methods**: Users are successfully deploying instances on Digital Ocean and other VPS providers using direct server setup, Docker containers, and nginx as reverse proxy
- **Core Features**: The team is implementing persistence for worlds to survive restarts, admin permissions via chat commands (/admin password), and basic chat functionality with name customization (/name)
- **Technical Architecture**: The platform is designed to be device-agnostic with VR support, and developers can build plugins and apps that work across all Hyperfy worlds

### $HYPER Token Launch
- **Airdrop Status**: Token airdrop for v1 NFT holders is ongoing with registration ending January 12th
- **Unclaimed Tokens**: Approximately 11% of tokens remain unclaimed, which will effectively be burned after the deadline
- **Price Action**: The token experienced volatility, dropping to lows around $0.05-0.07 before recovering to around $0.10
- **Exchange Listings**: Currently available on DEXes and has been listed on BingX CEX
- **Tokenomics**: The DAO will control 30% of tokens for community-driven development initiatives, with founder tokens in streamflow vesting contracts (9%, 4%, 1%, 1% split on 3-year linear vesting)

### AI Integration
- **ElizaOS Integration**: A key technical advancement is the integration of AI agents through ElizaOS, allowing for interactive NPCs
- **Multi-Agent Support**: The team plans to support multiple agent frameworks beyond the current Eliza implementation
- **Use Cases**: Community members are discussing creative applications like AI agent art critics and a "citadel" world where all AI agents can interact

### 3D Design & Technical Implementation
- **Avatar Systems**: Discussions about VRM exports, rigging techniques, and cross-platform compatibility
- **World Building**: Users are experimenting with drag-and-drop GLB files and object manipulation in the local environment
- **Performance Optimization**: The platform is described as lightweight ("runs on a potato"), with rendering performance settings that can be adjusted for custom avatars

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it still possible to build on v1 Legacy worlds or better to wait for v2?**  
A: No need to wait, v2 is out on GitHub and developers are already building with it (answered by maximus)

**Q: Will v1 worlds be ported to v2?**  
A: v1 worlds won't be automatically ported, so builders should plan to rebuild in v2 (answered by maximus)

**Q: How are permissions being handled in v2?**  
A: Currently implementing a system where typing /admin <password> makes you an admin who can build and grant builder permissions to others (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Should world chat be persistent across world restarts?**  
A: Yes, with option to hide it from new joins (answered by MetaMike)

**Q: What happens to unclaimed airdrops after the January 12th deadline?**  
A: Left unclaimed, essentially burned (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How much of the airdrop hasn't been claimed?**  
A: About 11% of total supply (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Does Hyperfy support VR?**  
A: Yes, 100% VR supported. Hyperfy is device-agnostic (answered by maximus)

**Q: Will there be a way to discover v2 worlds?**  
A: Yes, worlds can be detected using meta tags, and either Hyperfy or others can build portal/hub systems (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How do I fix shadow issues when manually injecting meshes?**  
A: Call world.setupMaterial(material) on mesh materials (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How do we add collisions to dropped GLBs?**  
A: Can be done in Blender or via script, with scripting coming soon (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Why doesn't the cursor lock when booting up a server locally?**  
A: The version on localhost requires holding right-click to look around, unlike the live version which automatically locks your pointer (answered by Saori)

**Q: Why does my custom VRM avatar show as an Ethereum logo?**  
A: You need to adjust the rendering performance settings to "heavy" or "unoptimized" (answered by maximus)

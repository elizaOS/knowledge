# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy V2 Launch & Open Source Transition
- **Major Announcement**: Hyperfy V2 is now open-source and freely accessible to everyone, eliminating the previous requirement of owning an NFT to create worlds
- Developers are actively implementing core features and fixing bugs while community members experiment with hosting and building worlds
- The platform is designed to be device-agnostic with minimal hardware requirements ("runs on a potato")
- V2 will not directly port V1 worlds, but there will be a long wind-down period to allow rebuilding

### Technical Implementation & Features
- Ashxn implemented several critical features including admin permissions, chat functionality, and persistence for world objects
- The permission system allows setting admin passwords in .env files, with a default that makes everyone an admin if no password is set
- The platform supports drag-and-drop functionality for GLB files and automatic instancing of meshes for performance optimization
- Multiple developers successfully deployed Hyperfy V2 on VPS services using various approaches, with ~/HowiEDuhzit creating a Docker implementation
- A key hosting issue was identified where WebSocket connections fail unless properly configured with the correct PUBLIC_WS_URL in the .env file

### AI Integration & "MetAIverse" Vision
- V2 includes integration of AI agents through ElizaOS, allowing for interactive NPCs that respond to natural language commands
- Discussions about integrating various AI agent frameworks beyond the current Shaw/AI16Z connection to establish Hyperfy's independent identity
- Community members expressed interest in creating AI-powered experiences like art galleries with AI critics

### $HYPER Token & Economics
- The $HYPER token was recently launched with an airdrop to V1 NFT holders, with registration ending January 12th
- Approximately 11% of the token supply remains unclaimed and will be burned after the claim deadline
- The token experienced significant volatility, dropping to lows around $0.05-0.07 before recovering to around $0.10
- $HYPER is positioned as the native currency for the Hyperfy ecosystem, potentially used for governance and in-world transactions

### 3D Design & Avatar Systems
- Discussions about 3D rigging techniques, specifically control bones in models and VRM file formats
- Debate about the merits of different rigging approaches for game engines versus VRM standards
- Interest in developing avatar customization systems with swappable components

## Key Questions & Answers

### Platform & Development
- **Q**: Is there a plan to let us host our worlds on hyperfy? (BitFiend)  
  **A**: Yes, we'll make it ultra easy for people to have worlds. This is just the tech behind it. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Should world chat be persistent even across world restarts? (Ashxn)  
  **A**: Yes (MetaMike)

- **Q**: Will it be possible to have mesh instances in worlds? (Sceth iii)  
  **A**: Everything is automatically instanced by default right now. Feel free to add thousands of the same mesh with little overhead. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do we add collisions to the dropped glbs? (SotoAlt)  
  **A**: Will show you guys that soon. Can do in Blender or via script. Scripting coming super soon. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Does hyperfy multiplayer implement a concept of "network lods"? (hiroP)  
  **A**: Not yet but we'll get there. Currently happy with 100-300 concurrent users. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do I access player position? (MetaMike)  
  **A**: world.entities.player is the local player. Can check in console. (Ashxn)

### User Experience & Accessibility
- **Q**: How do I start designing a world in Hyperfy? (oshafir)  
  **A**: For V2, you can access the open-source code on GitHub and spin up your own instance if you're technically capable. Documentation is being developed, and a more user-friendly version is coming soon. (maximus)

- **Q**: Is VR support currently a thing on Hyperfy? (vincentskele)  
  **A**: Yes, Hyperfy is fully VR supported and device-agnostic. If your device can access HTTP, you can likely visit a Hyperfy world. (maximus)

- **Q**: What PC specs are needed to get deep into Hyperfy? (terranosaurusrx)  
  **A**: "V2 runs on a potato" - meaning minimal hardware requirements are needed. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Will there be a way to discover V2 worlds? (felixdigit://)  
  **A**: Yes, worlds can be detected using meta tags, and either Hyperfy or others can build portal/hub systems to make worlds discoverable. (Ashxn)

### Token & Economics
- **Q**: What are the token use cases for $HYPER? (jar0d)  
  **A**: Currently conceptual, but includes DAO governance voting and potential integration as an exchange medium in the metaverse. The community will also develop additional utilities. (maximus and Uuuuuuuuu)

- **Q**: What happens to unclaimed airdrops after the deadline? (BlazeHorizon)  
  **A**: Left unclaimed, essentially burned. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How much of the airdrop hasn't been claimed? (Dippuccino)  
  **A**: About 11% of total supply. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: What role will $HYPER play in the ecosystem? (WarfreakzPlays)  
  **A**: It will be the world currency of the Hyperfy universe/metaverse, used for buying assets, avatars, clothes, pets, etc. (WarfreakzPlays)

- **Q**: Is $HYPER on CEX already? (macanga)  
  **A**: Yes, trading live on BingX currently at $0.1. (Ogundips)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Hosting & Deployment Solutions
- **HPrivakos** helped **vincentskele** resolve WebSocket connection issues when hosting on DigitalOcean by identifying that PUBLIC_WS_URL in .env needed to be set to the server's domain/IP instead of localhost
- **HPrivakos** assisted **vincentskele** with drag-and-drop GLB file issues when hosting by suggesting using HTTPS via nginx
- **~/HowiEDuhzit** created and shared a Docker implementation and Coolify package to simplify Hyperfy deployment for the community
- **HPrivakos** shared .env configuration and video tutorial for setting up Hyperfy with nginx and SSL on VPS

### Technical Assistance
- **Ashxn** helped **MetaMike** access player position in code by explaining that world.entities.player is the local player and can be checked in console
- **hiroP** shared techniques for optimizing 3D models using Blender's decimate modifier to reduce polygon count
- **Ashxn** recommended using WSL on Windows for a Linux-like experience to **Directive Creator** who was having Windows compatibility issues
- **Saori** explained to **frank_grimes_sr** that token distribution is split across multiple wallets with 3-year linear vesting on Streamflow

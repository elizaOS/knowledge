# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-13

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Camera Anchor System**: ~/drdoge.eth shared details about a camera anchor system with multiple angle types, player tracking, and configurable trigger modes.
- **Lightmap Implementation**: Marcel shared shaderchunk code from Needle Engine for handling lightmaps, while Ashxn worked on implementing Needle lightmaps in Hyperfy, noting issues with UV mapping for split meshes.
- **World Management**: 0mka provided a solution for cleaning bloated world folders using the "npm run world:clean" command, referencing the script in the Hyperfy GitHub repository.
- **App Building**: Discussions about building interactive applications (.hyp files) in Hyperfy, with community members sharing documentation resources and examples.

### Platform Features & Business
- **Open Source Confirmation**: Ashxn clarified that Hyperfy is completely open source, including the engine, editor, and ecosystem tooling.
- **Acquisition Attempt**: It was mentioned that AI16Z attempted to acquire Hyperfy, but the offer was declined to maintain autonomy.
- **Hosting Solutions**: Ashxn indicated that users "won't need to worry about hosting" in the future, suggesting a more streamlined approach is planned.
- **Privy Integration**: Lastraum mentioned integrating Privy to enable easier connections without web3 wallets.

### Hyper Token Utility
- **Current Uses**: Tokens can be used to tip creators of .hyp applications and are integrated in the Fallen demo game.
- **Proposed Uses**: Community members suggested using Hyper tokens for staking to receive hosting services and powering an asset marketplace.

### Future Concepts
- Brief speculation about future 3D rendering technology that could transform amorphous 3D blobs into detailed models through simple interactions.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: How do camera anchors work?  
  **A**: They can be placed in the world with configurable setup/angles and tracking options; clicking the anchor activates it when trigger mode is off (~/drdoge.eth)

- **Q**: How can I clean up my bloated world folder with deleted assets?  
  **A**: Run "npm run world:clean" command (0mka)

- **Q**: Do we have docs or tutorial for building app in hyperfy?  
  **A**: This might help: https://docs.hyperfy.xyz/docs/hyp-format/ (hiroP)

- **Q**: Is there a way to select multiple .hyp files and download them as a single .hyp file?  
  **A**: You can either download individual apps, or all apps together by zipping up your `world` folder (Ashxn)

### Platform & Business
- **Q**: How much of the project is open source?  
  **A**: Everything is completely open source, the engine, the editor, and any ecosystem tooling we'll be releasing along the way (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Can you build and modify assets directly in Hyperfy like in Roblox?  
  **A**: Hyperfy is much more flexible than Roblox. You build worlds in realtime with others, including scripting, and everything is persistent (Ashxn)

- **Q**: What does it mean "tried to buy hyperfy"?  
  **A**: ai16z wanted to buy the company, the deal was good but we decided not to go ahead with it to retain some autonomy (Ashxn)

### Hyper Token
- **Q**: What can you do with Hyper tokens?  
  **A**: You can use hyper tokens to tip hyp app creators (szjanko - HyperWorld.Host)

- **Q**: Will Hyperfy offer hosting as a part of the solution in the future?  
  **A**: All I can say currently is that people won't need to worry about hosting (Ashxn)

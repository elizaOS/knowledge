# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-13

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Camera Anchor System**: ~/drdoge.eth shared details about a new camera anchor system that allows for multiple angle types, player tracking, and various trigger modes.
- **Lightmap Implementation**: Marcel shared shaderchunk code from Needle Engine for handling lightmaps, while Ashxn worked on implementing Needle lightmaps in Hyperfy, noting issues with UV mapping for split meshes.
- **World Management**: 0mka provided a solution for cleaning bloated world folders using the "npm run world:clean" command.
- **UI Issues**: A bug was identified where toggling the UI off with "Z" key and then back on causes the chat functionality to become locked or unresponsive.

### Platform Features & Architecture
- **Open Source Philosophy**: Ashxn confirmed that everything in Hyperfy is completely open source, including the engine, editor, and ecosystem tooling.
- **Collaborative Building**: Hyperfy allows for real-time collaborative world building with persistent changes, differentiating it from platforms like Roblox.
- **Hosting Solutions**: Discussion about third-party hosting, with Ashxn indicating users "won't need to worry about hosting" in the future.
- **App Development**: 0mka offered to conduct a tutorial session on Monday covering UI implementation, world storage, and player information retrieval using a voting/ballot system as an example.

### Hyper Token Utility
- **Current Uses**: Hyper tokens can be used to tip Hyp app creators and are integrated into demo games like Fallen.
- **Proposed Models**: A community member suggested a "Stake to Host" model where users could stake Hyper tokens to receive hosting services.
- **Business Development**: There was discussion about a potential acquisition offer from ai16z that was declined to maintain autonomy.

### Future Concepts
- A user speculated about future 3D rendering capabilities where users could transform amorphous 3D blobs into detailed generated models through "spell casting" interactions.
- Plans for automatic script selection based on file type when importing assets (e.g., Model app for GLB files, Audio app for MP3 files).

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do camera anchors work?**  
A: They can be placed in the world with configurable setup/angles and tracking options; clicking the anchor activates it when trigger mode is off. (~/drdoge.eth)

**Q: How can I clean up my bloated world folder with deleted assets?**  
A: Run "npm run world:clean" command. (0mka)

**Q: Do we have docs or tutorial for building app in hyperfy?**  
A: Official documentation is available at https://docs.hyperfy.xyz/docs/hyp-format/ (hiroP)

**Q: Is there a way to select multiple .hyp files and download them as a single .hyp file?**  
A: You can either download individual apps, or all apps together by zipping up your `world` folder. (Ashxn)

**Q: What can you do with Hyper tokens?**  
A: You can use hyper tokens to tip hyp app creators and they're integrated in demo games like Fallen. (szjanko & maximus)

**Q: What does it mean "tried to buy hyperfy"?**  
A: ai16z wanted to buy the company, the deal was good but we decided not to go ahead with it to retain some autonomy. (Ashxn)

**Q: How much of the project is open source?**  
A: Everything is completely open source, the engine, the editor, and any ecosystem tooling we'll be releasing along the way. (Ashxn)

**Q: Can you build and modify assets directly in Hyperfy like in Roblox?**  
A: Hyperfy is much more flexible than Roblox. In Hyperfy you build worlds in realtime with others, including scripting and everything is persistent. (Ashxn)

**Q: How do you restore chat functionality after it gets locked?**  
A: Click on the chatbox and it starts working properly again. (ash)

**Q: Is there a solution for setting collision on/off when dragging and dropping a model into a V2 world?**  
A: Not yet but the goal is auto-select scripts pretty soon. Eg if you drop a glb it will use the Model app, Mp3 the Audio app etc. (ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Lightmap Implementation**
   - Marcel shared shaderchunk code from Needle Engine for proper lightmap handling
   - Ashxn built on this by sharing detailed code for handling GLTF extensions for lightmaps

2. **World Management**
   - 0mka helped Alephic with bloated world folder issues by providing the "npm run world:clean" command and linking to the relevant script in the GitHub repository

3. **App Development Resources**
   - hiroP shared official Hyperfy documentation on the .hyp format with Cayden0207
   - 0mka offered to conduct a tutorial session on building a voting/ballot application, covering UI implementation, world storage, and player information retrieval

4. **UI Troubleshooting**
   - Multiple users collaborated to identify the exact sequence that causes chat to lock (pressing Enter with UI off then Z to toggle UI back on)
   - Agent12 and ash provided workarounds for restoring chat functionality

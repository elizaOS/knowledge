# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-12

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Building & Development Tools
- **House Building Competition** announced by Ashxn with 15,000 HYPER in prizes, generating excitement and participation from community members
- **Scene Inspector Tool** being developed by ToxSam to allow easier manipulation of objects in the world
- **Build Mode Improvements** including a new "pinning" feature by Ashxn to prevent accidental deletion of objects
- **Plant Generator App** created by Gert-Jan Akerboom that randomizes plant appearance for more diverse environments
- **Griefing Issues** reported in the build server, with discussions about implementing authentication and role-based security

### 3D Optimization & Technical Implementation
- **LOD (Level of Detail)** implementation techniques shared by Ashxn, showing dramatic performance improvements (from struggling to 60fps)
- **Texture Optimization** discussions revealed significant memory usage reductions (5-6GB to 2.3GB) by downscaling textures
- **Animation Conversion** workflows from Mixamo to Hyperfy-compatible formats, with peezy creating a script to process animations
- **Trigger Implementation** for interactive objects, with code examples shared for proper event handling
- **Shadow Casting for Flat Objects** solved by flipping normals in Blender so the red side faces up

### Avatar Systems & Wearables
- **VRM vs Custom Format** debate, with most users advocating for extending VRM rather than creating a proprietary Hyperfy format
- **Wearables Implementation Challenges** discussed, noting VRM wasn't built with wearables in mind
- **Springbone Support** for VRM models requested as a feature

### AI Integration
- Discussion about using **Venice AI agents** in Hyperfy, with MetaMike confirming it's possible by pointing chat endpoints to Venice
- **Companion Intelligence** product shared by Maximus as a potential resource

### Cryptocurrency
- **HYPER Token** price volatility tracked throughout the day, ranging from -16.7% to +16.3% with market cap between 16-18.4M
- Warning about potential **rug pull** with Studia AI project where developer abandoned after pushing code for a month

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Building
- **Q:** How do I start developing locally with Hyperfy? (ToxSam)  
  **A:** Install nvm, clone repo, nvm install, nvm use, npm i, npm run dev (Saori)

- **Q:** How do I implement triggers in Hyperfy? (Shiffty)  
  **A:** Use onTriggerEnter and onTriggerLeave on the rigidbody parent, not on the collider (Ashxn)

- **Q:** How are snaps based in Hyperfy? (TheMattEmpire)  
  **A:** If a snap point comes within 1m of another snap point they snap (Ashxn)

- **Q:** How do we tag our houses for the competition? (TheMattEmpire)  
  **A:** "I should make a sign post that people can place out front" (Ashxn)

### 3D Design & Optimization
- **Q:** Do flat GLB files throw shadows? (Gert-Jan Akerboom)  
  **A:** Yes, but you need to flip the normals so the red side (in Blender's face orientation) is facing up (Gert-Jan Akerboom)

- **Q:** Would there be a way to auto LOD if desired? (TheMattEmpire)  
  **A:** Ashxn provided detailed manual LOD setup instructions using custom properties

- **Q:** Do we know if LODs will be added to blender hyperfy tools? (TheMattEmpire)  
  **A:** "I'll get this into hyperfy tools on the next update" (~/HowiEDuhzit)

- **Q:** How do I convert Mixamo emotes to Hyperfy compatible format? (peezy)  
  **A:** Import in Blender and add a root bone (voxvienne)

### AI & Integration
- **Q:** Are we able to use Venice AI agents? (salt√Ø)  
  **A:** In theory, yes. You'd just need the chat endpoint to point to Venice instead of Eliza/other LLM providers (MetaMike)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Assistance
- **Saori helped fishai** with angle snapping issues when building a house by joining their world and demonstrating how to rotate rails 180 degrees
- **Gert-Jan Akerboom helped treed** discover that flipping normals in Blender allows flat objects to cast shadows in Hyperfy
- **Ashxn helped Shiffty** implement trigger detection for hex tiles in a game, offering code examples
- **peezy helped Saori** by creating and sharing a script to process Mixamo animations with proper formatting for Hyperfy

### Knowledge Sharing
- **Omka shared optimization documentation resources** with links to guides for mesh optimization
- **Ashxn demonstrated LOD implementation** that dramatically improved performance for fence meshes
- **TheMattEmpire explained face orientation** to Gert-Jan Akerboom, clarifying that blue is solid and red is see-through in Blender
- **maximus offered to help Tom | Big Yellow Fishes** by walking around and deleting spam objects causing lag in the build server

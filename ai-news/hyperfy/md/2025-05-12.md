## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can Hyperfy handle webp with frames?**  
A: "Haven't tried but probably" (Ashxn)

**Q: How to handle slow loading images in virtual worlds?**

A: "Oh man, no pressure! ðŸ˜… I think a few folks are cooking cool stuff but not sure it'll all be released before the call ðŸ¤”" (maximus)

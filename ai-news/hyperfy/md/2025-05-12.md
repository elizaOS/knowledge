# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-12

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Asset Optimization**: Developers shared significant file size reductions using WebP format, reducing 3MB PNG skyboxes to 300KB WebP files with 95% compression. Weapon assets were optimized from over 100MB to under 2MB per HYP file.
- **VR Implementation**: Discussions around VR control mapping, with developers sharing code to map XR controller buttons to interaction controls. Interest in implementing raycast functionality for grabbing and moving items in VR.
- **Audio Implementation**: Challenges with seamless looping audio were discussed, with suggestions for crossfading techniques and using tools like drumbot.com/projects/looper for testing.
- **Water Effects**: A simple water plane effect was clarified to be just "a plane with normal map and a script that scrolls UVs" rather than a complex application.
- **UI Toggling**: Discussion about the Z key now toggling all UI elements, including custom onscreen UI/reticles, with clarification that this is by design for screenshot/cinematic purposes.

### Platform & Community
- **World Building**: Community members are actively building worlds on the Hyperfy platform, with some experiencing technical issues when accessing specific worlds like tattedalien.club.
- **Community Showcase**: A game called "fallen.hyperfy.xyz" was mentioned as a showcase of the platform's capabilities.
- **Version Control**: Developers discussed approaches to version control, including maintaining development worlds before pushing to production and backing up databases.

### Hyper Token
- **Market Strategy**: Community members discussed growth strategies for Hyper, with suggestions to focus on growing liquidity and expanding holders before implementing DAO or staking features.
- **Marketing Approach**: Recommendations for narrative-driven strategies and strategic CEX listings to increase visibility and adoption.
- **Market Sentiment**: Optimism about Hyper's price movement despite Sol being down, with mentions of "ai16z getting listed on crypto.com" being viewed as positive.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: Is there version control?  
  **A**: The world folder stores everything for backup/sharing; for app scripts you need to track changes in your own git repo.

- **Q**: Are controls in VR working, or do I have to do something in the apps?  
  **A**: Interact button just isn't mapped yet.

- **Q**: Would it make sense to let users configure the LiveKit roomId?  
  **A**: ServerLiveKit system runs once per world instance. All clients connect to a single server that provides the room ID in the initial network snapshot.

- **Q**: Can I make the transition of a looping audio a tiny bit more seamless?  
  **A**: You can test and do seamless crossfading using drumbot.com/projects/looper.

- **Q**: What is the water effect implementation?  
  **A**: It's literally just a plane with normal map and the script that scrolls UVs.

- **Q**: How do I make my onscreen UI not toggleable with the new Z key?  
  **A**: UI is all one thing, and Z is meant to hide it all for screenshots or recording cinematics.

### Platform & Community
- **Q**: Is the platform live, can we play game to earn hyper?  
  **A**: One of the games created as a showcase of the platform is available now at fallen.hyperfy.xyz.

- **Q**: What should be prioritized before DAO or staking?  
  **A**: Growing liquidity and expanding holders, building narrative-driven strategies, increasing visibility and hyperfy usage, and considering strategic CEX listings.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Docker Environment Variables**: Ashxn helped ~/^b0gie-(.*)$/ understand that .env files aren't copied into containers for security reasons but should be injected by Coolify.

- **LiveKit Integration**: Ashxn explained to tcm390 how the token system works with embedded room IDs, clarifying that the token already has the room ID embedded and LiveKit Client automatically handles it when connecting.

- **VR Button Mapping**: DevStarlight shared code with ~/drdoge.eth showing how to map XR controller buttons to interaction controls.

- **Audio Looping**: Ashxn suggested testing with drumbot.com/projects/looper for crossfading to vox who was having issues with seamless audio looping.

- **Water Effect Implementation**: Shiffty and Ashxn clarified for dean.land that the water effect is a simple plane with normal map and UV scrolling script, not a complex application.

- **Security Awareness**: ToxSam warned channel members about fake content/potential scams, alerting moderators and advising users to be careful.

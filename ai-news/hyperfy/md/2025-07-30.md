- **Internet Connectivity**: Brief discussion about internet speeds and tools for diagnosing local router issues.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What stack are you using?**  
A: "We're using the forge platform" (Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz)

**Q: Will hyp apps always be one model? Or will it ever be possible to export an entire world (with many apps inside of it) as one single hyp app?**  
A: "There's nothing stopping you from building 'uber apps' that have tons of things in them, but a single app with everything in it is less flexible than individual apps you can move around and manage independently. That said, if you zip up your `world` folder you get a single file that includes all apps placed in the world and can use that as a backup or as a way to import an entire world on any server." (Ashxn)

**Q: No community call this week?**  
A: "Calls are every other week 🫶" (maximus)

**Q: Where does Hyperfy stand right now and what lies ahead?**  
A: Focus is on building with plenty of runway, and marketing will come later when ready. (Pete)

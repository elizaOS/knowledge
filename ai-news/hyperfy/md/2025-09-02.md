# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-02

**Date: September 2, 2025**

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Vibe World & AI Generation
- Users discussed Hyperfy's "vibe" world feature, which allows generating 3D objects using AI prompts
- Community members shared creations including a rideable roller coaster later enhanced with neon lights
- There was enthusiasm about how Hyperfy makes creation accessible compared to platforms like Decentraland
- Users suggested making AI prompt viewing and remixing more accessible
- AI-generated objects in vibe world are scripts rather than traditional GLB files

### Development & Technical Infrastructure
- Discussions about environment configuration and dependency management when setting up Hyperfy projects
- Clarification on how world data is saved and managed using the WORLD environment variable
- Deployment options were discussed, including fly.io and hyperworld.host with considerations about user limits
- Brief mention of crypto wallet integration with a solana-v2 branch that needs rebasing
- Explanation that hyperfy.io is the old (classic) platform, while hyperfy.xyz is the next-gen tech

### World Building & Asset Management
- TheMattEmpire advocated for multi-select capabilities to improve building experience
- Current limitation of only selecting one asset at a time makes building modular structures tedious
- Suggestions for selection shaders, shift-to-multiselect, and a world outliner similar to Blender/Unity
- Discussion about extracting GLB files from Hyperfy assets (shift+click the model button in app details)
- Admin controls configuration to prevent unauthorized world editing

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Where is the data for a Hyperfy space actually saved?**  
A: If you use `npm run dev` it creates/runs the `world` folder. You can have multiple world folders and switch between them by doing `WORLD=world-2 npm run dev` etc.

**Q: Is it possible to extract the GLB from within a .hyp file?**  
A: Hyp is just a glb with text metadata. You can change file format from .hpy to .glb, or shift+click the model button in app details to download the current glb.

**Q: Why does the Hyperfy Twitter link show hyperfy.xyz instead of hyperfy.io?**  
A: hyperfy.io is the old (classic) platform, hyperfy.xyz is our next-gen tech.

**Q: How do I select objects in the vibe world?**  
A: Hit tab, then right click something.

**Q: How can I set an admin? Because my world is open and every people can edit.**  
A: You need to set your .env ADMIN_CODE. By default, everyone is an admin, but once you set ADMIN_CODE, you can type into the chat `/admin <code>` to become admin.

**Q: What does the error message mean when AI generation fails?**  
A: There's an error somewhere in the script. You can typically check the browser console to see what the error was, or just type /fix.

**Q: What is minimum requirement to run hyperfy smoothly?**  
A: By default it runs on nothing, it all just depends what you put in the world.

**Q: What's the status with crypto wallet integration in v2?**  
A: There's a solana-v2 branch but it needs a rebase. That's what the Fallen world uses.

## Community Help & Collaboration

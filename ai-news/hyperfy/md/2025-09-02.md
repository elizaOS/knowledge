# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-02

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Environment Setup
- Users encountered and resolved npm build failures related to missing dependencies
- Proper environment configuration was discussed, particularly the importance of setting up the `.env` file correctly
- Multiple world management was explained, with the ability to switch between worlds using environment variables

### Feature Discussions
- A suggestion was made to improve the creative building experience by making text prompts visible when inspecting objects
- The current implementation stores prompt information in code, but this was acknowledged as not ideal
- The proposal aims to enhance collaboration by making the creative process more transparent

### Miscellaneous
- A GitHub repository for AI coding tips was shared (https://github.com/snarktank/ai-dev-tasks)

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Where is the data for the space actually saved?**  
A: If you use `npm run dev` it creates/runs the `world` folder. You can have multiple world folders and switch between them by doing `WORLD=world-2 npm run dev` etc. (answered by ash)

**Q: Would it be possible to attach the text prompt somewhere while drag and dropping stuff?**  
A: It's in the code for now, not ideal but a good start (answered by ash)

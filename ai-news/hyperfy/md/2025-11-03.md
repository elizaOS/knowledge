# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Particle Systems & Graphics
- **3rdEyeVisuals** shared progress on an advanced particle system handling 20,000 particles at 160fps with an 8k EXR skybox
- **𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓** solved a flickering issue on Pixel 7 phones caused by plant/tree GLB models with transparent alpha textures
- Discussion about rendering performance across different devices, with desktop performing better than mobile for certain assets

### Persistence & Data Management
- Significant discussion about implementing persistent leaderboards for games in Hyperfy
- **Gert-Jan Akerboom** successfully implemented a persistent leaderboard for a dragon game using world.get and world.set methods
- Several users referenced existing examples of persistence implementation, including elementals by ash and quest item hyps by Valiant

### Animation Implementation
- **Sphynxcolt** inquired about adding looping animations from Blender to Hyperfy
- **Gert-Jan Akerboom** clarified that only skinned mesh (armature/bone) animations can currently be exported from Blender for V2
- **Valiant** provided a resource link to help with animation implementation

### Community & Project Direction
- Discussion about a community member named Saori who appears to be considering leaving the project
- Several members encouraged Saori to continue building with the community despite past issues
- Brief sharing of resources including music for coding sessions ("tactical beats to vibe code a world to")

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I make a leaderboard for the dragon game that persists after reload?**  
A: Use world.get & world.set methods, and check examples like elementals by ash or quest item hyps by Valiant.

**Q: How can I add an object that has a looping animation from Blender?**  
A: Currently only skinned mesh (armature/bone) animations can be exported from Blender for V2. Check the resource link provided by Valiant.

**Q: What causes flickering issues on certain phones?**  
A: Certain plant and tree GLB models, particularly those with transparent alpha textures for elements like leaves, can cause flickering on specific mobile devices like the Pixel 7.

**Q: Anything amazing been built with hyperfy yet?**  
A: "Only just started myself. But, every day I integrate something crazier. The possibilities are vast!" (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)

**Q: Should Saori burn their allocation or keep building?**  
A: "You could also just keep your allo and build here. This was the initial plan and I have no gripes with that either." (answered by ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Persistent Leaderboard Implementation**
   - **Valiant** and **.hyp shaman** helped **Gert-Jan Akerboom** implement a persistent leaderboard for a dragon game
   - They suggested examining existing examples and provided guidance on using world.get and world.set methods
   - **Gert-Jan** successfully implemented the functionality, allowing scores to persist between sessions

2. **Animation Support**
   - **Valiant** assisted **Sphynxcolt** with adding looping animations from Blender to Hyperfy
   - Provided a resource link to help with animation implementation
   - **Gert-Jan Akerboom** clarified the current limitations regarding animation types

3. **Mobile Rendering Issues**
   - An unnamed user helped **𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓** troubleshoot flickering issues on Pixel 7 phones
   - Suggested methodically activating/deactivating GLBs one by one to identify problematic models
   - **𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓** successfully identified and documented the issue with transparent textures

4. **Cultural Exchange**
   - **DevStarlight** shared an article explaining the Japanese concept "kuyashii" with **Dhin**

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Particle System Progress**: 3rdEyeVisuals shared impressive performance metrics for their particle system implementation, achieving 20,000 particles at 160fps while running with an 8K EXR skybox. The system is production-ready but still being refined, particularly for non-1:1 ratio shapes.
- **Video Player Implementation**: Valiant mentioned reposting "the hyp" with some changes to their framed video player implementation.
- **Browser Performance**: 3rdEyeVisuals humorously noted that crashing/freezing browser tabs can sometimes be a sign of pushing the technical boundaries correctly.

### Project Direction
- **Token Allocation Discussion**: A conversation emerged regarding someone named Saori who may have left the project but still holds an allocation of tokens/resources. Community members expressed different opinions about whether to "burn" the allocation or continue building.
- **Motivation Philosophy**: Dhin introduced the Japanese concept of "kuyashii" - using the energy from wanting to prove others wrong as motivation to build, which DevStarlight expanded on with additional resources.

### Future Plans
- **IP TV System**: 3rdEyeVisuals expressed plans to develop an IP TV system with UI remote functionality and channel browsing capabilities, though described as a longer-term goal.
- **Miniverse Project**: Referenced as being production-ready but still undergoing refinements.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### In-World App Development
- **3rdEyeVisuals** is developing an in-world app bundling system that would allow users to upload and manage apps without server-side file access
- They created an upload button for the sidebar allowing users to upload plain .js files as apps
- Work is underway on a **HYP BUNDLER GUI** for in-world app creation with a drag-and-drop interface
- Currently, adding apps to the sidebar requires placing files in the server's world assets folder

### Platform Issues

- A user reported that their play-world is currently broken

### NPC Development
- **mrtzhckr** is looking for NPC examples for AI agent development
- Community members directed them to specific users who have developed NPCs in their worlds

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-22

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Occlusion Culling Implementation**: Ashxn introduced occlusion culling using pre-pass depth checking, allowing objects hidden behind walls/houses to be skipped during rendering. The feature works by marking large objects as "occluders" with a simple checkbox, potentially offering significant performance improvements.
- **Animation Optimization**: Developers discussed adding root bones to animations for proper IK functionality, troubleshooting issues where feet were slipping during animations.
- **Performance Optimization**: Discussions emphasized avoiding transparency in models and using alpha-cutout instead of alpha-blend for better performance on mobile and VR platforms.
- **Platform Architecture**: The Hyper platform is designed to be "hyper centric" where creators can forge objects only using Hyper, and builders/collectors trade them using Hyper.

### Community & Content
- **NFT Integration**: Interest in integrating NFT projects, specifically Pudgy Penguins, into the Hyperfy platform. Ashxn mentioned having previously created a Pudgy Penguin model.
- **Community Meetings**: Recordings exist but need migration to a new YouTube channel.
- **Community Call Highlights**: Recent improvements include better VR interactions, splat map experiments, housing kit development, and performance optimizations.

### Tools & Resources
- A GitHub repository for programmatically adding root bones to Mixamo animations was shared, along with a Vercel app hosting Hyperfy-compatible animations.
- Maximus highlighted a useful asset collection for adding web3 elements to projects.
- Brief discussion about Auto Rig Pro's new AI integration.

### Industry News
- Discussion about the closure of a game called Ember Sword, with some members suggesting it was a "rug pull" rather than simply running out of funding.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is a specific name needed for the root bone?**  
A: "Root" is recommended, but it doesn't matter much. The root bone is usually at origin 0,0,0 and doesn't move.

**Q: Would occlusion culling be set up manually or automatically?**  
A: You mark big objects as "occluders" and it automatically tests everything else to see if it's hidden behind those occluders.

**Q: Is occlusion culling based on the asset or the collider?**  
A: It's based on the asset.

**Q: Are the community meetings recorded somewhere?**  
A: Yes, but they need to be migrated to another YouTube channel.

**Q: How is the Hyper platform designed to utilize the HYPER token?**  
A: The platform is hyper centric where creators forge objects only with hyper and builders/collectors trade them using hyper.

**Q: Does anyone have a pudgey vrm?**  
A: Ashxn confirmed having one made a month ago for a project.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Animation Root Bone Setup**:
   - peezy shared a GitHub repository (mixamo-hyperfy-converter) that automates adding root bones to animations
   - b0gie clarified that hips shouldn't be connected to the root
   - TheMattEmpire shared a tutorial link and suggested renaming 'root_bone' to 'root'

2. **Testing Animations with Different Avatars**:
   - drdoge.eth explained how to replace mannequin model with VRM and add animation GLB
   - b0gie shared a working link to hyperfy-animations.vercel.app

3. **NFT Integration Support**:
   - Ashxn and maximus helped MUDBONE with integrating Pudgy Penguins, with Ashxn sharing that he already had a model created
   - maximus found a penguin GLB but noted a VRM would work better with NPC hype

4. **Performance Optimization Guidance**:
   - Ashxn explained that transparency works on desktop GPUs but should be avoided on mobile/VR, recommending alpha-cutout as "a billion times better than alpha-blend"

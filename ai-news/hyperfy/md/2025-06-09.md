# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-09

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Updates
- **Camera Management Improvements**: Shiffty updated the camera manager with free cam mode that doesn't require right mouse to rotate and added mouse scroll to change move speed. Adjustments were made to FREECAM_LERP_FACTOR and MOVE_EASING parameters for smoother camera movement.
- **WebGPU Discussions**: Conversation about WebGPU becoming the default on Safari and visionOS, with debate about potentially rewriting the Hyperfy engine to leverage WebGPU's capabilities like compute shaders and hi-z occlusion culling. Ashxn noted that while WebGPU offers advantages, it might be a year before widespread adoption.
- **AI Agents**: b0gie mentioned getting "eliza" working again and suggested reactivating "mj" (likely AI agents). Discussion about creating multiple AI agents for a hackathon project, with b0gie noting that "each agent needs a computer."

### Project Showcases
- **Minimap System**: 0mka demonstrated a minimap system that tracks players and portals, a calendar/events feature, and a quadrant-based minimap.
- **Social Features**: Lastraum implemented social features including feeds, friends, finder, guilds, rewards, analytics, and VRM avatar management into "the Forge."
- **Place Teleportation**: 0mka shared instructions about using the place feature for teleportation, explaining how to designate places, toggle visibility, and set up commands and portals.

### Tokenomics & Market Position
- **Valuation Discussion**: Community members expressed that Hyperfy is significantly undervalued (at under $6M market cap) compared to Verse World (between $100M and $50M).
- **Token Model**: Hyperfy's tokenomics model was described as dual-purpose, serving both governance and marketplace functions.
- **Market Visibility**: Several members noted that Hyperfy lacks visibility despite having superior technology and a more substantive product.

### Community Events
- **WWDC25 Viewing**: Cynnx organized a group viewing of Apple's WWDC25 event, creating and sharing a Discord event link.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I make camera rotation smoother?** (asked by Ashxn)  
A: Increase the FREECAM_LERP_FACTOR for smoother rotation like v1 (answered by Shiffty)

**Q: How do I access the camera when there is zero UI?** (asked by vox)  
A: Use the CameraManagerFreecamToggle.hyp file (answered by hiroP)

**Q: Is it possible to display the avatar picture from a hyp?** (asked by 0mka)  
A: That's not a picture, it's a window that fully loads the avatar (answered by peezy)

**Q: Is it possible to add a fullscreen mode for the screenshare app?** (asked by Alephic)  
A: The video node is in 3D world-space and can't be put in screen-space yet, though it's possible but not implemented in the engine (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How big of a job would it be to rewrite the engine in WebGPU?** (asked by zzzzzzzzzzz)  
A: Only need to update the renderer and shader stuff, the vast majority of the engine would stay the same (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Has this token currently designed a proper tokenomics model?** (asked by haihui)  
A: It's dual-purpose as both a governance and marketplace token. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How do I set up a place for teleportation?** (implied by 0mka)  
A: Drop places where you want, turn off visibility of the place animation and toggle. The command is just the name of the place. (answered by 0mka)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Camera System Improvements**:
   - Shiffty helped Ashxn with camera rotation smoothness in free cam mode by adjusting FREECAM_LERP_FACTOR and MOVE_EASING parameters
   - hiroP assisted vox with accessing camera with no UI by pointing to CameraManagerFreecamToggle.hyp file

2. **Token Distribution Clarification**:
   - MUDBONE helped Saber understand token distribution, explaining that large portions are in the DAO and locked unclaimed airdrops, accounting for about 20% of the supply

3. **Place Teleportation System**:
   - 0mka provided detailed instructions to another user about setting up places, configuring commands, and linking portals for teleportation

4. **AI Agent Implementation**:
   - b0gie explained to CheddarQueso that each AI agent needs a computer and asked for help with additional computers
   - 0mka suggested running the agents on a server instead of individual computers

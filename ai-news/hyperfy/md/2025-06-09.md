# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-09

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Camera System Improvements
- **Shiffty** updated the camera manager with free cam mode that doesn't require right mouse to rotate
- Added mouse scroll to change move speed
- **Ashxn** provided feedback on making rotation smoother
- Adjustments made to FREECAM_LERP_FACTOR and MOVE_EASING parameters for better feel

### Development Projects Showcase
- **0mka** demonstrated:
  - Minimap system that tracks players and portals
  - Calendar/events feature
  - Quadrant-based minimap implementation
- **Lastraum** implemented social features in "the Forge":
  - Feeds, friends, finder, guilds
  - Rewards and analytics
  - VRM avatar management

### WebGPU Discussion
- WebGPU becoming the default on Safari and visionOS
- Debate about potentially rewriting the Hyperfy engine to leverage WebGPU capabilities
- Advantages include compute shaders and hi-z occlusion culling
- **Ashxn** noted it might be a year before widespread adoption across devices

### Tokenomics & Market Positioning
- Community consensus that Hyperfy is significantly undervalued (under $6M market cap) compared to Verse World ($50-100M)
- Hyperfy token described as dual-purpose: governance and marketplace functions
- Discussion about token distribution, with clarification that a large portion is held in the DAO and as unclaimed airdrops
- Some concerns about Hyperfy's dependence on ElizaOS's success

### Community Events
- **Cynnx** set up a Discord theater for watching Apple's WWDC25 event together
- Event scheduled for 10:00am PT

### Agent Technology
- Brief discussion about implementing multiple AI agents for a hackathon project
- **b0gie** mentioned getting "eliza working again" and needing to "boot up mj again"
- **CheddarQueso** discussed creating multiple agents (Tomato Tom, Leafy Greens, potato brothers)
- Noted that "each agent needs a computer" with questions about server-side alternatives

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I make camera rotation smoother?** (asked by Ashxn)  
A: Increase the FREECAM_LERP_FACTOR for smoother rotation like v1 (answered by Shiffty)

**Q: How do I access the camera when there is zero UI?** (asked by vox)  
A: Use the CameraManagerFreecamToggle.hyp file (answered by hiroP)

**Q: Is it possible to display the avatar picture from a hyp?** (asked by 0mka)  
A: That's not a picture, it's a window that fully loads the avatar (answered by peezy)

**Q: Is it possible to add a fullscreen mode for the screenshare app?** (asked by Alephic)  
A: The video node is in 3D world-space and can't be put in screen-space yet, though it's possible but not implemented in the engine (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How big of a job would it be to rewrite the engine in WebGPU?** (asked by zzzzzzzzzzz)  
A: Only need to update all the renderer and shader stuff. The vast majority of the engine would stay the same. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Has this token currently designed a proper tokenomics model?** (asked by haihui)  
A: It's dual-purpose as both a governance and marketplace token. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: When is WWDC25?** (asked by Cynnx)  
A: 10:00am PT (answered by untitled, xyz)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Camera System Assistance**
   - **Shiffty** helped **Ashxn** with camera rotation smoothness by adjusting FREECAM_LERP_FACTOR and MOVE_EASING parameters
   - **hiroP** assisted **vox** with accessing the camera without UI by pointing to CameraManagerFreecamToggle.hyp file

2. **Technical Clarifications**
   - **Ashxn** explained to **Alephic** the technical limitations of video nodes in 3D world-space vs. screen-space
   - **MUDBONE** clarified token distribution concerns for **Saber**, explaining that a large portion is in the DAO and unclaimed airdrops

3. **AI Development Guidance**
   - **hiroP** shared LLM recommendations for coding tasks: Claude 4 Opus for Python, Gemini 2.5 Pro for codebase refactoring, and O3 for JS/Node
   - **b0gie** provided guidance to **CheddarQueso** about agent implementation requirements for hackathon projects

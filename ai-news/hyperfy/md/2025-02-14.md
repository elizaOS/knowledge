# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Performance Optimization
- **New Performance Tracking Tool**: Ashxn introduced a tool displaying metrics like instances, geometries, triangles, and texture memory to help identify optimization opportunities.
- **Significant Improvements**: Performance optimizations in the play world reduced CPU usage from 20ms to 6ms and GPU usage from 50ms to 38ms.
- **LOD Support**: ~/HowiEDuhzit announced an update supporting Level of Detail functionality with meshes named in format objectLOD0, objLOD1, etc., plus custom colliders with objCOL.
- **Draw Call Optimization**: Discussions about how meshes with multiple materials are split into separate meshes in three.js, affecting performance.

### Player Interaction & Movement
- **Mountable Objects**: Several developers worked on creating mountable objects like bikes, with discussions about player control APIs.
- **Teleportation**: Code examples were shared for teleporting players to specific positions using world.getPlayer() and player.teleport().
- **Capsule Controller**: Brief mention of a "capsule controller" coming soon.
- **Controller Support**: PlayStation 5 controller support was demonstrated working on Solana Mobile.

### AI Integration
- **Agent Implementation**: drdoge.eth reported successfully implementing an AI agent that follows preset phrases for command tasks while using AI for other interactions.
- **RTS Applications**: Discussion about potential of AI technology to transform how users interact with virtual environments, particularly in Real-Time Strategy games.

### Development Workflow
- **Branch Management**: Features are built on the dev branch and pushed to main once stable, with no formal sprint structure.
- **Documentation Organization**: hyperfy.how was identified as the central resource, with internationalization (i18n) being added.
- **Server Issues**: Random disconnects reported due to a 60-second idle timeout.

### 3D Design & Assets
- **Character Rigging**: TheMattEmpire shared insights about character rigging, topology, and VRM exports from Blender.
- **Asset Organization**: Discussions about parenting objects, standardizing "sockets" for attachments, and optimizing materials.
- **Blender Integration**: ~/HowiEDuhzit created a Hyperfy theme for Blender with a default startup file including Hyperfy's default terrain and HDR.

### Strategic Direction
- **Feature Prioritization**: Saori mentioned a strategic shift toward focusing on features that would attract new users rather than solely addressing existing builder requests.
- **Combat Functionality**: Combat was identified as a high-demand feature from users and gamers.
- **Marketplace Development**: Discussions about implementing marketplace with tipping functionality for app creators.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I make an app spawn another app?**  
A: You can't yet, but you can embed everything in one GLB and have your script unmount everything on startup and spawn things as needed. (Ashxn)

**Q: How to set collision on Hyperfy V2?**  
A: Go into blender, open addons panel search for hyperfy, it handles it for you. (Saori)

**Q: Is there a way to read how long an animation is from the .glb?**  
A: You could use blender or use a Cursor marketplace extension (https://marketplace.cursorapi.com/items?itemName=degreat.3e). (᲼)

**Q: Where do you recommend me to start as a new user?**  
A: Go to play.hyperfy.xyz, then follow hyperfy.how/quickstart, grab community assets, and download .hyp apps (Omka)

**Q: What OS should I use for my first VPS to host Hyperfy2?**  
A: You shouldn't need to use cloud panel, check the VPS setup guide (maximus)

**Q: How is Hyperfy evolving in terms of development workflow?**  
A: Features are built on dev branch and pushed to main when stable, with no formal sprint structure (Ashxn and Saori)

**Q: Is all documentation about Hyperfy V2 on hyperfy.how?**  
A: Yes, plus some additional content in Discord and linked resources (Saori and Omka)

**Q: Do people think the rotation of an asset such as a road should be from the centre, or from the corner?**  
A: I would assume the center center. (Ashxn)

**Q: Why are GLB animations not showing up in world?**  
A: v2 doesn't support glb animations yet (Saori)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Performance Optimization**: Ashxn created a performance tracking tool to help multiple developers identify optimization issues in their worlds.

- **Player Teleportation**: peezy provided ToxSam with code examples for teleporting a player to a specific position using world.getPlayer() and player.teleport().

- **App Control API**: Ashxn explained the updated app.control API to peezy, including camera control and key capture functionality.

- **AI Coding Assistance**: ᲼ explained to ToxSam how to use .cursorrules file at project root to provide context for AI coding assistance.

- **VRM Implementation**: TheMattEmpire shared a Twitch stream recording demonstrating the character rigging process and documentation links with devilsadvocate.sol.

- **Blender Integration**: ~/HowiEDuhzit created and shared a Hyperfy theme for Blender with a default startup file including Hyperfy terrain and HDR for better in-world previewing.

- **New User Onboarding**: Omka provided MeryShark with comprehensive links to play.hyperfy.xyz, quickstart guide, community assets, and marketplace resources.

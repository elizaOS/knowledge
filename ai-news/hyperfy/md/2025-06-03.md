# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Rendering & Graphics
- **New Rendering Pipeline**: Ashxn reported progress on a new rendering pipeline that fixes transparency issues with chat bubbles, approaching alpha release. May include ambient occlusion but needs testing before going to main.
- **Texture Format Optimization**: Vox shared surprising findings that 512x512 PNG textures can provide better quality than 2048x2048 WebP textures while using less VRAM. WebP works well for most PBR textures but performs poorly with gradient-heavy baked textures.
- **Texture Scrolling Solution**: b0gie demonstrated a solution for controlling texture offsets independently from normal maps in UV scrolling using separate quads for different textures.
- **Denoising Techniques**: Vox recommended skipping denoising algorithms during baking and applying denoising via compositing later for better results.

### Asset Creation
- **PBR Atlas**: Vox shared a PBR atlas they created - a single texture that can be used to build entire scenes with minimal draw calls by joining or instancing meshes.
- **Terrain Assets**: Discussion about finding interesting terrain with ponds for scene building, with ~/drdoge.eth offering a "big desert" terrain.

### Community Updates
- **Documentation Links**: The docs link has moved to https://docs.hyperfy.xyz (previously hyperfy.how)
- **World Launch**: Brief mention of Gert-Jan Akerboom's hosted world launch
- **Scam Warning**: Kicale warned CheddarQueso about someone impersonating their project on Solana blockchain

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there an easy way to have the texture offsets not affect the normal map?**  
A: "Nah they're linked right now but it would be nice to control them individually" (Ashxn)

**Q: Anyone knows where to find the docs right now? https://hyperfy.how/ 404**  
A: "https://docs.hyperfy.xyz" (Ashxn)

**Q: What compression level is the webp though?**  
A: Vox didn't specify the exact level but mentioned that compression hurts most with gradient elements like baking

**Q: Have you launched on solana?**  
A: "not yet.. have you? ðŸ™‚" (CheddarQueso ðŸ§€)

**Q: Anyone got a hype with some Interesting Terrain? Looking for a Pond...**  
A: "Only terrain i have is the big desert one. i can send it over to ya" (~/drdoge.eth)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Texture Offset Control**
   - Helper: b0gie
   - Helpee: Shiffty
   - Context: Controlling texture offsets independently from normal maps
   - Resolution: Demonstrated a solution using separate planes for diffuse and normal textures with different scroll rates

2. **Documentation Link**
   - Helper: Ashxn
   - Helpee: mrtzhckr
   - Context: Finding current documentation link
   - Resolution: Provided correct docs URL and promised to fix outdated link in GitHub readme

3. **Texture Optimization Guidance**
   - Helper: vox
   - Helpee: Community
   - Context: Texture optimization for 3D models
   - Resolution: Shared findings about PNG vs WebP quality and VRAM usage, recommending 100% WebP except for baked textures

4. **Scam Warning**
   - Helper: Kicale
   - Helpee: CheddarQueso ðŸ§€
   - Context: Warning about potential scammers impersonating their project on Solana
   - Resolution: CheddarQueso acknowledged they haven't launched on Solana yet, confirming the other entity is a scam

## Action Items

### Technical
- Test and provide feedback on new rendering pipeline before it goes to main (Mentioned by Ashxn)
- Implement ambient occlusion in the rendering pipeline (Mentioned by Ashxn)
- Test 95% WebP compression as potential middle-ground for quality and size (Mentioned by Ashxn)
- For Blender 4+ users, may need to add a math node when using the shared PBR atlas with alpha clip (Mentioned by vox)
- Skip denoising algorithms during baking and apply denoising via compositing later for better results (Mentioned by vox)

### Documentation
- Update hyperfy.how link in GitHub Main Readme to point to docs.hyperfy.xyz (Mentioned by Ashxn)

### Feature
- Add ability to control texture offsets and normal maps independently (Mentioned by Ashxn)
- Implement fishing mechanics similar to Fallout 76 (Mentioned by ~/drdoge.eth)
- Create a grant or contest for building demos using eliza-3d-hyperfy-starter (Mentioned by jin)
- Create more specialized PBR atlases, including one specifically for Cambrian (Mentioned by vox)

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What would be the best place to store .hyp files so they can be downloaded in-world?**  
A: You could contribute to `awesome-hyps` GitHub repo, upload to Hyperworld host, or wait for `the platform` coming soon. (answered by b0gie)

**Q: How can I make .hyp files downloadable in my world?**  
A: You can call `world.open('https://somedomain.com/myapp.hyp', true)` from a script, but you need a place to host the hyp files. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What is "the platform"?**  
A: Ash and the "black ops team" are developing it; it was mentioned in builder calls about 2 weeks ago. (answered by b0gie)

**Q: Why doesn't the GitHub item appear when dropped in Hyperworld?**  
A: The item is present but invisible by default; you need to click on the seat in the apps list and toggle visibility in the configure settings. (answered by 0mka)

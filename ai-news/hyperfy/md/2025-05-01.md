- **Code Extraction Tool**: Cru shared a new tool (hyp-code-extract.vercel.app) for extracting code from Hyps in batch format, improving developer workflow.
- **Instancing Optimization**: Vox showcased a world using instancing for fast mobile loading, highlighting performance improvements.
- **Modular Updates**: A world was updated to include new modular capabilities, generating excitement among 3D designers.

### VR Compatibility & Performance
- **Transparency Issues**: Discussion about rendering problems with stylized trees in VR environments.
- **Device Compatibility**: Users reported issues with PICO 4 headsets, suggesting potential browser or firmware update requirements.
- **Cross-platform Optimization**: Emphasis on creating worlds that perform well across mobile and VR devices.

### Platform Features
- **LiveKit Integration**: Identified as necessary for streaming features including voice chat and screen sharing.
- **World Boundaries**: Community members discovered unintended ways to access restricted areas, providing valuable feedback.
- **Hyperfy Domains**: Discussion revealed approximately 6 worlds running on hyperfy.xyz domains with more in development.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Do we need the gltf.report equivalent for hyps?** (Ashxn)  
A: Could be handy, could be done within Hyperfy or as a dedicated tool. (cru)

**Q: Doesn't VR work for anyone else on PICO 4? Am I doing something wrong?** (PabloFM | Numinia)  
A: Performance matters. Some worlds run well on Quest 3, but PICO 4 might need browser updates or firmware updates. (Ashxn and hypb0gie)

**Q: How many worlds are running on hyperfy.xyz domains now?** (peezy)  
A: There are about 6, with more being developed. (Ashxn)

**Q: Why does the TV with screen sharing keep cycling through when I hold F to use it?** (vincentskele)  
A: You need LiveKit server for streaming/audio features including voice chat and screen share. (maximus)

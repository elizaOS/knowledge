## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I implement emission intensity control in a Hyperfy app?**  
A: Use mesh.material.emissiveIntensity and set emissive color in Blender to non-black for it to work properly (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Does Hyperfy work on PICO 4 headsets?**  
A: Technically it should, but you might need to try different browsers or update firmware (answered by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)

**Q: What's needed for screen sharing to work in Hyperfy?**  
A: You need a LiveKit server, especially for self-hosted worlds (answered by maximus)

**Q: Is shaw using the hyperfy engine?**  
A: Yes, he made a headless client, enabling AI agents (elizafy) to connect to any hyperfy world just like a human would (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What are the GPL license implications when using Hyperfy v2 with corporate clients?**  
A: GPL only applies to core improvements, not applications built on top, similar to Linux's licensing model (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How can I adjust the day cycle speed?**  
A: You can change the actual speed it cycles through in the code itself at the top few lines (answered by ~/drdoge.eth)

**Q: What pairing do you have on TradingView for Hyperfy?**  
A: "I trade in my phantom wallet and watch on Dexscreener 8vBMibwpn8wpfYKbQ9xqzodymg3LjmYec2tSNGRy23K8" (answered by CheddarQueso 🧀)

**Q: Is it possible to interact with hyperlink triggers in VR (Quest 2)?**  
A: Not yet, but it should be easy to add (answered by ash)

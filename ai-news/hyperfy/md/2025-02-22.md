# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-22

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **Effects System Improvements**: Ashxn proposed moving from `player.setEffect()` to `control.setEffect()` to better track app lifecycles and prevent players from getting stuck with effects. The new system includes a "turn" option that makes players face the camera direction.
- **V1 to V2 Migration**: Confirmation that V1 apps will be ported to V2, with the process being partly community-driven. Saori mentioned plans to add V1 apps to a GitHub board for tracking.
- **Documentation Consolidation**: Ongoing efforts to centralize documentation at hyperfy.how (created by jin), with Omka working on bringing together resources from various sources.
- **Physics Implementation**: Ashxn clarified that Hyperfy runs physics on CPU with SIMD support, not requiring GPU-based PhysX, addressing concerns about NVIDIA RTX 50-series compatibility.

### 3D Design & Optimization
- **Material Batching**: TheMattEmpire proposed a material batching approach where materials could be applied within Hyperfy rather than embedded in GLB files.
- **Web Optimization Techniques**: Detailed discussions about texture and polygon optimization, with recommendations for palette texturing using small (16x16 or 32x32) textures.
- **Avatar Size Considerations**: Debate about appropriate avatar sizes, with TheMattEmpire advocating for highly optimized models (under 15MB) while acknowledging that context matters.
- **Space Organization**: Suggestion to use portals/hyperlinks to break complex experiences into manageable spaces for better performance.

### AI & Agents
- **Fine-tuning vs. Context**: In-depth discussion about when to fine-tune LLMs versus providing context, with maximus explaining that fine-tuning is better for static baseline behaviors while context works better for dynamic information.
- **Implementation Examples**: Mentions of a Mistral model implementation via Hugging Face API and a Python-based agent under development.
- **AI Education**: Observation that many developers still view AI training as "black magic" and may not understand the differences between context provision and model tuning.

### Community Projects
- Several community members showcased their projects:
  - A throwing mechanic using the new effects system
  - An NPC controller with collision detection and gravity
  - A documentation search tool
  - A backend connection for board games
  - EVM integration for token-based interactions

### HYPER Token
- Multiple price checks using the Rick bot
- Brief mention of potential "token flywheel" implementation when market conditions improve
- Aspiration expressed about Hyperfy becoming "the next uniswap"

## Key Questions & Answers

### Platform & Development
- **Q**: How can I fix the issue where player effects persist after code edits?  
  **A**: Move from player.setEffect() to control.setEffect() to track app lifecycle and automatically cancel effects when apps are modified. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do I get rid of the grass in Hyperfy worlds?  
  **A**: For self-hosting it's a one-liner, but for Hyperworld a no-code toggle is needed; a grid app could be included by default in world templates. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How can I hide an avatar from a script?  
  **A**: Use avatar.active = false as all nodes have an 'active' property that completely unmounts them. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Do we still need an NFT to create a world?  
  **A**: For V2, no NFT is needed. (Omka)

- **Q**: Will the apps from V1 be ported over to V2 at some stage?  
  **A**: Yes, it will be partly community-driven. (Saori)

- **Q**: Would NVIDIA RTX 50-series not supporting PhysX impact Hyperfy?  
  **A**: No, Hyperfy runs physics on CPU, which is already extremely fast. (Ashxn)

### 3D Design & Optimization
- **Q**: What's an appropriate avatar size for web?  
  **A**: It depends on your end experience - 15k polygons is medium, but also consider material count and texture resolution. (TheMattEmpire)

- **Q**: What limits web performance more - textures or polygons?  
  **A**: For filesize, textures are worse. For processing cost, it depends. (TheMattEmpire)

- **Q**: How different is web performance from native applications?  
  **A**: The web isn't that much different to native. Missing some nice stuff like global illumination, but very close in performance. (Ashxn)

### AI & Agents
- **Q**: What's the difference between fine-tuning and providing context to an LLM?  
  **A**: Fine-tuning changes the weights of the model to better suit specific needs, while context is information provided at runtime. It's a balance between efficiency and accuracy. (maximus)

- **Q**: When would you want to tune a model vs feed it context?  
  **A**: Fine-tuning is better for static baseline behaviors, while context is better for dynamic information. Cost efficiency at scale is also a factor. (maximus)

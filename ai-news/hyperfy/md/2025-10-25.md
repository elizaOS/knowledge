# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Progress
- **3rdEyeVisuals** shared significant progress on two tools:
  - A Debug Dashboard for monitoring performance
  - Hyp Bundler with working backend and UI being finalized
  - Successfully generated a .hyp bundle that was brought in-world as an app
- **🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰** announced the creation of an NFT Holder Scanner tool that tracks NFT holders across Ethereum, Polygon, and Optimism networks

### 3D Model Loading & Generation
- Discussion about loading 3D models from remote URLs using an experimental but stable method
- Conversation about 3D model generators, with **3rdEyeVisuals** planning to set up a pipeline for local inference using the Hunyuan model
- **ash** mentioned having experimented with both open source and closed source 3D model generators

### Version Changes & Compatibility
- Some users expressed confusion about Blender version changes
- Features appear to have moved between v1 and v2, causing workflow disruptions
- **untitled, xyz** considered reverting to an older Blender version due to interface changes

### Minimal Activity
- Very brief exchanges in the **⚡│general** and **🪙│hyper** channels, consisting only of greetings and cryptic emoji messages

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Is there a way to load 3D models from a remote URL?  
   **A**: Yes, using `world.load('model', 'https://...glb').then(root => { app.add(root) })` - while experimental, this feature is stable but not well-documented due to being a niche use case.

2. **Q**: Have you experimented with open source 3D model generators or just using API keys for popular closed models?  
   **A**: "I played around with a bunch of both open source and closed source ones." (answered by **ash**)

3. **Q**: How to fix VRM file upload errors in Hyperfy 1?  
   **A**: "Could be anything hehe. There are a few VRM validator/tester tools online, maybe try something like this: https://vrm-validator.fern.solutions/" (answered by **ash**)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Remote Model Loading Assistance**
   - **ash** provided code snippets showing how to load 3D models from remote URLs
   - Clarified that while the feature exists, it's not documented because it's considered niche

2. **VRM File Troubleshooting**
   - **Fredm** sought help with VRM file uploading issues in Hyperfy 1
   - **ash** suggested using online VRM validator tools and provided a specific link

3. **Version Change Navigation**
   - **maximus** helped users understand feature location changes across different versions
   - Suggested that features had been moved from v1 to v2

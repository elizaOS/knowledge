# Hyperfy Development Report – 2025-03-27

## 1. Community Discussions and Feature Requests

### Key Focus Areas
- Physics synchronization
- Authentication challenges
- Media performance optimization
- AI integration and workflows
- App communication and traversal
- Onboarding strategies for developers and non-technical users

## 2. Technical Issues and Solutions

### Physics Synchronization
- Jitter issues from syncing rigidbody and controller positions in `FixedUpdate`
- Solution: Separate client-side rigidbody logic from server-side controller logic
- Detection via `overlapSphere` and tags
- Limitation: PhysX’s `PxCapsuleController` lacks tag/contact support

### Authentication Challenges
- Iframe limitations prevent in-world wallet connections
- Proposed solution: Mod for `hypkg` to enable direct player ID-to-wallet mapping

### Material Unlinking Bug
- Unlinked materials still behave as linked
- Cause: Order of operations when unlinking mesh and accessing material
- Status: Under investigation

### Snap Points Behavior
- Currently act as positional guides without parent-child relationships
- Workarounds: Use triggers and tags
- Feature request submitted for improved system

### App Traversal Enhancements
- Addition of `children` array to all nodes enables full traversal
- Documentation and examples needed

## 3. AI Integration and Agentic Workflows

### Agentic Workflows
- Proposed for in-world script validation using:
  - Context
  - Memory
  - Feedback cycles
- Requires improved inter-app communication and database access

### Modular Context Protocol (MCP)
- Standardized API layer for AI agent integration
- Abstracts service interfaces and automates request/response formatting

### FastMCP
- Built on MCP
- Enables tool/endpoint definition with minimal boilerplate
- Reduces token and compute costs
- Provides agents with instant context access

### AI for Non-Technical Users
- Encouraged to use `app.configure` and reference existing hyps
- Even basic models (e.g., Qwen) are sufficient for prototyping

## 4. Media and Communication Tools

### Media Optimization
- GIFs perform poorly in Hyperfy v1
- Recommendation: Convert large GIFs to MP4
- Hyperfy v2 offers improved media handling

### Voice and SMS Integration
- LiveKit recommended over Twilio for voice/video/screen sharing
- Planned integration in Hyperfy v2
- FlowiseAI suggested for SMS workflows

## 5. Ecosystem and Tooling Enhancements

### Asset Packaging
- Strategy: Combine multiple GLB files into a single `.hyp` file using a parent object
- Native support for asset collections in development for HyperWorld marketplace

### App Deactivation and Communication
- Improvements underway for:
  - App deactivation
  - Inter-app communication
  - Snap point behavior

## 6. Roadmap and Community Engagement

### Upcoming Features
- PvPvE gameplay
- DAO implementation
- Marketplace development

### Community Involvement
- Call for featured app contributions
- Encouragement to boost social media engagement

## 7. Market Update

- Current SOL (Solana) price: $137.37

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-27

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Performance Optimization**: Ash explained that GIF performance is poor in v1 but will improve in v2, recommending converting GIFs to MP4 videos for better performance across platforms including VR and mobile.
- **Material Handling**: Developers discussed issues with the `linked` property on meshes, where color changes affect all instances despite toggling the "unique" flag in the UI. Ash clarified that setting `mesh.linked = false` is necessary for independent manipulation.
- **Physics & Interactions**: Discussions about handling rigidbodies and character controllers occupying the same space, with suggestions to use contact events and layers for detection.
- **Authentication & Integration**: Questions about connecting frontend applications to Hyperfy worlds and wallet integration, with mentions of an upcoming EVM mod for direct wallet integration.
- **Livekit Integration**: 0mka mentioned that Hyperfy v2 will use Livekit for voice, screen sharing, and video functionality.

### Platform Development
- **Hyperfy v2 Progress**: Multiple references to the upcoming v2 release with improved performance, better material handling, and new features.
- **App Marketplace**: szjanko mentioned that a hyp app marketplace is "about to drop," with discussions about categories and nominations for featured apps.
- **PvP Updates**: Maximus reported work on PvP features with refined Elementals and improved inventory/action bar systems, focusing on implementing game loops and staking loot.
- **Platform Strategy**: Hyperfy is shifting focus toward supporting artists as the next tier of users after delivering key developer features.

### AI & Agents
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Detailed discussion about MCP as a standardization for APIs designed with LLMs in mind, enabling interoperability between services.
- **AI Game Creation**: Discussions about using AI to create games in Hyperfy v2 without technical skills, with community members confirming it's feasible by leveraging examples and documentation.
- **Agentic Workflows**: Conversations about how AI tools could be better integrated with Hyperfy development, including frameworks for validating scripts.

### Creative Projects
- **Butterfly Animation**: Gert-Jan Akerboom shared progress on customizable butterfly animations with spawn area and height parameters.
- **Leaderboard UI**: Omka demonstrated a multi-functional leaderboard that supports different game types and can set/get data from the world.
- **TattedAlien.club**: Dr. Doge presented updates including portal connections to other worlds and a Nuclear Wasteland version.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Performance & Optimization
- **Q**: Are GIFs better if using a URL? (Paradoxx)  
  **A**: In v1 GIF performance is poor, but v2 will have better options. Small GIFs are generally fine, but large ones (2k) perform poorly. (ash)

- **Q**: How does video handle performance wise? (Paradoxx)  
  **A**: Videos are great and work well in VR/mobile too. (ash)

- **Q**: How large is the default grass plain in Hyperfy? (Gert-Jan Akerboom)  
  **A**: It's 2km wide/deep, with the sky sphere having a 1km radius. (ash)

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: Can I set onClick or onPointerDown on colliders from mode nodes? (McCoder)  
  **A**: Yes, onPointerEnter, onPointerDown, and onPointerUp can be set to functions on any visual nodes like mesh. (ash)

- **Q**: Is there a way to quickly deactivate an app without commenting out the whole code? (general hyper)  
  **A**: Not yet. (ash)

- **Q**: How do I make materials unique for different instances of the same mesh? (general hyper)  
  **A**: Use mesh.linked = false to unlink the mesh. (ash and HowieDuhzit)

- **Q**: Is there a bug with the unique flag in the new UI? (general hyper)  
  **A**: No, you need to set `linked: false` on the mesh you are modifying uvscroll on, because by default they are instanced together. (ash)

### AI & Agents
- **Q**: For someone that has no technical skills how hard would it be for me to create a game in v2 completely using AI? (MUDBONE)  
  **A**: You could do it by feeding AI examples of relevant reference sections or code from other hyps. (general hyper)

- **Q**: Is MCP basically just an API standard? (general hyper)  
  **A**: Yes, but designed specifically for interoperability and LLM consumption. (maximus and Shiffty)

- **Q**: Why is everyone excited about MCP? (general hyper)  
  **A**: It enables interoperability and standardizes connections between services. (maximus)

### Platform & Features
- **Q**: $hyperfy wen utility? (cloudAI)  
  **A**: Platform eventually, pvpve soon, dao later, marketplace when built by Hyperfy or someone else. (ash)

- **Q**: Will there be future NFT drops from the team? (implied by jar0d)  
  **A**: There was/is an nft collection, but they got an airdrop and the project is focused on a bigger vision, so there will not be any future nft drops from the team. (jar0d)

- **Q**: Is it possible to combine 40+ glbs into one .hyp file? (TheMattEmpire)  
  **A**: You need to make some kind of script and parent object to place them. (general hyper)

## Community Help & Collaboration

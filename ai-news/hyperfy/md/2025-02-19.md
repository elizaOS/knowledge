# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-19

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **Major Release v0.7.0** introduced significant new features including build-mode controls with flying capability, WebXR support, and player effects system (anchor, emote, snare, freeze)
- **Raycasting** was implemented, enabling laser effects and precise object targeting for interactive experiences
- **Player Effects** system now allows developers to anchor players to objects, play emotes, apply movement restrictions, and freeze players in place - unlocking vehicle mechanics, mining, and other interactive gameplay scenarios
- **UI Improvements** include border colors, dropdown menus, and pin options for UI elements
- **Performance Enhancements** include reduced z-fighting at long distances and improved anisotropy for texture viewing
- **Bug Fixes** addressed a DOM-related memory leak, file upload delays, and app inspector issues

### Community Building & Asset Sharing
- Discussion about organizing community assets on the hyperfy.how/community/assets/ website for easier access
- Proposal for a "big pinning" initiative across channels to improve content discoverability
- Several developers sharing optimized 3D assets, including TheMattEmpire's road tiles with snaps, LODs, and shared textures
- Community members collaborating on character models and offering direct assistance with technical issues

### Technical Discussions
- Debate about app behavior when repositioning items in the editor - when moving an app, the script doesn't run, creating inconsistencies with script-defined properties
- Animation support is in progress but doesn't yet work with the custom scene graph
- Asset hosting solutions discussed, including using Storacha or Arweave with UCAN delegation for storing assets outside Hyperfy servers
- Exploration of both web3 (crypto) and web2 (fiat/Stripe) payment options to accommodate different user preferences

### Platform Transition & Business Model
- Ongoing transition from v1 to v2, with clarification that v2 is open-source with no token required
- Discussion about an airdrop for v1 world holders that needed to be claimed in January
- Debate about the perception of blockchain in game development, with some noting that many developers avoid crypto associations

### AI Integration
- Brief mention of connecting Eliza app to Venice AI agent
- Discussion about setting up an agent to bypass Eliza and connect directly to Venice AI
- Interest in AI-powered tools for generating art assets, vehicles, and other entities within the platform

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do player effects work?**  
A: Player effects allow anchoring players to objects, reducing movement speed, freezing position, playing emotes, setting duration, and making effects cancellable by movement. All options are optional and can be combined. (Ashxn)

**Q: How can apps coordinate loading in sequence?**  
A: Events can coordinate this. Local events are synchronous, so apps can use a rollcall system where one app emits an event and others respond to it. (Ashxn)

**Q: Why is my moving platform jittery?**  
A: Make your rigidbody type='kinematic' instead of static, which is the default. (Ashxn)

**Q: When can we start using the new platform?**  
A: The core engine is reliable and usable now, though it doesn't have many pre-made assets. You can join the workshop to get started. (maximus and Omka)

**Q: I bought a world slot a while back, does that mean I am gated out of the hyperfy 2.0 thing unless I buy into the token?**  
A: v2 is open source, no token or world required. World holders got an airdrop that had to be claimed back in January. (Knar)

**Q: Is it possible to mint the avatar as VRM NFT and have it in the wallet to use it in Hyperfy?**  
A: Our new platform will let you mint avatars and agents, but right now no Hyperfy v2 worlds support NFT avatars. (Ashxn)

**Q: How do I play animations on a GLB in Hyperfy V2?**  
A: Animations don't work with our custom scene graph yet, but we're making progress. (ash)

**Q: Why does an item reset its scale when repositioning it if the scale is set in the script?**  
A: When moving an app, there is no script running, it's just the original GLB. (ash)

**Q: Can we get access to the database or file system from app scripts?**  
A: Apps can connect to external services using fetch(), but don't have direct access to the file system. A persistent storage feature is planned. (ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Ashxn helped drdoge.eth** with monorail movement issues by suggesting making the rigidbody kinematic instead of static and updating position in fixedUpdate instead of update

- **Ashxn guided devilsadvocate.sol** on implementing a chat clear command with detailed instructions on proper network communication implementation

- **Ashxn advised MayD524** on app cloning causing memory leaks, suggesting rethinking the approach by having one app act as a spawner that manages multiple instances internally

- **MetaRick helped Gert-Jan Akerboom** who needed animation alternatives for a rotating cube by offering a script for Y-axis rotation and platform movement as workarounds

- **ii_cable_ii assisted saltï** with 3D modeling issues, recommending GLB format for Blender import and offering direct help with fixing hair and private area issues on a character model

- **Knar clarified for Maebbie** about v2 access, explaining that v2 is open source with no token required, and that world holders received an airdrop that needed to be claimed in January

- **maximus explained to bear** about web3 and blockchain integration, noting that blockchain is just a database that can be useful for cross-world sharing of achievements/items

- **ToxSam helped treed** understand VRM NFTs and interoperability, explaining that VRMs can be stored in NFT metadata and used across platforms

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do player effects work?** (asked by peezy)  
**A:** Player effects allow anchoring players to objects, applying movement restrictions, playing emotes, and setting durations with optional cancellation (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How can I make a moving platform less jittery?** (asked by devilsadvocate.sol)  
**A:** Make your rigidbody type='kinematic' and update position in fixedUpdate instead of update (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How can I download models in-world?** (asked by MetaRick)  
**A:** Hold "shift" when clicking on the model button in the inspector to download the GLB (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How can I implement a chat clear command?** (asked by devilsadvocate.sol)  
**A:** Add a broadcast parameter to clear() and wrap network send in an if statement (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What's causing memory leaks when cloning blueprints?** (asked by MayD524)  
**A:** Using emit after cloning an app causes memory leaks, while send doesn't (answered by MayD524)

**Q: I bought a world slot a while back, does that mean I am gated out of the hyperfy 2.0 thing unless I buy into the token?** (asked by Maebbie)  
**A:** v2 is open source, no token or world required. World holders got an airdrop that had to be claimed back in January. (answered by Knar)

**Q: Is it possible to mint the avatar as vrm nft and have it in the wallet to use it in hyperfy?** (asked by treed)  
**A:** Our new platform will let you mint avatars (and agents) but right now no hyperfy v2 worlds support nft avatars. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: I added the Eliza app, and pointed the chat to the Venice AI agent but I wonder if it should be a different one or need to be set up on the code side instead for it to work?** (asked by saltï)  
**A:** Was think about this last night and can probs set up an agent to bypass Eliza and go directly to Venice pretty easily (answered by MetaMike)

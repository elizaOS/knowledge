## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Discussions
- **TouchStick Control Implementation**: Discussion about the current state of the `control.touchStick` functionality in the Hyperfy platform. It appears this feature might not be fully implemented in the app runtime yet, as no examples of its use beyond avatar movement could be identified.

### Migration & Projects
- A user expressed interest in migrating their project from Cryptovoxels to Hyperfy, sharing their current project at distrito.museu.xyz.

### Technical Insights
- The Hyperfy engine/world compiles .hyp files when users download .glb files with .js attached, providing context on how the platform processes these file types.

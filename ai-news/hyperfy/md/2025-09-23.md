# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-23

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Gaussian Splatting & AI Generation
- **mrtzhckr** has been experimenting with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models generated through prompting
- **hiroP** shared a GitHub repository (splat-transform) for generating 3DGS models
- Generation process takes 1-2 minutes depending on complexity
- **mrtzhckr** successfully imported generated 3DGS content into Hyperfy using a fork they've been developing
- A user mentioned enjoying manipulating AI-generated objects and making them generative

### Infrastructure & Technical Considerations
- LiveKit (WebRTC service) usage limits were hit again by **.hyp shaman**
- **ash** noted LiveKit updated their pricing structure, increasing base price to $50/month
- Self-hosting LiveKit might be more cost-effective for smaller deployments (<50 active worlds)
- The Hyperfy engine compiles .hyp files when users download .glb files with .js attached

### Platform Migration & Development
- **marlus** expressed interest in migrating a project from Cryptovoxels to Hyperfy (distrito.museu.xyz)
- Discussion about control.touchStick functionality for non-avatar movement in Hyperfy
- **mrtzhckr** proposed creating a unified generator system supporting multiple media types through simple commands

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does anyone have or know of a .hyp that uses control.touchStick to control/move anything other than avatar?** (asked by Valiant)  
A: **ash** suggested it might not be fully implemented in the runtime yet

**Q: How long is the gen taking in cursor (roughly)?** (asked by hiroP)  
A: "1-2 min depending on complexity" (answered by mrtzhckr)

**Q: How to create colliders on GLB?** (asked by marlus)  
A: "This video might help you out https://youtu.be/NWTIZv2GTgw?si=BI_1Sfc7pXIFrrRU&t=1380" (answered by Dhin)

**Q: What happened to LiveKit pricing?** (asked by ash)  
A: "They updated their free limits, and their base price is now $50/mo" (answered by ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **hiroP** shared information about the splat-transform GitHub repository for 3DGS generation, which **mrtzhckr** successfully used to generate and import 3DGS content into Hyperfy

2. **Dhin** helped **marlus** with creating colliders on GLB files by sharing a YouTube tutorial video link with timestamp

3. **ash** provided infrastructure advice to **.hyp shaman** regarding LiveKit usage limits, suggesting self-hosting for smaller deployments and using managed service at scale

## Action Items

### Technical
- Investigate if control.touchStick is properly hooked up to the app runtime (mentioned by **ash**)
- Continue development of Gaussian Splatting integration with Hyperfy (mentioned by **hiroP**)
- Consider evaluating self-hosted LiveKit as an alternative to the managed service (mentioned by **ash**)
- Monitor LiveKit usage to prevent hitting limits (mentioned by **.hyp shaman**)

### Feature
- Implement a unified .hyp generator system for multiple media types (models, splats, images/videos, sound) (mentioned by **mrtzhckr**)
- Migration from Cryptovoxels to Hyperfy for distrito.museu.xyz project (mentioned by **marlus**)

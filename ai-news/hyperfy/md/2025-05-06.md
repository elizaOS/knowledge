# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **V1 to V2 Transition**: Maximus clarified that V1 worlds will eventually be discontinued but with ample notice and after achieving feature parity between versions
- **Documentation**: 0mka shared links to Hyperfy's documentation (docs.hyperfy.xyz) and mentioned plans to add it to GitHub for easier reference
- **UI Overhaul**: A major UI update is in development based on community feedback and prototypes
- **Community Call**: Maximus announced an upcoming community call to discuss platform updates, UI changes, and potential vehicle functionality

### App Development
- **NEON App**: Gert-Jan Akerboom created a new app allowing users to create customizable neon signs with features like color selection and snapping. B0gie contributed improvements including sound effects, snap points, and technical optimizations
- **App-to-App Communication**: Ashxn explained two methods for app-to-app communication: app.send()/app.on() for same-app network communication and app.emit()/world.on() for inter-app communication
- **Locationator App**: 0mka mentioned working on an app placement feature using emits/receives, though it wasn't yet added to the apps/inspect pane

### Technical Discussions
- **Vehicle Physics**: Ashxn noted that ball colliders create unrealistic "tank steering" effects in vehicle implementations
- **Gaussian Splats**: There was interest in Gaussian splats integration with v2, though no implementations were reported yet
- **Vertex Color Painting**: B0gie shared their experience using "ucupaint" tool for vertex color painting, noting it feels similar to Photoshop but had limitations with emission not properly using the color attribute
- **Self-hosting Issues**: Vincent reported disconnection problems when self-hosting, which b0gie identified as likely websocket issues related to connection spikes

### UI/UX Issues
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Discussion about the 'R' key being used for duplication, which conflicts with browser reload shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+R). Ash confirmed this has been fixed in the development version
- **UI Visibility**: Users requested that the 'Z' key hide the UI but keep the reticle visible for gameplay purposes
- **Bug Reports**: Two bugs were discussed: an intermittent issue where the 'Z' key sometimes doesn't work, and a camera flip bug where the view unexpectedly changes

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can I still use the legacy platform?**  
A: Yes, it's still operational with no set retirement date. (Agent12, maximus)

**Q: Will V1 be retired at all?**  
A: "There will be a time that the worlds cannot be hosted any longer but there is no set deadline. If you're running events on them still they should continue working. You should get plenty of notice when v1 worlds are to be closed." (maximus)

**Q: What does app.keepActive = true do?**  
A: It keeps the set text set. (b0gie)

**Q: How can I implement app-to-app communication for a race system?**  
A: There are two main ways: app.send()/app.on() for same-app communication across network, and app.emit()/world.on() for different apps. (Ashxn)

**Q: Has anyone done anything to show Gaussian splats in v2 yet?**  
A: Not that I know of. (Agent12)

**Q: Can 'R' be a different key for duplicating to avoid conflicts with browser reload?**  
A: Fixed in dev version. (ash)

**Q: Why am I getting disconnected when self-hosting?**  
A: It's likely websocket related, possibly due to connection spikes. (b0gie)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **NEON App Development**
   - Gert-Jan Akerboom created the initial app
   - B0gie contributed sound effects, snap points, and suggested adding invisible mesh hitbox
   - Vox offered world access for placing neon signs for demo video creation

2. **Race System Development**
   - Ashxn helped Valiant with app-to-app communication for a race system
   - Provided code examples for both same-app and inter-app communication methods

3. **Self-hosting Troubleshooting**
   - B0gie helped vincentskele identify likely websocket issues causing disconnections
   - Suggested connection spikes as the probable cause

4. **Documentation Efforts**
   - 0mka shared documentation resources with the community
   - HypPrivakos offered to host a full archive to preserve legacy content history

5. **Door Functionality**
   - B0gie shared door functionality work with Parzival89
   - Implementation referenced in a Twitter post

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### NEON App Development
- Gert-Jan Akerboom shared progress on a new NEON app that allows users to create customizable neon signs in Hyperfy worlds
- B0gie contributed code improvements including `app.keepActive = true` to maintain text settings
- Added snap functionality to make neon signs attachable to other objects
- Sound effects were implemented with discussions about adding a toggle
- Plans to create a video demonstration in a world with buildings

### Documentation Updates
- 0mka announced that docs.hyperfy.xyz is now live
- Plans to add AI chat functionality to the documentation site
- Working on gitingest of hyperfy.how with expanded code references
- Documentation will include more comprehensive references than basic LLM needs

### Platform & Infrastructure
- Discussion about Hyperfy's legacy platform (v1) confirmed it remains accessible with no immediate retirement plans
- V1 worlds will eventually be discontinued but only after achieving feature parity with v2 and with advance notice
- Vincent troubleshooted connection issues with his self-hosted Hyperfy server (Digital Ocean droplet with 1 CPU core, 2GB RAM)
- Determined that lag spikes in internet connection were causing disconnects rather than server performance issues

### 3D Design & Tools
- B0gie shared experience using "ucupaint" for 3D modeling with vertex color painting
- Compared the tool to Photoshop but noted limitations with emission properties not properly using color attributes
- Found the tool valuable for creating background or filler objects in 3D scenes

### Miscellaneous
- Brief discussion about vehicle physics, with Ashxn noting that ball colliders create unrealistic "tank steering" physics
- Users checked prices of tokens named "Hyperpigmentation" (HYPER) and "Hyperfy" using bot commands

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What does app.keepActive = true do?**  
A: It keeps the text settings persistent (answered by b0gie)

**Q: Can I still use the legacy platform?**  
A: Yes, it remains accessible (answered by Agent12)

**Q: Will the legacy platform be retired?**  
A: Eventually v1 worlds will be discontinued, but there's no set deadline. Users will receive plenty of notice, and it will only happen after achieving feature parity with v2 (answered by minimus-audio-issues)

**Q: How much RAM and CPU does your self-hosted server have?**  
A: 1 CPU (1 core), 2GB RAM (answered by vincentskele)

**Q: Is there an AI that generates sounds?**  
A: "Pixabay is our fren" (answered by b0gie, suggesting Pixabay as a resource)

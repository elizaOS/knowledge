# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development (v1 vs v2)
- Most community members are focused on v2 development, though some are still working with v1 for client projects
- Discussion highlighted differences between v1 and v2 portals - v1 portals cause scene reloads while v2 offers more seamless teleportation
- Technical distinction between different portal types: "hyperportal" for inworld teleports and "spicex" for external URLs

### Technical Implementations
- **Animation Support**: Current implementation only supports armature/bone animations
- **Vehicle Development**: Ongoing work on "Phetta kart" with movement physics, with challenges in collision handling causing glitches in circular movement patterns
- **Portals**: Various implementations being discussed including UI-based and app-configure-based options
- **Colliders Conversion**: Discussion about creating a script to convert Decentraland colliders to Hyperfy rigidbodies, eliminating the need to manually modify thousands of GLB files

### Game Development
- Interest in implementing classic games like Pong in Hyperfy
- Suggestions for creating 3D versions with potential VR support
- 0mka mentioned previous experience with Pong and Asteroids implementations

### World Building
- Information shared about environment sizing: 2km squared reaches the skybox (which has a 1km radius)
- Interest in creating specialized simulations like a Mars environment with Eliza agents to build a virtual city

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What animations are currently supported?**  
A: Only armature/bone animations are supported right now. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What is hyperportal?**  
A: It's for inworld teleport. The spicex one is for outside URLs. (answered by 0mka)

**Q: What's the minimum size of environment GLB so that I can cover the whole world?**  
A: 2km squared goes all the way up to the skybox, or the skybox is 1km radius. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Any reason you don't want to dabble in v2?**  
A: "I'm just putting together a scene for a client and he wants to have a presence in v1 and v2." (answered by carlosmu)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Skinned Mesh Implementation**: Ashxn helped carlosmu by sharing documentation link for SkinnedMesh implementation
- **Portal Functionality**: maximus and 0mka clarified different portal types and their functionality for carlosmu

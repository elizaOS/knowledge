# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development (v1 vs v2)
- **Version Migration**: Discussion about transitioning from v1 to v2, with carlosmu working on a client project in v1 while planning for v2 presence
- **Technical Differences**: Comparison of portal/teleportation functionality between versions
- **Animation Support**: Confirmation that only armature/bone animations are currently supported for skinned meshes

### World Building & Environment
- **World Size Specifications**: Confirmation that the skybox has a 1km radius, and a 2km squared environment would cover the entire world
- **Asset Conversion**: Discussion about converting Decentraland colliders to Hyperfy rigidbodies via script rather than manual modification
- **Environment Ideas**: Interest in creating Mars simulations and implementing classic games like Pong in Hyperfy

### Portal & Teleportation Systems
- **v1 Implementation**: carlosmu using portal_app + place_app in v1 but seeking seamless player movement without scene reloading
- **v2 Options**: Different portal implementations in v2, including hyperportal (for inworld teleport) and spiceX (for external URLs)

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Are only armature/bone animations supported right now?**  
A: Yes, only armature/bone animations are supported (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What is hyperportal?**  
A: It's for inworld teleport, while spiceX is for outside URLs (answered by 0mka)

**Q: What's the minimum size of environment GLB to cover the whole world?**  
A: 2km squared goes all the way up to the skybox, or the skybox is 1km radius (answered by Ashxn)

## Action Items

### Technical
- **Seamless Player Movement**: Implement seamless player movement without scene reload in v1 (mentioned by carlosmu)
- **Asset Conversion Script**: Create a script to convert Decentraland colliders to Hyperfy rigidbodies to avoid manually modifying thousands of GLB files (mentioned by Ashxn)

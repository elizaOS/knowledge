# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-02

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Avatar & Camera Behavior
- Users compared avatar camera behavior in Hyperfy vs Decentraland (DCL)
- Current issue: Hyperfy avatar heads don't properly look at the camera
- Proposed solution: Adding a "dead zone" of approximately 20 degrees to make avatars look forward without the excessive behavior seen in DCL

### Technical Issues & Solutions
- **Player Collision Issues**: Users reported players falling through custom ground models before they fully load
- **Git Workflow**: Discussion about handling Git errors when pulling with uncommitted changes
- **Platform Versions**: Clarification about differences between v1 (legacy) and v2 (current open-source) platforms
- **Visual Quality**: Anti-aliasing issues reported on the v1 platform

### 3D Design Techniques
- Discussion about an advanced 3D technique that creates the illusion of rotation by blending pre-rendered angles
- Technique was initially misidentified as simple billboarding
- Referred to as "smart LODs" (Level of Detail systems)

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a way to adjust start and end point of the Hyperfy head regarding camera?**  
A: It should behave properly by default, but adding a dead zone would help (Ashxn)

**Q: How can I prevent players from falling through my custom ground model before it loads?**  
A: Multiple solutions:
- Use scenes (Shiffty)
- Ensure your island preloads before the world (𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)
- Set spawn points higher in the air (𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 and .hyp shaman)

**Q: Where are the performance settings now? It looks like I have no antialias.**  
A: That's the old v1 platform that hasn't had any feature updates in over a year. (Ashxn)

**Q: Where do I use v2?**  
A: V2 is open source and meant to be self-hosted, start here in the repo: https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy (Shiffty)

**Q: How do I fix Git pull errors related to dirty working trees?**  
A: Use `git pull --rebase` (ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Ground Collision Issues
- **Shiffty** helped **shmoji** with player collision issues by suggesting scene implementation and providing a reference link
- **𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓** suggested preloading the island before the world and setting spawn points higher
- **.hyp shaman** asked if the island was set up as a scene, guiding the user toward a solution

### Platform Version Guidance
- **Ashxn** helped a user understand they were using the outdated v1 platform
- **Shiffty** provided GitHub repository link and explained v2 is open source and self-hosted

### Git Workflow Assistance
- **ash** provided a concise solution for Git pull errors with uncommitted changes
- **maximus** shared a resource about cleaning repository working trees before checkout operations

## Action Items

# Hyperfy Discord - 2026-01-30

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### V1 to V2 World Export System
- Jin is developing an automated export tool for Hyperfy v1 worlds to v2 format
- The tool will create zip files containing users' worlds and assets
- Estimated total export size is approximately 125GB, with individual wallets like Jin's around 10GB
- Implementation details being considered:
  - Export button placement options: editor sidebar, worlds list, or website
  - Processing approach: all zips at once vs. job queue
  - Organization method: per-wallet exports preferred
- Jin is working on fixing conversion bugs, particularly with "seats"
- 178 hyp files have been extracted from Discord

### Technical Optimizations
- Future optimization possibilities during build process discussed
- Potential compression formats to improve load times:
  - webp for textures
  - meshopt for geometry
  - draco for mesh compression
- Jin is working on porting cars to v2 format

### 3D Design Tools
- ToxSam - IBIH announced a new Blender extension called "blender-open-source-avatars"
- The extension allows users to get VRMs directly in Blender
- Published and awaiting approval, but already available for users to try
- Community support requested through comments to help with publication

### Game Development Sentiment
- Brief comment from ash noting "reality: 50% of game devs feel threatened"

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Should v2 upgraded worlds be included with zip or separate?** (asked by jin)  
A: Ash suggested putting an export button in the editor sidebar for owners/collaborators

**Q: Where should the export button be placed?** (asked by jin)  
A: Ash suggested "account -> worlds -> export"

**Q: Should we preprocess all the zips or do it on rolling basis / job queue?** (asked by jin)  
A: Ash suggested per wallet is easiest overall

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Jin helping untitled, xyz**: untitled, xyz has been manually porting worlds from v1 to v2. Jin offered to compare manual vs automated results and requested wallet address.

- **Jin responding to BallisticBanana**: BallisticBanana suggested optimizing items during v1 to v2 conversion. Jin confirmed optimization during build step is on the wishlist after establishing a good baseline conversion.

- **ToxSam requesting community support**: Asked for comments to help with the publication process of their Blender extension.

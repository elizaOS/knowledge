# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-09

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Discussions
- **Button Interaction Mechanics**: Ash clarified that button interaction distance is based on direct distance from player to object, or from camera to object when using drones or free cam. Default interaction distance is 3m but can be customized.
- **UI Implementation Challenges**: 3rdEyeVisuals is developing a gaming/gambling machine with UI elements and facing challenges with UI redraws, particularly for animations like spinning wheels.
- **Hybrid UI/3D Approach**: A solution was proposed to combine UI elements with 3D models to optimize performance, using physical wheel models that spin instead of relying on UI redraws.
- **Gaming Implementation**: The slot machine project will use tokens for gameplay and include a ticket system for NFT raffles, with emphasis that it's for educational purposes only.

### Platform Status & Community Sentiment
- Users expressed support for Ash (presumably project lead) and discussed the current state of the platform
- 3rdEyeVisuals suggested that the framework has been released and now requires community members to build experiences
- Pete mentioned technical limitations in implementing ideas, hoping core features from V1 will make it to V2
- A collection of Hyperfy-related links was shared, showcasing various virtual worlds and experiences including art exhibitions, sandbox environments, games, and tutorials

### Future Features
- Multiplayer poker game was suggested as a potential future implementation
- "Webrings" were mentioned as a potential navigation feature to connect different spaces

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is button interaction distance based on direct forward looking, distance, AND height cutoff?**  
A: It's direct distance from the player to the thing, and for actions it might actually be distance to the camera to allow interaction while using drones or free cam.

**Q: Are you setting actions per app? Internal to the app script?**  
A: That's an app script.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Button Interaction Configuration**: Ash provided code examples to 3rdEyeVisuals showing how to set custom interaction distances for action nodes
- **Action Implementation**: Ash shared complete code examples showing action creation with label, distance, and onTrigger handler to help 3rdEyeVisuals with their implementation

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-09

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **Remote Tooling Progress**: Development is 90% complete with positive initial results (teknopath)
- **Debugging PR Work**: State consolidation for debugging PR is in progress (teknopath)
- **Quest 3 Compatibility**: Clarification that Hyperfy already works on Quest 3 with controllers showing up properly (ash)
- **Scene Management**: Only one scene app can exist in a world at a time, with the ability to replace it if needed (ash)
- **Free Roam Camera**: In V2, the free roam camera now requires adding an app first, unlike V1 where it was toggled with "P" (vox)

### AR/VR Applications
- **AR Use Cases Discussion**: Users shared various AR application ideas including:
  - Card games with AI-generated models and interactions (maximus)
  - Traditional games in AR like mini golf, shuffleboard, and bocce ball (maximus)
  - Firearms assembly training application (MetaMikeC)
  - Ping pong game (𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)

### Technical Innovations
- **Real-time Style Transfer**: Discussion about technology that maintains consistent geometry while changing textures and lighting in real-time (b34k3r)
- **Plot System Concept**: Technical discussion about implementing a "plot system" that would allow multiple builders to have designated areas with specific permissions (miguel_amargo, HypPrivakos)
- **WebGPU Support**: Mentioned as a potential upgrade from WebGL to improve performance (PurpleSack)

### Token Economics
- **Transparency Concerns**: Some users expressed concerns about token allocation transparency and unlock schedules (lucyhail)
- **Project Value Debate**: Discussion about whether Hyperfy's value lies in its technology rather than token performance

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does every world have one scene app?**  
A: Yes, just one. If you try to drop another one down it asks if you want to replace it. (ash)

**Q: How do I toggle the free roam camera in v2?**  
A: For now it's an app you need to add first with a UI for settings and toggles. (vox)

**Q: Can a Hyperfy world be used to build and host another metaverse with token-gated areas?**  
A: It's technically possible but would require customization of the current system. (smickelbeard, TheMattEmpire, HypPrivakos)

**Q: How do I change the ground Mesh (the green one with the hills)?**  
A: It's on 'The Meadow' asset at the top of the properties panel. (TheMattEmpire)

**Q: How can I solve asset upload problems to my own server?**  
A: Check if your server is using SSL. Live websites need SSL with proper protocol prefixes (wss:// and https://) and proper SSL certificate handling. (ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **AR Use Cases Brainstorming**: Multiple users contributed ideas for AR applications in response to MetaMike's question, showcasing collaborative ideation
- **SSL Troubleshooting**: ash provided detailed guidance to Kz about resolving asset upload issues by checking SSL configuration and updating environment variables
- **Plot System Discussion**: Multiple users (HypPrivakos, TheMattEmpire, Agent12) collaborated to explain the technical challenges of implementing a plot system with permissions in Hyperfy
- **Real-time Style Transfer Education**: hiroP shared resources and search terms for community members interested in learning more about the technology demonstrated in b34k3r's video

## Action Items

### Technical
- Complete state consolidation for debugging PR (teknopath)
- Continue development of remote tooling (teknopath)

- Implement WebGPU support to upgrade from WebGL (PurpleSack)
- Verify SSL configuration on server and update environment variables to use secure protocols (ash)
- Ensure server and DNS properly issue and handle SSL certificates (ash)
- Research "realtime style transfer" techniques for 3D environments (hiroP)
- Explore "world models" and "genie 3" as future technologies (hiroP)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-27

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Video_Enhanced.hyp Component**: 3rdEyeVisuals is developing an enhanced video component with multiple mesh options including rectangle, circular, oval, octagonal, and planned rounded corners rectangular mesh. Black bars have been implemented for 16:9 ratio support. The developer took time off work to complete this project and expects to finish within a couple of days.
- **Node Deployment**: Allen is attempting to deploy a hyperliquid node and seeking assistance with obtaining block height using curl commands.
- **X402 Protocol**: Brief mention of "x402 protocol for Hyperfy" by Xukonth, though details were not elaborated upon.

### Blockchain Platform Considerations
- **Solana vs. EVM Migration**: Significant discussion about potentially migrating Hyper from Solana to EVM-compatible chains, with several users expressing support for EVM chains due to better tooling for governance, NFTs, and token-gating functionality.
- **Alternative Chains**: Specific alternatives mentioned include Ethereum and Monad (an upcoming L1 EVM-compatible chain launching in November).
- **Governance Solutions**: Tone introduced Realms, a Solana-based governance platform, as a potential solution for DAO governance.
- **Multi-chain Approach**: Suggestion to consider a multi-chain approach with DAO/treasury on Ethereum while maintaining other functionality elsewhere.

### Feature Requests
- **World Builder Export**: emotionull requested a feature for world builders to download a zip of all worlds as single GLB files per world, which ash confirmed is technically possible to implement.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Could you add a button for world builders to download a zip of all worlds as single GLBs per world?  
   **A**: "I think that's possible yeah" (answered by ash)

2. **Q**: Would Hyper be better on Telegram?  
   **A**: Multiple users agreed, with Agent12 adding that EVM would have provided working token-gating.

3. **Q**: What are the benefits of Monad compared to Base?  
   **A**: "Monad is an L1 that allows EVM builders to deploy and scale without the compromises of Ethereum or L2s" (answered by vox)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Video Component Development**:
   - 3rdEyeVisuals is developing an enhanced video component and plans to share it with the community upon completion
   - .hyp shaman provided positive feedback on the development

2. **Blockchain Platform Guidance**:
   - Tone shared Realms.today as a hosted Solana platform for governance with documentation links

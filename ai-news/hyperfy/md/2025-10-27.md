# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-27

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Migration Considerations
- Strong community interest in migrating Hyperfy from Solana to EVM-compatible chains
- Benefits discussed include improved token gating functionality, better governance tools, and enhanced NFT infrastructure
- Monad (launching in November) was suggested as a potential L1 destination rather than Ethereum L2s like Base
- A multi-chain approach was also considered, potentially keeping the DAO/treasury on Ethereum

### Development Requests
- Request for a feature allowing world builders to download worlds as individual GLB files
- Brief mention of "x402 protocol for Hyperfy" without further elaboration
- One user seeking help with deploying a hyperliquid node and obtaining block height via curl command

### Community Interactions
- Positive feedback exchange in the 3D design channel about a user's creation

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Could you add a button for world builders to download a zip of all worlds as single GLBs per world?**  
A: "I think that's possible, yeah" (answered by ash)

**Q: Would Hyperfy have working token gating if it were on EVM?**  
A: Implied yes, as Agent12 stated "if we were still on EVM we would have working Token_Gating"

**Q: What are the benefits of Monad over other EVM options?**  
A: "It's an L1 that allows builders to deploy and scale without the compromises of Ethereum or L2s" (answered by vox)

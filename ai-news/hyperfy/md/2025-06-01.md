# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-01

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Rendering & Performance Optimization
- **New Render Pipeline**: Ashxn shared details about a significant performance improvement through occlusion culling, which prevents rendering objects not visible to the camera
- **Performance Benefits**: The optimization is particularly beneficial for complex scenes like cities and improves performance on VR and mobile devices
- **Trade-offs**: The new approach increases CPU usage but is beneficial when many objects are occluded
- **LOD Improvements**: Plans to optimize Level of Detail logic to only process visible objects rather than everything off-screen

### Voice Chat & Collaboration Features
- **Voice Chat Integration**: Several discussions about LiveKit integration for voice chat functionality
- **Screen Sharing**: b0gie confirmed screen sharing functionality is available as a .hyp
- **Environment Setup**: Multiple users discussed setting up their own worlds with necessary environment variables for LiveKit integration

### 3D Design & Assets
- **Upstreet Reminiscence**: Community members discussed the defunct Upstreet platform and possibilities of recreating similar functionality in Hyperfy
- **Occlusion Colliders**: Agent12 noted that recent addition of occlusion colliders could enable "Plot Loading" effects similar to Upstreet
- **Splatmaps**: Ashxn mentioned working with splatmaps in Blender, noting they're difficult to set up

### Vehicle & Gameplay Features
- **Weaponized Vehicles**: Discussion confirmed that cars with guns are now possible in v2, which wasn't feasible in v1
- **Networked Functionality**: ~/drdoge.eth mentioned that weaponized vehicles can be networked

### AI & Content Consumption
- **NotebookLM**: Discussion about using NotebookLM to create audio summaries of academic papers
- **AI Tone Customization**: Suggestions for customizing AI voice tone to be less enthusiastic using specific prompts

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is voice chat still in development?**  
A: "We've had voice chat for months. Can try it out in Fallen or the Play world." (Ashxn)

**Q: Can the new rendering features be used with the free tier?**  
A: "Yes, we currently only use a free tier for all of our worlds." (Ashxn)

**Q: What are the chances we can do cull by distance in a hyp?**  
A: "You can already do this in Blender using LODs with a max distance to match your fog." (Ashxn)

**Q: Is the screen share screen available as a hyp?**  
A: "Yes, it's a .hyp" (b0gie)

**Q: Are there cars with guns?**  
A: "No but there could be. That's something we couldn't do in v1, but totally can in v2" (Ashxn)  
"Yes. Networked too. We also have just guns. You can put them on your cars." (~/drdoge.eth)

**Q: Would it be possible to do anything similar to Upstreet on Hyperfy?**  
A: "Might need to be a Special Fork of Hyper But i'd say ANYTHING is possible with Hyperfy. With the addition of Occlusion colliders I think you'd be able to get the 'Plot Loading' effect of Upstreet. Just not the Meta-Mask sign in just yet..." (Agent12)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-01

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Rendering & Performance
- **New Render Pipeline**: Ashxn discussed a significant rendering improvement featuring occlusion culling, which provides substantial performance gains by not rendering objects that aren't visible
- The new rendering approach could enable VR and mobile platforms to handle complex scenes like big cities
- This technique could help web-based engines (Three.js, Babylon, PlayCanvas) compete with traditional game engines like Unity, Unreal, and Godot
- Occlusion culling trades CPU usage for rendering performance, making it beneficial primarily when many objects are actually occluded

### 3D Design & Creation
- **Terrain Creation**: Discussion about the complexity of creating splatmaps in Blender, with Ashxn suggesting a potential demonstration stream
- Agent12 noted that a more intuitive workflow could increase adoption of this feature
- **Upstreet Nostalgia**: Several users expressed disappointment about the defunct platform "Upstreet" despite its significant development
- Fibelius offered perspective on entrepreneurial challenges that might explain Upstreet's abandonment

### Projects in Progress
- **Cruiser Project**: User b0gie is nearing completion of a "cruiser" project for tattedalien.club, with only minor tweaks and vanity features remaining

### Community Alerts
- **Scam Warning**: MetaRick warned about a scammer cloning someone's profile and sending friend requests and direct messages

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How does occlusion culling affect performance?**  
A: It provides free performance boosts with huge gains when many objects are occluded, but trades off with extra CPU usage (Ashxn)

**Q: Would it be possible to do anything similar to Upstreet on Hyperfy?**  
A: It might need a special fork of Hyperfy, but it's possible. With occlusion colliders, you could get the "Plot Loading" effect of Upstreet, though MetaMask sign-in functionality would be missing (Agent12)

**Q: How are splatmaps currently created?**  
A: They are authored in Blender but are difficult to set up (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Rendering Techniques**: Ashxn provided detailed explanations about how the new render pipeline works with occlusion culling, including performance tradeoffs and benefits for VR/mobile platforms
- **Splatmap Creation**: Ashxn offered to potentially stream a demonstration of the workflow for creating splatmaps in Blender to help the community
- **Upstreet Recreation**: Agent12 explained how Upstreet-like functionality could be recreated in Hyperfy using occlusion colliders for the "Plot Loading" effect

## Action Items

### Technical
- Implement and test occlusion culling in 3D environments for performance optimization (mentioned by b0gie)
- Test new renderer with city kits in VR/mobile to evaluate performance on resource-constrained platforms (mentioned by Ashxn)
- Improve the workflow for creating splatmaps in Blender (mentioned by Ashxn)
- Explore special fork of Hyperfy to recreate Upstreet functionality with occlusion colliders (mentioned by Agent12)

### Documentation
- Write a thread about rendering techniques explaining how proper techniques can help web engines compete with traditional game engines (mentioned by Ashxn)
- Create tutorial content for splatmap creation, potentially streaming a demonstration (mentioned by Ashxn)

### Feature
- Complete cruiser project by finishing remaining tweaks and adding vanity features (mentioned by b0gie)
- Develop more intuitive terrain creation tools to make splatmap workflow more accessible (mentioned by Agent12)
- Add MetaMask sign-in functionality to Hyperfy (mentioned by Agent12)
- Add more liquidity to a trading pool or market (mentioned by jingo)

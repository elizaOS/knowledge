# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### $HYPER Token Launch & V2 Platform
- Hyperfy is transitioning from V1 (NFT-gated worlds) to V2 (open source, permissionless platform)
- $HYPER token has launched on Solana with an airdrop for World NFT holders (who owned before Dec 7) and ai16z partners
- Each world holder received 151,200 tokens in the airdrop
- Liquidity is locked in Raydium
- V2 will launch within 1-2 weeks
- The token will power the ecosystem and be used for DAO governance

### Technical Developments
- V2 will support multi-chain functionality through plugins
- Browser-based coding without local development requirements is coming in V2
- AI agent integration (including Eliza) is being implemented
- Performance issues like camera jitter when switching views are being addressed
- Hyperfy runs in browsers without requiring powerful hardware, making it accessible across devices including VR

### 3D Design & Animation
- Issues with bone hierarchies in 3D models were discussed, particularly animations connecting to hip bone instead of root bone
- The problem affects some Mixamo and Rokoko animations inconsistently
- Retargeting tools were suggested as a solution to assign animations to correct bones

## Key Questions & Answers

### Platform & Token
- **Q: What is the difference between V1 and V2?**  
  A: V1 was NFT-gated to build worlds, V2 will open gates and allow people to build more freely with newer features.

- **Q: Is there any value in buying V1 NFTs now?**  
  A: No, they're only useful for building on V1, not for speculation or airdrops.

- **Q: Will V2 offer Solana capability?**  
  A: Yes, V2 will be multi-chain with every chain supported through plugins.

- **Q: Will Hyperfy be on other chains besides Solana?**  
  A: Hyperfy will be on all chains and web2.

- **Q: Is the liquidity locked?**  
  A: Yes, it's locked in Raydium.

### Development
- **Q: If I write a custom app for v1 is it likely to work in v2?**  
  A: (Unanswered)

- **Q: Can we integrate our agent (bossu) running on eliza on hyperfy?**  
  A: Yes, using a modified direct-client.

- **Q: Was there a fix to the camera-jitter bug when switching from 1st to 3rd person?**  
  A: It's related to performance issues; Knar had an idea but focus has been on V2.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Airdrop & Token Claiming Support
- **TropixMusic** helped **Spottie WiFi** with MetaMask connection issues by suggesting cache clearing and providing step-by-step claim instructions
- **Paradoxx** assisted users having Ledger issues by suggesting removing wallet from Phantom and re-adding it
- **maximus** identified a scam targeting **Gamer** through fake support tickets and warned about phishing attempts

### Development Assistance
- **jin** shared an unofficial documentation repository with **StrawberrySith** who was struggling with the current documentation
- **maximus** suggested using the tilde (~) key to view performance stats to help **yung_algorithm** troubleshoot camera jitter issues
- **JUAN** helped **ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì** with animation bone hierarchy issues by suggesting retargeting tools

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Token Launch & Airdrop
- The $HYPER token recently launched on Solana with an airdrop for legacy NFT holders and ai16z partners
- Airdrop recipients received 151,200 tokens per world (worth approximately $20k+ USD)
- The token experienced significant price volatility after launch, reaching nearly 300M market cap before retracing
- The claiming process requires linking ETH wallets to SOL addresses with a ~24 hour processing time
- Users who linked their SOL addresses late can now claim their tokens

### Platform Evolution: V1 to V2
- Hyperfy is transitioning from V1 (NFT-gated) to V2 (open-source, permissionless)
- V2 will feature in-browser coding without requiring local development environments
- Developers Ash and Saori are actively working on V2 features including AI agent integration
- V2 is expected to launch within weeks (less than 2 weeks according to maximus)
- V1 worlds will not be migrated to V2; V1 will remain as-is while V2 will be a new platform
- V2 will support multi-chain compatibility (including Solana)

### Development Challenges
- Developers expressed frustration with current documentation clarity and comprehensiveness
- Several community members, including the Numinia team, offered to help with documentation efforts
- Technical discussions included camera jitter bugs, performance optimization, and bone hierarchy issues in 3D models
- Jin shared an unofficial documentation repository that hasn't been merged into official docs

### NFT Status Update
- Hyperfy World NFTs are no longer mintable from the website
- All links have been removed from Discord and descriptions updated on OpenSea
- Future utility for these NFTs is not guaranteed
- V1 NFTs now only provide value for building on the V1 platform, as V2 will be accessible to everyone

### Technical Issues
- **Q: What issue sounds like it's related to how bone hierarchies or constraints are being handled by Hyperfy?**  
  **A:** The issue where animations connect to hip instead of root bone (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)

- **Q: Why does the claim site say "wallet not eligible" after I registered my SOL address?**  
  **A:** It takes approximately 24 hours for registration data to be transferred to the claim site. The team processes these in batches. (answered by maximus)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Render Textures/Portals Feature**: Ash showcased a significant implementation allowing objects to be visible only through portals in a "spirit realm," creating unique visual experiences.
- **Headless AI Service**: Development continues on a service supporting both Anthropic and OpenAI backends, with occasional issues where AI-generated scripts impact world performance.
- **AI Commands Implementation**: New commands include `/create`, `/edit`, and `/fix` for generating and modifying applications with AI assistance.
- **Mount/Ride System**: Valiant is working on implementing a mount system that needs to interact with an existing race system, specifically for race checkpoints to recognize mounted players.

### NFT & Blockchain Integration
- **NFT Utility Debate**: Community members discussed moving beyond basic NFT display functionality toward more meaningful use cases.
- **.hyp shaman** argued for making crypto "invisible" for better user experience and proposed innovative applications like on-chain rewards for in-world achievements ("playdrops").
- **Cross-Chain Expansion**: Mixed opinions were shared about expanding to Base and other EVM chains, with Cru advising against multi-chain expansion in the near term to avoid fragmenting liquidity.
- **Wallet Connection UX**: Frustration was expressed about mandatory wallet connection requirements in v2, with some preferring v1's connection method with a backpack for asset selection.

### AI Agents
- **NANDA Index Research**: Maximus shared a research paper titled "Beyond DNS: Unlocking the Internet of AI Agents via the NANDA Index and Verified AgentFacts," proposing a system for indexing AI agents similar to DNS for websites.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
**Q**: Is the example code for the headless AI opensource?  
**A**: Ash explained it's still work in progress being built locally with some issues to iron out before it's 100% usable.

**Q**: How does the AI editing system work?  
**A**: Ash described that you can use "/create a wheelbarrow" to generate a new app and "/edit add more wheels" to edit the app you're looking at.

### NFT Integration
**Q**: Why do we need better ideas for NFT integration?  
**A**: .hyp shaman explained that simply loading NFTs becomes gimmicky over time and there's potential for more innovative applications like on-chain rewards for in-game achievements.

**Q**: What's a potential use case for NFTs beyond display?  
**A**: .hyp shaman suggested that defeating a boss could equal a reward onchain, evolving airdrops into "playdrops."

**Q**: What was preferred about v1 connect?  
**A**: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 mentioned having the backpack with all assets to select from was more convenient.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Mount System Implementation
- **Shiffty** helped **Valiant** with detecting when a player on mount crosses race checkpoints by sharing a demo link for detecting overlapping objects.
- **.hyp shaman** suggested to **Valiant** about sending a signal from vehicle to teleport to race start and trigger timer for the race system to recognize mounted players.

### Metaverse Development Resources
- **rando1337** shared information about metaverse development in 2025, suggesting requesting GoodAlexander's space and providing links to his content as a resource.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Build Mode & UI Development
- **New Builder Interface**: Ashxn is leading development of a pointer-lock based building system with features like grab, duplicate, snap, rotate, and push/pull functionality. The community is actively testing and providing feedback.
- **Building Tools**: The push/pull mechanism has a learning curve but offers enhanced functionality. Users have requested undo functionality (cmd-z) and improved gizmos for easier rotation and alignment.
- **Movement Controls**: New controls allow users to hit Enter to focus chat even while pointer locked, and after sending it blurs so they can keep running around. Double jump will be added when not in build mode.

### VR & WebXR Implementation
- **Quest 3 Performance**: VR implementation in Hyperfy 2.0 shows improved performance on Quest 3, with hand tracking and gesture movement capabilities being developed.
- **WebXR Support**: Directional movement in WebXR needs fixing, but overall the VR experience is improving significantly.
- **Controller Support**: Discussion about implementing controller support on web using the Gamepad API.

### Avatar & 3D Model Development
- **VRM Implementation**: V2 requires properly skinned meshes with weight painting rather than just parenting objects to bones. Users discovered solutions by joining separate meshes, applying automatic weights, and ensuring proper bone structure.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Reducing draw calls by combining materials and meshes is crucial for performance. VRM size limit was increased from 4MB to 20MB for the play world.
- **3D Scanning**: Discussion about 3D scanning models for VRM creation, with Roustan mentioning they have one scan available on Hyperfy and another scan pending for two years.

### AI & Agent Development
- **Eliza Agent Configuration**: Szjanko presented progress on an Eliza agent configuration dashboard for Hyperfy, featuring a form interface allowing users to customize settings or select from preset options.
- **AI Model Selection**: The dashboard will include various AI models, though Claude (especially Sonnet 3.5) might not be available due to being significantly more expensive than other models on OpenRouter.
- **Collectron Robot**: MetaMike created an AI-driven collectron robot that can scan for and collect items in the world, with discussions about implementing navmesh for AI navigation.

### Documentation & Community Resources
- **Resource Consolidation**: Omka created a new site (hyperfy.how) using Astro Starlight to organize community resources, with plans to coordinate with Saori about winding down the HackMD book.
- **Asset Optimization Guidelines**: Updates to documentation for asset optimization are in progress.
- **Blender Add-on**: Discussion about a Blender add-on that works better with older versions (specifically Blender 3.4), with users sharing download links.

### Blockchain & Token Integration
- **$HYPER Utility**: Marketplace for .hyp apps/assets is being worked on and in-world $HYPER tips functionality is in development.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Work in progress on making buttons perform transactions, with potential for a "Hyperchain" with HYPER as the native gas token.
- **Trading Strategies**: Detailed discussion of cryptocurrency trading strategies, particularly for meme coins, using technical indicators like RSI and MACD.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: Is it possible to change the color of a material in app script?  
  **A**: Not yet but will be possible. Only emission intensity is available right now for bloom. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Do we have a way to have secrets in scripts yet?  
  **A**: Not yet but could implement it with server-side access to secrets that are null on client. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How can I destroy an app?  
  **A**: Apps can't delete other apps as it would cause chaos, but you can listen for an event and unmount meshes. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Why isn't my VRM model showing up in Hyperfy V2?  
  **A**: V2 requires properly skinned meshes with weight painting rather than just parenting objects to bones. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do I parent with automatic weights in Blender?  
  **A**: Select all meshes *then* the rig, right click, parent > Automatic weights. The rig has to be selected last. (TheMattEmpire)

- **Q**: What's causing high draw calls in my VRM model?  
  **A**: Each separate mesh with its own material creates additional draw calls. Joining meshes and combining materials reduces this. (Valiant)

### Platform & Documentation
- **Q**: Is there a dummy's guide to this project?  
  **A**: There are some community docs that might help at hyperfy.how (Saori)

- **Q**: Is there any documentation/development in hv2 regarding blockchain integration?  
  **A**: It's a work in progress. Documentation will be updated as development moves forward. (Omka)

- **Q**: Is there a world to study, where there are all functions and can you get acquainted with them clearly?  
  **A**: https://play.hyperfy.xyz - everyone is a builder there (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Which AI models will be offered in the Eliza agent configuration dashboard?  
  **A**: The list hasn't been finalized yet initially (szjanko)

- **Q**: Can the dashboard generate character.json files for use with your own subscriptions/models?  
  **A**: Yes, it will have a download button added (szjanko)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### VRM & 3D Model Assistance
- **Valiant** helped **devilsadvocate.sol** with a VRM model not showing in V2 due to improper rigging by replacing the original armature with default VRM armature, merging vertices, joining cubes, and parenting with automatic weights.

- **TheMattEmpire** assisted **devilsadvocate.sol** with understanding parenting with automatic weights by explaining the correct selection order and process for automatic weight parenting in Blender.

- **Ashxn** helped **Saori** by increasing the VRM size limit from 4MB to 20MB for the play world.

### Development Support
- **devilsadvocate.sol** helped **MetaMike** implement item collection in a robot app by discussing an event-based approach for handling item detection and collection.

- **HPrivakos** shared an API integration solution with the community by creating a workaround using app.on(update) for the lack of date() or timeout/interval functions.

- **ToxSam** helped **Ashxn** with creating seamlessly tiling hexagons in Blender by providing a mathematical spacing formula and visual examples for proper hexagon tiling.

### Resource Sharing
- **𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓** helped **devilsadvocate.sol** by uploading and sharing a Blender add-on via WeTransfer link when it was no longer available on the original site.

- **Saori** shared a copy of the hyperball asset with **scoe** who needed it for development.

- **Omka** helped **maximus** with documentation organization by creating hyperfy.how site using Astro Starlight to consolidate resources from Discord.

### Newcomer Guidance
- **devilsadvocate.sol** and **Saori** provided guidance to **frabra239** on learning paths, suggesting starting with JS/Three.js and using GPT to create simple projects, and focusing on learning JavaScript within Hyperfy as it doesn't require setting up a local environment.

- **TheMattEmpire** directed **denshipilovart** to appropriate channels based on question type and mentioned FAQ and docs.

- **VTATV** welcomed **denshipilovart** to the community and offered to exchange portal links between their worlds.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Build Mode & UI Development
- **New Builder Interface**: Ashxn is leading development of a pointer-lock based building system with features like grab, duplicate, snap, rotate, and push/pull functionality.
- **Builder Controls**: The new push/pull mechanism has a learning curve but offers enhanced functionality. Users can hit enter to focus chat even while pointer locked.
- **Upcoming Improvements**: Plans include implementing undo functionality (cmd-z), adding gizmos for easier rotation, and creating group selection capabilities.
- **Feedback Loop**: The community is actively testing and providing feedback on the system, with multiple PRs being merged and new features deployed to the test environment at play.hyperfy.xyz.

### VR & WebXR Integration
- **Quest 3 Performance**: VR implementation in Hyperfy 2.0 shows improved performance on Quest 3.
- **Hand Tracking**: Gesture movement capabilities are being developed for more intuitive VR interaction.
- **Technical Issues**: There's a known issue with directional movement in WebXR that needs fixing.
- **Controller Support**: Discussion about using the Gamepad API to support controllers on web.

### Avatar & 3D Model Development
- **VRM Requirements**: V2 requires properly skinned meshes with weight painting rather than just parenting objects to bones.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Users discovered that combining separate meshes and materials reduces draw calls and improves performance.
- **Size Limitations**: VRM size limit has been increased to 20MB to accommodate larger avatar files.
- **Rigging Process**: Proper workflow involves selecting all meshes then the rig, right-clicking, and using "parent > Automatic weights" in Blender.

### AI & Agent Development
- **Eliza Configuration Dashboard**: szjanko is developing a dashboard for configuring AI agents through input fields and preset options.
- **Model Support**: The dashboard will support various AI models, with the final list still being determined.
- **Export Options**: Users will be able to download character.json files for use with personal subscriptions.
- **AI-Driven Items**: MetaMike shared code for "collectron" - AI-driven collectible items that can scan for and collect resources using a perception system.

### Blockchain & Token Integration
- **$HYPER Utility**: Development of a marketplace for .hyp apps and assets is in progress, along with in-world $HYPER tips functionality.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Work in progress on making buttons perform blockchain transactions.
- **"Hyperchain" Concept**: Discussions about potentially implementing a "Hyperchain" with HYPER as a native gas token.

### Documentation & Resources
- **Resource Consolidation**: Omka created a new documentation site (hyperfy.how) using Astro Starlight to improve searchability and organization.
- **Community Contributions**: Users are actively contributing to documentation efforts, including tutorials on rigging VRMs and optimization guidelines.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Several users offered to stream their development process to help others learn.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: Is it possible to change the color of a material in app script?  
  **A**: Not yet but will be possible. Only emission intensity right now for bloom. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Do we have a way to have secrets in scripts yet?  
  **A**: Not yet but could implement it with server-side access to secrets that are null on client. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How can I destroy an app?  
  **A**: Apps can't delete other apps as it would cause chaos, but you can build an app that listens for events to unmount meshes. Alternatively, use app.emit('remove'). (Ashxn/MetaMike)

- **Q**: How does the collectron seek things?  
  **A**: It triggers perception scans randomly while moving and when searching an area, emitting 'ping' events and listening for 'pong' responses. (MetaMike)

### 3D Design & Avatars
- **Q**: Why isn't my VRM model showing up in Hyperfy V2?  
  **A**: V2 requires properly skinned meshes with weight painting rather than just parenting objects to bones. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: What's causing high draw calls in my VRM model?  
  **A**: Each separate mesh with its own material creates additional draw calls. Joining meshes and combining materials reduces this. (Valiant)

- **Q**: What's better for web experiences - low poly or realistic models?  
  **A**: Low poly is generally better for web due to performance, faster development, and allowing players' imagination to fill in details. (Multiple users)

### Platform Features
- **Q**: What are the environmental plug ins now? Sky box, and others yet?  
  **A**: Basic distance-based fog coming soon, nothing close to unreal yet. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is there any token for Hyperfy atm?  
  **A**: Yes, $HYPER on Solana blockchain. (Omka)

- **Q**: Is $Hyper utility about to be revealed yet?  
  **A**: A marketplace for .hyp apps and assets is being worked on, and in-world $hyper tips are in progress. (Omka)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Problem Solving
- **VRM Troubleshooting**: Valiant helped devilsadvocate.sol fix their VRM model by replacing the original armature with default VRM armature, merging vertices, joining cubes, and parenting with automatic weights.

- **Collectron Code Sharing**: MetaMike provided drdoge.eth with full code and explanation of how the perception system works for AI-driven item collection.

- **Blender Tool Access**: ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì shared a Blender tool via WeTransfer when devilsadvocate.sol couldn't access it through the original source.

### Knowledge Sharing
- **Trading Strategies**: devilsadvocate.sol provided Jona with detailed explanation of using MACD and RSI indicators for trading meme coins, including specific examples and charts.

- **Hexagon Tiling Mathematics**: ToxSam helped Ashxn with mathematical spacing formulas and visual examples for creating seamlessly tiling hexagons.

- **Learning Resources**: devilsadvocate.sol guided frabra239 on learning paths, suggesting starting with JS/Three.js, and explained how to use ChatGPT to create simple projects.

### Community Support
- **Documentation Initiative**: Omka created hyperfy.how to consolidate resources after noticing the community's difficulty finding and referencing useful content.

- **Newcomer Guidance**: Multiple users (TheMattEmpire, VTATV, maximus) welcomed and directed new user denshipilovart to appropriate channels and resources.

- **Asset Sharing**: Saori shared a .hyp file containing the hyperball when scoe requested it.

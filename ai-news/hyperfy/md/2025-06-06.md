## Overall Discussion Highlights

### World Hosting & Deployment
- **Backup Solutions**: HypPrivakos announced that backing up worlds on fly.io is possible through SSH container access and released an export feature on hyperworld.host
- **Coolify Deployment**: Ashxn provided a detailed Docker Compose setup guide for deploying Hyperfy worlds on Coolify, including environment variables configuration and domain setup
- **Performance Considerations**: Warning against using transmission on transparent materials due to performance issues on mobile/VR

### Technical Implementations
- **Lighting Effects**: Detailed discussion on creating realistic lighting by manipulating shadow properties to allow sunlight to pass through glass objects
- **Voice Chat**: LiveKit is currently used for spatial voice chat, though push-to-talk and recording features aren't implemented yet
- **Visual Effects**: UV scrolling was mentioned as beneficial for creating effects with minimal performance impact

### Future Features
- **Environment Apps**: Ashxn confirmed plans to implement "environment" apps that would be locked to 0,0,0 coordinates with scriptable extras
- **Digital Twins**: Community members shared creative ideas for digital twins of real-world objects (fish, cows, trees) that could interact between physical and virtual environments
- **GaussianSplats3D**: A GitHub repository link was shared, suggesting potential integration with Hyperfy

### Market Discussion
- Brief conversation about HYPER token price with one user mentioning purchasing 400,000 tokens and expressing optimism about potential price recovery

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What was the biggest issue with using fly.io?**  
A: Backing up worlds, but it's actually possible through SSH to the container (HypPrivakos)

**Q: Is there another coolify-optimized compose image for the latest stable 0.10.0 or dev release 0.13.0?**  
A: We're running a stock coolify with docker compose (Ashxn)

**Q: Is there a way to make the skybox follow the character vertically without modifying core?**  
A: Ashxn offered to add this functionality

**Q: Could the Scene-field in World settings allow code/.hyp functionality?**  
A: This was the plan - to have "environment" apps locked to 0,0,0 with scripts (Ashxn)

**Q: Do you support voice chat features?**  
A: We support LiveKit for spatial voice chat currently. Push to talk, recording etc isn't currently implemented (Ashxn)

**Q: How to get the sun to shine through glass?**  
A: Set castShadow and receiveShadow to false on the glass, though in some cases you might want receiveShadow to still be true (Ashxn)

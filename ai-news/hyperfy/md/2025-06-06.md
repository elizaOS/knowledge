# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development & Deployment
- **Deployment Methods**: Ashxn provided detailed instructions for setting up Docker Compose with Coolify, including environment variables configuration and domain setup.
- **Rendering Optimization**: Warnings against using transmission effects on transparent materials due to performance issues on mobile/VR as it "renders the entire screen multiple times."
- **Voice Chat**: LiveKit is currently supported for spatial voice chat, though push-to-talk and recording features aren't implemented yet.
- **User Management**: Identified as an urgent need, with suggestions for voice chat permission switches and admin controls (mute, kick, ban) for formal events.

### Technical Features & Requests
- **Skybox Functionality**: Request for skybox vertical following functionality for space settings, which Ashxn agreed to implement.
- **Environment Apps**: Plans to add "environment" apps locked at 0,0,0 coordinates with script support.
- **Portal System**: Confirmation that users can create portals between maps, with 0mka sharing an upgraded portal pack with emissive edges and scaling features.
- **Lighting Effects**: Techniques for creating realistic lighting through glass by manipulating shadow properties (setting castShadow and receiveShadow to false).
- **Command Implementation**: Agent12 shared implementations for rocket launch chat notifications and teleport/emote commands, but reported issues with teleport locations not saving.

### Creative Applications
- **Digital Twins**: Discussions about digital twins for fish, cows, and trees that could interact with real-world counterparts.
- **3D Design**: Techniques for creating god ray effects using transparent cones with fading, and UVscrolling as a zero-overhead technique for creating effects.
- **Marketplace**: New functionality where app links now display name, description, and thumbnail images.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What was the biggest issue with using fly.io?**  
A: Backing up worlds, but it's actually possible though complicated - need to SSH to the container then clone content (HypPrivakos)

**Q: Is there a way to make the skybox follow the character vertically without modifying core?**  
A: Ashxn agreed to add this functionality

**Q: Could the Scene-field in World settings allow code/.hyp functionality?**  
A: This was the plan - to have "environment" apps locked to 0,0,0 with scripts (Ashxn)

**Q: Do you have any suggestions for hosting meetings in the Hyperfy-based metaverse?**  
A: For formal events, you would need: 1) a voice chat permission switch for "everyone" or "just admins" 2) mute, kick, ban buttons for admins (Ashxn)

**Q: Is there anyway to add a portal in hyperfy which able to send user to another map?**  
A: Yes! Grab the portal in the play world someone put there (Ashxn)

**Q: How to get the sun to shine through glass?**  
A: Set castShadow and receiveShadow to false on the glass, though in some cases you might want receiveShadow to still be true (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Deployment Assistance**: Ashxn provided Reneil with detailed Docker Compose configuration and step-by-step instructions for deploying Hyperfy worlds on Coolify.

- **Lighting Effects**: Ashxn helped Gert-Jan Akerboom and untitled.xyz with techniques for making sunlight pass through glass objects, suggesting shadow property manipulation and using transparent cones for god rays.

- **Portal Functionality**: 0mka shared an upgraded portal pack with emissive edges and scaling features for the community to use.

- **Feature Proposals**: 0mka guided Enryt on where to post feature proposals, suggesting specific channels or GitHub for better visibility.

- **World Backup**: HypPrivakos clarified for 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 how to back up worlds on fly.io via SSH and provided a reference link.

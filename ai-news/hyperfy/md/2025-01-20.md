# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-20

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development (V1 to V2 Transition)
- V1 worlds are considered obsolete, with the team advising against purchasing them as V2 is actively being developed
- V2 introduces significant technical improvements including LOD (Level of Detail) support, GPU instancing for duplicated objects, and improved performance
- The platform is moving toward a SaaS-like model where users can pay for worlds without requiring cryptocurrency or NFT purchases
- Currently, developers can run V2 locally and self-host, while non-developers can pay community members for hosting services

### Technical Capabilities
- Hyperfy supports both server and client authority models with flexible networking capabilities through app.send() and app.on() methods
- Fetch API support was added for external API calls, particularly useful for AI agent integration
- The platform was described as "multiplayer infinite backrooms with environment recognition and custom behavior permissionless integration with any framework"
- V2 handles duplicated objects efficiently through shared draw calls, with linked duplicates in Blender (cmd+D) optimized to a single draw call

### AI Agents & Integration
- Significant progress on implementing AI agents using the Eliza framework, allowing VRM avatars to be controlled by AI with emote capabilities
- Developers demonstrated agents that can observe users entering/leaving worlds and respond via text and emote animations
- Plans for more advanced agent capabilities including movement and environment interaction in future updates
- Bitpixi proposed a virtual post office system featuring conversational mail delivery agents that would deliver messages for a small fee

### 3D Design & Tools
- Scoe created a Blender plugin for making Collider Boxes, shared via GitHub (https://github.com/scoegrams/hyperfyhitbox)
- Ashxn proposed enhancements to automate reading/writing custom properties without manual setup
- Discussions about optimization techniques including GPU instancing, bloom effects, and LOD configuration in Blender
- Proper collider implementation requires an Empty as the Parent of objects with specific custom properties

### Token & Economics
- The HYPER token experienced significant price swings during a volatile market period dominated by Trump-related token launches
- Team members emphasized that all team allocation is vested over 3 years, countering claims that developers were selling tokens
- Discussions about the circulating supply API endpoint and market cap calculations
- Community members debated potential use cases for the token, including gaming, AI integration, and adult content applications

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it possible to adjust VRM bone positions/rotations in real time with VMC protocol?**  
A: Yes, but it's not exposed to app runtime yet. (Ashxn)

**Q: How do I set up a collider properly?**  
A: Make LogoEmpty node=rigidbody and LogoCollider node=collider. (Ashxn)

**Q: Is there a profiler to see polycount, drawcalls, materials?**  
A: In V1 there's a performance button at the bottom of the editor window, similar functionality planned for V2. (Ashxn)

**Q: Are we able to make network requests in object scripts?**  
A: Yes, fetch is available in the script function parameters, but you need to be on dev branch and run npm build first. (peezy and Ashxn)

**Q: Is there a concept of having "client authoritative" objects?**  
A: Yes, you can have full server authority, server simulation, client authority, or hybrid approaches using app.send() and app.on(). (Ashxn)

**Q: How could spam be prevented in the virtual post office system?**  
A: By implementing a small fee, showing sender information and subject line, and giving users options to open or trash messages. (bitpixi)

**Q: What tokenomics does HyperFi have? For example, how do you use HyperFi tokens?**  
A: They will have utility, including through the DAO, worlds, games, etc. The specifics are still being worked out. (Ashxn)

**Q: How does instancing work in V2?**  
A: If you drop a GLB into a V2 world, they're automatically GPU instanced; duplicating objects results in one draw call. (Ashxn)

**Q: Is there any point in buying more v1 worlds now or should I wait for v2?**  
A: Don't buy v1 as they're obsolete. V2 is rolling out now, being built live with some people making hosting services. (Saori)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Collider Implementation**: Ashxn helped Valiant implement colliders successfully by providing specific node configuration instructions for rigidbody and collider setup
- **Script Debugging**: Saori helped bitpixi identify an extra bracket causing a syntax error and explained that Ctrl+S is needed to save scripts
- **Asset Loading Issues**: Ashxn helped m₂ resolve assets not loading after refresh by identifying an Nginx client_max_body_size limit issue and suggesting an increase to 32M
- **Blender Plugin**: Scoe created and shared a Blender plugin for Collider Boxes, with HiroP providing video demonstrations of Unreal Engine's collision editing system as reference
- **Model Optimization**: MJMoonbow aka Tinman suggested using TripoSR with specific flags (--mc-resolution 144-192) to reduce AI-generated 3D models to around 30k triangles
- **VRM Conversion**: felixdigit:// shared a YouTube tutorial and documentation by Metamike for converting CloneX files to VRM format
- **Platform Compatibility**: Ashxn identified disabled graphic acceleration as the issue preventing Chrome from loading Hyperfy worlds on Mac M1

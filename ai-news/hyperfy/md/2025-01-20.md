# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-20

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **V2 Progress**: Hyperfy's V2 (open-source version) continues to gain features with recent v0.4.0 release including drag-and-drop VRM support and numerous fixes
- **Technical Architecture**: Discussions clarified that Hyperfy supports both server and client authority models through app.send() and app.on() methods
- **Performance Optimizations**: V2 automatically GPU instances GLB files and optimizes linked duplicates (cmd+D in Blender) into shared draw calls
- **Rendering Improvements**: Bloom processing has been enhanced in V2, with frustum culling applied conditionally based on various factors

### AI Agent Integration
- **Eliza Framework**: Significant work focused on integrating AI agents using the Eliza framework, with developers sharing code for creating AI-powered avatars
- **Agent Interactions**: Demonstrations showed multiple AI agents interacting with each other, with future plans to add walking and environment interaction capabilities
- **Response Format**: Detailed implementation of agent response format including emotes, speech, and actions was shared

### Creative Applications
- **HyperFone Project**: User HowieDuhzit showcased an in-world phone interface allowing cross-world communication and app installation
- **Virtual Post Office**: Bitpixi proposed a detailed concept for a virtual post office system with conversational agents as mail carriers
- **Wedding Space**: Discussion of a wedding-themed virtual space with interactive elements and potential NFT gifts for attendees

### Tools & Development
- **Blender Plugin**: Scoe created a Blender plugin for making Collider Boxes, with Ashxn proposing enhancements and offering funding
- **Collision System**: Detailed explanations of how to set up colliders properly, with LogoEmpty node=rigidbody and LogoCollider node=collider
- **Documentation Improvements**: README simplified by moving Docker instructions to a separate file to make getting started clearer

### Token & Business
- **Market Volatility**: HYPER token experienced significant price swings, dropping to around $0.03-0.04 before showing recovery signs
- **Token Utility**: Team mentioned ongoing work on token utility mechanisms through DAO, worlds, and games
- **Platform Positioning**: Discussion about better positioning Hyperfy as an engine for 3D websites rather than just a "metaverse"

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it possible to adjust VRM bone positions/rotations in real time with VMC protocol?**  
A: Yes, but it's not exposed to app runtime; would need to be a core feature rather than an app (Ashxn)

**Q: How should a basic script be formatted?**  
A: Scripts should use the app.setup format and be saved with Ctrl+S (Saori)

**Q: How do I set up colliders properly?**  
A: Make LogoEmpty node=rigidbody and LogoCollider node=collider (Ashxn)

**Q: Is there a concept of having "client authoritative" objects with unique properties not replicated across the network?**  
A: Yes, you can have full server authority, server simulation, client authority, or hybrid approaches using app.send() and app.on() (Ashxn)

**Q: Are we able to make network requests in object scripts?**  
A: Yes, using fetch parameter in script function, but requires npm run build first (Ashxn)

**Q: How could the post office system avoid being used for spam?**  
A: By implementing a small fee, showing sender information before opening, and giving users options to open or trash messages (bitpixi)

**Q: How do I learn to build on V2 as an artist with some code knowledge?**  
A: V2 isn't fully ready for non-technical builders yet, but you can check the GitHub code if you're comfortable with terminals (maximus)

**Q: What tokenomics does HyperFi have? For example, how do you use HyperFi tokens?**  
A: They will have utility, including through the DAO, worlds, games, etc. The specifics are still being worked out (Ashxn)

**Q: How does mesh reuse/kitbashing work in V2?**  
A: If you drop a GLB into a V2 world, they're automatically GPU instanced; duplicating objects results in one draw call (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Script Troubleshooting**: Saori helped bitpixi identify an extra bracket in code and explained Ctrl+S is needed to save scripts
- **Collider Setup**: Ashxn provided Valiant with specific node configuration instructions for rigidbody and collider setup
- **Asset Loading**: Ashxn helped mâ‚‚ identify an nginx upload size limit issue, suggesting adding client_max_body_size 32M to server block
- **Eliza Integration**: Peezy assisted MetaMike with agent integration issues by identifying incorrect URL format and need to rebuild
- **Model Optimization**: MJMoonbow advised bitpixi on reducing triangle count in AI-generated 3D models using TripoSR with specific flags
- **Post Office Implementation**: Maximus suggested to bitpixi treating the virtual post office like email with on-demand activation rather than requiring agents to physically appear
- **Blender Plugin**: Scoe developed and shared a Blender plugin (hyperfyhitbox) on GitHub for creating collider boxes

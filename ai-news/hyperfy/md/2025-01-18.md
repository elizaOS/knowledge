# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-18

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Progress
- **V2 Migration Status**: The team is actively migrating functionality from v1 to v2, with Ashxn implementing in-world UI components (UI, UIView, UIText) using yoga. The focus is on completing the port from V1 to V2, integrating agents, and adding new features.
- **Agent Development**: Ashxn demonstrated progress on agent chat bubbles that will also be used for player chat. The team is prioritizing agent functionality in V2.
- **Technical Demonstrations**: Ash showcased a tank game prototype, while MetaMike implemented OSC (Open Sound Control) integration for potential VRM puppeteering and body tracking via webcam.
- **Self-Hosting Solutions**: PabloFM indicated they're working on self-hosting solutions for multi-world instances on personal servers.

### Technical Discussions
- **3D Optimization Techniques**: Discussions about GPU instancing, mesh merging, and texture atlasing for optimizing 3D environments. The engine can handle "9 billion trees in a world, just not all in one small area" with proper LOD implementation.
- **Collision Implementation**: Developers explored adding collisions to objects in Blender by setting custom properties and ensuring they're exported correctly with GLB files.
- **App Communication**: Ashxn explained that `world.emit()` lets you send events across apps on client/server, while `app.send()` sends events from client to server or server to all clients just for the app.
- **Agent Frameworks**: Community members debated using Eliza (self-hosted) versus Vvaifu/Dasha (paid service) for agent implementation, noting a 10x cost difference (0.15 vs 1.5 SOL).

### Market Events
- **Token Market Volatility**: A Trump-related cryptocurrency launch caused major disruption across the crypto market, particularly affecting Hyper token. The Trump token rapidly gained value (reaching billions in market cap), causing liquidity to drain from other tokens.
- **Technical Token Issues**: The Hyperfy team is working on metadata fixes for the token to improve visibility on platforms like Jupiter and developing an API endpoint for CoinGecko to correctly display circulating supply.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: How do we get the app state? (asked by Spizzy)  
  **A**: "State is an empty object by default. Anything put in server-side is sent to clients when they connect. On the client, you can use it to update and store info about the current state." (answered by Ashxn)

- **Q**: How to add collision to meshes in Blender for v2? (asked by jar0d and Roustan)  
  **A**: "Add custom properties to the mesh in Blender and ensure 'Custom Properties' is selected in the export dialog." (answered by hiroP and Ashxn)

- **Q**: How are apps supposed to communicate? (asked by peezy)  
  **A**: "world.emit() lets you send events across apps on client/server. app.send() sends events from client to server or server to all clients just for the app." (answered by Ashxn)

- **Q**: How does GPU instancing work in Hyperfy? (asked by TheMattEmpire)  
  **A**: "The engine references a single model and reduces calls by drawing once and copying for each instance, similar to Unity prefabs." (answered by maximus)

- **Q**: When will V2 be rolled out in full? (asked by Authr)  
  **A**: Ash indicated they're focusing on agents in V2, completing the port from V1 to V2, and adding features, with dev streams planned to showcase progress.

### Agents & AI
- **Q**: How do we detect if an AI agent is present in a world? (asked by felixdigit://)  
  **A**: "Agents would be like 'apps' and the right-click context menu will be different from players." (answered by Saori and Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is it technically possible to achieve VRM puppeteering that VTubers have on Hyperfy? (asked by peezy)  
  **A**: "Yes, it's possible using webcam without VR via OSC or potentially using existing solutions like kalidoface-3d." (answered by MetaMike)

- **Q**: Is there a way AI-NPCs aka ai agents could be stored in inventory and spawned by anyone visiting your world? (asked by felixdigit://)  
  **A**: "That's one of the goals of v2, where hosting sites would need to support the app you're bringing into the world." (answered by maximus)

### Token & Market
- **Q**: Why is the market cap displayed incorrectly for Hyper? (asked by frank_grimes_sr)  
  **A**: "The DAO tokens and dev supply aren't circulating, so actual market cap is around 30M." (answered by maximus)

- **Q**: Why doesn't Hyper have a logo or verification on Jupiter? (asked by Beats)  
  **A**: "The team submitted verification but Jupiter hasn't processed it yet." (answered by Saori)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Development Assistance
- **hiroP** helped **jar0d** and **Roustan** with adding collisions to meshes in Blender by providing detailed instructions and screenshots on setting custom properties and ensuring they're exported correctly.

- **Ashxn** assisted **bitpixi** with setting up the environment for Hyperfy, clarifying that .env file is needed and Docker is optional.

- **MetaMike** guided **bitpixi** through setting up the development environment, explaining the process of using npm run dev after npm i/npm run build.

- **maximus** helped **Z aka MetaDJ** access the V2 SDK by directing them to the FAQ with GitHub repository link and noting it's surprisingly easy once terminal is running.

### 3D Design Support
- **TheMattEmpire** recommended **emotionull** use Substance Painter as an alternative to Simplygon for model baking, highlighting its feature to label assets with _high and _low for efficient baking.

- **hiroP** suggested the SimpleBake plugin from Blender Market to **emotionull** for baking models in Blender.

- **ùöüùöòùö°ùöüùöíùöéùöóùöóùöé** provided **Sceth iii** with Hyperfy logo assets with bloom effect and offered to share baked environments for creating cinematic scenes.

### Market & Token Support
- **Saori** explained to **Beats** why adding liquidity from treasury isn't simple, clarifying that treasury is in Hyper tokens, so providing liquidity would require selling tokens.

- **Uuuuuuuuu** provided perspective on market recovery patterns to multiple users during the Trump token crash.

- **Morph** advised multiple users on how to get transactions through during network congestion by using high gas and lots of slippage.

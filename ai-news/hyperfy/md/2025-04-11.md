# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy V1 vs V2 Development
- V1 is a legacy version with NFT-based world ownership, while V2 is under active development with improved performance
- V2 offers better performance but some features aren't fully implemented yet
- V1 is still considered easier to build on for certain use cases
- Mobile compatibility varies: Android devices perform better than iOS, which has compatibility issues with video/audio streams
- V2 doesn't yet support "perpetual state" for hosted worlds from rented servers

### Technical Capabilities & Implementation
- New Video node supports both 360-degree videos and curved video viewing, including m3u8 live streams
- Screen sharing capabilities coming soon to the Video node
- Physics implementation requires `world.attach(body)` for raycasts and rigidbodies to work properly
- V2 doesn't currently support Draco, KTX, or Meshopt compression, but WebP is recommended for textures
- Instancing is automatically supported in V2 through Blender's "duplicate linked" feature and by duplicating GLBs in-world
- Node.js version compatibility issues identified: v20 LTS recommended over v22 for Hyperfy V2 installation

### Hosting & Deployment
- Self-hosting V2 worlds requires development skills
- Paid hosting services like hyperworld.host are available as alternatives
- World contents and code are owned by creators, but hosting arrangements vary

### Community & Events
- Users expressed interest in using Hyperfy for events, especially as virtual attendance options for physical gatherings
- Spatial audio system highlighted as a notable feature for events
- Discussion about avatar customization and community engagement strategies involving NFT collections
- New modding documentation for Hypkg has been released

### Market & Business
- HYPER token has reportedly outperformed most of the market over the past week
- Plans confirmed for CEX (centralized exchange) listings beyond web3 DEX marketplaces
- Discussion about strategic approach to growth through organic hype versus attention-grabbing

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I customize my avatar in Fallen?**  
A: It's currently disabled but ash could add avatar stands (answered by ash)

**Q: What are the perks of owning V1, should I sell it and use browser-based V2?**  
A: V1 is still easier to build on, while V2 offers better performance but some features aren't fully implemented yet (answered by Saori)

**Q: Is V2 already available for me to host people on phones, VR and more?**  
A: V2 can host people on phones but requires dev skills or paid hosting services; VR support isn't ready yet (answered by Agent12 and maximus)

**Q: Do I get to keep hosted world after or is it just rented?**  
A: The world contents and code are owned by you, but V2 worlds don't have a "perpetual state" yet from rented servers (answered by Agent12)

**Q: Should physics be programmatically added, and why aren't raycasts working with tags?**  
A: If you suspect a bug, create a small test app to demonstrate it for easier verification (answered by ash)

**Q: Is there a difference between setting up meshes in Blender versus scripts?**  
A: Both approaches produce the same outcome if you do the same thing; importing GLB just converts them to nodes like a script would (answered by ash)

**Q: Do I have to install Draco into Hyperfy build for GLB models?**  
A: Draco is not supported in v2 yet (answered by smickelbeard)

**Q: Are instances supported in Hyperfy v2?**  
A: Yes, automatically through Blender's duplicate linked feature and by duplicating GLBs in world (answered by ash)

**Q: Do you have any plans for CEX listing, other than web3 dex marketplace of hyper?**  
A: Yes! (answered by ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Physics Implementation Troubleshooting**  
   Helper: smickelbeard | Helpee: FortyMcNiner  
   Context: Discovered and shared that `world.attach(body)` is required for raycasts and rigidbodies to work properly, solving a common implementation issue.

2. **Node.js Version Compatibility**  
   Helper: smickelbeard | Helpee: FortyMcNiner  
   Context: When FortyMcNiner encountered fastify compatibility errors, smickelbeard suggested using Node v20 LTS instead of v22, which resolved the issue.

3. **V1 vs V2 Decision Guidance**  
   Helper: Saori | Helpee: uuilliam.k  
   Context: Helped a user decide between V1 and V2 for events, advising that V1 is still good enough for events with proper scaling (max 20 people).

4. **Hosting Options Explanation**  
   Helper: Agent12 | Helpee: uuilliam.k  
   Context: Explained self-hosting requires dev skills and shared hyperworld.host as a paid hosting alternative, providing GitHub, community book, and documentation links.

5. **3D Model Optimization Advice**  
   Helper: ash | Helpee: FortyMcNiner  
   Context: Detailed how instancing works automatically in v2 through Blender's duplicate linked feature and in-world duplication, providing performance optimization guidance.

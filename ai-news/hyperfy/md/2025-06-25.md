# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Cross-Platform Development
- **Action Node System**: Ashxn explained that the "Action" node system is the recommended approach for cross-platform interactions rather than pointer events, as it works on all devices including mobile and VR.
- **Platform-Specific Interactions**: On mobile, users get a hand button that appears when near an action, and on VR, triggers are used for interaction.
- **Implementation Testing**: HiroP successfully implemented the Action system with simple red and green cubes as test objects.

### Hyperfy Architecture & Development Direction
- **Platform vs. Engine Debate**: Philbert argued that Hyperfy is trying to be both a game engine and metaverse platform simultaneously, creating tradeoffs that limit its effectiveness in either role.
- **Development Suggestion**: Philbert suggested focusing on being a Three.js game engine with strong networking capabilities while embracing AI-assisted development workflows.
- **Current Limitations**: After 7 months of v2 development, Hyperfy still lacks critical platform features like cross-world identity and discovery that existed in v1.
- **Developer Experience Issues**: Philbert highlighted pain points including lack of version control and difficult script management.

### 3D NFTs and Virtual Spaces
- **Historical Documentation**: Users johan and untitled, xyz discussed creating a comprehensive list of historical 3D NFT collections, with untitled sharing a chronological list from 2019-2024.
- **Museum Proposal**: A "3D NFT history Museum" in Hyperfy was proposed to showcase these collections and their timeline.
- **Asset Creation**: Untitled, xyz shared work created using Comput3 for an upcoming meetup, mentioning that all assets were generated without 3D modeling or editing.

### Technical Issues & Deployment
- **Model Loading Problems**: A user reported issues with red boxes appearing for big models after refreshing, accompanied by resource loading errors.
- **Multi-World Deployment**: Ash confirmed that deploying multiple worlds on a single cloud server is possible using Coolify to manage containers on a Hetzner server.
- **Portal Functionality**: 0mka updated the world portal hyperlink in the repository to only portal the local player rather than everyone.

### 3D Character Creation
- **VRM Model Request**: Ashxn sought help finding a professional character designer to create a clean VRM version of a character image.
- **Automated Solutions**: Automated tools like Meshy/Tripo produced unsatisfactory topology for the character model.
- **Model Improvement**: Valiant shared their attempt at improving a model by reprocessing it through Meshy with quad remeshing and symmetry enabled, followed by AI retexturing.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there some secret sauce needed to enable "clicks" in VR and mobile?**  
A: Use the "action" node which works on all devices including mobile and VR; pointer/reticle events currently only work on desktop. (Ashxn)

**Q: How do interactions work on different platforms?**  
A: On mobile you get a little hand button that pops up when near an action, on VR you use the triggers. (Ashxn)

**Q: When I enter the website portal I bring everyone in my world to a new world, shouldn't only me go there? Is it a bug?**  
A: Every object in Hyperfy is built independently by many different people in the community so quite literally anything could be the reason. You need to be more specific, maybe drop the portal app you are using. (Ashxn)

**Q: Do all of these [3D NFT collections] have the 3d file in the nft metadata?**  
A: Yes. All except maybe JOYWORLD, I initially thought those pointed to 3D files but I can't see them in the metadata. (untitled, xyz)

**Q: Can we deploy 10 worlds on a single cloud server with different subdomains?**  
A: Yes, using Coolify to manage containers on a Hetzner server, which takes 30-60 minutes to set up. (ash)

**Q: What is philbert's perspective on Hyperfy's current direction?**  
A: Philbert believes Hyperfy is trying to be both a game engine and metaverse platform, creating tradeoffs that limit effectiveness, and suggests focusing on being a Three.js game engine with strong networking while embracing AI-assisted development.

3. **3D NFT History Documentation**
   - Helper: untitled, xyz
   - Helpee: johan
   - Context: Request for information about 3D NFT history
   - Resolution: untitled, xyz provided a chronological list of architectural/design-based 3D NFT collections from 2019-2024

4. **Multi-World Deployment**
   - Helper: ash
   - Helpee: Coinexpert
   - Context: Deploying multiple worlds on a single server
   - Resolution: Suggested using Coolify to manage containers on a Hetzner server, noting it takes 30-60 minutes to set up

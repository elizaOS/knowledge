## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there some secret sauce I need to enable "clicks" in VR and mobile or is that something that doesn't exist yet?**  
A: You can click on UIs in VR already and mobile I believe. Definitely seen it work on world UI in VR. Pretty sure onPointerDown works on mobile. (0mka)

**Q: When I enter the website portal I bring everyone in my world to a new world, shouldn't only me go there? Is it a bug?**  
A: Every object in hyperfy is built independently by many different people in the community so quite literally anything could be the reason. You're gonna have be more specific, maybe drop the portal app you are using in here and we can check it out for you. (Ashxn)

**Q: Do all of these [3D NFT collections] have the 3d file in the nft metadata?**  
A: Yes. All except maybe JOYWORLD, I initially thought those pointed to 3D files but I can't see them in the metadata. (untitled, xyz)

**Q: Why did philbert remove emotionull from a group chat?**  
A: Because emotionull "minted and shilled 3 of your own tokens in 24 hr span" (philbert)

**Q: What are the technical limitations of Hyperfy as a game engine?**  
A: It struggles to balance being both a game engine and metaverse platform, with collaborative features sometimes conflicting with game development workflows (philbert)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-20

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Animation & Interaction Systems
- **Head Tracking & Gaze Mechanics**: Ashxn is developing advanced head tracking and gaze systems for more immersive interactions, receiving positive community feedback.
- **Humanoid Animation Compatibility**: Work is underway to support animations beyond Mixamo, with Ashxn offering to conduct a call explaining the implementation process.
- **Held Object Support**: Development of systems to support held objects like guns, bows, and staffs, including raycast projectiles.

### Quest & Collection Systems
- **Gold Collection System**: 0mka shared a comprehensive Quest Item collection system with configurable UI components, being implemented in "Hyperscape" and "Coinquest" at roustan.xyz.
- **Technical Features**: The system includes signal emission, persistent storage options, 3D model customization, UI configuration, sound effects, and block visibility toggling.
- **Persistence Challenges**: Discussion about limitations with persistent storage where items reload on world refresh, requiring further development.

### World Management Issues
- **World Clean Operation Bug**: Users reported being unable to access worlds after running world clean operations, particularly affecting hyperlinks with additional files beyond GLB.
- **Workaround Discovered**: 0mka restored access by manually adding missing assets back to the world/assets folder, but noted this isn't viable for users without server access.
- **Proposed Solution**: Suggestion to modify the system to allow world access even when assets are missing, perhaps by displaying a "crashblock" instead.

### Platform Discussions
- **Base App Invites**: Brief discussion about obtaining Base app invites, with speculation that it might be a rebranded Coinbase wallet.
- **Documentation Resources**: References to documentation available in the #resources channel and at deepwiki.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Implementation
- **Q**: Is there an easy way to prompt user for text input? (asked by shmoji)  
  **A**: You can hijack the chat (answered by Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘)

- **Q**: Was double jump axed? (asked by Valiant)  
  **A**: "I just disabled it while I figure things out. Head tracking and flipping doesn't go together yet" (answered by Ashxn)

- **Q**: Where can I find documentation? (asked by emotionull)  
  **A**: Check #resources and https://deepwiki.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy (answered by 0mka)

### Technical Issues
- **Q**: Does restarting the server after world clean resolve the issue? (asked by 0mka)  
  **A**: No, restarting the server post world clean did not resolve the issue (answered by 0mka)

- **Q**: What types of hyperlinks seem to cause the issue? (asked by 0mka)  
  **A**: Typically hyperlinks with additional files attached to the GLB, while hyperlinks with just GLB files seemed to be fine (answered by 0mka)

- **Q**: How was the world access restored? (asked by 0mka)  
  **A**: By identifying the missing assets from console logs and manually readding them to the world/assets folder on the server (answered by 0mka)

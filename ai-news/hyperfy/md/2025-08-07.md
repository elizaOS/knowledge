# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI-Powered 3D Generation
- **Ashxn** demonstrated an impressive AI-powered primitive shape generation system using Claude Opus 4.1
- The system generates complex 3D structures (castles, carousels, coliseums, cityscapes) using only basic primitive shapes (boxes, cylinders, cones)
- Performance is optimized through instancing (1 draw call per same material+shape combination)
- The system maintains 60fps even with complex structures
- Community members tested various prompts from specific requests to abstract concepts
- **MetaMike** and **Shiffty** also experimented with the system using different models like Sonnet 4.1

### Platform Infrastructure
- Brief discussion about domain ownership in Hyperfy, comparing it to ENS (Ethereum Name Service)
- Users jokingly referred to the concept as "hypername service" or "hypname service"
- Mention of costs associated with maintaining domains (estimated at $6k/year)
- Debate on whether worlds should be free or paid in Hyperfy

### Community Events
- **vox** organized a watch party for the GPT-5 release event
- Created and shared a Hyperfy space (https://hyperfy.io/watchparty) for streaming the event

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How does the AI shape generation work performance-wise? Does it instance?**  
A: 1 draw call per same material+shape combination (answered by **Ashxn**)

**Q: What's the base model you're using for the AI shape generation?**  
A: Claude Opus 4.1 (answered by **Ashxn**)

**Q: Did it stack cuboids or make cuts in the mesh? Or are the lights additional mesh faces?**  
A: All stacked, and lights are bloom effects (answered by **Ashxn**)

**Q: Should worlds be free or paid in Hyperfy?**  
A: Worlds should be practically free; at least I personally don't want to make money from that (answered by **Ashxn**)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **AI Shape Generation Prompt Sharing**
   - **Ashxn** shared the prompt template that worked successfully for generating complex structures
   - Helped the community understand how to structure prompts for optimal results

2. **GPT-5 Watch Party Setup**
   - **vox** created and shared a dedicated space for community members to watch the GPT-5 release event
   - Provided the link (https://hyperfy.io/watchparty) for easy access

3. **Technical Support**
   - **Ashxn** helped **MetaMike** understand how to try the AI shape generation system
   - Clarified that the latest dev build is needed as the play world doesn't have the primitives feature yet

4. **3D Design Issue Resolution**
   - User **ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì** reported successfully resolving a previously discussed issue in the 3D design channel

## Action Items

### Technical
- Improve instancing to handle many shape variations without FPS drop (mentioned by **Ashxn**)
- Fix z-fighting issues in the generated structures (mentioned by **vox**)
- Optimize to potentially make the entire structure one draw call using shaders (mentioned by **Ashxn**)

### Feature
- Add ability to swap with custom set of primitives and use underlying texture atlas (mentioned by **vox**)
- Improve AI's understanding of scale in generated structures (mentioned by **Ashxn**)
- Explore if providing an image reference would improve reconstruction accuracy (mentioned by **Ashxn**)
- Consider implementing a domain/world naming system similar to ENS (mentioned by **.hyp shaman**)
- Evaluate pricing model for worlds (mentioned by **Ashxn** and **.hyp shaman**)

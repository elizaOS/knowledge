# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI-Generated 3D Environments
- **Breakthrough Technology**: Ashxn demonstrated a system where Claude Opus 4.1 generates complex 3D environments using primitive shapes (boxes, cylinders, cones) in Hyperfy
- **Impressive Capabilities**: The AI successfully created structures like castles, carousels, coliseums, and cities through simple prompts
- **Technical Implementation**: The system outputs JavaScript code that places and styles primitives to create scenes
- **Performance Optimization**: Ashxn implemented instancing to handle numerous objects efficiently, with potential for further optimization to single draw calls using shaders
- **Community Experimentation**: Several developers (peezy, MetaMike, Shiffty) tested different prompts and AI models to push the system's capabilities

### Domain Management & Community Concepts
- **Hypername Service**: Discussion about creating an ENS-like system for Hyperfy domains
- **Domain Costs**: Brief mention of approximately $6k/year for maintaining domains
- **Virtual Events**: Proposal to use watch party world for streaming the GPT-5 release event
- **Community Spaces**: Nostalgic references to Burning Man metaverse experiences, with suggestions to create similar concepts in Hyperfy

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: How does the AI-generated environment work performance-wise? (vox)
  **A**: "1 draw per same material+shape, and there are ways to make almost the entire thing one draw call using shaders" (Ashxn)

- **Q**: What AI model are you using? (MetaMike)
  **A**: Claude Opus 4.1 (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is it possible to control colors and emissions within the prompt? (vox)
  **A**: Yes, it has bloom, though not all capabilities have been fully implemented yet (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is there a way to detect mobile for resizing UI? (Lastraum)
  **A**: control.screen.width and control.screen.height exist, and world.device.isTouch will be added soon (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do I access the AI prim builder? (maximus)
  **A**: You need to be on latest dev branch and prompt an AI to generate the code (MetaMike and Valiant)

- **Q**: What is the forward/up jump distance for avatars? (Valiant)
  **A**: Jump height is ~1.5m and jump distance while running is around 5m (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### AI Environment Generation
- **Ashxn helped maximus**: Identified hallucinated code referencing non-existent player.velocity.y and suggested commenting out those lines to make it run
- **Ashxn helped Lastraum**: Acknowledged a potential bug with screen dimensions access and committed to fixing it
- **MetaMike helped maximus**: Explained an iterative approach to building complex structures (field, sidelines, endzone bleachers, etc.)
- **Ashxn shared with community**: Posted the prompt template structure used for generating 3D environments

### Event Organization
- **vox self-organized**: Set up a watch party at https://hyperfy.io/watchparty for the GPT-5 release event

## Action Items

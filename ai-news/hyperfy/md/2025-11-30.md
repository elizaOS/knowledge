# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-30

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Licensing & Development
- **GPLv3 Licensing Clarification**: Extensive discussion about how Hyperfy's GPLv3 license affects app development. Consensus reached that apps built on Hyperfy are separate from the codebase and not subject to the license requirements.
- **Protecting Proprietary Code**: Technical approaches were shared for keeping proprietary logic on backend servers while only sending minimal UI and rendering code to the browser, allowing developers to protect trade secrets while complying with licensing.
- **SaaS Loophole Discussion**: Explanation that GPL only triggers when distributing software, not when running services, giving developers flexibility in how they implement their solutions.

### AI Agents & Virtual Worlds
- **Advanced AI Agents**: Discussion about the distinction between basic NPCs and more sophisticated AI agents in virtual worlds, with interest in going beyond simple behaviors like trading or emoji reactions.
- **Agent Examples**: Request for examples of live agents in .xyz worlds or .hyp environments, with specific mention of an implementation by drdoge from months ago.
- **"Eliza in hyperfy"**: Mentioned as an example of more advanced agent implementation that allows characters to interact with the platform in sophisticated ways.

### Technical Issues
- **Deployment Challenges**: A user reported difficulties setting up a Hyperfy world on a DigitalOcean droplet, encountering build errors related to esbuild service being stopped on Node.js v22.11.0.
- **HYPER Token**: Brief price update showing HYPER/SOL trading pair on Solana with a market cap of 690K and a -7.4% price change.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does the GPLv3 license apply to apps built on Hyperfy?**  
A: No, apps are not part of the codebase, so the license doesn't apply to them. Apps can be entirely proprietary and monetized.

**Q: Can you sell GPL software?**  
A: Yes, you can sell GPL software at any price, but you must provide source code, include the GPL license, and allow recipients the same freedoms.

**Q: Does GPLv3 require sharing code when running it as a service?**  
A: No, GPLv3 only triggers when you distribute the software, not when running it as a service.

**Q: How can developers protect their proprietary code while using Hyperfy?**  
A: Keep logic on the backend server and only send minimal UI and rendering code to the browser.

**Q: What's the difference between basic NPCs and advanced agents in Hyperfy?**  
A: Basic NPCs in play.hyperfy have simple behaviors, while more advanced implementations like "Eliza in hyperfy" allow characters to interact with the platform in more sophisticated ways.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Licensing Guidance
- **3rdEyeVisuals** provided detailed explanations about GPL licensing misconceptions to **Ozymandias**, suggesting technical approaches to protect proprietary code while complying with licensing requirements.
- **ash** and **HypPrivakos** clarified for **Ozymandias** that apps can be entirely proprietary and monetized as they're separate from the engine.

### Technical Support
- **.hyp shaman** helped **Fibelius** understand the distinction between simple NPCs and more advanced agent implementations in Hyperfy.
- **.hyp shaman** suggested to **CarTarL** to try running Hyperfy locally first and watching Roustan's beginner guide video when they encountered deployment issues.
- **Shiffty** promptly addressed a security concern when **CarTarL** reported someone trying to redirect them to an external server for "support," confirming the problematic user was banned.

## Action Items

### Technical

- Implement fetch operations from private backend with minimal UI in browser (Mentioned by 3rdEyeVisuals)
- Create PR for added features to enhance Apps environment capabilities (Mentioned by Ozymandias)
- Investigate esbuild service stopping during build process on Node.js v22.11.0 (Mentioned by CarTarL)
- Review compatibility with Node.js v22.11.0 to address deprecation warning for fs.Stats constructor (Mentioned by CarTarL)

### Documentation
- Clarify licensing implications for apps built on Hyperfy (Mentioned by Ozymandias)
- Elaborate on how Hyperscape handles licensing with Hyperfy fork (Mentioned by 3rdEyeVisuals)
- Update deployment documentation to clarify current setup process for hosted environments like DigitalOcean (Mentioned by CarTarL)
- Clarify the differences between NPCs and advanced agents in Hyperfy (Mentioned by .hyp shaman)

### Feature

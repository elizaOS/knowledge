# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-28

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Updates
- **Hyperfy V2 Development**: Monaco code editor integration was implemented by peezy, adding autocomplete functionality for app and world objects with JSDoc descriptions, providing better documentation while coding.
- **Sky Node Changes**: A breaking change combined separate sky and hdr nodes into a single node with multiple properties (bg, hdr, time, intensity, fog).
- **Memory Optimization**: Discussions about material sharing between GLBs revealed that identical materials in different GLBs currently have unique UUIDs, preventing automatic sharing. Tests showed a car model consuming 800MB RAM in V2 versus 1.1GB in V1, with optimization potentially reducing this to just a few MB.
- **UI Improvements**: Multiple developers created variations of position/rotation/scale editor UI, with consensus needed on a final implementation.
- **App-to-App Communication**: Developers discussed using app.emit() and world.on() for event handling between apps.
- **Preloader Enhancement**: The preloader was improved with an overlay to enhance user experience during loading.

### Immersive Experiences & 3D Design
- **360° VR Experiences**: Implementation of immersive experiences by projecting video onto a sphere with flipped normals, enabling VR cinema and potential for streaming live 360° events like sports games.
- **Reflection Systems**: Reflections are powered by static HDRIs that match the sky. A technique was discussed for capturing equirectangular snapshots of the world to create more accurate environment maps showing buildings and other elements.
- **Projector Concept**: A proposal for using a projector with a camera inside the world, allowing real-world content to be projected into Hyperfy while simultaneously projecting the Hyperfy world outward.

### AI & Agents
- **Agent Development**: Hyperfy is collaborating with companies to develop a no-code solution for launching Eliza agents with Hyperfy integration "out of the box."
- **AI Technology Integration**: Discussion noted that reinforcement learning models are more effective for game NPCs than LLMs, though LLMs could be valuable for long-term objective planning.

### Community & Platform Vision
- **Hyperfy Roadmap**: Ashxn outlined Hyperfy's vision: enabling non-technical users to build and explore, developers to create powerful tools, 3D artists to bring content to life without code, and AI agents to coexist in virtual worlds.
- **Community Building**: Discussions about standardized matchmaking systems for games and creating more games to drive platform adoption.
- **Developer Call**: The community held a recorded developer call with discussions about education-focused avatars and community documentation efforts.

### HYPER Token
- **Market Movement**: HYPER token experienced a 90-93% drop from its all-time high, with community members discussing technical analysis patterns, resistance levels, and potential price floors.
- **Developer Transparency**: Saori discussed plans to sell a small amount (~$7k) of tokens to fund hackathons and tournaments, emphasizing transparency with the community.
- **Community Sentiment**: Despite price decline, many community members expressed continued confidence in the project's fundamentals and technology.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: How do you fetch data for trading screens?  
  **A**: Using Dexscreener API (MetaMike)

- **Q**: Is there a fetch object in the script?  
  **A**: Yes, fetch is a global you can use in scripts (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Can we host a Hyperfy world using our own server and connect to any chains we want?  
  **A**: Absolutely, Saori made a Solana branch on the official repo, and the same could be done for any chain (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is there anything like app.openUrl?  
  **A**: No, but it would be easy to add to App.js (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Can I spawn things like projectiles or enemies in V2?  
  **A**: Yes, you can .clone() anything from your app's model and move it around (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is there app-to-app communication?  
  **A**: Yes, using app.emit(name, data) and world.on(name, callback) (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is there a prefab/blueprint system?  
  **A**: Apps are essentially blueprints, with plans to add .hyp file export/import (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is there a way to instance materials on the backend?  
  **A**: Currently no, GLBs have different material UUIDs even if identical (Ashxn)

### Agents & AI
- **Q**: Where are we at with agents? I'd like a mid-level option of attaching my JSON file to a VRM.  
  **A**: You can run your own Eliza server that connects to Hyperfy agents in world right now. We're working with companies to make it possible to launch Hyperfy-enabled Eliza agents out of the box, no code. (Ashxn)

### Platform & Community
- **Q**: Is there any kind of roadmap for Hyperfy?  
  **A**: Ashxn outlined that the ultimate goals are: 1) enabling regular people to build without technical skills, 2) developers making powerful apps/tools, 3) 3D artists bringing content to life without code, 4) AI agents coexisting in worlds (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do I get the WorldOwner role?  
  **A**: Legacy role that's no longer given for v1 worlds (maximus and HPrivakos)

- **Q**: Would you argue that Hyperfy worlds are persistent despite the DAO being able to turn off the server?  
  **A**: "Nobody can stop hyperfy, not even if we or the dao wanted to" (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is Hyperfy good for a 360 VR cinema experience?  
  **A**: MetaRick demonstrated it's possible by streaming 360° video onto a sphere with flipped normals in Hyperfy (MetaRick)

- **Q**: Are the community calls recorded?  
  **A**: Yes, recordings are shared afterward (fractilians and maximus)

- **Q**: Can I run a .glb avatar in Hyperfy?  
  **A**: No, only VRM format is supported, conversion is needed (𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)

### HYPER Token
- **Q**: What is the reason for selling some tokens?  
  **A**: To fund hackathons and tournaments, with only 35% being sold for taxes and the rest used as prizes (Saori)

- **Q**: Can someone help me understand what's happening with these consistent selling at a loss transactions?  
  **A**: Possibly a misconfigured arbitrage bot (maximus)

- **Q**: Can we still reach 0.1?  
  **A**: Yes, just probably not today (jar0d)

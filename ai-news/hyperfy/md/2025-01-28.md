# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-28

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy V2 Development
- **Monaco Code Editor Integration**: Peezy implemented autocomplete functionality for app and world objects with JSDoc descriptions, significantly improving developer experience.
- **UI Improvements**: Transform controls interface for position/rotation/scale manipulation was discussed, along with a new sky node that combines previous sky and HDR functionality.
- **Memory Optimization**: Discussions about optimizing large assets with multiple textures. A test showed that optimizing a car model reduced VRAM usage from 550MB to 34MB while maintaining visual quality.
- **App-to-App Communication**: The world.emit() and app.on() event system allows different apps to interact. Plans for exporting apps as .hyp files for sharing and reuse were discussed.

### 3D Design & Immersive Experiences
- **Reflection Systems**: Ashxn explained that reflections are powered by static HDRIs that match the sky, with techniques to capture equirectangular snapshots for more accurate environment maps.
- **360° VR Cinema**: MetaRick demonstrated a successful implementation using a sphere with flipped normals to project 360° video content, creating immersive experiences.
- **Bidirectional Experiences**: Maximus proposed using a projector with a 360 camera to create bidirectional experiences between real-world and virtual environments.

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- **World Deployment System**: Lastraum showcased theforgecore.xyz, allowing users to create and deploy Hyperfy worlds with custom subdomains (username.hyperfyworlds.xyz) using chat commands.
- **Digital Ocean Deployment**: Several users discussed troubleshooting Digital Ocean deployments, with issues related to node versions and environment setup.
- **Docker Implementation**: The deployment system runs on Docker and Digital Ocean with a wildcard DNS setup, though it's described as "bare bones" with plans for continued development.

### HYPER Token & Community
- **Token Price Movements**: Community members discussed HYPER token experiencing a 90-93% drop from its all-time high, with technical analysis of support levels around 0.02 SOL.
- **Developer Funding**: Saori discussed plans to sell a small amount (~$7k) of tokens to fund hackathons and tournaments, emphasizing transparency.
- **AI Integration**: Discussion about reinforcement learning models often being more effective than LLMs for gaming applications.

### Hyperfy Vision & Roadmap
- **Platform Goals**: Ashxn outlined Hyperfy's vision: enabling non-technical users to build and explore, developers to create powerful tools, 3D artists to bring content without code, and AI agents to coexist in worlds.
- **No-Code Development**: Several users expressed interest in no-code tools, with indications that such features might be available in a few weeks.
- **AI Agents**: Hyperfy is collaborating with companies to develop a no-code solution for launching Eliza agents with Hyperfy integration "out of the box."

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: How do you fetch data for trading screens?  
  **A**: Using Dexscreener API and fetch in scripts (MetaMike, Ashxn)

- **Q**: Can I spawn things like projectiles or enemies in V2?  
  **A**: Yes, you can .clone() objects from your app's model and manipulate them (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is there app-to-app communication?  
  **A**: Yes, using app.emit(name, data) and world.on(name, callback) (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is there a way to instance materials across multiple GLBs to save memory?  
  **A**: Currently no, but it's a potential optimization (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is there any way to have volumes that reflect different skyboxes for more accurate reflections/lighting?  
  **A**: Reflections use static HDRIs matching the sky; you can take equirectangular snapshots for more accurate reflections (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Why are scripts linked when you duplicate objects?  
  **A**: To avoid editing code in multiple places and to reduce download requirements (Ash)

### Platform & Roadmap
- **Q**: Is there any kind of roadmap for Hyperfy?  
  **A**: Ashxn outlined goals: enabling regular people to build without technical skills, allowing developers to make powerful apps/tools, helping 3D artists bring content to life without code, and enabling AI agents to coexist in worlds.

- **Q**: Would you argue that Hyperfy worlds are persistent despite the DAO potentially turning off the server?  
  **A**: "Nobody can stop hyperfy, not even if we or the dao wanted to." (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Where are we at with agents?  
  **A**: You can run your own Eliza server that connects to Hyperfy agents in world right now. We're also working with companies on no-code solutions. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: When is the version with the settings menu for no code experience available to try?  
  **A**: Maybe in a few weeks there will be some more no code tools, but it's still somewhat early. (general hyper)

### HYPER Token
- **Q**: What is the reason for selling some tokens?  
  **A**: To fund hackathons and tournaments, with only 35% being sold for taxes and the rest used as prizes (Saori)

- **Q**: Why is the token price dropping so much?  
  **A**: Market-wide downturn affecting AI tokens, with HYPER experiencing approximately 93% decline from ATH (BitFiend, devilsadvocate.sol)

- **Q**: What type of AI is better for gaming?  
  **A**: Reinforcement learning models are often better than LLMs for gameplay, while LLMs are good for decision making (Saori)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Troubleshooting
- **devilsadvocate.sol** helped **emotionull** troubleshoot Digital Ocean deployment errors by identifying potential node version issues and missing .env file configuration.

- **HPrivakos** assisted **emotionull** with node version management for deployment, providing detailed commands for installing and managing Node.js versions using NVM.

- **maximus** shared additional documentation created by peezy for Digital Ocean deployment troubleshooting with **emotionull**.

- **Lastraum** fixed an infinite loop in their update script that was blocking new world creation after **ash** reported their world wasn't launching.

### Development Assistance

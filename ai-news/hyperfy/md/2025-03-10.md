# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Topics
- **PVP Game Development**: Ashxn revealed they're building a high-risk PVP game internally to showcase Hyperfy technology. The game will be weapon-based (swords, consumables) and require Hyper tokens to play, with rewards from kills going back to Hyper.
- **Avatar Systems**: Extensive discussion about VRM format vs. custom wearables, with developers explaining how Hyperfy uses VRM format for avatars rather than regular animated GLB files.
- **Water/Ocean Implementation**: Multiple developers shared techniques for creating realistic water effects using UV scrolling, mesh animation, and particle effects.
- **Collision Systems**: Developers discussed methods for handling collisions with custom .glb files, recommending the Hyperfy Blender addon for collision setup.
- **Raycasting & Camera Controls**: Code examples were shared for implementing raycasting from camera and third-person controls, with specific focus on ignoring self-collisions.
- **In-World Development**: Ricky demonstrated a prototype for editing scripts directly in-world with hot reloading, sparking discussion about creating development interfaces that modify code without requiring page refreshes.
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Multiple developers shared Cursor/Claude configurations for better code generation, with discussion about creating an official LLM prompt guide.

### 3D Design & Optimization
- **Model Optimization**: A shared 3D arm model was critiqued for inefficiency, with the community identifying excessive polygon count (10k triangles in sleeve ripples) and poor texture space utilization in a 2K texture map.
- **File Size Concerns**: The 140kb arm model was deemed too large, with suggestions to optimize both geometry and textures.

### Platform & Ecosystem
- **Platform Launch Status**: Hyperfy is approaching launch to open access to non-developers, currently spreading through word-of-mouth among developers.
- **Hyper Token**: Market discussions tracked Hyperfy (HYPER/SOL) price movements, showing resilience despite broader market downturns. Market cap fluctuated between approximately 6.2M and 7.1M SOL.
- **Upcoming Tutorials**: Mention of an upcoming tutorial session about the .hyp app format, Hypkg (a mod manager), and App Rollup for external Hyp development.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I handle collisions with custom .glb files?** (mooshu meezy)  
A: Use the Hyperfy Blender addon which handles collision setup. (Saori)

**Q: How do I alter the landscape in Hyperfy?** (mooshu meezy)  
A: Make your entire playable landscape in Blender and bring it in. (MayD524)

**Q: How do I handle water/ocean physics in Hyperfy?** (mooshu meezy)  
A: Use UV scrolling for the material, move the water mesh up and down with the tide, add sound effects and water particle effects. (~/HowiEDuhzit)

**Q: How do animations work with custom avatars?** (mooshu meezy)  
A: Hyperfy uses VRM format for avatars, not regular animated GLB files yet. (Saori)

**Q: How do I ignore myself when raycasting?** (Saori)  
A: Use collision layers or start raycasting from a different point away from the player. (Shiffty)

**Q: Can we load models from a URL?** (devilsadvocate.sol)  
A: Not directly from the inspect pane, but potentially through scripts. (Omka)

**Q: Is there any way I can play video in the scene?** (McCoder)  
A: Not yet, at least not officially. (MayD524)

**Q: Are you guys doing outreach or is the product not ready yet?** (zobo)  
A: This is a multi-sided market. Right now devs are having fun and people are learning about this via word of mouth. Our platform is getting closer to launch which will open it up to non-devs. (Ashxn)

**Q: Will we get ships in the pvp game?** (johan)  
A: Nope it's weapon based, eg swords, consumables etc. (Ashxn)

**Q: Would that mean you can't play pvp if you don't have hyper?** (bear)  
A: Need hyper to play. (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Saori helped mooshu meezy** understand how to use Hyperfy for game development by explaining VRM avatar format, scripting workflow, and providing documentation links.

- **~/HowiEDuhzit helped mooshu meezy** create water/ocean effects in Hyperfy with a detailed explanation of UV scrolling technique for water animation.

- **Ashxn helped Saori** with raycasting from camera to gun direction by providing code snippets showing how to get camera direction and origin from player bone.

- **MayD524 helped mooshu meezy** create an ocean in Hyperfy by implementing and demonstrating a working ocean solution.

- **Shiffty helped the community** by sharing a UI scrolling plane example with code for UV scrolling implementation.

- **Omka helped the community** by sharing a configurable UI billboard with settings in the inspect pane.

- **devilsadvocate.sol helped the community** by creating a search endpoint for finding .hyp files by keyword.

- **Ricky helped the community** by demonstrating a working prototype for editing scripts directly in-world with hot reloading.

- **ùöüùöòùö°ùöüùöíùöéùöóùöóùöé helped Ashxn** analyze why an arm model was inefficient by sharing images of the model and texture, noting ripples are baked into textures but texture space is poorly utilized.

- **Saori helped N1Kingz/HCK1** set up AI agents for social media platforms by providing links to Eliza app marketplace and GitHub repository with necessary changes.

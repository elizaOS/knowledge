# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Implementation
- **Hyperfy v0.9.0** was released (announced by ash)
- **PVP Game Development**: Ashxn mentioned they're building a high-risk PVP game internally to showcase Hyperfy technology, requiring Hyper tokens to play with rewards from kills going back to Hyper
- **Developer Tooling**: ~/MayD524/Hyperfy shared GitHub repositories for HypTool and App-Rollup with precompiled binaries, plus a modified hypkg enabling raw THREE.js, WASM, globalThis, and CSS3D functionality
- **Physics & Environment**: Significant work on raycasting, physics layers, collision detection, and environment manipulation including ocean water effects
- **In-world Editing**: Ricky demonstrated an in-world chat interface that can edit scripts directly without page refreshes

### Avatar Systems & 3D Models
- **VRM vs Custom GLB**: Extensive debate about the tradeoffs between interoperability and customization, with consensus favoring VRM for its established ecosystem despite limitations
- **3D Model Optimization**: Discussion about an arm model (140kb) being unnecessarily large, with suggestions to improve texture space allocation rather than reducing geometry
- **Runtime Wearables**: Discussions about implementing support for VRM avatars

### App Architecture
- Discussions about app manipulation APIs, loading models from URLs, and third-party plugin systems
- Upcoming tutorial (Episode 4) covering the .hyp app format, Hypkg (a mod manager), and App Rollup for external Hyp development

### Market Conditions
- Users tracked Hyperfy's market capitalization fluctuating between approximately $6.2M and $7.1M during a broader market downturn
- Discussion about Bitcoin dropping below $80k, Solana declining, and speculation about market manipulation

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
- **Q**: How do I handle collisions with custom .glb files? (mooshu meezy)  
  **A**: Use the Hyperfy Blender addon which handles collision setup (Saori)

- **Q**: How do I shoot from the gun's position rather than the camera? (Saori)  
  **A**: Use raycast from the gun in the camera direction and verify line of sight (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do I get started with Hyperfy using Cursor? (mooshu meezy)  
  **A**: Feed it the docs but don't modify core files, use .hyp files as starting points (MetaMike)

- **Q**: How do I alter the landscape in Hyperfy? (mooshu meezy)  
  **A**: Make your entire playable landscape in Blender and import it (MayD524)

- **Q**: How do I create water/ocean effects? (mooshu meezy)  
  **A**: Use UV scrolling for textures, move the mesh position for tides, and add sound effects (~/HowiEDuhzit)

- **Q**: How do I ignore myself when raycasting? (Saori)  
  **A**: Use collision layers (Shiffty)

- **Q**: Is there a way to play video in a scene? (McCoder)  
  **A**: Not yet officially supported (MayD524)

- **Q**: Is it possible to create a host world with the setting menu already integrated? (Zen)  
  **A**: Not available yet, it's from Hyperfy v1 (HypPrivakos and Saori)

### Business & Community
- **Q**: Are you guys doing outreach or is the product not ready yet? (zobo)  
  **A**: Building a multi-sided market, with devs currently having fun and word-of-mouth growth, while the platform is getting closer to launch for non-devs (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Will we get ships in the pvp game? (johan)  
  **A**: No, it's weapon based, e.g. swords, consumables etc (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Would that mean you can't play pvp if you don't have hyper? (bear)  
  **A**: Need hyper to play (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Ocean Implementation**  
   Helper: ~/HowiEDuhzit & MayD524  
   Helpee: mooshu meezy  
   Context: Creating water/ocean effects  
   Resolution: Explained technique using UV scrolling, mesh movement, and sound effects, then implemented and shared a working ocean solution

2. **Shooting Mechanics**  
   Helper: Ashxn  
   Helpee: Saori  
   Context: Shooting from gun position rather than camera  
   Resolution: Provided code snippet to get camera direction but shoot ray from gun position

3. **Raycast Implementation**  
   Helper: Saori  
   Helpee: mattimus  
   Context: Getting cursor pointing position for raycast  
   Resolution: Shared code examples for implementation

4. **3D Model Analysis**  
   Helper: 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎  
   Helpee: Ashxn  
   Context: Analyzing arm model efficiency  
   Resolution: Shared images showing the ripples were texture-based rather than geometry-based, and identified inefficient texture space allocation

5. **In-world Script Editing**  
   Helper: Ricky  
   Helpee: peezy  
   Context: Changing app scripts on the fly  
   Resolution: Shared documentation and demonstration of in-world script editing without page refresh

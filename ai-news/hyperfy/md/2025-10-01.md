# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-01

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Builder Permissions System
The main technical discussion today centered around the builder permissions system in Hyperfy worlds. Currently, builder rights persist when users leave and return to a world, but there's a limitation that permissions can only be revoked when both the admin and the user are simultaneously present in the world. This permission data is stored persistently in world storage.

### Platform Compatibility
A brief clarification confirmed that the legacy world version is still supported for building, which is important for users who aren't familiar with the newer platform or its coding requirements.

### Development Integrations
There was mention of Azure OpenAI endpoint integration, with a user reporting successful local implementation and referencing an existing pull request (#134) addressing this functionality.

### Mobile Experience
A suggestion was raised regarding improving the mobile version's image viewing capabilities, specifically adding zoom functionality for better user experience.

### Community Projects
Community members expressed appreciation for editing work done by others and anticipation for an upcoming "diner" project. A user also shared a link to a world on marble.worldlabs.ai, likely showcasing ongoing development.

### Marketing
There was a brief comment admiring Pandemic Labs' marketing abilities with hopes that Hyperfy will receive similar market attention in the future.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a way to revoke builder rights from players that are not in the world?**

**Q: Do builder rights persist when a player leaves and returns later?**  
A: Yes, builder rights are persistent in the system.

**Q: Are we able to build using the legacy world version still?**  
A: Yes, the legacy version still works for building.

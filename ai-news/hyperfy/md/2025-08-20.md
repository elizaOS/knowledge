# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-20

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### App Architecture & Development Patterns
- **App-Based Organization**: Ash explained that everything in Hyperfy is organized as apps (combinations of GLB models, scripts, and metadata)
- **Recommended Patterns**: For game mechanics like harvestable resources, the suggested approach is creating category-based apps with shared logic rather than individual apps for each asset type
- **Sandboxing**: Confirmation that Hyperfy uses the SES package to create isolated compartments for running user scripts safely

### Technical Solutions
- **Local Development on Quest**: Ash provided a solution for testing networked functionality on Quest devices without SSL certificates using port forwarding via ADB
- **AI-Generated Content**: Ash demonstrated a system for AI-generated networked apps where users could create and edit 3D objects through text commands

### Community Dynamics
- Some tension was evident regarding a former contributor named "saori" and credit for work on "primitives" PRs
- Ash mentioned having improved the primitives implementation to be "100x more performant"
- Community members expressed support for the current project leadership

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can an app spawn a GLB in world space?** (asked by Lastraum)  
A: You can use world.add(mesh) which will remove it from its previous parent. (answered by Ash)

**Q: If I have a table and I want a plate to appear when clicked, how would I implement that?** (asked by Lastraum)  
A: You could make the app's GLB include both table and plate, hide/remove the plate on initialization, and add it back when the table is clicked. (answered by Ash)

**Q: For a game with many resource types and harvestable items, would I need a separate app for each?** (asked by Lastraum)  
A: You could use a single app per category with shared logic and swap visuals, or use individual apps that communicate with a central game manager. (answered by Ash)

**Q: Does the Image Asset only work when live and not when running locally?** (asked by TheMattEmpire)  
A: Local and live environments should behave identically; refreshing the page resolved the issue. (answered by Ash)

**Q: How can I test networked functionality locally on Quest without SSL certificates?** (asked by mrtzhckr)  
A: Use port forwarding with ADB: "adb reverse tcp:3000 tcp:3000" via Meta Quest Developer Hub, then visit localhost:3000 on the Quest. (answered by Ash)

**Q: How does Hyperfy prevent scripts from doing malicious things on servers/clients?** (asked by marcel ðŸŒµ)  
A: Hyperfy uses the SES package for sandboxing, with additional security through admin-only script editing and limited API access. (answered by Shiffty and marcel ðŸŒµ)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **App Architecture Guidance**
   - Helper: Ash
   - Helpee: Lastraum
   - Context: Understanding Hyperfy's app architecture for game development
   - Resolution: Explained different approaches for implementing game mechanics, suggesting category-based apps with shared logic or a game manager pattern

2. **Local Development Troubleshooting**
   - Helper: Ash
   - Helpee: TheMattEmpire
   - Context: Image Asset not updating when running locally
   - Resolution: Suggested refreshing the page, which resolved the issue

3. **Quest Development Setup**
   - Helper: Ash
   - Helpee: mrtzhckr
   - Context: Testing networked functionality on Quest without SSL certificates
   - Resolution: Provided ADB port forwarding command to access local development server from Quest

4. **Security Implementation Explanation**
   - Helper: Shiffty
   - Helpee: marcel ðŸŒµ
   - Context: Understanding how Hyperfy handles script content and security

## Action Items

### Technical
- **Implement category-based apps with shared logic** for similar game elements
  - Description: Group similar game objects into single apps with shared code to avoid duplication
  - Mentioned By: Ash

- **Use game manager pattern for centralized game logic**
  - Description: Create a central app for game state and logic that communicates with other apps via events
  - Mentioned By: Ash

- **Use port forwarding for Quest local development**
  - Description: Use "adb reverse tcp:3000 tcp:3000" to test networked functionality on Quest
  - Mentioned By: Ash

### Feature
- **AI-generated networked apps**
  - Description: System for creating and editing 3D objects through text commands

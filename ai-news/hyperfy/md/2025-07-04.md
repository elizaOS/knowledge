# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

- **Litepaper Plans**: Discussion about integrating cryptoart into Hyperfy as outlined in a Litepaper.
- **Metaverse Philosophy**: Team members emphasized methodical building over rushed marketing, focusing on creating a true interoperable metaverse that requires patience and proper execution rather than rushing to meet market cycles.
- **World-Building**: Conversations about "world-maxxing" and creating a Hyperfy overworld to connect different spaces.

### AI Integration
- **AI Agents**: Possibility of embodied AI agents for live trading in Hyperfy worlds mentioned by team members.
- **Competition Arenas**: Suggestions to use 3D models as arenas for hosting AI agent trading competitions or leaderboards.
- **Visualization Tools**: Need identified for better web dashboards to visualize agent logs.

### 3D Design & Development
- **Documentation Progress**: Mention of in-world documentation development at learn.hyperfy.xyz and plans for an "in-world docs pane."
- **3D Content Creation**: Discussion about creating 3D implementations of 2D content.
- **Model Sharing**: Users sharing and discussing 3D models, with technical observations about UV mapping.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Backend Development & Infrastructure
- **Cloudflare Ecosystem**: General hyper advocated strongly for Cloudflare Workers as a versatile solution for many development tasks, highlighting ease of use, GPT compatibility, and free hosting options. They also recommended using Cloudflare S2 buckets as a CDN for web assets to improve loading performance.
- **Backend Stack**: Discussions centered around Flask/Quart backends integrated with Postgres, Cloudflare, and Redis, noting initial learning curves but reusability benefits.
- **Deployment Approaches**: General hyper mentioned using Quart with Docker on Digital Ocean but finds themselves creating new Cloudflare Workers more frequently than adding routes to existing applications.

### Project Vision & Development Philosophy
- **Litepaper Release**: Ash shared the Hyperfy Litepaper, outlining the project's vision and roadmap for immersive digital spaces.
- **Development Approach**: Team members emphasized methodical building over rushed marketing, with Ashxn mentioning holding 14M unlocked tokens as evidence of team commitment.
- **Community Sentiment**: Discussions revealed tension between investor expectations for near-term price action and the team's focus on long-term product development, with several community members advocating for patience.

### Technical Issues & Improvements
- **Audio Memory Usage**: Clarification that looping audio should only load audio data once rather than reloading for each loop iteration.
- **Asset Download Bug**: Ash confirmed a fix in the development version for an issue where the system was only attempting to load assets from cache.
- **Collaboration Challenges**: 0mka raised concerns about multiple users working on the same world simultaneously, suggesting version control and real-time collaboration features.

### Content Creation & Integration
- **3D Development**: Discussions about creating 3D versions of 2D content and a 3D model created in Blender that could potentially be used as an arena for AI agent trading competitions.
- **Documentation**: Brief mentions of learn.hyperfy.xyz and plans to finish an in-world documentation pane.
- **Cryptoart Integration**: Reneil mentioned plans to integrate cryptoart into Hyperfy as outlined in the Litepaper.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Backend & Development
**Q**: Are you using flask?  
**A**: No direct answer, but hiroP indicated they're working on a similar backend setup.

**Q**: Does audio.play with loop true add up in memory usage?  
**A**: "It should only hold enough memory for the audio once and then loops over it, it doesn't load the binary each time." - ash

### Platform Usage
**Q**: How can I mint/claim a world?  
**A**: "There is no 'Mint' of V2 it's open source. You can check out a Self-Hosted V2 world by checking out the #v2-worlds or #v2-worlds-showcase under the Worlds channel!!" - Agent12

**Q**: Am I crazy, or could someone link me to the # All Hypes Thread?  
**A**: Link provided by maximus

### Project Direction
**Q**: How much hyper do you currently hold?  
**A**: "14M unlocked but haven't claimed" - Ashxn

**Q**: Will hyperfy have its own AI trading agent?  
**A**: "Nothing official but i wouldn't be surprised to see embodied agents live trading in our worlds" - Ashxn

**Q**: What do you build?  
**A**: "We do https://numen.games/ and we help to improve and push Hyperfy engine as much as we can. All we do is Open for all of you to copy and make it better." - PabloFM | Numinia

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Backend Development Guidance**
   - General hyper offered guidance to hiroP on backend development with Flask/Quart, Postgres, Cloudflare, and Redis
   - Offered to share code from public/private repos and recommendations for Cloudflare Workers implementation
   - Suggested using Cloudflare S2 buckets as CDN for better performance of web assets, models, and textures

2. **Platform Navigation Assistance**
   - Agent12 helped OC understand that V2 is open source without a minting process and directed them to relevant channels for self-hosted worlds
   - Maximus provided a direct link to the All Hypes Thread when Agent12 was looking for it

3. **Open Source Contributions**
   - PabloFM from Numinia explained to bpvxduu that they develop numen.games and help improve the Hyperfy engine with open-source contributions

4. **Technical Issue Resolution**
   - Ash helped 0mka understand that a bug with downloading files uploaded via app.configure was fixed in the dev version

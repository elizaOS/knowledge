# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI-Assisted Development
- Developers are experimenting with "vibe coding" - using AI to generate code from natural language prompts for Hyperfy
- Browser-based AI prompting is preferred for simple tasks, while specialized tools like Cursor are used for more complex development
- Developers shared examples of AI-generated 3D environments including obstacle courses, stadiums, and platform games
- The recommended approach for complex scenes is building them iteratively (section by section)
- Some limitations were noted with AI handling rotated objects like angled stadiums

### Performance & Optimization
- Significant performance improvements have been implemented, particularly with shape instancing
- The platform now runs well even on older mobile devices (Samsung S9) after recent optimizations
- Discussions about responsive design and detecting mobile devices for UI adjustments

### Community Projects
- Mentions of Burning Man experiences being created in Hyperfy
- References to previous implementations on OnCyber platform
- User @213767993153290250 has created a "pretty sweet burning man world" in Hyperfy

### Technical Issues
- Reports of edit gizmos not being visible or selectable in development branch b7ca8f9169
- Some errors with AI-generated code containing non-existent properties

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I access the AI prim builder?**  
A: You need to be on the latest dev branch and prompt AI to get code (MetaMike, Valiant)

**Q: What is the forward/up jump distance for avatars?**  
A: Jump height is ~1.5m and jump distance while running is around 5m (Ashxn)

**Q: Is there a way to detect mobile for resizing UI?**  
A: control.screen.width and control.screen.height exist, and world.device.isTouch will be added soon (Ashxn)

**Q: How do I make edit gizmos appear?**  
A: You have to press 1, 2, 3 to get them to appear (maximus)

**Q: Has anyone created a Burning Man experience in Hyperfy?**  
A: User @213767993153290250 "has a pretty sweet burning man world somewhere in hyperfy" (Ashxn)

**Q: When will this project be done?**  
A: "When fortnite is done" (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **AI Code Troubleshooting**
   - Ashxn helped maximus identify hallucinated code with a non-existent player.velocity property
   - Suggested commenting out the problematic lines to fix the error

2. **Complex Scene Building**
   - MetaMike advised maximus on building complex scenes with AI by developing them section by section
   - Explained the approach of building field, sidelines, bleachers, etc. separately

3. **UI Responsiveness**
   - Ashxn assisted Lastraum with accessing screen dimensions for responsive design
   - Acknowledged a bug with control.screen properties and promised to fix the implementation

4. **Edit Gizmo Issues**
   - Maximus suggested key combinations to Enryt for making edit gizmos appear
   - Though the solution didn't fully resolve the deeper issue of gizmos not being selectable

## Action Items

### Technical
- Fix bug with control.screen properties causing TypeError (Mentioned by Lastraum)
- Investigate why edit gizmos cannot be selected in dev branch b7ca8f9169 (Mentioned by Enryt)
- Improve AI prompting for handling rotated objects (Mentioned by Shiffty)
- Explore compatibility with GLB files for 3D models like CloneX (Mentioned by Enryt)

### Feature
- Add world.device.isTouch property for detecting touch devices (Mentioned by Ashxn)
- Create a Burning Man-inspired experience in Hyperfy similar to previous OnCyber implementation (Mentioned by Fibelius)

### Documentation
- Document jump height (~1.5m) and distance (~5m) parameters for game development (Mentioned by Ashxn)

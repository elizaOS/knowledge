# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI-Assisted Development
- Users experimented with "vibe coding" - using AI to generate code for games and interactive 3D elements in Hyperfy
- Several members shared examples of AI-generated platform games, stadiums, and obstacle courses
- Developers compared browser-based AI prompting versus code-specific tools like Cursor/Claude
  - Browser-based prompting was found to be faster for simple tasks
- An iterative approach was discussed for building complex structures by generating code section by section
- Challenges were noted with AI hallucinating non-existent methods (like player.velocity.y)

### Technical Discussions
- A potential memory leak was identified in certain code implementations
- Performance improvements for shape instancing were mentioned
- Discussion about detecting mobile devices for responsive UI design occurred
- A bug was identified with the control.screen functionality

### Metaverse Experiences
- Fibelius shared reflections about a Burning Man metaverse experience on OnCyber platform
- They described it as their "biggest metaverse experience ever" and expressed hope for similar concepts in Hyperfy
- Links to related content were shared

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I access the AI prim builder?** (asked by maximus)  
**A:** You need to be on the latest dev branch and prompt AI to get code (answered by MetaMike and Valiant)

**Q: What is the forward/up jump distance for avatars?** (asked by Valiant)  
**A:** Jump height is ~1.5m and jump distance while running is around 5m (guessing) (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Is there a way to detect mobile for resizing UI?** (asked by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz)  
**A:** control.screen.width and control.screen.height exist. Will add world.device.isTouch soon (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: When will this project be done?** (asked by Zdeff)  
**A:** When fortnite is done (answered by Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **AI Code Debugging**
   - **Helper:** Ashxn
   - **Helpee:** maximus
   - **Context:** AI-generated code with hallucinated methods
   - **Resolution:** Identified that .velocity doesn't exist and suggested commenting out those 3 lines to make it run

2. **Mobile Detection Error**
   - **Helper:** Ashxn
   - **Helpee:** Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz
   - **Context:** Error when trying to use control.screen for mobile detection
   - **Resolution:** Acknowledged it's a bug that needs fixing, promised to check and fix it

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-24

**Date: September 24, 2025**

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) Integration
- hiroP shared a GitHub repository called "splat-transform" that enables generating 3DGS models through AI prompting
- mrtzhckr confirmed successful testing by using GPT-5 in Cursor to generate Gaussian splats
- The generated splats were successfully imported into Hyperfy using mrtzhckr's fork
- Generation process takes 1-2 minutes depending on complexity
- Both users expressed excitement about the SOG export feature in the shared repository

### AI Generation in Hyperfy
- Discussion about the rapid evolution of splatting technology
- Potential for creating a unified generator system in Hyperfy for various media types:
  - 3D models
  - Gaussian splats
  - Images/videos
  - Sound
- This system could enhance VR worldbuilding with speech input
- Gert-Jan Akerboom expressed enthusiasm about manipulating AI-generated objects and making them generative

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How long does generating 3DGS using GPT-5 in Cursor take?**  
A: 1-2 minutes depending on complexity (answered by mrtzhckr)

**Q: What is the workflow for creating prompted gaussians?**  
A: Generating 3DGS using the CLI repo with GPT-5 in Cursor and importing into Hyperfy using mrtzhckr's fork (answered by mrtzhckr)

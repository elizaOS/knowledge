# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Gaussian Splatting Technology
- hiroP shared a GitHub repository (splat-transform) enabling 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) generation
- mrtzhckr confirmed successful experiments using GPT-5 in Cursor to generate 3DGS content
- Generation process takes 1-2 minutes depending on complexity
- Discussion about potential for a unified generator system in Hyperfy for various media types

### Procedural Environment Generation
- Gert-Jan Akerboom described a technique for "painting" forests similar to weight painting in Blender
- Dhin implemented a forest with trees that raycast to ground level, accommodating hills and terrain
- Performance concerns noted with framerate drops despite using lightweight assets
- UI implementation that appears when a player is within 10 meters highlighted as useful

### Infrastructure & Hosting
- LiveKit pricing structure has been updated with base price now at $50/month
- HypPrivakos reported running a single LiveKit instance for all their worlds on a $6/month VPS
- Self-hosting LiveKit appears viable for smaller deployments
- HypPrivakos offered free LiveKit server access to community members

### Technical Fixes
- ash fixed a disconnection issue in the latest dev version by adjusting the ping-pong timer
- The fix accommodates large world snapshots that were causing immediate disconnections

### Community Organization
- New "worlds" channel created specifically for V2 worlds, distinguishing from existing V1 worlds collection

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does naming things in blender like $Object have an effect in world?**  
A: It shouldn't have any effect at all. Behavior is all through custom properties, names are just used to get references. (ash)

**Q: Can skinned meshes have LOD0, if so how?**  
A: Yeah they should work the same way. Add your skinned mesh as children to a LOD group. (ash)

**Q: How long is the gen taking in cursor (roughly)?**  
A: 1-2 min depending on complexity (mrtzhckr)

**Q: Are those trees auto raycasting down?**  
A: Yes they are (Dhin)

**Q: What is LiveKit's new pricing structure?**  
A: Base price is now $50/month, and they updated their free limits (ash)

**Q: Is self-hosting LiveKit viable?**  
A: Yes, HypPrivakos is running a single instance on a $6/month VPS for all their worlds (HypPrivakos)

**Q: At what scale would managed LiveKit be better than self-hosting?**  
A: At scale with >50 active worlds, it would be better to have LiveKit manage it (ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Gaussian Splatting Implementation**:  
  hiroP shared resources for 3DGS generation, which mrtzhckr successfully tested using GPT-5 in Cursor and imported into Hyperfy

- **Disconnection Issue Resolution**:  
  ash addressed community concerns about users disconnecting immediately when entering some worlds by fixing the ping-pong timer in the latest dev version

- **Forest Generation Techniques**:  
  Gert-Jan Akerboom shared forest "painting" implementation that inspired Dhin's coin UI implementation

- **LiveKit Hosting Solutions**:  
  HypPrivakos offered free LiveKit server access to community members experiencing usage limit issues and shared experience running LiveKit on an affordable VPS

## Action Items

### Technical
- **Implement Gaussian Splatting in Hyperfy** (mentioned by hiroP)  
  Integration of 3DGS technology into the Hyperfy platform
  
- **Test the fixed disconnection issue in latest dev** (mentioned by ash)  
  Verify the ping-pong timer adjustment resolves the immediate disconnection problem
  
- **Investigate performance issues with plant/tree objects** (mentioned by Gert-Jan Akerboom)  
  Address framerate drops to 30-40 FPS when using vegetation elements
  
- **Consider self-hosting LiveKit as a cost-effective alternative** (mentioned by HypPrivakos)  
  Evaluate running LiveKit on a low-cost VPS similar to HypPrivakos' setup
  
- **Plan for distributed HA system for LiveKit** (mentioned by HypPrivakos)  
  Prepare to move to a high-availability setup when usage increases

### Feature
- **Create a unified generator system for multiple media types** (mentioned by mrtzhckr)  
  Implement "/create" commands for models, splats, images/videos, and sounds
  
- **Implement seasonal changes for forest elements** (mentioned by Dhin)  
  Add dynamic seasonal variations to procedurally generated forests
  
- **Create a system to "paint" forests across landscapes** (mentioned by Gert-Jan Akerboom)  
  Develop tools for controlled placement of vegetation
  
- **Evaluate LiveKit usage limits and potential changes needed** (mentioned by .hyp shaman)  
  Review what it takes to hit LiveKit limits and consider necessary adjustments

### Documentation
- **Maintain V2-only worlds in the newly created worlds channel** (mentioned by Gert-Jan Akerboom)  
  Ensure proper organization of world links in the appropriate channels

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-01

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Updates
- **Docker Optimization**: HPrivakos explained the benefits of using Alpine-based images over Debian, reducing size by 1GB and saving ~15 cents per month per instance. Pre-built Docker images are available at `ghcr.io/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy` with tags for dev, main, and version releases.
- **V1 to V2 Transition**: Team members discussed the platform's evolution, highlighting that V2 offers performance improvements and a less limiting SDK, making it easier for developers to iterate and create custom tools.
- **Game Mechanics Development**: Several developers shared progress on advanced features, particularly drdoge.eth's work on a jet flight system with weapons, camera angles, and spatial audio.
- **UI Development**: A fix was implemented for a black screen bug when clicking the ⚡ button, caused by an incorrect "this.world" reference.
- **Networking APIs**: Discussions clarified the differences between app.emit(), world.on(), app.on(), and app.send() methods for event handling in the platform.

### Platform Strategy & Business Model
- **Long-term Vision**: Saori mentioned that Hyperfy's strategy is to "flip Roblox," indicating ambitious platform goals.
- **Token Economics**: Discussions about the HYPER token revealed it provides "a few years runway" for development, with plans for a marketplace that will generate revenue.
- **Development Focus**: The team emphasized they're building out platform capabilities and tools before pushing for wider adoption.

### 3D Design & Technical Constraints
- **Lighting Discussions**: Debate about using dynamic lights versus baked lighting, with developers explaining that while enabling lights is technically feasible, it's restricted due to performance concerns.
- **Material Optimization**: Tips shared for version 4.3, specifically regarding transparency overlap settings and switching from dithered to blended modes for better rendering.

### Community Building
- **Self-hosting Options**: Discussions about Coolify, CasaOS, and Umbrel for hosting Hyperfy instances.
- **Component Sharing**: Developers actively shared reusable components like an attachable anchor system that allows swapping GLB models.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Platform Development**
- Q: How are you going to showcase the tech? Partnerships? Cities? Games? What is the end game?
  A: The team is focused on building the platform and tools, with a marketplace planned around the token. (Saori)

- Q: Is the project just building out the rails and leaving it up to the general public to build?
  A: Yes, the focus is on building tools and infrastructure for others to use. (bear and Saori)

- Q: How does the Hyper coin sustain development?
  A: It gave the team a few years runway to build full time, and they're creating a marketplace around it for revenue. (Saori)

**Technical Implementation**
- Q: Why use Alpine instead of Debian for Docker images?
  A: The Debian node image adds an unnecessary 1GB to the Docker image, costing ~15 cents per month per instance and requiring larger downloads. (HPrivakos)

- Q: What does the commit_hash environment variable do?
  A: It's used for the /status endpoint to show which version a server is running. (HPrivakos)

- Q: What's the difference between app.emit(), world.on(), app.on(), and app.send()?
  A: app.emit() sends events to the world, world.on() listens for world events, app.on() listens for app-specific events, app.send() sends events to the same app on other clients/server. (Ashxn)

- Q: Can we have lights instead of baking everything?
  A: It's not hard to enable lights, but there are downstream performance issues when people place too many lights. Amazing spaces can be created without baking. (Ashxn)

**Asset Management**
- Q: How can I access default player emote GLBs in code for NPCs?
  A: Use the correct asset URL, e.g., asset://emote-float.glb. (Ashxn)

- Q: Is there an easy way to bring images into V2 like in V1?
  A: Not yet directly, but you can texture a plane in Blender or use the undocumented UIImage component. (Ashxn)

- Q: What's the shortcut to see all items in a world?
  A: Click the Hyperfy logo in the corner next to the chat/gear icon. (MayD524)

- Q: How do I drop an item after picking it up?
  A: Press Q. (Ashxn)

**Token Economics**
- Q: What is the alternative to a "rug" and how are coin creators supposed to profit?
  A: They're not supposed to profit until vesting terms end. Real tokens come with vesting. (Saori)

- Q: What does the "good ending" look like for token creators?
  A: Once vesting happens, you can sell, similar to how startups work with equity. (Saori)

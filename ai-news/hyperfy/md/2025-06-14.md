# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Implementations
- **Lightmap Integration**: Ashxn shared detailed code for handling lightmaps in Three.js when importing GLTF models with the Needle engine extension, addressing UV mapping issues for objects with multiple materials. Single-material objects render correctly, but wall/floor meshes with multiple materials still have issues. The implementation includes custom shader modifications for lightmap scale offsets and RGBM encoding.

- **Web3 Integration**: Lastraum announced integrating Privy into "The Forge" to simplify user connections from Hyperfy without requiring web3 wallets, making the platform more accessible.

### Platform Features & Capabilities
- **Collaborative Building**: Hyperfy allows for real-time collaborative world building with persistent changes, unlike Roblox's offline building approach. Users can build worlds together, including scripting functionality.

- **Open Source Nature**: Clarification that Hyperfy is completely open source, including the engine, editor, and ecosystem tooling, distinguishing it from platforms with proprietary components.

### Token Utility Proposals
- **Stake-to-Host Model**: A proposal suggested implementing a system where users could stake HYPER tokens (e.g., 30,000 tokens locked for 1 year) to receive free hosting services, providing practical utility for the token.

- **HYPER-Only Marketplace**: Suggestion to create an asset marketplace that exclusively accepts HYPER tokens for transactions, potentially reducing token supply through burns or redistribution.

### File Management
- Discussion about managing .hyp files, with users seeking ways to combine multiple files into a single download for easier sharing and organization.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a way to select multiple .hyp files and download them as a single .hyp file?**  
A: You can either download individual apps, or all apps together by zipping up your `world` folder. Alternatively, use Blender with empty objects to organize seat applications. (Answered by Ashxn and 0mka)

**Q: Will Hyperfy offer hosting as a part of the solution in the future?**  
A: "All I can say currently is that people won't need to worry about hosting." (Answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How much of the project is open source?**  
A: "Everything is completely open source, the engine, the editor, and any ecosystem tooling we'll be releasing along the way." (Answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How can we make it easier for people to connect from Hyperfy without web3 wallets?**  
A: By integrating Privy into The Forge (Answered by Lastraum)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Lightmap Implementation Help**:
   Ashxn shared detailed code implementation with custom shader modifications for handling lightmaps in Three.js, helping the community understand how to properly implement this technical feature.

2. **File Management Solutions**:
   - Ashxn suggested downloading all apps together by zipping up the "world" folder when Cayden0207 asked about combining multiple .hyp files.
   - 0mka provided an alternative approach using Blender with empty objects to organize seat applications, even sharing a GLB file example.

3. **Platform Comparisons**:
   Ashxn helped Jayzen understand how Hyperfy differs from Roblox by explaining the real-time collaborative building capabilities with persistence.

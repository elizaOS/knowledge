# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Implementations
- **Lightmap Rendering**: Ashxn shared detailed code for handling lightmaps in Three.js when importing GLTF models with the Needle engine extension, addressing issues with meshes that have multiple materials being split during import and causing UV mapping problems.
- **Web3 Integration**: Lastraum announced integrating Privy into "The Forge" to simplify user connections from Hyperfy without requiring web3 wallets.
- **File Management**: Discussion about combining multiple .hyp files, with solutions including downloading individual apps or zipping the "world" folder to get all apps together.

### Token Economics & Platform Architecture
- **Staking Proposal**: Community members discussed a staking-for-hosting mechanism where users could stake 30,000 HYPER tokens for a year to receive free basic hosting.
- **Open Source Confirmation**: Ashxn clarified that Hyperfy is completely open source, including the engine, editor, and ecosystem tooling.
- **Collaborative Building**: Unlike Roblox's offline proprietary editor, Hyperfy offers real-time collaboration with persistent changes, allowing for collaborative building and scripting.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical
- **Q**: Is there a way to select multiple .hyp files and download them as a single file? Like I want to download my conference hall with all the chairs together.
  **A**: You can either download individual apps, or all apps together by zipping up your `world` folder. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Why are UV mappings incorrect for wall/floor meshes with multiple materials?
  **A**: Because when imported via GLTFLoader, single meshes with multiple materials are split into multiple meshes with the MeshRenderer on the parent. (Ashxn)

### Platform & Ecosystem
- **Q**: Will Hyperfy offer hosting as a part of the solution in the future?
  **A**: "All I can say currently is that people won't need to worry about hosting." (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How much of the project is open source?
  **A**: "Everything is completely open source, the engine, the editor, and any ecosystem tooling we'll be releasing along the way." (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Can you build and modify assets directly in Hyperfy like you can do in Roblox?
  **A**: "Hyperfy is much more flexible than Roblox. In Hyperfy you build worlds in realtime with others, including scripting and everything is persistent." (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How can we make it easier for people to connect from Hyperfy without web3 wallets?
  **A**: By integrating Privy into The Forge. (Lastraum)

## Community Help & Collaboration

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### 3D Rendering & Lightmapping
- **Needle Lightmaps Integration**: Ashxn shared code for integrating Needle lightmaps with Three.js, demonstrating how to extract and apply lightmap data from GLTF files
- **Efficient Lightmapping**: MetaRick showcased examples of scenes using a single lightmap across multiple objects for improved efficiency
- **Technical Implementation**: The shared code handles texture extraction, material modification, and shader customization for properly displaying lightmapped scenes
- **Geometry Nodes**: Brief discussion about Blender geometry nodes and their exportability limitations to GLTF format

### Platform Development
- **Privy Integration**: Lastraum mentioned integrating Privy into The Forge to simplify user connections without requiring web3 wallets
- **Open Source Confirmation**: Ashxn clarified that Hyperfy is completely open source, including the engine, editor, and ecosystem tooling
- **Collaborative Building**: The platform allows for real-time collaborative world building with persistent changes, differentiating it from Roblox's offline approach

### HYPER Token Utility
- **Stake-to-Host Model**: Community members proposed a system where users could stake HYPER tokens to receive free hosting services
- **Asset Marketplace**: Suggestions for creating a marketplace exclusively accepting HYPER tokens for transactions
- **Token Distribution**: Ashxn provided information about token distribution: ~10% consists of unclaimed airdrops (essentially burnt), 15% is linearly vested over 3 years, and 30% is currently inactive DAO allocation

### Content Creation & Management
- **Multiple .hyp Files**: Discussion about downloading and managing multiple .hyp files in Hyperfy, particularly for complex scenes like conference halls with chairs
- **2D to 3D Generation**: MetaRick shared information about Tencent Hunyuan's tool that converts 2D images to 3D models, with different versions for 3D printing and game assets

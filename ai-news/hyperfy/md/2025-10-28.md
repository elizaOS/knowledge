# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-28

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Custom Component Development
- **Video_Enhanced.hyp**: 3rdEyeVisuals developed an enhanced version of the standard Video.hyp with additional shape options including circle, oval, and plans for rounded rectangle displays. The component supports .m3u8 URL fields and includes black bars for 16:9 ratios.
- **Implementation Details**: The oval shape uses the circle mesh with unlocked width/height fields rather than a dedicated oval mesh due to rotation challenges.
- **Technical Issues**: Several minor issues were identified including an unnecessary oval shape in the GLB file, mesh orientation problems, and a potential "lit" toggle behavior issue.

### Blender Integration & Tools
- **Blender Add-on**: Gert-Jan Akerboom is developing a Blender add-on that allows exporting Blender objects to Hyperworld primitives.
- **Bidirectional Conversion**: Plans include support for converting Hyperworld code back into Blender objects.
- **Feature Support**: The tool will support collision toggles and trigger zones.

### Advanced THREE.js Techniques
- **Direct THREE.js Access**: 3rdEyeVisuals shared experiments with direct THREE.js access as a "super user," enabling capabilities beyond the standard primitive system.
- **Portal Effects**: Demonstrated techniques for creating portal/Tardis-like effects where spaces are only visible when inside specific volumes.

### Game Development
- **Dragon Shooting Game**: Gert-Jan announced a dragon shooting game with climbing mechanics and invited community testing.

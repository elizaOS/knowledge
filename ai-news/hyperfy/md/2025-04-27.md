# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-27

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Builder Interface Redesign**: Ashxn shared mockups for a redesigned interface that separates regular player views from builder views, with a more intuitive tab-based organization including dedicated sections for world settings, documentation, app management, and app configuration.
- **App State Preservation**: A new "keepActive" option was discussed that allows apps to remain live while being moved, maintaining their state, scale, and configuration instead of resetting to the original unscripted state.
- **Development Approach Debate**: Tension emerged between immediate UI improvements and more extensive refactoring, with Ashxn preferring focused problem-solving commits while 0mka advocated for broader reorganization of components, hooks, and utilities.

### World Structure & Version Control
- **Git-Friendly Structure**: Proposals for improving the world folder structure to be more git-friendly and AI-compatible, with better organization of blueprints, scripts, and assets using manifests to map human-readable assets to hashed files.
- **External Editing Limitations**: Current limitations were discussed regarding editing world code via external editors, as the world folder is currently an engine/artifact format not meant for manual changes.

### Community Feature Requests
- **"Hype Dreams"**: Community members shared desired features including:
  - An object importer that reads blockchain wallets to bring objects into worlds without granting builder permissions
  - "Engage-MINT Systems" allowing interactable objects to add value through token minting
  - Enhanced Summon App with hittable/destroyable objects and different skins for throwable items
  - A "100 men vs 1 gorilla" simulation game concept

### 3D Design Tools
- New tools from the creators of tripoSG were mentioned, including a rigging tool
- A VRM addon created by HowieDuhzit is currently under review (for approximately 2 weeks)

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it possible to keep an app "live" while it's being moved?**  
A: Yes, with the new keepActive option that's being implemented (Ashxn)

**Q: Does keepActive solve keeping the scale size of something when you are moving it?**  
A: Yes (Ashxn)

**Q: How can I add code via an external editor and have it show up in the app menu?**  
A: The world folder is an engine/artifact format not meant for manual changes; currently you need to use the in-world editor (Ashxn)

**Q: If there was one hype you wanted for a world you are building in, what would it be?**  
A: An object importer that can read a person's blockchain wallet or data source to bring objects/hypes into the world without giving builder permissions (maximus)

**Q: What do you mean by 'hittable objects'?**  
A: Objects that can be hit and destroyed by thrown items from the app (Agent12)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **UI/UX Redesign Collaboration**: Ashxn shared Figma mockups and offered to implement the core UI changes while 0mka could work on new tabs like docs and palettes
- **Feature Explanation**: Maximus provided a detailed explanation of how an object importer that reads blockchain wallets could work, with use cases for vehicle mounts and trading card games
- **Concept Clarification**: Agent12 explained the concept of "hittable objects" as elements that can be destroyed by thrown items, with examples like barrels, targets, and moving objects

## Action Items

### Technical

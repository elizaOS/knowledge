# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-27

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Builder Interface Redesign**: Ashxn shared mockups for a redesigned UI that separates regular player views from builder views, using a more intuitive tab-based organization
- **New Menu Structure**: Proposed design includes main menu sections for world settings, documentation, app management, and a cleaner app inspection interface
- **Dedicated Tabs**: New interface would feature specific tabs for properties, scripts, nodes, and metadata
- Implementation approaches were debated between 0mka (suggesting additional codebase refactoring) and Ashxn (preferring to focus on UI reorganization)

### Development Workflow Enhancements
- **keepActive Option**: New feature allowing apps to remain live while being moved, maintaining their script-driven state, scale, and rotation during repositioning
- **World Folder Structure**: Discussion about potential new file structure that would make assets more git-friendly and AI-friendly
- **Blueprint System**: Proposed system with blueprints/manifests pointing to models, scripts, and assets
- Current limitations of manually editing files in the world folder versus using the in-world editor were discussed

### Community Feature Requests
- **Object Importer**: Maximus described a feature that would allow users to bring items from blockchain wallets or external data sources into worlds without gaining builder permissions
- **Engage-MINT Systems**: Agent12 proposed systems that would add value to interactable objects, enabling rogue-like growth games where interactions mint tokens on a curve
- **Enhanced Summon App**: Suggestions for "hittable objects" or different "skins" for throwable items
- **3D Design Tools**: Peezy shared that the creators of tripoSG have released new tools, including one for rigging

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does the keepActive option solve keeping the scale size of something when you are moving it?**  
A: Yes (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Is there a way to add code via IDE rather than in-world?**  
A: This is something we've been discussing because we all want version control of some kind (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Can I edit the code snippets with the IDE or is it advised to do so in-world?**  
A: You can keep your own format in vscode etc and version control that, but you'd be copying pasting back and forth (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What do you think about pros and cons of folder per app versus scripts/assets/blueprints structure?**  
A: The blueprint is essentially just a manifest pointing to a model, script and prop assets (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What do you mean 'hittable objects'?**  
A: Objects that can be thrown to hit and destroy other objects, with the app providing them when set down (answered by Agent12)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **External Editor Workflow**
   - Helper: Ashxn
   - Helpee: JollyGrin
   - Context: JollyGrin was trying to add code via external editor and have it show up in the app menu
   - Resolution: Ashxn explained that the world folder is an engine/artifact format not meant to be manually changed, and that drag-and-drop is the current workflow

2. **keepActive Feature Explanation**
   - Helper: Ashxn
   - Helpee: 0mka
   - Context: 0mka asked if keepActive option maintains scale during movement
   - Resolution: Ashxn confirmed it does maintain scale when moving objects

3. **Hittable Objects Clarification**
   - Helper: 0mka
   - Helpee: Agent12
   - Context: Clarifying what Agent12 meant by "hittable objects"
   - Resolution: Agent12 explained they meant throwable objects that can destroy other objects when the app is set down

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-19

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Tools & Techniques
- **DeepWiki for Hyperfy Development**: hiroP shared that indexing Hyperfy on DeepWiki is more token-friendly than using a mega-prompt with the entire repo. Ashxn confirmed this works well for making apps, especially for non-coders, though it occasionally hallucinates functions not in the codebase.
- **Animated WebP Support**: Users discovered that animated WebP files work in the Hyperfy platform, generating excitement about potential applications. The optimal image size for .hyp metadata images was identified as 400x400 pixels, with WebP being preferred for its superior compression.

### New Applications & Features
- **UI Toggle Button**: Gert-Jan Akerboom developed a new .hyp app that can handle up to 14 links (download or web) with dynamic adjustment capabilities, available from the "Awesome-Hyps" collection.
- **Toggle Configuration Request**: 0mka suggested adding a configuration option (`ignoreToggleKey: true`) to disable the toggle controlling apps instead of requiring source code modifications.

### Project Status & Community
- **HYPER Token Concerns**: Several users expressed concern about the HYPER token's price decline, with requests for more information about tokenomics and project direction.
- **Security Warning**: A warning was shared about a hacked Twitter account that might be promoting scam tokens.
- **Event Planning**: Promotional materials were being prepared for a "proxim8 / project89 party" including image formatting for Discord events.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I use DeepWiki with Hyperfy development?**  
A: Use DeepWiki to ask questions about Hyperfy, then copy responses into an LLM assistant with context about your understanding of Hyperfy's approach. (hiroP)

**Q: Is there a .lookAt function in Hyperfy?**  
A: No, but the AI can fix its approach once informed about the missing function. (Ashxn)

**Q: Where/when would the image you can add to a .hyp's metadata be visible?**  
A: In Hyperfy there is a little + icon where you can see the image in the metadata. The "awesome-hyps" collection makes it easy for world hosts/builders to add hyps to the add section. Marketplaces can also read this information, and PCs might use the image as a thumbnail. (᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/ and Ashxn)

**Q: Could animated WebP files be used as particles?**  
A: "I haven't tried. My guess is they don't animate on particles? Maybe just first frame." (Ashxn)

**Q: Need tokenomics or a concept of a plan to keep moving forward?**  
A: "more patience" (𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-19

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Tools & Techniques
- **DeepWiki Integration**: hiroP shared that Hyperfy is now indexed on DeepWiki, enabling more efficient development workflows. This approach allows for targeted queries about Hyperfy functionality that are more token-efficient than using entire repository prompts.
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Discussion around using DeepWiki with LLM assistants for Hyperfy app development. Ashxn confirmed this was an effective method, calling it "probably the simplest way to make apps with AI" especially for those new to coding, though noting it occasionally hallucinates functions not in the codebase.
- **Version Control**: 0mka briefly mentioned that "in world version control" had been solved for components coming from repository URLs, though specific details weren't provided.

### New Tools & Features
- **UI Toggle Button App**: Gert-Jan Akerboom shared a new .hyp app featuring a screen UI toggle button that can dynamically display up to 14 customizable links (for downloads or websites). This tool allows world creators to provide direct download links to visitors and is available for download from the "play world."

### Community Activities
- Brief coordination around promotional materials for an upcoming Proxim8/Project89 event.
- Casual morning greetings exchanged in the general channel.

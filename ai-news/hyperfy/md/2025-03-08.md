# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Framework & Systems
- **Elemental Framework**: Ashxn is developing "Elemental" (previously "Lootify"), a modular framework for inventory management, combat, and item interactions. The system includes action bars, backpacks, item persistence, health management, and shop functionality.
- **World State Persistence**: Developers discussed using `world.get()` and `world.set()` on the server side for persisting app state to the database.
- **UI Improvements**: New 2D UI nodes are available for creating interfaces, with discussions about absolute positioning for cooldown indicators and pointer event accuracy.

### Combat & Interaction Mechanics
- **Combat Systems**: Several developers shared progress on combat systems, including raybeam implementation for targeting, player push mechanics for launchers, and damage pads.
- **Animation Blending**: Discussion about implementing lower body animation blending for emotes, similar to how it worked in v1 with base locomotion emotes.
- **Player Direction**: Implementation of player direction properties derived from character bone orientation.

### 3D Design & Generation
- **Meshy Tool Experiences**: Users compared experiences with Meshy for 3D generation, discussing pricing models and quality issues with textures.
- **Primitive 3D Shapes**: Interest in ThreeJS geometry primitives for rapid prototyping (similar to "vibe coding" trend).
- **Model Quality**: Character models tend to have better texturing than environmental objects in AI-generated content.

### Platform Features
- **Undo Functionality**: Implementation of undo functionality for terrain/object positioning with up to 50 entries in the undo list.
- **WebXR Support**: WebXR functionality is available in the main branch but reportedly not working on play.hyperfy.xyz.
- **Trading Systems**: Discussion about implementing item trading systems with potential Hyper token integration.

### Community Sentiment
- Platform capabilities are growing, with Saori noting "we rly turned hyperfy into something u can build anything with."
- General excitement about Hyperfy 2.0 and worlds being built on the platform.
- HYPER token price discussions with users checking prices using the "$hyperfy" command.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I implement undo functionality for deleted objects?**  
A: Ashxn implemented basic undo that tracks add/move/remove operations with up to 50 entries in the undo list.

**Q: Can I use UIImage on the onscreen UI?**  
A: Yes, it should be 100% the same as other UI implementations.

**Q: How do you derive direction from a character's chest bone?**  
A: Use a normalized Vector3 with quaternion application:
const forward = new Vector3(0, 0, -1);
const direction = new Vector3().copy(forward).applyQuaternion(objectQuaternion);

**Q: How can I persist state for an App to the database?**  
A: Use world.get(key) and world.set(key, value) on the server side.

**Q: How hard is it to get lower body blending for emotes like in v1?**  
A: V1 had a base locomotion emote with custom emotes on top; if your emote doesn't have leg bones, it'll play walk/run anims for the lower body while showing the custom emote for the upper body.

**Q: Is there a way to generate dimensions of a GLB programmatically?**  
A: Load the GLTF into ThreeJS and get the bounding box; this is used to get avatar height.

**Q: Has anyone come up with the idea of getting a LLM hooked into the app window like copilot?**  
A: Yes, someone implemented this in the first week of launch. It would likely be more effective now with documentation available to feed it.

**Q: What's the best laptop to play hyperfy? Is the new MacBook Air a decent choice?**  
A: Yes, the new MacBook Air would work well.

**Q: Does anyone recommend a cool free svg logo maker?**  
A: recraft.ai was recommended.

**Q: Is the pricing for text-to-3D generation 10 credits per generation in Meshy?**  
A: Pricing may vary; some users have different pricing possibly due to account age or API access with limited features.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Raybeam Implementation**:
   - Ashxn helped ~/HowiEDuhzit with raycast not registering despite raybeam showing
   - Ashxn provided Saori with code snippet using Vector3 and quaternion for deriving direction from a chest bone

2. **UI Development**:
   - Ashxn confirmed to Omka that UIImage works the same way as other UI implementations
   - Saori shared action bar implementation with peezy, providing code and screenshots

3. **State Management**:
   - Saori explained to Cybernetic-O-Cult how to persist app state using world.get() and world.set() on server side

4. **Animation Systems**:
   - Ashxn explained to peezy how v1 handled lower body blending for emotes with base locomotion and custom emotes

5. **3D Design Tools**:
   - Valiant and devilsadvocate.sol compared notes on Meshy texture quality, validating observations about character models having better texture quality than environmental objects

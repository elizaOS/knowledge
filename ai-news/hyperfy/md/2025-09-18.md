# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-18

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Gaussian Splatting Implementation
- **mrtzhckr** introduced a Gaussian Splatting implementation for Hyperfy using Spark.js
- The implementation enables photorealistic 3D rendering via PLY/SPLAT files and works with Three.js
- Several technical challenges were identified including asset cleanup bugs, memory leaks, and race conditions
- **ash** expressed interest in forming a workgroup to develop an optimal approach if there's sufficient community demand

### Security & App Architecture
- Discussion about app isolation in Hyperfy for security purposes
- **ash** explained that apps are isolated to prevent security issues like cookie theft and unauthorized access to authentication tokens
- **Gh0stt** suggested creating a virus-scanner for apps to improve security

### Platform Status
- Brief discussion about token price and project status in the HYPER channel
- **jay** questioned if the project was dead, with **PabloFM | Numinia** confirming it is not
- **HypPrivakos** announced completion of a design project with UI that received positive feedback

### Technical Issues
- **johan** reported display problems on a new iPhone
- **ash** expressed interest in a potential fullscreen API for iOS Safari
- Discussion about troubleshooting app-related issues by systematically disabling apps

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why are apps so isolated in Hyperfy?** (asked by Gh0stt)  
**A:** For security reasons - to prevent malicious apps from stealing auth tokens or cookies from users (answered by ash)

**Q: Does Spark.js work with Three.js?** (asked by ash)  
**A:** Yes, Spark.js works with Three.js, which is why it was used as a starting point (answered by mrtzhckr)

**Q: Would Ash be open to forming a splatting workgroup?** (asked by mrtzhckr)  
**A:** Yes, if there's enough demand, though he can only help with high-level direction currently (answered by ash)

**Q: Is the project dead?** (asked by jay)  
**A:** No (answered by PabloFM | Numinia)

**Q: How can I troubleshoot an app-related issue?** (implied by Gert-Jan Akerboom)  
**A:** Try disabling some apps until the problem stops occurring to help identify the cause (answered by ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Gaussian Splatting Support
- **mrtzhckr** created a GitHub repository with an MVP implementation and is seeking community help to make it production-ready
- **ash** suggested a simpler approach of adding a "splat" node with splat file type support and offered high-level guidance

### Security Awareness
- **Xukonth** helped **lucyhail** by identifying a potential scam, leading to suggestion to kick the scammer

### Troubleshooting Assistance
- **ash** helped **Gert-Jan Akerboom** with troubleshooting methodology for an unspecified technical issue, suggesting systematic app disabling to isolate the cause

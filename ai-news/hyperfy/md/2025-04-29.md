# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-29

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### UI & Design Updates
- **New UI Style**: Ashxn shared updates about a new UI style that has received positive feedback from users, though some minor issues remain (stats overlapping)
- **App Libraries**: Discussion about app libraries and collections, with plans to implement multiple tabs of "collections"
- **Asset Management**: Explanation of how the engine extracts assets from hyp files into the assets folder using a manifest.json structure

### AI Integration
- **AI Assistant Package**: Significant discussion about peezy's AI assistant package (drama-haus/ai hypkg) which integrates with various LLM providers
- **Provider Support**: The implementation allows users to select different models and only displays providers for which users have API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter)
- **Future Plans**: Potential support for localhost LLM integration was discussed

### Technical Development
- **Character Controllers**: Discussion about isometric character controllers using apps, with examples from pew.bet and coliseum world
- **Player Modification**: Techniques for modifying player behavior through player.applyEffect({ emote })
- **Equippable Items**: Conceptual discussion about attaching apps to player bones for skinned meshes (belts, watches, backpacks)
- **Mobile Optimization**: Improvements noted for performance on mobile devices, particularly on iPhone
- **UV Scrolling**: Ashxn shared a video demonstrating UV scroll techniques, generating positive reactions

### App Development
- **Neon Sign App**: Gert-Jan Akerboom mentioned working on a neon sign app with UI for typing and letter selection
- **Cross-World Communication**: Cru mentioned ongoing development of prototype functionality for live communication between worlds

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How to create an isometric character controller using apps?**  
A: Ashxn mentioned examples like pew.bet and coliseum world where developers modified player behavior using player.applyEffect({ emote }), but noted that first person, isometric, and top-down views aren't as flexible yet.

**Q: Is the new UI style 100% done?**  
A: Ashxn indicated there are still some cleanup tasks but nothing urgent, suggesting peezy could proceed with his AI integration.

**Q: Did anything change with occlusion culling?**  
A: Ashxn suggested the physics material optimization might be responsible for improved performance on iPhone.

**Q: How can I change the name of a world on the browser tab?**  
A: It's available as a text input in the world settings menu.

**Q: What can you do with UV scroll?**  
A: According to Ashxn, "it's wild what you can do with UV scroll" (demonstrated with a video).

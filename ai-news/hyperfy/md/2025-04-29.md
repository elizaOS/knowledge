# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-29

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Character Controller & Player Customization
- Discussion about creating an isometric character controller using apps in Gather
- Developers have used `player.applyEffect({ emote })` to switch between emotes in projects like pew.bet and coliseum world
- Third-person worlds are well-supported, but first-person, isometric, and top-down perspectives have limited flexibility
- Concept of "equipable skinned meshes" proposed to allow attaching apps to player character bones (watches, belts, backpacks) while keeping hands free

### Mobile Optimization
- Request for mobile-optimized worlds to demonstrate to newcomers
- Confirmation that v1 is still viable for mobile optimization
- User shared personal website (roustan.xyz) with two v1 mobile worlds (/pool and /roustan)

### Game Ideas
- Suggestions for games that could be built in Hyperfy:
  - Survival game
  - "Floating coliseum" where players avoid being knocked off by a gorilla

### UI Development
- One user maintaining their own fork with side tabs based on previous discussions
- Positive feedback about a new UI implementation

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How to create an isometric character controller using apps?**  
A: While not directly answering the isometric question, Ashxn explained that developers have modified player behavior using player.applyEffect({ emote }) for custom animations, but notes that isometric views aren't as flexible as third-person implementations.

**Q: Thoughts on equipable skinned meshes?**  
A: Ashxn seemed to agree it should be possible but didn't provide specific implementation details.

**Q: Doesn't anyone have any mobile optimized worlds? Looking to link normies to a reliably performant site so they can see a world in action**  
A: "I do have two v1 mobile worlds /pool and /roustan" (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)

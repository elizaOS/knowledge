# Hyperfy Discord - 2026-01-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### V1 to V2 Migration
- Jin is working on porting V1 apps to V2, including models, spawn points, environments, audio, seats, text, and images
- Debating whether to keep or strip Draco/Meshopt compression support:
  - **Pros of keeping:** File size reduction and better network performance
  - **Cons of keeping:** Code complexity and more difficult Blender pipeline integration
  - **Potential compromise:** Making compression optional during the build step
- Jin is developing a converter tool for V1 to V2 migration and plans to open-source it

### Technical Architecture
- V2 is simpler to host than Mozilla Hubs (which required Kubernetes and cost ~$500/month)
- V2 runs on a single server with a data-driven approach
- Non-technical users still face challenges with self-hosting
- A significant technical limitation was discovered: V2 doesn't support traditional lights, only emission materials

### Community Resources
- ToxSam - IBIH shared an update to the Open Source Avatars website (opensourceavatars.com/en/finder)
- The update includes expanded avatar collections and improved functionality for finding avatars

### Development Tools
- Discussion about AI tools like Clawdbot that provide continuous assistance with development ideas

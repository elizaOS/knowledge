# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Updates
- **Combat Mechanics**: Ashxn has been implementing combat features including damage numbers, critical hits, and player-to-player collision.
- **UI Capabilities**: Developers are exploring on-screen UI elements and discussing limitations around CSS properties like transform/translate.
- **Physics Interactions**: Significant interest in player forces/pushback and object manipulation mechanics.
- **Twitter/X Integration**: Several developers are working on displaying tweets in-world, debating between using the official API (requiring OAuth) or scraping approaches.
- **Tabletop Game Development**: smickelbeard showcased progress on a virtual tabletop card game prototype with features including session authentication, dynamic content loading, and interactive card mechanics.
- **Camera Features**: Implementation of an IdleCamera feature for switching camera views, plus discussions about top-down camera viewers for easier building.

### Technical Discussions
- **Breaking Changes**: A change affecting the `world.getPlayers` function was noted.
- **VRM Updates**: Uncertainty about implementing `vrm.update(delta)` function in the new paradigm - possibly in "playerlocal", "proxy", or "vrmfactory".
- **Avatar Attachments**: Discussions about bone transforms for avatar attachments, with specific focus on hand mounting positions.
- **3D Scaling**: Methods for scaling imported GLB models were shared.

### AI & Agents
- **SoulGraph Integration**: Whambammy discussed potential integration of SoulGraph's voice-to-voice technology with 3D avatars and Hyperfy agents once API access becomes available.
- **AI Projects**: 
  - CheddarQueso mentioned a hackathon project involving an AI agent for plant growing advice.
  - Bitpixi completed an "HyperParenting" project with 10 AI agents for Claire's contest.
  - Jin proposed setting up an Eliza AI agent to help with Discord questions using documentation as reference.
- **AI Policy Concerns**: maximus shared concerns about Anthropic's AI policy recommendations potentially disadvantaging open-source AI.

### Creative Projects
- **Map Generation**: Bitpixi shared progress on a map generator with an on-grid system, focusing on island shapes and street layouts.
- **Avatar Systems**: ToxSam announced fixing avatar download functionality on their website.
- **Creator Tools**: Discussion about Beb's creator portal idea, primarily focused on Blender scripts.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: How can I make imported GLB models bigger like in V1?  
  **A**: Use the script `app.scale.setScalar(10)` to make it 10x bigger.

- **Q**: How do I find my avatar position in world?  
  **A**: Use `const player = world.getPlayer(); player.position` or type `world.entities.player.base.position.toArray()` in browser console.

- **Q**: Is there a way to animate something? app.onUpdate doesn't seem to work.  
  **A**: Use `app.on('update', delta => { })`.

- **Q**: Which bone is anchor for weapons?  
  **A**: The sword is set to right hand, but you can change it in the hyp.

- **Q**: What do people use to do screen records?  
  **A**: OBS, Medal, Nvidia.

### Agents & Integration
- **Q**: How could SoulGraph technology be incorporated into 3D avatars?  
  **A**: It could potentially be added to the Hyperfy agent/Eliza app once API access is available.

- **Q**: What's notable about SoulGraph's voice chat technology?  
  **A**: It's fast and responsive, with the ability to stop and adjust responses in real-time when interrupted.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Ashxn helped fractilians** with making imported GLB models bigger by providing a one-liner script: `app.scale.setScalar(10)`.

- **Ashxn helped MetaRick** find avatar position in world by providing code to get player position and suggesting browser console commands.

- **Ashxn helped peezy** resolve JSON parsing issues with emojis in app properties by fixing a bug causing problems with certain characters.

- **Omka helped ToxSam** with displaying tweets in-world by sharing examples of UI implementations and suggesting using fetch with Twitter API.

- **Omka and HowiEDuhzit helped maximus** locate information about a top-down camera viewer tool by directing them to check stage chat from the most recent call.

- **devilsadvocate.sol helped Saori** with a tire repair question, suggesting using tire patch glue for bikes.

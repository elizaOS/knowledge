# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Combat & Physics Development
- **Ashxn** has been implementing combat mechanics including damage numbers, critical hits, and player-to-player collision
- Several developers are creating apps with the new physics capabilities, including interactive objects that can be pushed and picked up
- Player collision mechanics are being tested but may need to be made optional to prevent abuse
- Discussions about implementing player forces/pushback mechanics are ongoing

### UI Development
- **Omka** and others are working on screen overlays and in-world interfaces
- Current UI positioning has limitations as it's drawn in canvas for VR compatibility
- Developers are requesting position:absolute and top/left/right/bottom offsets for UI positioning
- Support for SVG and keyframes for UI animations has been requested

### Avatar & VRM Features
- Discussions about bone transforms for avatar attachments
- **Saori** suggested implementing spring bones functionality in V2 might be as simple as adding "vrm.update(delta)"
- Hand mount position for weapons/items needs fixing
- Questions about which bone is used as anchor for weapons (currently set to right hand)

### AI Integration
- **Whambammy** discussed SoulGraph technology for voice-to-voice chat that could be integrated with Hyperfy
- **CheddarQueso** created a hackathon project with an AI agent for plant growing advice
- **Bitpixi** completed an entry for Claire's AI contest featuring "HyperParenting" with 10 AI agents
- **jin** offered to set up an AI assistant for the Discord

### Technical Challenges
- App packaging/unpacking issues with emojis and special characters
- Twitter API integration difficulties
- **Valiant** reported Meshy API pricing changes and possible throttling of texture retries

### Project Status
- Some users questioned if development is still active, though this appears to be joking
- Brief mentions of cryptocurrency aspects of the project ($hyper token)
- Discussion about Hyperfy's potential for 2D game development

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I make imported GLB models bigger like in V1?**  
A: Use the script `app.scale.setScalar(10)` to make it 10x bigger (answered by **Ashxn**)

**Q: What do people use to do screen records?**  
A: OBS, Medal, Nvidia (answered by **Gooey**)

**Q: Which bone is anchor for weapons?**  
A: It's set to right hand, but you can change it in the hyp (answered by **Omka**)

**Q: How do we find our avatar position in world?**  
A: Use `const player = world.getPlayer(); player.position` or type `/coords` (answered by **Ashxn**)

**Q: Is there a way to make UI views rotate to cardinal directions?**  
A: Not currently supported as UI is drawn in canvas for VR compatibility (answered by **Ashxn**)

A: It's "fast and responsive" with the ability to interrupt and have the AI adjust responses in real-time (answered by **Whambammy**)

**Q: Is there a tool for top-down viewing when building?**  
A: Yes, **Howie** made one and shared it in a recent call (answered by **~/HowiEDuhzit**)

**Q: What's the ticker for the token?**  
A: $hyper (answered by **Ashxn**) and $hyperfy (answered by **peezy**)

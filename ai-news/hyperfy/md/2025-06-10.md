# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Engine Development & Technical Infrastructure
- **WebGPU Adoption**: Apple has unlocked WebGPU support on Safari/visionOS, prompting discussions about transitioning from WebGL. WebGPU offers superior performance and features like compute shaders and hi-z occlusion culling, though implementation would require significant renderer and shader updates.
- **Terrain Generation**: Significant interest in terrain features with Ash actively working on implementation. Discussions covered approaches (heightmaps vs. 3D voxel terrains) and technical considerations like size limitations, LOD systems, and edge handling.
- **Camera System Improvements**: Shifty released camera updates enhancing functionality for world builders.
- **VSCode Integration**: A new VSCode plugin for .hyp files was created to improve developer experience.
- **Instance Management**: Discussions about approaches for single-player experiences, including custom clients without networking systems or server pools that reset after use.

### Content Creation & Tools
- **VRM Management**: Lastraum announced VRM management integration with Hyperfy, allowing users to load VRMs, set defaults, and have them automatically load when connected to The Forge.
- **World Transfer Tools**: HP released World Exporter and Importer features for HyperWorld.Host, facilitating easier world sharing and backup.
- **Animation Techniques**: Vox shared a mega texture with UV scroll technique for creating performant animated models, along with a sample Hyp app for PBR atlas textures.
- **Teleport App**: A new teleport app was released for improved world navigation.

### AI Integration & Agents
- **Eliza Integration**: Community members expressed interest in integrating Eliza with Hyperfy, with discussions about implementation approaches.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Discussions about setting up multiple AI agents for a hackathon project, with considerations for hosting solutions including Replit and "coolify" on personal servers.
- **Vegetable-Themed Agents**: Proposal to create AI agents based on Toxsam's vegetable avatars for a hackathon project.

### Business & Ecosystem
- **Market Position**: Community compared Hyperfy's market cap (~$6M) to competitors like Verse World (~$50-100M), suggesting Hyperfy appears undervalued.
- **Development Philosophy**: Debate between building methodically for long-term sustainability versus pursuing short-term hype, with team emphasizing quality over token price pumping.
- **Token Utility**: Questions raised about what would drive demand for HYPER tokens in the ecosystem, with suggestions for marketplace and launchpad implementations.
- **Hyperfy Stack Position**: MUDBONE described Hyperfy's position as: "solana network -> Hyperfy -> Eliza integrations -> your world/project community."

### Community Projects
- **Active World Building**: Several members actively developing worlds, including Gert-Jan's "Akerboom Studio" going live and progress updates from OxQuan, Fibelius, and Lastraum.
- **Phettaverse Project**: A bounty was announced for helping build the phettaverse project.
- **New Hyp Repository**: B0gie and Omka created a new Hyp repository to support community development.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How big of a job would it be to rewrite the engine in WebGPU?**  
A: Only need to update all the renderer and shader stuff. The vast majority of the engine would stay the same. (Ashxn)

**Q: Is it possible to add a fullscreen mode for the screenshare app?**  
A: The video node is in 3D world-space and can't be put in screen-space yet, but it's possible with rendering to a subsection of the UI canvas each frame. (Ashxn)

**Q: Does someone have experience designing a world which always spins up single player instances?**  
A: You can create a custom client without networking systems, or have a smaller pool of servers that launch when someone joins and reset after everyone leaves. (Ashxn)

**Q: Can we get terrain generation officially?**  
A: It's not in the core yet because we need to decide on which type to use (heightmaps vs. 3D voxel) and come up with a simple UX. (Ashxn)

**Q: Can't we get AI agents running on server?**  
A: Possibly, gotta look into it. (b0gie)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **3D Animation Techniques**: Vox shared a mega texture with UV scroll technique for creating performant animated models, providing a sample Hyp app for PBR atlas texture implementation.

- **VSCode Integration**: B0gie created a VSCode plugin for .hyp files based on an existing project, improving the development experience.

- **World Transfer Tools**: HP released World Exporter and Importer features for HyperWorld.Host, enabling easier world sharing and backup.

- **AI Agent Hosting**: HiroP recommended Replit as an easy solution for hosting multiple AI agent services.

- **ElizaOS Clarification**: MUDBONE explained to cloudAI that ElizaOS's issues were related to X's API restrictions for bots and shouldn't affect Hyperfy.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### WebGPU & Technical Infrastructure
- **WebGPU Adoption**: Apple has unlocked WebGPU support on Safari/visionOS, prompting discussions about transitioning from WebGL
- **Performance Benefits**: WebGPU offers superior performance and features like compute shaders and hi-z occlusion culling
- **Implementation Challenges**: Transition would require significant renderer and shader updates, though most of the engine could remain unchanged
- **Hosting Solutions**: Community members discussed various hosting options for agents, including Replit, personal servers with "coolify", and dedicated servers

### Terrain Generation & Environment Design
- **Feature Request**: Terrain generation emerged as a highly requested feature
- **Implementation Approaches**: Debate between heightmaps vs. 3D voxel terrains
- **Technical Considerations**: Discussions covered size limitations, LOD systems, and edge handling
- **Future Plans**: Ashxn mentioned plans to add scene apps and bounties for optimized base environments beyond the default grass plane
- **Ambient Occlusion**: Plans to add ambient occlusion to the dev branch

### Avatar & VRM Integration
- **VRM Management**: Lastraum shared progress on VRM management linked to Hyperfy
- **User Experience**: System allows users to load VRMs and set defaults that load when connected to The Forge
- **Veggie Avatars**: Community discussed using Toxsam's veggie avatars for agents in an "urban farm" setting

### Business Strategy & Token Economics
- **Market Position**: Community compared Hyperfy's market cap (~$6M) to competitors like Verse World (~$50-100M)
- **Development Philosophy**: Debate between methodical building for long-term sustainability versus pursuing short-term hype
- **Token Utility**: Questions raised about what would drive demand for the HYPER token in the ecosystem
- **Ecosystem Structure**: MUDBONE described Hyperfy's position as: "solana network -> Hyperfy -> Eliza integrations -> your world/project community"

### Developer Tools & Integrations
- **VSCode Plugin**: b0gie created a .hyp plugin for VSCode and shared the GitHub repository
- **ElizaOS Integration**: Discussion about getting "eliza" working again and integration methods
- **LLM Selection**: hiroP shared that Claude 4 Opus works best for Python, Gemini 2.5 Pro for refactoring, and O3 for JS/Node

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it possible to add a fullscreen mode for the screenshare app?** (Alephic)  
A: The video node is in 3D world-space and can't be put in screen-space yet, but it's possible by rendering to a subsection of the UI canvas each frame. (Ashxn)

**Q: How big of a job would it be to rewrite the engine in WebGPU?** (zzzzzzzzzzz)  
A: Only need to update all the renderer and shader stuff. The vast majority of the engine would stay the same. (Ashxn)

**Q: Does someone have experience designing a world which always spins up single player instances?** (Reneil)  
A: Two options: create a custom client without networking systems, or have a smaller pool of servers that launch when someone joins and reset after everyone leaves. (Ashxn)

**Q: Can we get terrain generation officially?** (peezy)  
A: It's not in the core yet because decisions need to be made on which type to use (heightmaps vs. 3D voxel) and UX considerations. (Ashxn)

**Q: Can't we get it running on server?** (0mka)  
A: Possibly, gotta look into it (b0gie)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Single-Player Instances**
   - Helper: Ashxn & HypPrivakos
   - Helpee: Reneil
   - Context: Creating single-player instances for a curation world (MOCA project)
   - Resolution: Provided two approaches and offered direct assistance via DM

2. **VSCode Integration**
   - Helper: b0gie
   - Helpee: Community
   - Context: VSCode integration for Hyperfy
   - Resolution: Created a .hyp plugin for VSCode and shared the GitHub repository

3. **LLM Selection Guidance**
   - Helper: hiroP
   - Helpee: Community
   - Context: LLM selection for coding tasks
   - Resolution: Shared experience with different models for specific programming tasks

4. **ElizaOS Clarification**
   - Helper: MUDBONE
   - Helpee: cloudAI
   - Context: Concerns about ElizaOS affecting Hyperfy
   - Resolution: Explained that ElizaOS's issues were related to X's API restrictions and shouldn't affect Hyperfy

5. **Hosting Options**
   - Helper: hiroP
   - Helpee: b0gie
   - Context: Hosting options for running agents
   - Resolution: Suggested Replit as an "ez mode" solution for hosting multiple things

## Action Items

### Technical

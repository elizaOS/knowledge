# Hyperfy Discord - 2026-01-09

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Shader Development
- **Grass Shader Implementation**: Ozymandias shared progress on adapting a 3D grass shader from codevre.com into Hyperfy, adding rotation capabilities for realistic grass movement beyond Hyperfy's existing wind shader
- The implementation is optimized to handle 1 million grass blades (each with 8 rectangles)
- .hyp shaman expressed interest in creating a grass shader that interacts with players

### Audio Implementation
- Discussion about implementing audio in Hyperfy objects, with community members sharing documentation and examples
- Valiant shared a basic MP3 player implementation that allows users to upload MP3 files or load them via URL

### Technical Infrastructure
- Brief discussion about file upload size limitations in Hyperfy and how to modify them using environment variables
- A user reported an issue with their world not saving changes when hosted on fly.io (later resolved with help)

### Development Tools
- A user mentioned creating an OSRS map scraper using Blender to split terrain and generate collision
- Discussion about .hyp file creation process when GLB files are dropped into Hyperfy worlds

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How to upload audio file to an object?**  
A: Create an audio node. Documentation links and examples like a boombox implementation were provided by Valiant and Dhin.

**Q: How to set up file size limits in Hyperfy?**  
A: Environment variables can be changed in the .env file to increase upload limits.

**Q: How to create a .hyp file?**  
A: .hyp files are created when GLB files are dropped into the Hyperfy world, after which code can be added before downloading the file.

**Q: Has anyone encountered an issue where a world (server w/ fly.io) is not saving changes?**  
A: The issue was resolved with Antigravity's help, though specific solution details weren't shared.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **.hyp shaman helped NOlove** with file size limits in Hyperfy, explaining that environment variables can be changed in the .env file to increase upload limits.

2. **Valiant and Dhin assisted Coinexpert** with audio implementation by providing documentation links and sharing a boombox example for reference.

3. **Antigravity helped untitled, xyz** resolve an issue where their Hyperfy world hosted on fly.io was not saving changes and reverting to default meadow after closing and reopening.

4. **Gert-Jan Akerboom explained** the .hyp file creation process to a user, including providing documentation about the format.

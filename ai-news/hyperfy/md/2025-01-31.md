# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-31

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Updates
- **V2 Platform Progress**: V2 is currently available for developers, with the team working on making it accessible to non-technical users. The new version offers better performance with models and avatars, though differences are most noticeable to developers at this stage.
- **Builder Interface Improvements**: A significant PR (#23) was submitted with UI enhancements including sliding value editors, reset transform buttons, and tooltips. The team is working on transform controls, lock functionality, and copy/paste capabilities.
- **Audio Implementation**: A new audio node has been introduced with play/pause/stop controls and position tracking, with discussions about adding "audio bloom" for enhanced party experiences.
- **Networking Architecture**: Developers shared code examples demonstrating how to synchronize object movements across clients using server-client communication patterns, with emphasis on smooth interpolation.
- **Environment Apps**: Work is underway on environment apps that would replace the default scene at position 0,0,0 and allow for different terrains and sky settings.
- **Server Infrastructure**: Knar described plans for a single-shard MMO with dynamic server mesh topology where world servers spin up zone servers as needed and split into smaller zones when they get full.

### Agent Systems
- **Framework Optimization**: Discussions compared Hyperfy (400MB) and Eliza (5GB) Docker images, noting that using Alpine Linux instead of Debian/Ubuntu significantly reduced image size.
- **Responsiveness Challenges**: Participants debated approaches to creating responsive embodied agents, suggesting a hybrid approach using LLMs for high-level decision-making while leveraging traditional game AI for low-latency actions.
- **Client Prediction**: The concept of having agents immediately respond with predicted behaviors while waiting for LLM confirmation was proposed to reduce perceived latency.
- **Goal Oriented Action Planning**: This was suggested as a potential solution where LLMs determine goals but traditional algorithms handle execution, similar to systems used in games like F.E.A.R.

### 3D Design & Architecture
- **Model Optimization**: Discussions emphasized the importance of optimizing 3D models for cross-device compatibility, with maximus sharing resources on optimization techniques.
- **Architectural Applications**: Several community members with architectural backgrounds connected to discuss transitioning from real architecture to metaverse design.
- **Technical Troubleshooting**: The community helped diagnose and fix issues with transparent materials in imported models, identifying Alpha Blend material settings as the culprit.
- **Modular Building Systems**: Conversations touched on creating modular architectural elements that work with Hyperfy's snapping system.

### HYPER Token
- **Price Discussion**: Community members discussed the token's price decline from around $0.27 to below $0.02, with some expressing concerns while others remained optimistic about the project's fundamentals.
- **Distribution Clarification**: The team clarified that 5% of tokens went to AI16Z partners (not the treasury) and confirmed they haven't sold tokens.
- **Market Analysis**: Price drops were attributed to market-wide liquidity issues and early investors selling at losses.
- **Exchange Listing**: The token was recently listed on BVOX exchange, which may have contributed to a small price rebound.

### Community Engagement
- **Community Call**: Maximus shared an update highlighting focus on core UI for non-technical users, pre-fabs development, agent partnerships, and hyperBALL progress.
- **Discoverability Improvements**: Suggestions included creating a /worlds page on hyperfy.xyz and a dedicated Discord channel for world submissions.
- **No-Code Solutions**: Multiple community members discussed the need for tools that would make the platform more accessible to non-developers.
- **Hosting Options**: HPrivakos mentioned hyperworld.host service that allows world creation in minutes.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
- **Q**: How do you make objects networked?  
  **A**: Use client/server pattern with app.send() to communicate between clients and server, with the server handling position updates. (Saori)

- **Q**: Why is app.id `$root` for each app even if they're separate GLBs?  
  **A**: Every app has a $root (empty) as the basis, and every GLB is an app. (᲼)

- **Q**: Could we set up nodes with properties in a single object rather than separate assignments?  
  **A**: Yes, this would be cleaner and more readable, especially for non-developers. (MetaMike)

- **Q**: What would be a better way to run Hyperfy on Steam Deck?  
  **A**: A wrapper would likely be the best approach since Steam Deck is essentially a custom Linux box. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Has V2 already been deployed?  
  **A**: Yes, if you can dev you can use V2; if not, they're still working on it. (jar0d)

### Agents
- **Q**: What increases the size of a docker image?  
  **A**: A docker image is built in layers, each installation or embedded file increases size. Using Alpine instead of Debian/Ubuntu significantly reduces size but offers fewer tools out of the box. (HPrivakos)

- **Q**: Is there an agent to generate agents?  
  **A**: You can give an LLM the JSON format and description of the show/character to generate agent definitions. (Saori and Omka)

- **Q**: Will the agents be able to have a speech to text mode?  
  **A**: Agent voice services are expensive but technically possible, and could be optional in the new core. (peezy and Ashxn)

### 3D Design
- **Q**: How can I add colliders to my models for Hyperfy worlds?  
  **A**: There are tools made by Howie, a Blender add-on available at https://github.com/HowieDuhzit/Hyperfy-Tools (𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)

- **Q**: Why does my model look transparent in Hyperfy when it appears normal in Blender?  
  **A**: The material is plugged into alpha and the blendmode is "Alpha Blend" (𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)

- **Q**: What optimization is needed for 3D models in Hyperfy?  
  **A**: Models need to be optimized to be lightweight so worlds are accessible across all device types. (maximus)

### HYPER Token
- **Q**: Is HYPER an SPL token?  
  **A**: Yes, it's on Solana. (HPrivakos)

- **Q**: Did the AI16Z DAO get tokens and subsequently sell them?  
  **A**: No, 5% went to AI16Z partners, not the treasury. (Saori)

- **Q**: Why did the token fall so much?  
  **A**: Market-wide liquidity issues after events like Trump/Melania tokens, plus early investors selling at losses. (devilsadvocate.sol)

- **Q**: Can AI16Z partner NFT holders still claim HYPER?  
  **A**: No, the claim period ended January 13th. (Rick/hyperfy_io tweet)

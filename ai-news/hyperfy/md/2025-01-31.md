# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-31

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Progress
- **V2 Development**: The team is focused on core UI for non-technical users, pre-fabs development, agent partnerships, and hyperBALL progress. V2 is more performant with models and avatars, though differences are currently most noticeable to developers.
- **Architecture**: Knar mentioned plans for a "single shard MMO" with dynamic server mesh topology that spins up zone servers as needed and splits them into smaller zones when full.
- **Docker Optimization**: A significant PR reduced Docker image size by approximately 70% and implemented automated image building for main and dev branches. The PR also adds COMMIT_HASH to the image and displays it on the /status page.

### Builder Controls & Features
- A PR from user "᲼" added sliding value editors, reset transform button, and copy/paste buttons to the InspectPane.
- Discussions about improving builder controls with features like transform widgets, lock functionality, and copy/paste capabilities.
- Ashxn suggested a cleaner syntax for setting multiple node properties during creation using an object parameter.

### Audio Implementation
- Ashxn introduced a new audio node in the dev branch with playback controls (play, pause, stop) and shared example code.

### Agent Technology
- Comparison between Hyperfy (400MB) and Eliza (5GB) Docker images, with HPrivakos noting that using Alpine Linux instead of Debian/Ubuntu significantly reduced image size.
- Discussion about latency challenges in embodied agents, with suggestions for client-side prediction techniques, pre-computing responses, and implementing goal-oriented action planning.
- Debate about combining traditional game AI techniques with LLMs to achieve better performance.

### HYPER Token
- The token experienced significant downward pressure, dropping from around $0.27 to approximately $0.014.
- Community members discussed potential causes, including market-wide liquidity issues and typical airdrop sell pressure.
- The token was listed on BVOX exchange, which caused a small price rebound.
- Team members directed users to token.hyperfy.xyz for transparency on allocation.

### 3D Design & Architecture
- Discussions about optimization techniques for 3D models to ensure good performance across devices.
- Technical issues addressed, including transparency problems with models.
- Several members with architectural backgrounds expressed interest in collaborating and experimenting with Hyperfy's capabilities.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: Any reason to have an exit(1) instead of an exit(0) in build.mjs?  
  **A**: This was only added because the process kept running after an `npm run build`, so it could be anything if you want to change (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do you make objects networked in Hyperfy?  
  **A**: Use client/server pattern where client sends actions to server, server updates position and broadcasts to all clients (Saori)

- **Q**: How do you build 3D models for Hyperfy?  
  **A**: Use Blender (try the donut tutorial), then export models to GLB format; also check out gltf.report for auto-optimization (Ashxn)

- **Q**: What increases the size of a docker image?  
  **A**: A docker image is built in layers, each installation or file embedding increases size. Using Alpine instead of Debian/Ubuntu significantly reduces size. (HPrivakos)

- **Q**: How can I fix my model that looks transparent in Hyperfy but normal in Blender?  
  **A**: The material is plugged into alpha and the blendmode is "Alpha Blend". You need to reassign materials to the areas. (𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)

### Platform & Roadmap
- **Q**: Would it be possible to get a summary/tdlr of updates discussed in the community call?  
  **A**: Focus on core UI for non-techs, pre-fabs on the way, agent partnerships in progress, hyperBALL going well (maximus)

- **Q**: Where can I check the next roadmap? In GitHub?  
  **A**: "No roadmap just vibes" (Saori)

- **Q**: When will there be #nocode solutions?  
  **A**: Working on firm plan (short term roadmap) to make you guys feel better about this (Saori)

- **Q**: Has V2 already been deployed?  
  **A**: Yes, if you can dev, you can use V2; if you can't dev, they're still working on it (jar0d)

### HYPER Token
- **Q**: Is HYPER an SPL token?  
  **A**: Yes, it is a Solana-based token (HPrivakos)

- **Q**: Were KOLs paid in this token for supply that just made a few tweets and then sold?  
  **A**: No, KOLs weren't paid and nobody got the contract address before it was public (Saori)

- **Q**: Can ai16z partner NFT holders still claim HYPER?  
  **A**: No, the claim period ended January 13th (Rick with tweet evidence)

- **Q**: Why did this token fall so much?  
  **A**: Market-wide liquidity issues and typical airdrop sell pressure (multiple users)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Assistance
- **Saori helped MetaMike** with networking object movement across clients by providing two code examples showing how to implement server-client communication for synchronized movement.

- **Ashxn helped vlad** with 3D modeling workflow for Hyperfy by recommending Blender with donut tutorial and GLB export format, plus gltf.report for optimization.

- **𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 helped mahmoudghorbani** with a model transparency issue, identifying it as a material plugged into alpha with "Alpha Blend" mode, and suggested reassigning materials to fix the problem.

- **HPrivakos helped devilsadvocate.sol** understand what increases Docker image size by explaining Docker layers and how switching from Debian/Ubuntu to Alpine reduces size.

### Agent Development
- **peezy helped MetaMike** with implementing game AI with LLMs by explaining goal-oriented action planning as used in games like F.E.A.R.

- **Saori helped ᲼** adapt Eliza for Hyperfy by providing guidance and sharing a GitHub comparison link showing the changes.

### Platform Support
- **maximus helped Juank** who missed the community call by providing a summary of key points and later sharing the recording link.

- **jar0d helped PascalCase** with V2 deployment questions by explaining that developers can use V2 but need to host their own server or pay for hosting.

- **HPrivakos helped PascalCase** find a way to host a Hyperfy world by sharing hyperworld.host service that allows getting a world in less than 2 minutes.

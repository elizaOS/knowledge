# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-02

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Infrastructure
- **App Creation API Improvements**: Ashxn introduced a cleaner syntax for creating nodes with `app.create(node, props)` and updated the props documentation.
- **Docker & Deployment**: HPrivakos set up GitHub container packages for Hyperfy, making the Docker image publicly available. smickelbeard shared a complete fly.toml configuration for one-line deployment to fly.io with auto-scaling capabilities.
- **Hosting Options**: Community members discussed various hosting solutions including fly.io, Vercel, and hyperworld.host, comparing scaling capabilities, costs, and ease of use. hyperworld.host now supports both crypto and fiat payments via Stripe.
- **Audio Implementation**: Discussions covered streaming MP3 support and the orientation of audio cones, with current implementation downloading entire files instead of streaming them.

### AI Integration
- **Eliza Agents**: Significant focus on integrating AI agents using the Eliza framework. Lastraum demonstrated JavaScript implementation allowing agents created in Decentraland to be used in Hyperfy, enabling cross-platform interactions.
- **Agent Hosting**: HPrivakos offered to host Eliza agents for users, requiring only character files, and shared the GitHub link to the Hyperfy branch of Eliza.
- **AI Code Generation**: User cru demonstrated AI code generation for scripts, with discussions about integrating this capability into the core platform with proper API documentation context.

### HYPER Token & Ecosystem
- **Token Utility**: Ashxn and Saori emphasized that the team has figured out token use cases, focusing on marketplace dynamics that allow creators to build narrative-driven experiences and collectibles.
- **Market Sentiment**: Discussions about HYPER token price movements, with the token experiencing volatility but recovering from around $0.01 to approximately $0.02 by the end of the chat period.
- **Token Distribution**: Clarification that top wallets include the DAO and vested team allocations using Streamflow, with core dev team having a 3-year vesting period.

### 3D Design & Assets
- **Hyperduck Meme**: The community discussed "hyperduck," a duck.glb 3D model that has become a community meme and testing asset, noted for its efficient file size (270kb).
- **Avatar Implementation**: Conversations about using VRM models as avatars, with Saori providing links to Vroid Hub for downloadable models.
- **Environment Creation**: Resources shared for creating 3D environments, including Blockade Labs for skyboxes and Meshy.ai for generating 3D models.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
- **Q**: Can React Three Fiber (r3f) be combined with Hyperfy?  
  **A**: Yes, but with limitations. R3f is just a Three.js wrapper for React, and can be used for things like fetching updated world data and displaying a galaxy.

- **Q**: How do you make 3D objects solid so avatars can jump on them?  
  **A**: Change collision to "all" in the object properties.

- **Q**: How can I generate a UUID in an app script?  
  **A**: There's a global uuid() function injected into the script environment.

- **Q**: How can I get the current timestamp in a script?  
  **A**: Use world.getTime() for performance.now() synced to server time, world.getTimestamp() for ISO date timestamps, or Date.now() which was just added.

- **Q**: Is there a way to sleep for some amount of milliseconds in a script?  
  **A**: Raw setTimeout isn't available, but you can track time with updates using delta values.

### AI Agents
- **Q**: Has anyone made a tutorial to set up an agent in hyperfy that is easy to understand for less than devs?  
  **A**: Not directly answered, though Lastraum and HPrivakos shared code implementations.

- **Q**: How do you make the agent auto chat when you join world or respond to you without typing "/agent" first?  
  **A**: HPrivakos suggested using Ash's code and tweaking it to handle your server.

- **Q**: Where can u find all the agents?  
  **A**: Currently you create the agent inside dcl, but it's available anywhere - and the list of agents are public (for now) https://lkdcl.co/eliza/agents.

- **Q**: Is there a standard character file format that you're using?  
  **A**: https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/core/characterfile/

### Platform & Token
- **Q**: We use metamask to connect to hyperfy?  
  **A**: Hyperfy.io is the old v1 worlds. It was token gated by an ETH NFT. V2 project is open source and will use the hyper token to drive the ecosystem within the v2 paradigm.

- **Q**: Do I need to be a serious developer or can I figure this shit out?  
  **A**: hyperfy.io is friendly for non devs and you bought a world so you can use it, just need 3d models and stuff.

- **Q**: Will be great if it is token use case problem?  
  **A**: There is no token use case problem. The token will be used, and there are tokens with no use case that are worth billions because the open source code base they are attached to have adoption.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Assistance
- **Lastraum** shared JavaScript code for connecting Eliza agent framework to Hyperfy, helping users implement AI agents in their worlds.
- **HPrivakos** offered to host Eliza agents for users, requiring only character files, making agent implementation more accessible.
- **MetaMike** shared complete code for a cube movement app with UI text and action label synchronization, providing a practical example for other developers.
- **smickelbeard** shared a complete fly.toml configuration for easy deployment to fly.io with auto-scaling capabilities.

### Resource Sharing
- **Saori** provided links to Vroid Hub for downloadable VRM avatar models and explained how to use them.
- **maximus** provided YouTube tutorial links for building in Hyperfy to help new users get started.
- **𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚝𝚎** provided a custom environment with HDR for better visual demonstrations of AI code generation.

### Problem Solving
- **Ashxn** explained audio cone visualization and suggested moving the audio node to the center of the cube to resolve orientation issues.
- **Saori** helped a user understand how to make objects solid by changing collision settings to "all".
- **Valiant** and **Saori** collaborated on solutions for fixing "sticky steps" in 3D environments, suggesting either adding invisible ramp colliders or editing player capsule settings.

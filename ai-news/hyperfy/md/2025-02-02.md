# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-02

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **Hyperfy v2 Progress**: The platform is transitioning from v1 to v2, with v2 being Solana-first but aiming to include all chains and web2 authentication methods. V2 resolves many issues from v1 including camera clipping, tab switching jitter, and improved lighting and physics.
- **API Improvements**: Ashxn introduced a cleaner syntax for creating nodes with `app.create(node, props)` and improved props validation, making development more intuitive.
- **Self-hosting Options**: Discussion about hyperworld.host, a hosting service that now supports both crypto and fiat payments via Stripe.
- **Sandbox Environment Limitations**: Users discussed restrictions in the current sandbox environment, including limited access to functions like `Date.now()`, `setTimeout`, and `crypto.randomUUID()`.

### AI Integration
- **Eliza Agents**: Lastraum and HPrivakos shared code for connecting Eliza-based agents from Decentraland to Hyperfy, enabling cross-platform agent interactions. The implementation uses JavaScript to fetch agent data from endpoints like "lkdcl.co/eliza" and "agents.dcl.guru".
- **Agent Hosting**: HPrivakos offered to host Eliza agents for users, requiring only their character files while handling the LLM backend with Ollama.
- **AI Code Generation**: User cru demonstrated AI code generation for scripts, with Ashxn suggesting implementing this in the core by feeding AI the list of nodes and API docs.

### Technical Features
- **Audio Implementation**: Discussions about audio streaming capabilities, with plans to add streaming MP3 support instead of downloading entire files. Firefox compatibility issues with Web Audio API were noted.
- **Physics & Collisions**: Conversations about physics interactions, collision settings, and fixing "sticky steps" issues by either adding invisible ramp colliders or editing player capsule settings.
- **3D Assets**: The community discussed "hyperduck," a duck.glb 3D model that has become a community meme and testing asset for colliders due to its small file size (270kb).

### Token & Ecosystem
- **HYPER Token**: Significant volatility observed (dropping from around $0.10 to as low as $0.01 before rebounding to $0.02). Community members expressed both concern and optimism amid a broader market downturn.
- **Token Distribution**: Clarification that large wallets are vested through Streamflow, addressing concerns about concentration.
- **Ecosystem Vision**: Ashxn and Saori mentioned they're working on making it easy for creators to build narrative-driven experiences and collectables, with everything remaining interoperable and open.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: Can you combine React Three Fiber (r3f) with Hyperfy?  
  **A**: Not directly inside Hyperfy; r3f is a React wrapper for three.js that's useful for landing pages but separate from Hyperfy.

- **Q**: How can I generate a UUID in an app script?  
  **A**: There's a global uuid() function injected into the script environment.

- **Q**: How can I get the current timestamp in a script?  
  **A**: Use world.getTime() for performance.now() synced to server time, world.getTimestamp() for ISO timestamps, or Date.now() which was just added.

- **Q**: Can I make 3D objects solid so avatars can jump on them?  
  **A**: Yes, change collision to "all".

- **Q**: What does "inherit" mean for collision settings?  
  **A**: It uses collision shapes defined in Blender for better performance with more basic shapes.

- **Q**: Is there a way to sleep for some milliseconds in a script?  
  **A**: No direct setTimeout, but you can track time with the update event.

### AI Agents
- **Q**: How do you make the agent auto chat when you join world or respond without typing "/agent" first?  
  **A**: Use the code Ash provided and tweak it to handle your server.

- **Q**: Where can you find all the agents?  
  **A**: Currently you create the agent inside DCL, but it's available anywhere - and the list of agents are public (for now) at https://lkdcl.co/eliza/agents.

- **Q**: Is there a standard character file format for agents?  
  **A**: Yes, documentation is available at https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/core/characterfile/.

- **Q**: Is adding agents on the dev branch straightforward?  
  **A**: It requires the custom Eliza branch running with Ollama as backend, plus a script in-world.

### Platform & Ecosystem
- **Q**: Does connecting to Hyperfy use MetaMask? I thought this was a Solana thing?  
  **A**: V1 worlds need an Ethereum NFT, while v2 doesn't require MetaMask connection. V2 is Solana-first but aims to include all chains and web2 auth.

- **Q**: Do I need to be a serious developer or can I figure this out?  
  **A**: Hyperfy.io is friendly for non-devs and if you bought a world you can use it, just need 3D models and content.

- **Q**: What percentage of the supply needs to be in the LP to prevent crazy spikes on low volume?  
  **A**: Too much in the LP at this point and the price will plummet... only 1.32% in the pool is a good thing but it can be bad too if a big whale sells.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Development Assistance
- **Ashxn** helped **m‚ÇÇ** by adding Date.now() support to the dev branch after they requested timestamp functionality in scripts.
- **Ashxn** assisted **b34k3r** with an audio cone orientation issue by explaining the audio node positioning and providing visualization of audio cone.
- **Valiant** suggested to **Saori** a solution for fixing "sticky steps" issue by "adding an extra ultra simple collider to act as an invisible ramp for quick fix."
- **Saori** offered **Valiant** an alternative solution for sticky steps issue by suggesting "we can fix by editing the player capsule settings."

### AI Agent Implementation
- **Lastraum** helped **ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì** set up agents in Hyperfy by sharing JavaScript code for integrating Eliza agents.
- **HPrivakos** assisted **ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì** with making agents auto-chat by providing code and URL example for Hawk Tuah agent.
- **HPrivakos** offered to host Eliza agents for **bitpixi** and other users, requiring only their character files while handling the LLM backend.
- **HPrivakos** shared documentation links with **MetaMike** for Eliza character files and created a Hyperfy-compatible Ken Oath agent URL.

### Resource Sharing
- **Saori** helped **frabra239** find 3D models for world building by sharing resources like Sketchfab, Meshy.ai, and Blockadelabs for skyboxes.
- **maximus** provided **frabra239** with YouTube tutorial links for v1 worlds when they needed tutorials for building in Hyperfy.
- **Saori** shared a link to downloadable VRoid models with **frabra239** and explained how to use them as avatars.
- **untitled, xyz** provided **Scuube (Saori)** with a link to an empty V1 playground world and requested ETH address to grant builder permissions.

### Platform Navigation
- **maximus** helped **frabra239** understand the difference between v1 and v2 platforms after they purchased a world on hyperfy.io, explaining that hyperfy.io is the v1 platform, sharing FAQ link, and suggesting GitHub for building options.
- **Jona** clarified for **frabra239** the difference between v1 (Ethereum) and v2 (Solana) worlds and provided links to more information when they were confused about Hyperfy using MetaMask despite being Solana-related.

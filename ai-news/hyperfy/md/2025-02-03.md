# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Infrastructure
- **API Stability**: Ashxn confirmed that documented scripting APIs are unlikely to change, while undocumented features may evolve
- **V2 Improvements**: Better camera collision handling, physics-based player controller, and more accurate lighting
- **Self-hosting**: Progress on making Hyperfy worlds portable between hosts, with maximus explaining that worlds can be easily transferred
- **Ecosystem Vision**: Ashxn shared a conceptual framework where developers create cores, artists create collectibles, and consumers build experiences without coding

### Agent Framework Integration
- Lastraum shared JavaScript code for implementing "Eliza" agents in Hyperfy and Decentraland
- HPrivakos announced support for hosting Eliza agents without requiring API keys
- Discussion of advanced agent technologies including Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and on-chain agents via WebAssembly

### 3D Design & Avatars
- Challenges with VRM avatar compatibility, particularly with Nifty Island's NFTs which are token-gated
- Detailed discussions about Mixamo rigging issues and alternative workflows using AutoRigPro or Accurig
- Community members shared resources for avatar creation and optimization

### HYPER Token
- Significant price volatility with the token dropping to $0.01 before recovering to $0.02, then falling again by 36%
- Community divided between holding strategies ("hodl til $1") and swing trading approaches
- Discussion about liquidity pool requirements to prevent price volatility

### App Development
- Methods for inter-app communication using world.emit()/on() and app.send()/on()
- New feature allowing apps to be downloaded as .hyp files with version compatibility checks
- Audio implementation discussions about 3D positioning using PannerNode from Web Audio API

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How stable is the networking API?** (Saori)  
A: Networking is pretty stable now. (Ashxn)

**Q: How can I store values in apps and make them accessible to other apps?** (MetaMike)  
A: Use world.emit("event name", data) and world.on("event name", (data) => {}) for server-to-server communication. (Saori)

**Q: Is there a way to sleep for some amount of milliseconds?** (m‚ÇÇ)  
A: There's no direct setTimeout, but you can track time with updates using the delta parameter. (Ashxn)

**Q: Do you need model API keys to host Eliza agents?** (MetaMike)  
A: No, just your character file, I take care of the LLM part :) (HPrivakos)

**Q: How does it work with updates coming from Hyperfy? Will we need to set things up all over again when new versions are released?** (Paradoxx)  
A: Not really, worlds can be easily transferred between hosts. (ToxSam)

**Q: What percentage of the supply needs to be in the LP to be enough to prevent crazy spikes on low volume?** (jar0d)  
A: Too much in the LP at this point and the price will plummet. Only 1.32% in the pool is a good thing, but it can be bad too if a big whale sells. (BitFiend)

**Q: Anyone have the problem of rigging an avatar on mixamo where the model "lurches" forward in edit mode?** (FortyMcNiner)  
A: Look into resetting the 'rest pose' or try alternative rigging methods like AutoRigPro or Accurig. (TheMattEmpire and Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Audio Positioning**: Ashxn helped b34k3r fix audio cone positioning by explaining how to move the audio node to the center of a cube
- **Avatar Integration**: Saori provided frabra239 with links to downloadable VRoid models and explained how to use them in Hyperfy
- **Cross-App Communication**: Saori and Ashxn helped MetaMike understand how to share data between apps using the event system
- **Agent Framework**: HPrivakos offered to host Eliza agents for MetaMike without requiring API keys
- **VRM Compatibility**: maximus explained to N1Kingz/HCK1 why Nifty Island NFTs are inaccessible in Hyperfy due to token-gating
- **Rigging Workflow**: TheMattEmpire and Ashxn suggested alternative rigging approaches to FortyMcNiner to solve the "lurching" model issue

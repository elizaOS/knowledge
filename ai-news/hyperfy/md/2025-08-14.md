# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Projects
- **Tile Dash Game**: Lastraum showcased this multiplayer game with mobile compatibility and later added token rewards (25 tokens for completing a level). The game includes leaderboard functionality and integration with "The Forge" for saving progress and earning LSC tokens.
- **Race System**: Valiant shared progress on a race system with persistent storage for leaderboards and invited others to test it.

### Technical Challenges & Solutions
- **Performance Optimization**: Significant discussions about performance issues in Tile Dash, with .hyp shaman noting high resource usage on a 5060 Ti GPU. Ash investigated and found the app running at 30+ms in Angzaar world versus 5ms in a blank world. Lastraum removed approximately 100MB of 3D models to improve performance.
- **Physics Implementation**: Detailed discussion about technical limitations in DCL (Decentraland) compared to Hyperfy, particularly regarding physics. Lastraum explained their workaround using server-simulated physics with client-side colliders.
- **Animation Issues**: Problems with cloned skinned meshes where only 1/3 play animations with "bones are missing" errors were reported by .hyp shaman.

### Community & Token Discussions
- **Community Tensions**: Discussions about a former community member named Saori who has been criticizing the project after leaving. Ash expressed frustration while maintaining confidence in Hyperfy's direction.
- **Token Concerns**: Users expressed frustration about the lack of information regarding the token's roadmap and future plans. There were calls for more community engagement on social media platforms to increase visibility.

### 3D Design
- **Return to Design**: Fibelius mentioned returning to 3D design after some frustration with their corporate laptop, planning to purchase a new Mac and update their Blender from version 3.4.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How does Lastraum implement physics in DCL without native physics support?**  
A: Server simulated physics with client-side colliders. The client-side collider blocks players from going through objects while the server tracks player positions and ball forces using Colyseus for WebSocket connections. (answered by Lastraum)

**Q: Why is Tile Dash running sub 30FPS on a 5060 Ti?**  
A: The performance issues were related to numerous 3D models ported from DCL consuming resources. Removing approximately 100MB of models resolved the issue. (answered by Lastraum and ash)

**Q: Are NLA tracks supported in Hyperfy?**  
A: No, they are not currently supported. (answered by Valiant)

**Q: Are Saori's tokens locked?**  
A: Ash indicated this isn't a major concern as Saori "could have top blasted his huge NFT airdrop and didn't" (answered by ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **.hyp shaman helped Lastraum** with performance optimization for 3D models, suggesting using glb.babylonpress.org, .webp format, and LODs for optimization.

2. **Ash helped Lastraum** by identifying performance issues in Tile Dash, noting that the app was running at 30+ms in Angzaar world vs 5ms in blank world, suggesting world-specific optimization issues.

3. **Lastraum helped Ash** by explaining how server-simulated physics with client-side colliders works as a workaround for DCL's lack of integrated physics.

4. **Lastraum helped Ash** with understanding Tile Dash gameplay, explaining there's a green safe zone for each level and clarifying the objective is to get as many tiles as possible, not necessarily complete levels.

5. **HypPrivakos warned the community** about potential scams when user Berko asked to buy NFTs through DM, advising using established platforms like OpenSea instead of OTC Discord sales.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Game Development Projects
- **Race System (Valiant)**: Announced a working race system with persistent storage for leaderboards. The system includes start/finish lines and gates that players must pass through, with a warning about "bad normals" causing issues.
- **Tile Dash (Lastraum)**: 
  - Updated to multiplayer with improved FPS, restart logic, and mobile compatibility
  - Added token reward system (25 tokens for completing a level)
  - Integrated with "The Forge" marketplace and includes a leaderboard system
  - Some players reported difficulty issues, particularly with the first level where lines sometimes appear directly under players' feet

### Technical Discussions
- **Performance Optimization**: 
  - User reported low FPS despite having a 5060 Ti GPU
  - 3D models ported from DCL identified as causing performance problems
  - Lastraum removed problematic models to improve performance
- **Physics Implementation**: Discussion between Ash and Lastraum about implementing physics in DCL, using server-simulated physics with client-side colliders to prevent players from walking through objects
- **Feature Development**: Ash mentioned plans for occlusion culling but noted it wasn't a current priority

### Community & Token Concerns
- **Token Direction**: Community members expressed frustration about lack of information regarding token roadmap and planning
- **Community Tensions**: Discussion about a former member (Saori) who continues to criticize the project externally while still using Hyperfy technology
- **Marketing Strategy**: Call for more community interaction on X (Twitter) to support official Hyperfy accounts and builders

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How does Lastraum implement physics in DCL without players walking through objects?** (asked by ash)  
A: Server simulated physics and client side colliders block players from going through objects, with Colyseus server for WebSocket connections (answered by Lastraum)

**Q: Is occlusion culling in the latest dev?** (asked by .hyp shaman)  
A: No, it got pushed aside but there are plans for it (answered by ash)

**Q: Are NLA tracks supported?** (asked by .hyp shaman)  
A: No, they're not supported yet (answered by Valiant)

**Q: What's the objective in Tile Dash?** (implied by ash's comments)  
A: The objective is to get as many tiles as you can, not necessarily how many levels (answered by Lastraum)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Performance Optimization for 3D Models**
   - Helper: .hyp shaman
   - Helpee: Lastraum
   - Context: Performance issues with 3D models
   - Resolution: Suggested using glb.babylonpress.org for optimization and using .webp format and LODs

2. **Performance Analysis of Tile Dash**
   - Helper: ash
   - Helpee: Lastraum
   - Context: Performance analysis of Tile Dash
   - Resolution: Identified that the app runs at 5ms CPU in blank world vs 30+ms in Angzaar, suggesting world-specific issues

3. **NLA Track Issues**
   - Helper: Valiant
   - Helpee: Lastraum
   - Context: Issues with NLA tracks causing matrix transform errors
   - Resolution: Suggested stripping them out

4. **Tile Dash Game Mechanics**
   - Helper: Lastraum
   - Helpee: ash
   - Context: Difficulty issues with Tile Dash game
   - Resolution: Explained there's a green safe zone in each level and clarified the game objective is collecting tiles, not completing levels

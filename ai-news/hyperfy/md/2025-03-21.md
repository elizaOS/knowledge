## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does anyone know if there is a way to extract the code from apps without having to open them in a v2 world?**  
A: appTools.js in the engine shows how to do this (answered by ash)

**Q: How do I make a door to open and close with a shifter + a button model in V1?**  
A: Pretty sure you can do it all in one. But yeah could be two buttons for simplicity (answered by ash)

**Q: What was causing the octree errors and performance issues?**  
A: Fire particles scaling to zero were making the octree create billions of subdivisions (answered by ash)

**Q: How can I check ping in Hyperfy worlds?**  
A: Type /stats in the world (answered by ash)

**Q: What camera modes are available in the Camera Manager app?**  
A: Follow, Orbit, Static and default (answered by Shiffty)

**Q: What is Caddy used for in Hyperfy deployments?**  
A: Caddy is a web server that coolify uses as a reverse proxy for domain assignment and port management (answered by HowieDuhzit)

**Q: What do I do if my mobile device is stuck in an infinite reload loop after setting graphics to high?**  
A: Clear the browser cache just for that website/for the current day (answered by ash)

**Q: How do you set a spawn point?**  
A: Use "/spawn set" command which sets it to where you are standing when you execute the command (answered by 0mka)

**Q: How hard would it be for a competitor to create something on par with hyperfy?**  
A: VC backed companies keep trying to do this but what ends up happening is they prioritize early revenue generation and management ends up watering the whole thing down. (answered by ash)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-19

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Progress
- **Hyperfy V2 Development**: The team is actively working on porting features from V1 to V2 while adding new capabilities like LOD support for 3D models.
- **World Engine**: Ashxn mentioned progress on the "world engine" and plans to shift focus to onboarding projects to build experiences.
- **AI Agents**: First version has agents able to observe people entering/leaving worlds and respond via text and emote animations. Future versions will enable agents to walk around and interact with environments.
- **HyperFone**: HowieDuhzit developed a phone interface within Hyperfy that can run apps, access wallets, and potentially enable cross-world communication.

### Technical Implementations
- **Collision System**: Detailed discussions about implementing collisions in Blender for Hyperfy V2, requiring custom properties on meshes and ensuring "Custom Properties" is selected during GLTF export.
- **OSC Integration**: MetaMike is developing OSC (Open Sound Control) integration for avatar control, including VRM puppeteering for VTuber-like functionality.
- **State Management**: Server-side state is sent to clients upon connection, but clients manage their own state afterward.
- **Object Authority Models**: Hyperfy supports various authority models (server authority, client authority, hybrid) using app.send() and app.on() for event communication.
- **GPU Instancing**: The engine references a single model and reduces calls by drawing it once and copying the result for duplicates, similar to Unity prefabs.

### AI Agents & Applications
- **Agent Types**: Community members are exploring various agent implementations including parenting bots, trading assistants, world builders, and interactive NPCs.
- **Implementation Options**: Discussions about self-hosting Eliza framework versus using paid platforms like vvaifu/Dasha, with a 10x price difference noted.
- **Creative Applications**: Ideas include creator clones for exhibits, gated events requiring agent interaction, and a post office system with agent-delivered messages and NFT-based stamps.

### Market & Token
- **Market Volatility**: HYPER token experienced significant price swings due to market turbulence caused by Trump-related tokens launching on Solana.
- **Circulating Supply Fix**: Saori created an API endpoint (hyperfy.xyz/api/circulating) that returns the accurate circulating supply (440,355,269.74098694) for CoinGecko.
- **Network Congestion**: Solana experienced high congestion during peak trading, requiring higher gas fees and slippage to push transactions through.

### 3D Design & Optimization
- **Optimization Techniques**: Discussions about GPU instancing, texture atlasing, and model optimization for web experiences.
- **Collider Plugin**: Scoe developed a Blender plugin for creating collider boxes, which Ashxn expressed interest in funding further development.
- **Engine Capabilities**: According to Ash, the engine can handle 9 billion trees in a world with proper LOD implementation.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do we get the app state?** (asked by Spizzy)  
A: State is an empty object by default. Anything put in server-side is sent to clients when they connect. On the client, you can update and store info about the current state as needed. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Is it possible to detect if an AI agent is present in a world?** (asked by felixdigit://)  
A: Agents would be like "apps" and can be figured out. The right-click context menu will be different from a player's. (answered by Saori and Ashxn)

**Q: How do we add collision via Blender for V2?** (asked by jar0d)  
A: Add custom properties to meshes in Blender and ensure "Custom Properties" is selected during export. (answered by hiroP and Ashxn)

**Q: Are we able to make network requests in object scripts?** (asked by m‚ÇÇ)  
A: Yes, fetch is available in the dev branch after running npm build. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What is the main difference between Dasha and Eliza framework?** (asked by bitpixi)  
A: Vvaifu (Dasha) is an agent building platform that's easy to set up but requires tokens for features, while Eliza can be self-hosted. (answered by MetaMike and peezy)

**Q: Is there a way AI-NPCs aka ai agents could be stored in inventory and spawned by anyone visiting your world?** (asked by felixdigit://)  
A: That's one of the goals of v2; the hosting site needs to support the app you're bringing into the world. (answered by maximus)

**Q: How does Hyperfy work?** (asked by bear)  
A: Fully multiplayer persistent world where you can edit everything in-world in realtime. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How is the circulating supply of HYPER calculated?** (asked by frank_grimes_sr)  
A: Saori created an API endpoint that excludes certain wallets to calculate the true circulating supply of 440,355,269.74 tokens. (answered by Saori)

**Q: What happened to cause the sudden price drop in HYPER?** (asked by zobo)  
A: Trump and Melania tokens launched, draining liquidity from the Solana ecosystem, causing network congestion and market-wide volatility. (answered by multiple users)

**Q: How does Hyperfy handle GPU instancing?** (asked by TheMattEmpire)  
A: The engine references a single model and reduces calls by drawing it once and copying the result for duplicates, similar to Unity prefabs. (answered by maximus)

## Community Help & Collaboration

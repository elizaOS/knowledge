# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-19

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy v2 Development
- The team is focused on completing the port from v1 to v2, adding agents, and improving the world engine
- V2 will eventually become a SaaS platform where users can pay for worlds without requiring crypto or NFT purchases
- LOD (Level of Detail) support is already implemented in v2
- The platform supports multiplayer persistent worlds where users can edit everything in real-time
- V1 worlds are considered "dead" except for building on the old platform

### AI Agents Implementation
- Agents in v2 can observe users, respond via text, and use emote animations
- Future versions will allow agents to walk around and interact with the environment
- Various agent concepts were discussed including parenting bots, creator clones, trading assistants, and world builder agents
- Technical implementation options were explored, comparing Eliza framework with Dasha/vvaifu platforms
- Self-hosting Eliza versus paying for vvaifu features has a 10x price difference

### Technical Optimization
- GPU instancing is handled by the engine, which references a single model to reduce calls
- The engine implements culling and can handle "9 billion trees in a world" with proper distribution
- Discussions about texture atlasing and model optimization for web experiences
- Scoe developed a Blender plugin for creating collider boxes
- Collider implementation requires an Empty as the Parent of objects with custom properties

### HYPER Token Market
- Market volatility affected the HYPER token, triggered by Trump-related tokens draining liquidity
- A large whale sold approximately 11M tokens, causing a price crash to around $0.03 before recovery
- Saori is working on fixing the market cap display issue by creating an API endpoint for CoinGecko
- The API calculates circulating supply (around 440,355,269 tokens) by excluding certain wallets
- Community members expressed continued faith in the project despite short-term volatility

### Community Projects
- A "HyperFone" app was created by a community member, functioning as a phone interface within Hyperfy worlds
- This could enable cross-world communication, wallet integration, and app installation
- Community members are creating hosting services for v2 worlds for users who aren't developers

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What is the current focus for Hyperfy v2 development?**  
A: Agents in v2, completing the port from v1 to v2, adding additional features, and showcasing the updated engine via streams. (Ashxn)

**Q: How do agents work in the first version of v2?**  
A: Agents can observe people coming into a world and leaving, chatting, etc., and then they can choose to respond via text and emote animations. Future versions will let them walk around and interact with the environment. (Ashxn)

**Q: What is the main difference between Dasha and Eliza framework?**  
A: vvaifu (Dasha) is an agent building platform that's easy to set up but requires tokens for features, while Eliza can be self-hosted. (MetaMike, peezy)

**Q: Will I be able to connect an existing Eliza Agent to an NPC?**  
A: Yes, that's what another user is currently working towards. (Jona)

**Q: How would a "pet/npc follower" be supported across different worlds?**  
A: The hosting site needs to support the app, which scans user data and implements the NPC version in that world. (maximus)

**Q: Does Hyperfy v2 support LOD (Level of Detail)?**  
A: Yes, LOD is implemented in v2 with documentation available at github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy/blob/main/docs/ref/LOD.md. (Saori)

**Q: How does authority of objects work in Hyperfy worlds?**  
A: It's flexible. The demo world is set up so anyone can build by default. (Ashxn)

**Q: How does Hyperfy handle GPU instancing?**  
A: The engine handles the concept of one model download and reference, similar to Unity prefabs. It also implements culling and can handle "9 billion trees in a world" with proper distribution. (maximus)

**Q: Is there any point in buying more v1 worlds now or should I wait for v2?**  
A: Don't buy, they're dead except for building on the old platform. V2 is rolling out now. (Saori)

**Q: How is the market cap being fixed?**  
A: Saori is creating an API endpoint for CoinGecko that calculates the circulating supply by excluding certain wallets. (Saori)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **peezy helped bitpixi** with self-hosting Eliza by explaining that it can be done by cloning the main repo and installing, noting the method in the docs is "giga bloated" with all plugins.

- **maximus directed ApeironCreations** to the appropriate channel (#scripting-help) for connecting Nani.ooo Smart Wallet to an agent.

- **Saori guided ApeironCreations** on implementing web3 connection for agent token distribution by suggesting checking the Solana branch for examples of passing web3 connection from React to scripting.

- **Ashxn helped Valiant** with colliders by explaining that an Empty needs to be the Parent of the object and its collider with custom properties.

- **bitpixi assisted Uuuuuuuuu** with converting 2D to 3D objects by recommending Trellis AI on HuggingFace and providing guidance on using Blender afterward.

- **Saori helped TheMattEmpire** understand LOD implementation by providing a link to LOD documentation in the GitHub repository.

- **scoe helped the community** by developing and sharing a Blender plugin on GitHub to simplify the process of creating collider boxes for Hyperfy.

- **devilsadvocate.sol advised Uuuuuuuuu** on trading strategy during volatility by suggesting cycling 10-15k in and out on price peaks to rebuild position.

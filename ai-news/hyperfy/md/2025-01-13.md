# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-13

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy V2 Development Progress
- **Major Milestone**: Apps are now executing in V2 local environments, potentially ahead of the estimated 2-week timeline (Ashxn)
- V2 is positioned as an open-source, browser-based 3D platform that allows users to create immersive worlds without code
- V0.2.0 was released with mobile/touch controls support
- The platform supports browser-based accessibility without downloads, cross-platform compatibility (desktop/mobile/VR), voice chat capabilities, and server-side physics simulation
- Deployment guides were created for various platforms including Digital Ocean, with community members successfully deploying on Ubuntu

### Technical Architecture & Features
- **Physics Implementation**: Server-side physics simulation is being implemented for better competitive games with cheating prevention
- **Collision System**: Detailed discussions about setting up collision for meshes, with explanations about how to properly configure rigidbodies and colliders in Blender
- **Blueprint Architecture**: Blueprints (formerly called app configs) contain all components needed to run an app, while an app is a single instance of a blueprint
- **AI Integration**: Plans for MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration and local LLM support via Ollama
- **Concurrent Users**: Hyperfy can support about 100 people in a single world instance, 300+ across multiple instances

### DAO Governance & Token
- **Token Launch**: Hyperfy recently launched a token on Solana with an airdrop for early adopters (registration period ended January 12, 2025)
- **Governance Structure**: Discussions about balancing centralized leadership with decentralized governance, with many favoring a "benevolent dictator" approach
- **Unclaimed Tokens**: Effectively burned/locked and taken out of circulation
- **Proposed Models**: Tiered bounty system for funding tasks with clear success criteria, retroactive rewards for valuable contributions

### 3D Design & Asset Creation
- **VRM Export Tools**: Debate about Blender-only approach versus Unity's UniVRM (which has better spring bone functionality)
- **Model Optimization**: Discussions about reducing material count and fixing normal issues in 3D models
- **Authentication**: While you can't prevent people from ripping and using avatars, badges can show NFT ownership

## Key Questions & Answers

### Platform & Development
- **Q**: What is the difference between apps and blueprints in v2? (hiroP)  
  **A**: Blueprints contain all components needed to run an app, while an app is a single instance of a blueprint. When editing an app, you're editing all instances with the same blueprint. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How does one set collision on an asset? (MetaMike)  
  **A**: In Blender, set up custom properties. For dynamic collision objects, you need a rigidbody node with type="dynamic" and a collider node with convex=true. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How can I reset a world? (MetaMike)  
  **A**: Use "rm -rf world" or "mv world world2" to generate a new one and switch back if needed. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How can we build an MMO? (SotoAlt)  
  **A**: That's the default state - when spinning up a local host, users can log in from different browsers and move things live. (maximus and MetaMike)

- **Q**: How many concurrent users can Hyperfy support? (moonshotcat)  
  **A**: About 100 people in a single world instance, 300+ across multiple instances. (maximus)

### Token & Governance
- **Q**: What happened with the remaining unclaimed tokens? (Throbby)  
  **A**: They were effectively burned. (Saori)

- **Q**: How will the DAO be structured? (multiple users)  
  **A**: Establishing a foundation with a balance between centralized leadership and community input, with retroactive rewards for valuable contributions being considered. (Saori)

- **Q**: Can I still claim tokens if I linked addresses previously? (merk)  
  **A**: As long as you registered before the cutoff date of Jan 12th, 2025, you can claim any time. (Knar)

### 3D Design
- **Q**: What's the best VRM exporting tool for Blender? (MetaRick)  
  **A**: Several options: VRM-Addon-for-Blender for Blender 3.6.1, newer extension for Blender 4.2+ at extensions.blender.org/add-ons/vrm/, and Mal's Blender VRM0 Utility for wiggle bones. (Ashxn, TheMattEmpire, and ᲼)

- **Q**: Does Hyperfy have lipsync functionality? (TheMattEmpire)  
  **A**: Hyperfy 1.0 had lip sync so Hyperfy 2.0 likely will too. (Whambammy⚡)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Troubleshooting
- **Collision Setup**: Ashxn helped MetaMike understand that a dedicated collision mesh with no materials is needed because threejs splits meshes into multiple pieces (one per material), and for dynamic-to-dynamic collision, convex colliders are required.

- **Deployment Issues**: When m₂ had issues deploying on Alma Linux, vincentskele and others suggested trying Ubuntu instead, which worked successfully.

- **Windows Deployment**: HPrivakos helped MetaMike run Hyperfy on Windows by suggesting Docker and sharing a working Dockerfile.

- **World Builder Issues**: When psy-sci couldn't see objects placed in their world, the community helped troubleshoot, eventually identifying Wallet Guard browser extension as the cause.

### Knowledge Sharing
- **Documentation Efforts**: hiroP created a shared HackMD document for Hyperfy development notes that multiple community members contributed to.

- **Model Extraction**: Knar helped bitpixi extract 3D models from a Hyperfy V1 world by explaining how to use browser developer tools to download .glb files.

- **DAO Governance**: maximus created a comprehensive document summarizing key points and ideas shared by community members about governance models.

### Resource Sharing
- **VRM Tools**: Multiple community members shared GitHub repositories and links to VRM export tools for different Blender versions.

- **Deployment Guides**: Ashxn created a deployment guide for Digital Ocean, while others shared configurations for different platforms.

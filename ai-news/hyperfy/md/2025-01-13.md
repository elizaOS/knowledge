# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-13

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy v2 Development Progress
- **Major Milestone**: Ashxn announced that apps are now executing in v2 local environments, potentially ahead of the estimated 2-week timeline
- The team is focused on building foundational technology rather than marketing, with a small core team (primarily Ash and Saori)
- A public playground is now available at play.hyperfy.xyz where anyone can experiment with the platform
- V2 is positioned as an open-source, browser-based 3D platform allowing users to create immersive worlds without code

### Technical Architecture
- **Blueprint System**: Blueprints (formerly called app configs) contain everything needed to run an app, while an app is a single instance of a blueprint
- **Physics Implementation**: Server-side physics simulation is being implemented for better cheating prevention in competitive games
- **Collision Detection**: Requires proper setup in Blender with custom properties; for dynamic objects, rigidbody nodes with type="dynamic" and collider nodes with convex=true are needed
- **Cross-Platform Support**: The platform works across desktop, mobile, and VR with browser-based access (no downloads required)

### DAO Governance & Token
- Extensive discussion about balancing centralized leadership with community input for Hyperfy's DAO structure
- Many community members favor a "benevolent dictator" approach where the core team maintains significant control
- Token claim period has closed with unclaimed tokens being effectively burned
- The team is working on a foundation structure to manage the treasury, likely implementing a bounty system with clear success criteria

### 3D Design & Asset Creation
- Multiple VRM export workflows discussed, including direct Blender addons and Unity with UniVRM
- Model optimization challenges addressed, particularly around flipped normals and excessive materials
- Confirmation that Hyperfy supports lipsync functionality (in v1 and likely in v2)

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: What is the difference between apps and blueprints in v2?  
  **A**: Blueprints contain everything needed to run an app, while an app is a single instance of a blueprint. When editing an app, you're editing all instances with the same blueprint.

- **Q**: How do you set collision on an asset?  
  **A**: You need to set up proper collision meshes in Blender with custom properties. For dynamic objects, you need a rigidbody node with type="dynamic" and collider nodes with convex=true.

- **Q**: How can we build an MMO where everyone can modify the world?  
  **A**: That's the default state in Hyperfy - when spinning up a local host, multiple users can log in from different browsers and move things live.

- **Q**: How do you reset a world?  
  **A**: Use "rm -rf world" or "mv world world2" to generate a new one and switch back if needed.

- **Q**: What's the best VRM exporting tool for Blender?  
  **A**: Several options mentioned: VRM Addon for Blender, Blender 4.2+ extension, and Mal's Blender VRM0 Utility for wiggle bones.

### Platform Capabilities
- **Q**: How many concurrent users can Hyperfy support?  
  **A**: Event managers have instanced 100 people in a single world, probably 300+ across multiple instances.

- **Q**: What are the PC spec requirements?  
  **A**: It runs on phones and most devices.

- **Q**: Does Hyperfy V2 allow real-time voice chat?  
  **A**: Yes, and it supports VR as well.

### Token & Governance
- **Q**: How will the DAO be structured?  
  **A**: The team is working on a foundation structure that balances team control with community input, likely using a bounty system with clear success criteria.

- **Q**: What happens to unclaimed tokens?  
  **A**: They are effectively burned.

- **Q**: Will token holders get special access to features?  
  **A**: It's challenging with open source, but token holders could commission features via treasury.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Support
- **Ashxn** helped **MetaMike** with setting up collision for meshes with multiple materials, explaining that a dedicated collision mesh with no materials is needed because ThreeJS splits meshes by material
- **vincentskele** assisted **maximus** with VPS setup challenges by sharing a simplified 3-step process including nginx configuration
- **Knar** helped **bitpixi** extract 3D model files from a Hyperfy world by explaining how to use browser developer tools to download .glb files
- **Valiant** supported **vincentskele** with model optimization, flipping normals and suggesting material count reduction

### Knowledge Sharing
- The community is collaboratively documenting findings in a shared HackMD document
- **maximus** created comprehensive notes capturing key points from the DAO governance discussion
- **á²¼** shared Mal's Blender VRM0 Utility plugin that adds one-click functionality for setting up wiggle bones in Blender
- **TheMattEmpire** shared information about UniVRM tools with Unity and later found a Blender 4.2+ extension

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-15

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Character Controls Update**: Ashxn pushed new character controls to the dev branch, receiving positive feedback after community testing. These controls will soon be merged to the main branch.
- **Mesh Instancing**: Detailed technical discussion about efficient mesh instancing in Hyperfy, with Ashxn explaining that the engine handles instancing automatically unless specifically disabled. The `clone()` method creates exact copies while maintaining resource efficiency.
- **First-Person View**: Ongoing improvements to first-person view, particularly when holding items. Alexa suggested implementing a view from the eyes that shows hands/feet when looking down for role-playing games.
- **Billboarding Techniques**: Discussion about implementing billboarding for non-UI meshes, with Ashxn sharing multiple approaches and suggesting a dedicated billboard node as a future improvement.
- **Networked Objects**: .hyp shaman shared progress on a networked rock object with color-changing capabilities.

### Community & Project Status
- **Team Relationships**: Discussion about Shaw and ai16z's relationship with the project, with Ashxn confirming Shaw is still involved and was on their last call.
- **Open Source Contribution**: Community members were encouraged to participate in the open-source project, especially if they want to see specific features implemented.
- **Domain Offering**: Fibelius offered to donate the "hyperfy.fi" domain to the project.

### Token & Economics
- **HYPER Token Concerns**: Some community members expressed frustration about token performance, while others defended the project's focus on building rather than price action.
- **Staking Plans**: Mention that staking functionality might be implemented after locked tokens unlock.
- **CEX Listings**: .hyp shaman suggested CEX listings are not beneficial as they "dilute the FDV and price dumps."

### Security
- **Scam Concerns**: Multiple users noted an increase in scam attempts in the Discord server.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical
- **Q**: How do I set a spawn point? (asked by Pete)  
  **A**: Use "/spawn set" to set it to your current location (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)

- **Q**: Is there any example of instancing a mesh in hyp code? (asked by hiroP)  
  **A**: You can use the clone() method, which creates an exact copy while the engine handles instancing automatically (answered by Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is clone == instancing from the pov of resource use? (asked by hiroP)  
  **A**: Yes, a clone is an exact copy of the mesh description, and the engine auto-instances things behind the scenes (answered by Ashxn)

- **Q**: Any tips for billboarding non-particle and non-UI meshes? (asked by hiroP)  
  **A**: You can grab the camera position/rotation and use that; there are different types of billboarding (answered by Ashxn)

### Community & Project
- **Q**: Are we on good terms with Shaw? (asked by Xukonth)  
  **A**: He was on our last call and is considered a "goat" (greatest of all time) (answered by Ashxn)

- **Q**: Will staking happen soon? (asked by ai16zgm)  
  **A**: It will likely only happen after locked tokens unlock (implied by ai16zgm)

- **Q**: Is a CEX listing good for HYPER? (implied question)  
  **A**: No, CEX listings "dilute the FDV and price dumps" (answered by .hyp shaman)

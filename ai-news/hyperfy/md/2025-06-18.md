## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What would be the best place to store .hyp files so they can be downloaded in-world?**  
*Asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom*  
A: You could contribute to `awesome-hyps` GitHub repo, upload to Hyperfy host, or wait for "the platform" coming soon. You can also call `world.open('https://somedomain.com/myapp.hyp', true)` from a script.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-09

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Mobile Optimization
- **Major Performance Breakthrough**: Significant optimization work has enabled the Hyperfy virtual world application to run on older mobile devices that previously couldn't handle it
- A 7-year-old Samsung S9 (described as a "potato" device) can now successfully run the application, even on a 4G connection
- Previously, the same device would only show a black screen with menu and chat box, unable to render the world graphics properly
- While the older device runs at higher CPU/GPU usage with some graphical compromises, the fact that it works represents a significant technical achievement for backward compatibility

### Content & Creation
- Discussion about Android_Jones' burning man art that was previously available in a virtual world
- Fibelius shared links to examples on Twitter/X
- Ashxn mentioned that a user has a burning man world in Hyperfy
- Enryt successfully imported a CloneX GLB file using simple drag-and-drop functionality, suggesting Hyperfy has intuitive 3D model import capabilities

**Q: Does the play world work on your Samsung S9?** (asked by Ashxn)  
**A:** "Currently it's potato friendly. Top work sir." (answered by Valiant)

**Q: Has anyone tried importing CloneX models into Hyperfy?** (implied by Enryt)  
**A:** Enryt confirmed drag-and-dropping the GLB file worked naturally.

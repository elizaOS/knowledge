# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **Major v2 Updates**: Ashxn implemented several significant features including a treasure chest for persistent storage and a health/damage system.
- **Breaking Change**: `control.setEffect` now requires using `world.getPlayer(playerId)` to get player handles, enabling better tracking of effects and proper cleanup when apps are destroyed.
- **UI Improvements**: Fixed scrolling issues in the inspector pane and enhanced health bar visuals.
- **Bug Fixes**: Camera initialization bug was fixed, ensuring correct initial position/rotation values.

### 3D Design & Assets
- **Hyperfy Tools for Blender**: Now available as an official Blender extension, installable directly through Blender's preferences.
- **Texture Rendering**: Changing texture filtering from "closest" to "linear" fixed blurriness issues in GLB files, though "closest" is preferred for pixel-perfect 3D pixel art.
- **VRM Format Troubleshooting**: Detailed workflow shared for properly rigging and exporting VRM models, including steps for armature creation, weight painting, and mesh joining.
- **Asset Optimization**: Discussions about combining multiple textures into one for VRM models and proper scaling to avoid octree problems.

### Community Projects
- **Asset Sharing**: Extensive compilation of Hyper files (.hyp) organized by user and channel source, including interactive objects, character systems, UI components, vehicles, and more.
- **AI Integration**: Brief mentions of AI voice functionality that was implemented but not yet packaged for distribution, and references to "grph soul" project building AI personalities with voice capabilities.
- **NFT Development**: Discussion about manually adding glb_url attributes to NFTs, uploading GLB files to Arweave, and including data transactions as hidden attributes.

### Events & Opportunities
- **RP1 Metaverse Platform**: Demo shared with $1,000 USD bounty for design challenges.
- **Upcoming Tutorial**: Announcement about a tutorial on hypkg & app roll-up coming next week.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: Is it possible to get the camera's current position and rotation before setting it?  
  **A**: Yes, but there was a bug where initial values were all zeros; this has been fixed.

- **Q**: Can I list player ID in the world?  
  **A**: Yes, this functionality is now available.

- **Q**: Can we get a setBoneTransform()?  
  **A**: Initially thought impractical due to animation overrides, but later recognized as valuable for features like head-turning and blended animations.

- **Q**: Is this the correct way to hide the original model/glb in v2? `cube.visible = false;`  
  **A**: Use `cube.active = false` instead.

### 3D Design
- **Q**: Where can I find the Blender tools?  
  **A**: Install directly through Blender's preferences under extensions and search for "hyperfy tools".

- **Q**: Why is my VRM upload throwing an error about skinned mesh nodes?  
  **A**: The model has bones not hooked up to meshes and needs proper rigging.

- **Q**: Do the fingers need to move in the VRM model?  
  **A**: Yes.

### NFTs & Integration
- **Q**: How do you add glb_url to NFTs?  
  **A**: You manually upload the glb to Arweave and have the data tx as part of the hidden attribute, same process as with VRM files.

- **Q**: People can get gated roles on Discord Via a Wallet Check for Solana?  
  **A**: Phantom was already supported.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Assistance
- **Ashxn** helped **Omka** fix scrolling issues in the inspector pane after the treasure chest update, identifying and resolving the bug within an hour.
- **Ashxn** offered to personally fix any apps broken by the `control.setEffect` change and provided migration instructions.
- **MisfitPIXELS** provided **bear** with a detailed step-by-step process for properly rigging and exporting VRM models.
- **Ashxn** helped **ApeironCreations** with image stretching in a display board by suggesting changing objectFit from 'fill' to 'cover' to maintain aspect ratio.

### Resource Sharing
- **HypPrivakos** and **0mka** compiled and shared extensive lists of .hyp files organized by channel and creator to help **fractilians**.
- **~/HowiEDuhzit** shared a floor asset with automatic origin-snapping script with **bear**.
- **untitled, xyz** confirmed **treed's** approach to adding glb_url attributes to NFTs was correct.

### Security Awareness
- **ApeironCreations** warned **simk** about a scammer impersonating Ashxn and explained how to verify real users by checking User ID.

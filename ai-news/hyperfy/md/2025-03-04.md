# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **V2 Platform Updates**: Ashxn implemented several significant features including a treasure chest for persistent storage and a health/damage system.
- **Breaking Change**: `control.setEffect` now requires using `world.getPlayer(playerId)` to get player handles, enabling better tracking of effects and proper cleanup when apps are destroyed.
- **Camera Improvements**: Fixed a bug where initial camera position/rotation values were all zeros on first frame.
- **UI Enhancements**: Fixed scrolling issues in the inspector pane and improved health bar visuals.

### 3D Design & Tools
- **Hyperfy Tools for Blender**: Now available as an official Blender extension, installable directly through Blender's preferences.
- **Asset Optimization**: Discussions on combining multiple textures into a single texture for better performance and reducing draw calls.
- **VRM Workflow**: Detailed exchanges about properly rigging and optimizing VRM models with multiple meshes.
- **Texture Rendering**: Fixed texture blurriness by changing settings from "closest" to "linear" for improved rendering.

### NFTs & Blockchain
- **3D NFT Creation**: Discussion about manually uploading GLB files to Arweave and including them as hidden attributes.
- **Token Discussions**: Conversations about cryptocurrency exchanges and verification of the legitimacy of a Nick Cannon token called "Wild 'N Out".

### AI & Voice Technology
- **AI Voice Implementation**: MetaMike mentioned having implemented AI voice functionality that works but needs to be packaged.
- **AI Personalities**: Reference to "grph soul," a project building AI personalities with voice capabilities.

### Community Projects
- **Sports Game Potential**: Discussion about creating sports games in Hyperfy, with Ashxn noting the basic mechanics needed.
- **Display Board Development**: A display board for JPEGs and PNGs was developed with help from Ashxn to maintain proper aspect ratios.
- **App Preservation**: Developers discussed ways to organize and preserve Hyperfy apps through initiatives like "hyperdex" and "hypdeck".

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: Is it possible to get the camera's current position and rotation before setting it?  
  **A**: Yes, but there was a bug where initial values were all zeros; this has been fixed (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Can I list player ID in the world?  
  **A**: Yes, this feature is now available (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Would it be possible to create a sports game in Hyperfy?  
  **A**: Yes, with mechanics like "pick up ball, run with ball, key to kick ball, goal triggers" (Ashxn)

### 3D Design
- **Q**: Where can I find the Hyperfy Blender tools?  
  **A**: Install directly through Blender by opening preferences, clicking extensions, and searching for "hyperfy tools" (~/HowiEDuhzit)

- **Q**: Why is my VRM upload throwing an error about not finding skinned mesh nodes?  
  **A**: Some bones are not properly hooked up to meshes (Valiant)

- **Q**: Do the fingers need to move in the VRM model?  
  **A**: Yes (bear)

### NFTs & Development
- **Q**: How do you handle glb_url for 3D NFTs?  
  **A**: Upload the glb to Arweave and have the data tx as part of hidden attribute, same process as with vrm files (untitled, xyz)

- **Q**: What's a good v2 site to check out?  
  **A**: "Tatted alien club pretty cool imo" (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Assistance
- **Ashxn** helped **~/HowiEDuhzit** by fixing a bug where camera position/rotation values were all zeros on first frame.
- **Ashxn** helped **Omka** by fixing scrolling issues in the inspector pane after the treasure chest update.
- **Ashxn** offered to personally fix any apps broken by the `control.setEffect` change if hyp files were sent to him.

### 3D Design Support
- **MisfitPIXELS** provided **bear** with a detailed step-by-step process for properly rigging and optimizing VRM models with multiple meshes.
- **~/HowiEDuhzit** shared a floor asset with automatic origin snapping functionality with **bear**.
- **Ashxn** helped **ApeironCreations** fix image stretching in a display board by suggesting changing objectFit from 'fill' to 'cover'.
- **Ashxn** helped **ùöüùöòùö°ùöüùöíùöéùöóùöóùöé** fix floor texture blurriness by changing texture settings from "closest" to "linear".

### Community Safety
- **ApeironCreations** helped **simk** identify a scammer impersonating Ashxn by explaining how to verify user IDs.

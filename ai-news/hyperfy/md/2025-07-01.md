# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-01

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Weight Painting App**: Gert-Jan Akerboom demonstrated a new app for particles that allows users to place elements like grass and flowers in worlds using weight painting.
- **Portable Apps System**: Ashxn outlined a vision for apps that can be "equipped" across different worlds, with a sophisticated object signing system to control permissions.
- **Data Persistence**: Discussion about using `world.get()` and `world.set()` functions for storing world-level data that persists after reload.
- **Content Layering**: HiroP proposed a "leaves" concept allowing users to subscribe to specific content themes that would follow them between worlds.

### Governance & Ownership
- **World Ownership Models**: Community discussed possibilities including worlds as NFTs and DAO-owned worlds.
- **Object Permissions**: Detailed explanation of how world owners could control what objects visitors can use:
  - No backpack items
  - Specific objects only
  - Objects from certain publishers
  - Codex objects with specific flux levels (1-5)

### Project Direction & Communication
- **Development vs. Marketing**: Ashxn characterized the project as "99% building, 1% marketing," prioritizing product development over token price.
- **Community Concerns**: Some members expressed frustration about disconnect between early promises and visible progress.
- **Progress Visibility**: Team pointed to weekly community calls on YouTube and plugin development in public channels as evidence of ongoing work.
- **V2 Accessibility**: Concerns raised about users needing to navigate through Discord links rather than having a proper web portal.

### Design
- **Logo Design**: Community debated potential logo changes, with most preferring the current lightning bolt over a proposed alternative that resembled a warning sign.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I store data in my world that persists after reload?**  
A: You can use `world.get(key)` and `world.set(key, value)` to store data at the world level. (Ashxn)

**Q: What progress has been made in the last 6 months?**  
A: Progress is visible through weekly community calls on YouTube and plugin development in public channels. (Reneil)

**Q: Why isn't there better communication about developments?**  
A: The team acknowledges communication is poor but prioritizes development over marketing; a litepaper is in progress but requires accuracy checks. (Ashxn)

**Q: How will object/app permissions work across worlds?**  
A: Objects can be signed with a publisher key, and world owners can set permissions for what visitors can use. (Ashxn)

**Q: What is netdata and why should I use it?**  
A: It's a monitoring tool for servers that provides charts and alerts about resource usage, helping detect issues like disk space running out. (hiroP)

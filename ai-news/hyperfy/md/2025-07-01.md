# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-01

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Architecture
- **Portable App System**: Ashxn detailed the upcoming system where objects can be equipped, used across worlds, and have permission controls through publisher signatures.
- **World Persistence**: Discussion about storing persistent data in worlds using `world.get()` and `world.set()` methods, with the portal app cited as an example implementation.
- **Content Layering**: HiroP proposed a "leaves" concept for content organization in worlds, allowing users to subscribe to specific content channels.
- **Web Integration Limitations**: Hyperfy V2 currently lacks webview functionality, though screensharing is available as a workaround. The `screen.hyp` component can share video but apparently not audio.

### Creative Tools & Applications
- **Weight Painting App**: Gert-Jan Akerboom demonstrated an app for particle placement in worlds, generating excitement about creative possibilities.
- **Performance Management**: A "codex" system with flux levels (1-5) was mentioned for managing application performance across worlds.

### Project Direction & Communication
- **Development Focus**: Ashxn described their approach as "99% building, 1% marketing," prioritizing product development before promotion.
- **Communication Concerns**: MUDBONE expressed frustration about lack of visible progress compared to promises made in a January podcast, while Ashxn acknowledged communication weaknesses.
- **Community Updates**: Reneil pointed to weekly community calls on YouTube and plugin development in a dedicated channel as evidence of ongoing work.

### Ownership & Governance Concepts
- **NFT Integration**: Discussion about the possibility of making worlds into NFTs.
- **DAO Governance**: Concept of self-owned worlds through DAOs with pre-programmed rules was explored.
- **Access Issues**: Current V2 can only be accessed through Discord links rather than through a proper website portal.

### Community Content Sharing
- **Metaverse Explorations**: MetaRick shared videos of past explorations in different metaverse environments, including webaverse and a Japanese platform.
- **Private Development**: Many community members are building projects privately before sharing them publicly.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I store data in my world that persists after reload?**  
A: You can use `world.get(key)` and `world.set(key, value)` to store data at the world level. The portal app uses it to store teleport position. (Ashxn)

**Q: How will portable apps work across worlds?**  
A: Objects can be signed with a publisher, and world owners can control what objects can be used through various permission levels. (Ashxn)

**Q: Do we have an app that is a screen in the world can show a designated webpage?**  
A: No webview in v2 yet. But you can use screenshare and show a tab or a stream. (0mka)

**Q: What progress has been made on the project since January?**  
A: There are weekly community calls on YouTube and plugins being built in public, but communication about developments needs improvement. (Reneil)

**Q: Why isn't there better communication about project direction?**  
A: The team is focused on building the tech first, with plans to focus on growth later when the product is ready. (Ashxn)

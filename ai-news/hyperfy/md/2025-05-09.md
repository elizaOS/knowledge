# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-09

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- The Hyperfy team has paused platform development to conduct R&D and determine the best direction, which is now "locked in" for execution
- Initial platform focus will be on Solana due to synergy with the Hyper token, though EVM mods already exist for self-hosting
- No specific launch dates were provided, with Ashxn noting it will "happen out of nowhere like most things we do here"

### Technical Implementations
- **Agent System**: The node-client for agents properly runs all systems regular players do, including physics and player controllers
- **Vehicle Physics**: Vehicles are being pivoted to use a single armature with bones for moving parts (wheels, doors, lights) to optimize draw calls
- **VRM Avatars**: Discussion confirmed that player avatars are using the VRM format, with optimization techniques shared for blendshapes in Blender
- **World Functionality**: V2 includes screenUV video with streaming, UV scrolling, and enhanced agent capabilities

### Integration & Deployment
- Hyperfy worlds can be embedded in Next.js applications via iframes, though the multiplayer component presents challenges for serverless applications like Vercel
- Hyperworld.host was recommended as a solution for embedding worlds or pointing subdomains to them
- React Native was mentioned as potentially enabling mobile app development for Hyperfy

### Hyper Token Utility
- Hyper token powers the marketplace, DAO, and a narrative-driven experience with digital items and avatars
- The "forge" allows users to mint digital items backed by the Hyper token
- Future staking plans were mentioned, though these are not imminent

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Will the platform be Solana or multi-chain?**  
A: "Initially the platform will be Solana focused as it has a synergy with our token, and yeah there are evm mods already for those self hosting." (Ashxn)

**Q: Do you think it's possible to spin a world on a next.js vercel web app?**  
A: "It's difficult to deploy on vercel because hyperfy requires a server to be running and vercel focuses on serverless applications." (peezy)

**Q: Is it possible to start making our own vehicles?**  
A: "Yes, everything is in the engine including skinnedmesh.getBone() and physics for raycasting suspension." (Ashxn)

**Q: Is there a single place/board kept up to date with core functionality for v2?**  
A: "The docs folder in the repo includes all functionality and is comprehensive, plus https://docs.hyperfy.xyz has community knowledge." (Ashxn)

**Q: When adding multiple NEON apps to a world, why doesn't the color setting remain unique for each app?**  
A: "The 'unique' setting applies to settings but the engine still instances meshes behind the scenes, causing them to share materials. You can unlink meshes with mesh.linked=false, but this reduces performance at scale." (ash)

**Q: Do you have a strategy for hyperfy token?**  
A: "Hyper is at the center of everything. It powers the marketplace, dao, an official story driven narrative with digital items and avatars, our forge mints digital items made by anybody backed by our token, we have plans for staking but thats a way off." (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### VRM Optimization Techniques
TheMattEmpire shared a technique for optimizing VRM blendshapes in Blender by combining multiple mesh blendshapes into presets using 'Make shape from mix', which helps reduce file size.

### World Integration Solutions
When Sceth iii asked about integrating Hyperfy worlds with Next.js websites, Ashxn suggested using hyperworld.host and either embedding an iframe in the Next.js website or pointing a subdomain to hyperworld. Peezy added context about the limitations of deploying on Vercel due to the multiplayer component requiring a server.

### Technical Issue Resolution
Ash helped Gert-Jan Akerboom resolve an issue with NEON apps in a world where color settings weren't being maintained individually. Ash explained the technical reason (mesh instancing) and provided a solution (setting mesh.linked=false), while noting performance implications.

### Agent Implementation Guidance
Ashxn guided 0mka on working with agent implementation, explaining that the node-client properly runs all systems regular players do and pointing to agent.mjs in the dev branch as a reference.

## Action Items

### Technical
- Convert existing avatars to VRM format for stonk market world (jin)
- Implement agent functionality using the node-client approach from dev branch (0mka)
- Optimize VRM blendshapes by combining them using 'Make shape from mix' in Blender (TheMattEmpire)
- Implement vehicle physics using skinnedmesh.getBone() and raycasting for suspension (~/drdoge.eth)
- Fix collisions in imported worlds (emotionull)
- Improve process for getting scraped and packaged worlds into Hyperfy (emotionull)
- Investigate performance-friendly solutions for maintaining unique material properties across instanced meshes (ash)

### Documentation
- Replace old hyperfy.how link with new docs.hyperfy.xyz in the link section (Gert-Jan Akerboom)
- Update documentation to reflect new vehicle implementation approach (Ashxn)

### Feature
- Vehicle system with single armature and bones for moving parts to optimize draw calls (Ashxn)
- Consider implementing React Native support for mobile app development (peezy)
- Explore portfolio use cases for 3D environment visualization (Sceth iii)
- Staking functionality for Hyper token (Ashxn)

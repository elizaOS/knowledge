# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Builder Interface Redesign**: Ashxn shared Figma mockups for a redesigned UI that separates regular player views from builder views, with a more intuitive tab-based organization including dedicated sections for world settings, documentation, app lists, and app configuration.
- **keepActive Feature**: A new feature was discussed that allows apps to remain live while being moved, preserving their state, scale, and rotation.

### World Structure & Development
- **Git-Friendly World Structure**: Proposals for improving the world folder structure to be more git-friendly and AI-friendly, with a manifest-based system that maps human-readable assets to hashed files.
- **Codebase Organization**: 0mka and Ashxn debated approaches to refactoring the codebase, with 0mka suggesting folder restructuring and import path standardization.

### Feature Requests & Ideas
- **Object Importer**: Maximus described a dream feature for an object importer that would allow users to bring items from their blockchain wallets or external data sources into worlds without gaining builder permissions.
- **Engage-MINT Systems**: Agent12 shared their vision for systems that would add value to interactable objects, allowing for rogue-like growth games where users earn tokens through interactions.
- **Enhanced Summon App**: Suggestions for improvements to include hittable objects and different skins for throwable items.

### Technical Issues
- **Black Screen Problems**: Multiple users reported experiencing black screens when loading Hyperfy worlds, potentially related to wallet extensions like Phantom.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does the keepActive option solve keeping the scale size of something when you are moving it?**  
A: Yes (confirmed by Ashxn)

**Q: Does anyone have any examples of .hyp files/folders?**  
A: The world folder is an engine/artifact format you're not supposed to manually change things (explained by Ashxn)

**Q: Can I edit the code snippets with the IDE? Or is it advised to do so inworld?**  
A: You can keep your own format in vscode etc and version control that, but you'd be copying pasting back and forth (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: If there was one hype you wanted for a world you are building in, what would it be?**  
A: The main dream hype is an object importer that can read a person's blockchain wallet or a data source they provide (answered by Maximus)

**Q: How can I fix black screens when loading worlds in Hyperfy?**  
A: Try clearing site data in developer tools (Chrome/Brave) or refreshing when authentication options don't appear (suggested by Roustan and vox)

**Q: Could Phantom wallet be causing black screens in Hyperfy?**  
A: Possibly, as vox experienced similar issues with Phantom wallet related to authentication options not appearing

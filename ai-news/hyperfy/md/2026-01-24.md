# Hyperfy Discord - 2026-01-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy v1 to v2 Conversion
- Jin developed a conversion pipeline for Hyperfy v1 worlds to v2
  - Initially required Blender but later streamlined to direct v1→v2 conversion
  - Successfully ports models, spawn points, skies, environment elements, audio, text, and images
  - Challenges remain with skinned/animated models and lighting
  - Goal is to provide all world owners with ready-to-launch v2 worlds and assets

### Technical Architecture
- Ash clarified that v2 is more streamlined than v1:
  - Runs on a single server with a data-driven approach
  - Easier to host but requires some technical knowledge
  - Doesn't support Draco/Meshopt compression or dedicated light nodes
  - Uses emissive materials instead of light nodes

### Cloud Services & Development
- Discussion about a fly.io service providing virtual machines for AI agents
  - Features hibernation when not in use to avoid unnecessary charges
  - Backup/restore functionality in development
- "Hyper scape" identified as a modified fork of Hyperfy
- Webviews feature in development (GitHub PR #147 by Saori)

### Community Resources
- ToxSam - IBIH shared an update to the Open Source Avatars website (opensourceavatars.com)
  - Improved finder page with expanded avatar collections

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What is the fly.io service?**  
A (ash): It's meant for giving agents a VM in the cloud to work in, but easier to use than fly.io itself. It has hibernation features to avoid charges when not in use.

**Q: Does "hyper scape" have anything to do with Hyperfy?**  
A (𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓): Yes, it's built off Hyperfy.

**Q: Does v2 have draco / meshopt / EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing gltf extension support?**  
A (ash): None of those! Ultra simple.

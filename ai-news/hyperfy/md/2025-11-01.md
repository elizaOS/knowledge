## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a place that lists all the latest V2 worlds suitable for students?**  
A: "Here, https://discord.com/channels/958209073277456457/1420766572720689214 i think mine is ok for kids : )" (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)

**Q: Is there a simple way to rename a model that I bring in? I want it to have colliders.**  
A: "If you name the model before you drag it in world it will have that name otherwise you can rename your app by changing the metadata (tag looking icon)." (answered by .hyp shaman)

**Q: Is there a way to create collections and folders to organize the models more easily once they are in world?**  
A: "Currently there isn't a way to manage collection from within a world all that stuff happens before the world spins up." (answered by .hyp shaman)

**Q: Are the framed primitives available in the main branch?**  
A: No, they are development branch only for now. (answered by Valiant)

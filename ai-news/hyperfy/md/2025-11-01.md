# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-01

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Component Development
- **Framed Image & Video Components**: Valiant released a "Framed Image" component (v1) and later extended it to a "Framed VideoPlayer" (v1) following community feedback. The video player was implemented with a TV-like frame as suggested by 3rdEyeVisuals.
- **Audio Reactivity**: .hyp shaman suggested adding audio reactivity features to visualizations, noting it could be effectively simulated in the current implementation.

### Platform Comparisons
- **Hyperfy vs. Otherside**: Roustan created a simple world in Hyperfy to demonstrate its ease of use compared to Otherside, even getting the Improbable CEO to try it. This was shared via Twitter as a practical comparison between the platforms.

### 3D Model Management
- **Model Organization**: Discussion about the limitations of organizing models within worlds. Currently, organization needs to happen before world initialization, with no in-world collection management available.
- **Collision Implementation**: Clarification that the default cube already has collisions implemented via code rather than being prebaked into the GLB file.

### Performance Optimization
- **Draco Compression**: highlander mentioned potentially implementing Draco compression, noting server-side implementation challenges despite its significant performance benefits.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Is there a simple way to rename a model that I bring in? I want it to have colliders.  
   **A**: If you name the model before you drag it in world it will have that name, otherwise you can rename your app by changing the metadata (tag looking icon).

2. **Q**: Is there a way to create collections and folders to organize the models more easily once they are in world?  
   **A**: Currently there isn't a way to manage collections from within a world; all that organization happens before the world spins up.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **3D Model Renaming**
   - **Helper**: .hyp shaman
   - **Helpee**: fractilians
   - **Context**: User needed to know how to rename imported models to have colliders
   - **Resolution**: Explained that models can be renamed before importing or through the metadata tab, and clarified that default cubes already have collision via code

2. **Video Player Enhancement**
   - **Helper**: 3rdEyeVisuals
   - **Helpee**: Valiant
   - **Context**: Suggesting design improvement for framed video player
   - **Resolution**: Valiant implemented a TV-like framed video player as suggested

3. **Platform Demonstration**
   - **Helper**: Roustan
   - **Helpee**: BAYC community (implied)
   - **Context**: Demonstrating Hyperfy's ease of use compared to Otherside
   - **Resolution**: Created a simple world as a demonstration and shared via Twitter

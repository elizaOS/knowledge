## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q:** Is it possible to extract the GLB from within a .hyp file?

2. **Q:** How do I download the current GLB?  
   **A:** "Shift+click the model button (cube button) in the app details" (answered by **ash**)

3. **Q:** How do I navigate in vibe.hyperfy?  
   **A:** "Hit tab, then right click something" (answered by **ash**)

4. **Q:** Why does Hyperfy Twitter link show hyperfy.xyz instead of hyperfy.io?  
   **A:** "Hyperfy.io is the old (classic) platform, hyperfy.xyz is our next-gen tech" (answered by **ash**)

5. **Q:** What's the status with crypto wallet integration in v2?  
   **A:** "There's a solana-v2 branch but it needs a rebase. That's what the Fallen world uses." (answered by **ash**)

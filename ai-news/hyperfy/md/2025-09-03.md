# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Building & Editing Tools
- **Multi-select functionality** was a major discussion point, with TheMattEmpire advocating for improvements to the current single-asset selection limitation
- The community debated workflows between building in **Blender versus directly in Hyperfy**, with some preferring collaborative in-world building
- **Vibe world** (vibe.hyperfy.xyz) received significant attention as users created complex 3D objects using AI prompts with simple commands like `/create` and `/edit`
- Users shared impressive creations including a rideable roller coaster and a drone swarm with shape-changing capabilities
- The ease and speed of creation in Hyperfy compared to platforms like Decentraland was highlighted

### Technical Infrastructure
- Discussion of **world hosting options** including fly.io and hyperworld.host for deploying spaces with user limits
- Clarification that **hyperfy.io** is the classic platform while **hyperfy.xyz** is the next-gen technology
- Methods for creating multiple local development worlds by modifying the `.env` file
- Admin functionality implementation requiring an `ADMIN_CODE` in the `.env` configuration
- File format insights: `.hyp` files are essentially GLB files with text metadata

### Development Status
- HiroP inquired about **crypto wallet integration** in v2, with ash pointing to an existing solana-v2 branch
- Performance optimization discussions for VR applications and complex AI-generated objects
- Reports that vibe world stopped generating new objects, possibly due to someone prompting a particle accelerator

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it possible to select more than one asset at a time in Hyperfy?**  
A: Currently not possible, with no definite timeline for implementation (ash)

**Q: How do I create an experimental world?**  
A: Change the WORLD variable in the .env file and run npm run dev (Shiffty)

**Q: When you download a .hyp file, is there any way to extract the GLB from within it?**  
A: Hyp is just a GLB with text metadata. You can change the file extension from .hyp to .glb, or shift+click the model button in the app details to download the current GLB (maximus, ash)

**Q: Why does the Hyperfy Twitter link show hyperfy.xyz instead of hyperfy.io?**  
A: hyperfy.io is the old (classic) platform, hyperfy.xyz is the next-gen tech (ash)

**Q: How can I set an admin? My world is open and everyone can edit.**  
A: Set your .env ADMIN_CODE, then type "/admin <code>" in chat to become admin (ash)

**Q: What's the minimum requirement to run Hyperfy smoothly?**  
A: By default it runs on minimal resources; performance depends on what you put in the world (ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Shiffty helped TheMattEmpire** create multiple local development worlds by explaining how to change the WORLD variable in .env file
- **ash assisted web-gnar** with extracting GLB files from .hyp files and navigating in vibe world
- **vox guided Wilson** who couldn't see the chat box to create objects, advising to press enter to access it
- **vox helped Valiant** locate and make visible an invisible drone swarm object
- **Gert-Jan Akerboom suggested** using collection instances in Blender as a workaround for multi-select limitations
- **Valiant recommended** hyperworld.host $5 option as a safe hosting solution with user limits

## Action Items

### Technical
- Rebase the solana-v2 branch for crypto wallet integration (mentioned by ash)
- Fix bug in vibe world where zero-height cone was causing physics issues (mentioned by ash)
- Fix vibe world generation issue possibly related to particle accelerator prompt (mentioned by vox)
- Optimize performance for complex objects like drone swarm (mentioned by vox)
- Set ADMIN_CODE in .env file to restrict editing privileges (mentioned by ash)
- Optimize assets for better performance in VR applications (mentioned by Valiant)

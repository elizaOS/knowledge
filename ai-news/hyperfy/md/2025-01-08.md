# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy V2 Launch & Development
- **V2 Release Imminent**: The open-source, self-hostable Hyperfy V2 is launching within a week, with the GitHub repository already available at https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy
- **Technical Architecture**: Developers are exploring the V2 codebase, figuring out configuration formats for world.js and app config.js files
- **Deployment Success**: Several developers have successfully deployed local instances and even hosted instances on VPS servers with HTTPS support
- **Performance Improvements**: V2 is lightweight (requiring only 1-2GB RAM) with better performance than V1
- **Current Capabilities**: The platform currently supports basic 3D model placement with movement, duplication, and deletion functionality
- **Limited Functionality**: V2 is still early with support for model placement but lacking UI elements, skyboxes, lighting, and sound
- **Community Documentation**: Developers are collaborating on unofficial documentation through a shared HackMD document

### AI Integration
- **Eliza AI Agent**: Ashxn demonstrated an AI agent named Shaw that can interact with users in real-time within worlds
- **Object Interaction**: AI agents can control world elements without coding knowledge
- **Future Navigation**: The team is working on enabling AI agents to navigate worlds in V2

### $HYPER Token
- **Airdrop Details**: Eligibility limited to V1 world owners (snapshot from December 7) and holders of 100k+ ai16z tokens (snapshot from December 25)
- **Claim Process**: Registration at hyperfy.io/airdrop closes January 12, after which unclaimed tokens will be burned
- **Token Utility**: Saori mentioned plans for token utility within the open source codebase, expected within a month
- **Price Discussion**: Community members discussed price volatility following the token's launch on Solana

### Platform Transition
- **V1 to V2 Migration**: V1 worlds won't automatically transfer to V2, though V1 will continue to function without guarantee of long-term support
- **Asset Compatibility**: The same 3D models, avatars, and emotes from V1 will be supported in V2
- **NFT Integration**: V2 will maintain the "wallet as backpack" concept for NFT integration

## Key Questions & Answers

### V2 Platform
- **Q**: Will V2 support an in-game marketplace and custom currencies?  
  **A**: These features are being considered as part of the vision for high customization and interoperability (maximus)

- **Q**: Can we use wallet as inventory so each NFT is a 3D asset?  
  **A**: V1 supports the wallet as a backpack concept, and V2 will be able to read wallet contents (maximus)

- **Q**: Will there be a customization interface for agents/characters?  
  **A**: The team is working to support this, having done similar things in V1 (PabloFM)

- **Q**: Is there any ETA for V2?  
  **A**: Less than a week (maximus)

- **Q**: How do I move objects vertically in V2?  
  **A**: Hold shift and move mouse (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How much RAM is needed to self-host a V2 world?  
  **A**: It's lightweight - tests ran with 512MB, but 1-2GB recommended (Ashxn)

- **Q**: What will V2 offer that V1 doesn't?  
  **A**: Better performance, open source, self-hostable, better in-world editing including in-browser coding (Ashxn)

### $HYPER Token
- **Q**: How can I claim the $HYPER airdrop?  
  **A**: Register ETH and SOL addresses at hyperfy.io/airdrop, wait 24 hours, then claim at hyperfy.xyz/claim (maximus)

- **Q**: What happens to unclaimed airdrop tokens?  
  **A**: Remaining tokens will be burned after January 12 (maximus)

- **Q**: Why was the airdrop claim extended?  
  **A**: "They only had a month to submit and a lot of people who supported us hadn't really been paying attention" (Saori)

- **Q**: How many tokens were airdropped per world?  
  **A**: About 151,200 per world (maximus)

- **Q**: Does the airdrop work if my Hyperfy NFT is on ETH?  
  **A**: Yes, if you had it on December 7th when the snapshot was taken (PabloFM)

### AI Integration
- **Q**: How do AI agents interact with the world?  
  **A**: They can trigger actions in the world without requiring coding knowledge (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is there a way to verify VRM ownership in Hyperfy?  
  **A**: Proving ownership as a badge is possible, but DRM protection would be an endless battle (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Development Support

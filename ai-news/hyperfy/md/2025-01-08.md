# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy V2 Launch
- **Open Source Release**: Hyperfy V2 is being released as an open-source, self-hostable metaverse platform, with the GitHub repository now available at https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy
- **Technical Architecture**: V2 features a completely new engine with significantly improved performance, in-browser coding capabilities, and better in-world editing tools
- **Resource Requirements**: The platform is lightweight enough to run on servers with as little as 512MB RAM, though 1-2GB is recommended for optimal performance
- **Current State**: The initial release is minimal with basic functionality (drag-and-drop models, move/duplicate/destroy), with more features planned including GUI tools, apps infrastructure, and persistence
- **Community Documentation**: Developers are collaborating on a shared HackMD document (https://hackmd.io/@metamike/hyperfy-communal-note-pool) to aggregate knowledge and discoveries

### AI Integration
- **Eliza AI Agents**: Ashxn demonstrated an AI agent named Shaw that can interact with users in real-time within worlds
- **Codeless Interaction**: The system allows AI agents to control world elements without requiring coding
- **Future Plans**: AI agents will be able to roam worlds in V2, with voice integration planned
- **Technical Implementation**: The system appears to use Blender for character creation and ElizaOS framework for AI functionality

### $HYPER Token
- **Airdrop Extension**: The deadline for linking ETH and SOL wallets for the $HYPER airdrop has been extended to January 12th, 2025
- **Token Utility**: Saori mentioned plans for token utility within the open source codebase, with implementation expected within a month
- **Market Performance**: The token experienced significant price volatility after launch, with an initial spike followed by a substantial decline (approximately 80% from peak)
- **Community Sentiment**: Users are divided between those concerned about the price drop and others who view it as normal consolidation after a token launch

### Platform Transition
- **V1 to V2 Relationship**: V1 NFT worlds will not automatically transfer to V2; they will remain on Hyperfy.io while V2 will be the focus moving forward
- **Accessibility**: V2 removes the NFT requirement to build worlds, making the platform more accessible
- **Cross-World Connectivity**: A "One avatar, every world" feature is being implemented, initially supporting Phantom wallet with plans to expand to other chains and web2 integrations

### Security Concerns
- **Phishing Attempts**: The team warned about scammers creating fake "ticket" or "eligibility check" threads to steal private keys
- **Security Incident**: Someone claiming to be a security researcher threatened the team and temporarily took down the website
- **Team Response**: The team is actively addressing these security issues while managing the V2 launch

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Questions
- **Q**: How performant of a server do we need when hosting ourselves?  
  **A**: "It's actually really lightweight - we were running a world with 512mb of RAM, but recommend 1-2GB as the world simulates on the server with all models." (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Will v2 support an in-game marketplace and custom currencies?  
  **A**: These features are being considered as part of the vision for high customization and interoperability (maximus)

- **Q**: Can we use wallet as inventory so each NFT is a 3D asset?  
  **A**: V1 supports the wallet as a backpack concept, and V2 will likely be able to read wallet contents (maximus)

- **Q**: What will be the difference between v2 and v1?  
  **A**: "Totally new engine, much more performance, open source, self hostable, better in-world editing including coding in-browser." (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How did you create the AI agent?  
  **A**: Using Blender, with custom scripts that aren't open-sourced (jin)

- **Q**: Are there plans to verify VRM ownership inside hyperfy?  
  **A**: "It's a tricky situation. Proving ownership as a badge is possible, but DRM to protect using stuff is an endless battle." (Ashxn)

### Token & Airdrop Questions
- **Q**: What are the plans for token utility?  
  **A**: Saori mentioned they have "cool ideas for how tokens can be used in the open source codebase" but won't share details yet, expecting implementation in about a month

- **Q**: Why was the airdrop claim extended?  
  **A**: Because people only had a month to submit and many supporters hadn't been paying attention (Saori)

- **Q**: Does the airdrop work if my Hyperfy NFT is on ETH?  
  **A**: Yes, if you had it on December 7th when the snapshot was taken (PabloFM | Numinia)

- **Q**: Why does my wallet show as "not eligible" despite registering?  
  **A**: Registration updates are processed in batches which can take 24+ hours; the team is running behind schedule due to v2 launch (maximus)

- **Q**: What if I changed my SOL address after registering?  
  **A**: This causes complications in the automated process and will take 12-24 hours to resolve (maximus)

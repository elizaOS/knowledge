- **Skybox & Fog Effects**: Discussion about implementing skybox rotation and enhancing fog effects for atmospheric environments
- **Billboarding Techniques**: Solutions shared for non-UI meshes with performance considerations
- **Mesh Instancing**: Clarification that clone() creates instances with automatic engine optimization
- **The Grid Mist Issue**: Problem with mist behavior that appears to resolve when color is set

### HYPER Token & Community
- **Website Update**: Clarification that hyperfy.xyz is the current website (replacing hyperfy.io), containing more relevant information including a litepaper
- **Token Economics**: Discussion about HYPER's price being influenced by SOL, which follows ETH/BTC and fiat trends
- **Community Dynamics**: Tension between token-focused members and development-focused members, with calls for constructive participation

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
- **Q**: How can I set a spawn point?  
  **A**: Use "/spawn set" to set it to your current location

- **Q**: Is there any example of instancing a mesh in hyp code?  
  **A**: You can clone meshes with "const quad2 = quad.clone(true)" and the engine handles instancing automatically

- **Q**: Any tips for billboarding non-particle and non-UI meshes?  
  **A**: You can grab camera position/rotation and use that; code examples were provided

### HYPER Token
- **Q**: Do we need a website like hyperfy.io?  
  **A**: The new website hyperfy.xyz has more relevant info like the litepaper

- **Q**: Is HYPER listed on any exchanges, and is it affected by BTC and ETH price movements?  
  **A**: It has low volume ($12k 24h) and is primarily affected through SOL, which connects to ETH/BTC and fiat

- **Q**: When will staking happen?  
  **A**: Likely after locked tokens unlock

### Community
- **Q**: Are we on good terms with Shaw?  
  **A**: "shaws a goat" (indicating positive relationship)

- **Q**: Why are there so many scam tags in this server compared to others?  
  **A**: Possibly because whoever is behind the scams is still in the server

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Assistance
- **Mesh Instancing Help**: Ashxn helped hiroP with mesh instancing, explaining that clone() creates instances and the engine handles optimization automatically
- **Billboarding Solutions**: Ashxn provided code examples for different billboarding approaches with performance considerations
- **Spawn Point Setting**: Gert-Jan Akerboom helped Pete with the correct command for setting spawn points

### Community Guidance
- **.hyp shaman** explained HYPER price relationships to haihui, describing the price chain: "hyper <~> sol, sol <~> eth or btc <~> fiat"
- **untitled, xyz** addressed community frustration by explaining that many community members are both creators and holders, emphasizing the open-source nature of the project

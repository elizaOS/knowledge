# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Character Controller & Locomotion System
- **New Locomotion System**: Ashxn introduced a new system that locks directional movement forward (similar to Fortnite/UE), allowing players to strafe while facing the camera direction
- The update improves VR and first-person modes, weapon handling, and creates a more intuitive experience
- First-person view implementation was well-received by the community
- Several developers tested the new system with positive feedback, though some compatibility issues were identified

### Technical Implementations
- **Mesh Instancing**: Discussions about efficient ways to clone and instance meshes in Hyperfy
- **Billboarding Techniques**: Code examples shared for implementing billboarding effects for non-particle and non-UI meshes
- **Skybox Rotation**: Implementation methods and potential speed settings discussed
- **Fog Effects**: Issues with "the Grid" mist behavior were mentioned

### Community & Token Discussions
- Conversations about HYPER token price relationships with SOL, ETH, and BTC
- Website changes from older version to hyperfy.xyz, which now contains the litepaper
- Some community tension between those focused on token price and those emphasizing development
- Mention of hyperfy.fi domain being reserved for potential donation to the project
- Concerns about scams in the server with warnings to be cautious about clicking links

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
- **Q**: How can I set a spawn point in a world?  
  **A**: Use "/spawn set" to set it to your current location

- **Q**: How can I instance a mesh in Hyperfy code?  
  **A**: You can clone the mesh with quad.clone(true) and then add it with app.add(quad2)

- **Q**: Is clone equivalent to instancing from a resource usage perspective?  
  **A**: Yes, a clone is an exact copy of the mesh description, and the engine auto-instances things behind the scenes

- **Q**: How can I implement billboarding for non-particle and non-UI meshes?  
  **A**: You can use the camera position/rotation or use the provided code examples

### Community & Token
- **Q**: Does anyone talk to Shaw? What happened with ai16z?  
  **A**: "They all just ghosted x and kept building"

- **Q**: Are we on good terms with Shaw?  
  **A**: "Shaw's a goat"

- **Q**: Is HYPER listed on any exchanges, and is it affected by BTC and ETH price movements?  
  **A**: It has low 24h volume and follows a price chain: hyper <~> sol <~> eth or btc <~> fiat

- **Q**: Do we need a website like hyperfy.io?  
  **A**: The new website hyperfy.xyz has more relevant info like the litepaper

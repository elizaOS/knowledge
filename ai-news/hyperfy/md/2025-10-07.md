# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI Integration & Generative Tools
- **Real-time Style Transfer**: Several users demonstrated using external AI tools like Decart.ai and Krea to apply real-time visual filters to Hyperfy environments through screen-sharing
- **Vibe Prompting System**: Users with API keys can generate 3D assets using chat commands like "../create" to build ThreeJS primitive-based objects (cubes, cylinders, spheres)
- **AI-Generated Environments**: Vox described how Hypercity was created over 4-5 days using the prompt-based asset generation system, demonstrating the potential for complex environment creation
- **Future Possibilities**: Discussion about potential for infinite procedurally generated worlds, though this capability doesn't currently exist

### Development & Technical Features
- **HLS Stream Support**: Valiant introduced a modified video player application that adds HLS (.m3u8) stream support to the built-in video app
- **Camera Direction Access**: Developers discussed implementing shooting mechanics by accessing player camera direction using quaternion conversion
- **Hyperfy-to-Blender Resource**: A resource for transferring Hyperfy content to Blender was shared
- **Humoto Dataset**: Discussion about compatibility issues with the Humoto motion dataset, which was resolved by changing file extensions

### NFT & Virtual Worlds
- **MidnightBreeze Project**: Agent12 discussed their Hyperfy virtual world containing hidden areas accessible only to Breeze NFT owners
- **Performance Optimization**: Current version of the MidnightBreeze world was described as "SUPER un-optimized" with slow loading times
- **Upcoming Improvements**: A V2 with fully animated versions of the banners is in development

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why does my world look so white washed?** (asked by Harambe Advocate)  
**A:** Change the HDR in the v1 sky app, try the presets or Day 1 (answered by vox)

**Q: Is the AI layer happening in real time inside hyperfy or as a rendering layer from camera/screen output?** (asked by Sceth iii)  
**A:** It's a rendering layer from camera/virtual camera (answered by Valiant)

**Q: How does that work? You generate 3D AI assets and create a world, or there is a tool that generates the whole stack?** (asked by Sceth iii)  
**A:** You can use chat commands like "../create whatever" to generate 3D assets built with ThreeJS primitives if you have your API key in Hyperfy (answered by vox)

**Q: Is there a way to get access to where the player is looking for a shooter game?** (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom)  
**A:** Yeah if you get the camera quaternion you can turn that into a directional vector and that's the direction the player is looking. You could also raycast from that to find if it hits anything. (answered by ash)

**Q: Anyone heard about this dataset? https://adobe-research.github.io/humoto/ Cannot get it to work (unzip not possible), but it looks like a really good idea. They say it is mixamo compatible then it should work for us aswell, right?** (asked by mrtzhckr)  
**A:** Think they barfed file extension. Just change .zip to .fbx and your good for Blender etc. (answered by Valiant)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **World Appearance Troubleshooting**
   - **Helper:** vox
   - **Helpee:** Harambe Advocate
   - **Context:** World colors looking white-washed
   - **Resolution:** Suggested changing HDR in v1 sky app, offered to send good presets later

2. **AI Asset Generation Explanation**
   - **Helper:** vox
   - **Helpee:** Sceth iii
   - **Context:** Understanding how AI-generated assets work in Hyperfy
   - **Resolution:** Explained the vibe prompting system using "../create" commands to generate ThreeJS primitives

3. **AI Style Transfer Clarification**
   - **Helper:** Valiant
   - **Helpee:** Sceth iii
   - **Context:** Confusion about how AI style transfer works with Hyperfy
   - **Resolution:** Clarified it's a rendering layer from camera/virtual camera

4. **Dataset File Extension Fix**
   - **Helper:** Valiant
   - **Helpee:** mrtzhckr
   - **Context:** Unable to unzip Humoto dataset files
   - **Resolution:** Identified incorrect file extension issue, suggested changing .zip to .fbx for Blender compatibility and created a fixed package

5. **Shooter Game Mechanics Implementation**
   - **Helper:** ash
   - **Helpee:** Gert-Jan Akerboom
   - **Context:** Implementing player camera direction for a shooter game
   - **Resolution:** Explained how to convert camera quaternion to directional vector and suggested raycasting for hit detection

## Action Items

### Technical
- **Explore integration of real-time style transfer directly into Hyperfy engine** (Mentioned by mrtzhckr)
  - Currently requires external tools but could potentially be built into the platform
- **Investigate Krea's real-time styling capabilities** (Mentioned by untitled, xyz)
  - Has "insane styling options" similar to their 2D tools
- **Check if Meshy service is functioning properly** (Mentioned by Valiant)
  - User reported Meshy being "trashed"
- **Review Hyperfy-to-Blender resource** (Mentioned by .hyp shaman)
  - Available at https://hackmd.io/@XR/hyperfy-to-blender
- **Implement camera direction detection using quaternion conversion** (Mentioned by Gert-Jan Akerboom)
  - For directional vector calculation in shooter game development
- **Consider implementing raycasting from camera direction for hit detection** (Mentioned by ash)
  - For shooter games and interactive applications

### Features
- **Add templates with preexisting assets and styling** (Mentioned by Sceth iii)
  - For easier world creation with AI-generated assets
- **Video player with HLS (.m3u8) stream support** (Mentioned by Valiant)

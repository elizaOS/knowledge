## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it possible to convert an image into a 3D character in Hyperfy?**  
A: Ash mentioned they did R&D on this, converting text to images to meshes to VRMs, but with high failure rates. The goal is to revisit this.

**Q: How do you change your profile to a character like this, is there a complete tutorial on YouTube?**  
A: TheMattEmpire suggested using VRM creation tutorials, making meshes with AI tools, and using VRM for Blender addon.

**Q: Is the vibe world ever getting back online?**  
A: It was back up yesterday but experiencing issues, possibly due to DDOS or bad actors.

**Q: Are these 3D models created in Blender first, or can they be generated directly in Hyperfy?**  
A: Generated directly in Hyperfy using the dev branch and appropriate commands.

**Q: How to generate 3D models directly in Hyperfy?**  
A: You need to be on the dev branch, configure AI_PROVIDER and API keys in .env file, then use commands like "/create thing" or "/edit add eye" when cursor is over an object.

**Q: Do you know how to add the AI agent role to the Hyperfy world?**

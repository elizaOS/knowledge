# Hyperfy Development and Community Enhancements (2025-04-01)

## Platform Improvements

- Ongoing development focused on:
  - Technical enhancements
  - User experience upgrades
  - Agentic workflow integration

## Feature Updates

### Emote Integration & Skinned Meshes
- Introduced sit emote using `player.applyEffect` and props
- Skinned mesh support added in dev branch
  - Enables non-humanoid animations (e.g., pets, mounts)
  - Crossfade between animations via fade parameter

### Deployment & Persistence Fixes
- Deployment issues on Digital Ocean resolved
  - Required matching `.env` variables with public IP
  - HTTPS necessary for file hashing and object persistence

### Custom Events & Draw Call Optimization
- Demonstrated use of `app.emit` and `world.on` for custom events
- Performance tips:
  - Optimize vertex colors
  - Adjust Blender export settings
  - Refine mesh structure

### First-Person Building & Drone Control
- Drone object introduced for first-person building with visible avatar
- Remote drone control via keybinds added by devbyte_00

### Object Optimization & Asset Importing
- Addressed large object placement issues
- Community shared asset imports (e.g., Shell gas station from GTA5)

### Modular Player Mechanics & Snap Features
- Proposed modular system for toggling player abilities and weapons
- Programmatic snap point creation via `app.create('snap')`

## Agentic Workflows & LLM Integration

- Advanced prompt engineering using multiple LLMs in feedback loops
- Introduced "jintern" project:
  - Embeds organizational knowledge into LLM agents
  - Supports code review and autonomous script validation
  - Aims for self-improving AI workflows

## Community Feedback & Documentation

- Feature requests:
  - Object scaling
  - Energy bars for dash mechanics
  - Packaging experiences into `.hyp` files
- Documentation suggestions:
  - Drone usage
  - Snap point creation
  - Modular mechanics

## Market Update

- Current SOL price: $124.53

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-09

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Projects
- **Keyboard Implementation**: Gh0sTt is developing an enhanced keyboard based on Starlight's existing one, adding individual key coloring functionality.
- **Modular Building Project**: Gert-Jan Akerboom reported progress on their modular building project, with the structure taking form and plans to implement collision detection next. The project can be viewed at akerboom.fyi.
- **Bot and API Development**: Gh0sTt mentioned plans to release repositories for both a bot and API they're developing.

### Technical Discussions
- **Blender Add-ons**: Two different Blender add-ons for Hyperfy were discussed:
  - Official Hyperfy Tools (version 1.5.0)
  - An alternative script created by Ash available in the source code (blender_addon.py and blender-exporter.md)
- **Mobile & VR Compatibility**: Developers discussed making implementations mobile and VR friendly, with interest in:
  - Using phone gyroscopes for controller functionality
  - Implementing gamepad API support for controllers
  - Adding VR/raycasting support for keyboard interfaces

### HYPER Token
- Community members discussed recent price movements of the HYPER token
- Some speculation that price increases might be related to Emirates announcing crypto payments for flights
- Brief mention of swing trading as a strategy during market downturns
- Discussion about token buybacks using fees earned, though this idea has reportedly been "resoundingly shot down" in previous conversations

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can animated skinned meshes have collision?**  
A: Try adding collisions manually as sometimes the plugin causes issues (Valiant)

**Q: Is there another blender addon?**  
A: Yes, in the source code - blender_addon.py and blender-exporter.md (.hyp shaman)

**Q: Will the keyboard implementation be mobile and VR friendly?**  
A: Yes (PabloFM | Numinia)

**Q: Any news about possible buy backs on token with fees earned?**  
A: The couple times I've seen buybacks raised, the idea was resoundingly shot down, so it's unlikely any buyback will be entertained (maximus)

**Q: Does @mods role tagging work?**  
A: No it actually doesn't for some reason. There are settings but I think for simplicity we limited the ability for people to tag roles of any kind (Agent12 & maximus)

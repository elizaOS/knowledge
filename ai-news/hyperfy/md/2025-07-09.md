- **Blender Tools**: Discussion about alternative Blender addons available in the source code, including blender_addon.py and documentation in blender-exporter.md, alongside the Hyperfy Tools addon.

### Community & Token
- **Hyper Token**: Community members discussed price movements, trading strategies, and market sentiment around the Hyper token. Some expressed frustration about the token being "down 99%", while others discussed swing trading opportunities.
- **AI in Development**: Users shared and discussed content related to AI's impact on software development, including insights from GitHub's CEO about how AI will change development work while developers remain essential.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
- **Q**: Can animated skinned meshes have collision?  
  **A**: Valiant suggested adding collisions manually as sometimes the plugin causes issues.

- **Q**: Is there another Blender addon besides Hyperfy Tools?  
  **A**: .hyp shaman confirmed there is one in the source code created by ash, including blender_addon.py and blender-exporter.md.

- **Q**: Will the keyboard implementation be mobile and VR friendly?  
  **A**: PabloFM | Numinia indicated they will implement this with "We will do".

### Server Infrastructure
- **Q**: Which manufacturer do you use for your server?  
  **A**: Ash: "We use Hetzner servers located in one of their US datacenters, specifically Hillsboro OR."

- **Q**: Is it deployed on a single server in the United States? Are there no other distributed node servers?  
  **A**: Ash: "Correct, no craziness, it's not really needed. Our single server holds like 20 worlds at once, online 24/7."

- **Q**: What could cause websocket disconnection with 1006 errors?  
  **A**: Ash: "If there are no server errors in your logs, either your connection or the server networking is borked."

### Community & Token
- **Q**: Any news about possible buy backs on token with fees earned?  
  **A**: Maximus: "The couple times I've seen buybacks raised the idea was resoundingly shot down so it's unlikely any buyback will be entertained."

- **Q**: Does @mods work?  
  **A**: Agent12: "No it actually doesn't for some reason."

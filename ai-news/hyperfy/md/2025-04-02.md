# Hyperfy Community Report â€“ April 2, 2025

## 1. Technical Discussions and Optimization

### 1.1 Vertex Color Handling in Meshes
- Sharp edges in vertex-colored meshes can increase draw calls due to material splits.
- Blender export settings identified as a cause; specific option must be enabled to preserve vertex colors.
- themattempire plans further investigation.

### 1.2 Gradient UVs vs. Vertex Colors
- Gradient UVs preferred for clothing customization due to:
  - Greater flexibility
  - Compatibility with PBR effects
- Advanced vertex color techniques acknowledged as viable alternatives.

### 1.3 Development Workflow Clarification
- gertjanakerboom faced issues running the dev version of Hyperfy.
- 0mka_ and 0xpeezy clarified:
  - Difference between local server and dev branch
  - Provided git commands
  - Updated documentation to reduce confusion.

### 1.4 Server Configuration and HTTPS Setup
- mio55 encountered SSL issues on DigitalOcean.
- Resolved using:
  - Cloudflare proxy
  - certbot for SSL certificates
- Led to suggestions for improving self-hosting documentation.

### 1.5 Skinned Mesh Animation for Procedural Plants
- gertjanakerboom explored using a specific animation frame as a static state.
- b0gie suggested using the wind shader as a workaround.
- Full support may require core engine changes.

### 1.6 Math.random() Re-enabled
- Previously disabled due to non-determinism and exploit concerns.
- Re-enabled with num() as a controlled alternative.
- Balances flexibility and security.

### 1.7 Feature Suggestions
- Proposed features:
  - `player.setRole()` with permission controls (e.g., canBuild, god mode)
  - UI improvements for spawn position settings
  - Enhanced model extraction tools
- Acknowledged but not confirmed for implementation.

### 1.8 Community Project: pew.bet
- _saori_ invited testing of interactive web experience: [https://pew.bet/](https://pew.bet/)
- Performance issues resolved; cheddarqueso confirmed smooth operation.
- UX issue: continuous camera movement requires holding mouse button.
- May be platform-specific.

### 1.9 Future Development Ideas
- rando1337 suggested porting pew.bet to Hyperfy.
- Indicates interest in expanding platform capabilities.

## 2. Hyperfy Development and Community Projects

### 2.1 Multi-LLM Prompt Engineering
- d_maximus introduced a multi-LLM refinement loop:
  - One LLM generates prompts
  - Others provide feedback and refinement
- Introduced "jintern" project:
  - Embeds organizational best practices into LLM agents
  - Supports code review and improvement
- rickydata1 emphasized need for autonomous validation and iteration.

**Action Items:**
- Implement multi-LLM feedback loops
- Integrate jintern as a modular service
- Enable LLMs to test and refine code autonomously

### 2.2 Modular Player Mechanics and Asset Enhancements
- themattempire proposed modular system for toggling player features (e.g., slide, wall run, weapon types).
- Supported by ashxn.eth and d_maximus.
- 0xpeezy shared double dash workaround.
- .somethingmoreprofessional updated cart model with snap points and considered adding a status screen.
- ashxn.eth provided fix for VRM rigging issues (rest pose correction).

**Action Items:**
- Implement modular player system
- Enhance cart model and add status screen
- Document VRM fixes and snap point creation

### 2.3 Community Project Feedback: pew.bet
- Performance confirmed stable
- UX issue under investigation
- Suggestion to port to Hyperfy noted

**Action Items:**
- Investigate camera control issue
- Document platform-specific behaviors

## 3. Market Update

- Solana (SOL) price: **$126.68**

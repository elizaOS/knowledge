# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-31

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Projects
- **Miniverse App Development**: 3rdEyeVisuals shared progress on the Miniverse app, including user proximity triggering and camera control improvements. Plans include adding weather effects with UI controls.
- **Image Frame Functionality**: Several developers discussed implementing image frames similar to those in "V1". Valiant demonstrated a working image frame with glowing effects, while others discussed alternative styles like holographic effects.
- **.hyp shaman** shared boilerplate code for image apps and configuration options to help developers implement image functionality.

### Technical Issues
- **Broken WIP Parcel**: Rizzle reported breaking the "wip" parcel by placing a large pumpkin model in it, making it inaccessible to all users. Admin intervention was suggested as necessary to fix the issue.
- **V1 World Access Problems**: Multiple users reported broader access issues with v1 worlds, though one specific world (babacci) remained accessible.
- **Database Management**: 3rdEyeVisuals offered a Python script solution that can remove problematic apps and entities directly from the database while creating backups first.

### Documentation
- A HackMD document was shared by Saori in the 🪙│hyper channel, though the specific content remains unknown.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: How can I add image functionality to an app?  
   **A**: You can find boilerplate code in the collections by spawning an image app, or use the provided JavaScript code snippet. (answered by .hyp shaman)

2. **Q**: When I click on the Metamask logo to connect my wallet, it opens my temple wallet instead. Is this normal?  
   **A**: When you have multiple wallets in your browser, they compete to connect. Try disabling the unwanted wallet and connect again. (answered by .hyp shaman)

3. **Q**: Can anyone else see if they can get in the wip parcel?  
   **A**: Not loading for me baus (answered by untitled, xyz)

4. **Q**: How can the broken wip parcel be fixed?  
   **A**: I think ash needs to reset it for you, you need god mode (answered by untitled, xyz)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **.hyp shaman** provided documentation and complete boilerplate code for image implementation to help users add image functionality to their apps.

2. **.hyp shaman** helped Gert-Jan Akerboom with a wallet connection issue by suggesting disabling competing wallets before attempting to connect.

3. **3rdEyeVisuals** shared a utility script to help untitled, xyz locate app blueprints and entities for creating image frames similar to V1.

4. **Valiant** developed and demonstrated a working image frame solution with glowing effects to assist untitled, xyz.

5. **3rdEyeVisuals** offered a Python script solution to Rizzle that can remove problematic apps and entities from the database while creating backups, addressing the broken wip parcel issue.

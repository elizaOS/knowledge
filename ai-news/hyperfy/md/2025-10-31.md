# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-31

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Progress
- **Miniverse App Development**: 3rdEyeVisuals shared progress on a "Miniverse" app featuring proximity-based triggering and camera control, with plans to implement smooth camera interpolation instead of abrupt movements. Weather effects will be added that remain hidden until users enter designated areas.
- **Framed Components**: Valiant developed and shared two new Hyperdeck components - "Framed Image" and "Framed VideoPlayer" - both currently available only in the development branch. These components use primitives for creating customizable frames.
- **Image Handling**: .hyp shaman provided code snippets and documentation references for image handling and configuration, helping developers implement visual elements.
- **Performance Optimization**: highlander inquired about Draco compression implementation, noting its significant impact on performance.

### Platform Issues
- **Broken WIP Parcel**: Rizzle broke the "wip" parcel by attempting to place a large pumpkin model, rendering it inaccessible. 3rdEyeVisuals offered a Python script solution to remove problematic apps and entities from the database.
- **V1 World Access Problems**: Pete reported being unable to access any v1 worlds, though one specific world (babacci) remained accessible.
- **World Loading Issue**: Pedro.M² reported being unable to load any worlds after connecting their wallet, including ones where they are a collaborator.

### 3D Design & Management
- **Model Organization**: Discussion about renaming models and organizing them in 3D environments. Users learned how to rename models by changing metadata through the "tag looking icon" interface.
- **Collections Management**: It was clarified that there's currently no way to manage collections from within a world - organization needs to happen before the world loads.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
- **Q**: How can image features be added to an app?  
  **A**: Via code, with boilerplate available in the collections and documentation at docs/scripting/nodes/types/Image.md (.hyp shaman)

- **Q**: When I click on the Metamask logo to connect my wallet it opens the login for my temple wallet, is this normal?  
  **A**: When you have more than one wallet in your browser they tend to fight to connect. Normally disable the wallet (temple) and try to connect again. (.hyp shaman)

### Platform Issues
- **Q**: Can anyone else see if they can get into the wip parcel?  
  **A**: Not loading for me baus (untitled, xyz)

- **Q**: How can the broken wip parcel be fixed?  
  **A**: I think ash needs to reset it for you, you need god mode (untitled, xyz)

### 3D Design
- **Q**: Is there a simple way to rename a model that I bring in? I want it to have colliders.  
  **A**: If you name the model before you drag it in world it will have that name otherwise you can rename your app by changing the metadata (tag looking icon). (.hyp shaman)

- **Q**: Is there a way to create collections and folders to organize the models more easily once they are in world?  
  **A**: Currently there isn't a way to manage collection from within a world all that stuff happens before the world spins up. (.hyp shaman)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **.hyp shaman provided image implementation guidance**:
   - Shared documentation references, example code, and detailed JavaScript implementation for image handling
   - Helped with wallet connection issues when multiple wallets are installed

2. **3rdEyeVisuals offered technical solutions**:
   - Shared a Python script that can remove problematic apps and entities from the database while creating backups
   - Provided a utility that can be run from the hyperfy-repo folder to identify app blueprints and entities

3. **Valiant responded to community needs**:
   - Created and shared a Framed Image v1 and Framed VideoPlayer v1 application in response to requests for image frames like in v1
   - Made these components available in the development branch for testing

4. **untitled, xyz helped with access issues**:
   - Confirmed the wip parcel loading problem reported by Rizzle
   - Shared a working link to a specific world (babacci) that was still accessible when v1 worlds were having issues

## Action Items

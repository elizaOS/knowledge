# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-29

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### VR/XR Development
- **VR Interface Progress**: Ash shared developments on a VR interface using controller triggers and thumbsticks for object manipulation (pointing, editing, copying, deleting, rotating, scaling)
- **Controller Input Improvements**: Discussion about implementing smoothing factors to reduce controller shakiness in VR interfaces, with Ash reporting an "80%" improvement after implementation
- **Control Scheme Details**: Comprehensive control scheme was outlined: trigger pull shows beam, long press brings up menu, stick directions for different functions, grip+stick for scaling and distance

### AI Integration & Tools
- **AI-Generated Environments**: Users are exploring AI-prompted environment creation in "Vibe World," with particular focus on a collaborative diner space
- **Text-to-Speech Models**: Discussion about AI-powered TTS tools for creating conversational content, including KittenTTS, VibevoiceAI, and other conversational speech models (CSMs)
- **Privacy Concerns**: Users expressed concerns about cloud-based AI services requiring access to personal accounts
- **Fast Inference**: Maximus mentioned a fast inference system running through WebGPU with quick response times

### Collaborative Virtual Spaces
- **Networked Environments**: The "Vibe World" diner is a networked space where multiple users can see and interact with objects placed by others
- **Community Building**: Users are collaboratively enhancing spaces with features like jukeboxes, water pumps, and other objects
- **Persistent Environments**: Appreciation for the ability to return to spaces and see changes made by others
- **Object Management**: Discussion about pinning objects to prevent accidental movement

### Platform Updates
- **Repository Updates**: Marcel mentioned creating a podcast-like system summarizing updates to the hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy repository
- **Version v0.15.0**: Includes social tools, VRM avatar support, and improved networking
- **Blockchain Integration**: Some users expressed enthusiasm for token-based permission systems for world building

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Are you `grabbing` stuff with the grab button or triggers?**  
A: Triggers (answered by ash)

**Q: It's the thumbstick left or right?**  
A: Can use either left or right (answered by ash)

**Q: Is there any plan to bring back backpack?**  
A: "I liked that, but sometimes the vrms in v1 backpacks that were nfts weren't necessary optimised enough. So had to upload anyway. I also like can just drag and drop from a folder straight in. Not always easy if out and about on mobile" (answered by BallisticBanana)

**Q: This is so rad! who built it?**  
A: "Thanks! Prompted the whole thing, it's networked too. So crazy" (answered by Dhin)

**Q: Networked meaning Global, and all users can see at the same time?**  
A: "Yeah" (answered by Dhin)

**Q: Are you using an OS pipeline (info gathering -> audio file) to generate this or did you roll your own?**  
A: "Rolled my own. Not that hard if you did something like this before + have some ai to write fast." (answered by marcel 🌵)

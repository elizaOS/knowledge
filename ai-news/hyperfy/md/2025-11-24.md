# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Canvas Texture Streaming Technology
- **3rdEyeVisuals** is developing an extensive arcade-style project using three.js CanvasTexture with 2D Canvas API rendering directly applied to 3D meshes
- The implementation enables raycasting and click detection in world-space, resembling a Game Boy screen texture-mapped onto 3D objects
- System is optimized with proximity-based rendering, allowing potentially thousands of arcade machines while maintaining 60 FPS
- VR-compatible arcade games like Time Crisis and House of the Dead are planned
- Some features will be token-gated while test games will be available to all

### Token Economics
- **ailes** sent 30 million HYPER tokens to an "incinerator" address, effectively burning them from circulation
- **Xukonth** mentioned "Hyperfy will be at least 20m again," likely referring to token value or market cap
- **Saori** shared a Streamflow Finance contract link on Solana mainnet

### Infrastructure & Technical Debt
- **Ozymandias** noted improvements in codebase management with functional codebases becoming more streamlined
- Technical debt is becoming easier to manage according to Ozymandias
- Heroku was discussed as a hosting platform, with the limitation that it only supports PostgreSQL for persistent storage, causing data loss when Dynos spin down

### Bug Fixes
- **Ozymandias** identified and fixed a cache-related issue in Firefox that appeared when using power-GPU
- The issue disappeared in subsequent sessions, suggesting an intermittent problem

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is this arcade system using iframes or UI nodes?**  
A: Neither. Using canvas texture streaming with three.js CanvasTexture and 2D Canvas API rendering directly applied to 3D mesh (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)

**Q: Doesn't this mean it would work in VR?**  
A: Implied yes - "You know im already planning Time Crisis 😉" (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)

**Q: Should I create a GitHub issue for a bug I found and fixed in my fork?**  
A: The existing issue was for v1 with private codebase, suggesting a new issue may be appropriate (answered by ash)

**Q: whatchu do? (regarding HYPER tokens)**  
A: Sent 30M HYPER tokens to the incinerator address (answered by ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **3rdEyeVisuals** helped **ash** understand the technical implementation of the arcade system, explaining it uses three.js CanvasTexture with 2D Canvas API rendering directly on 3D meshes, not iframes or UI nodes

2. **3rdEyeVisuals** clarified for **ash** how the proximity-based rendering system works for performance, allowing many arcade machines to exist while maintaining 60 FPS

3. **ash** helped **ailes** by identifying and confirming that 30M HYPER tokens had been sent to the incinerator address

4. **ash** assisted **Ozymandias** regarding whether to create a GitHub issue for a Firefox cache bug, clarifying that the existing issue was for v1 with private codebase

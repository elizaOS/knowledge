# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Arcade Game Implementation
- **3rdEyeVisuals** shared details about an innovative arcade-style gaming implementation in virtual worlds
- The implementation uses **Three.js CanvasTexture with 2D Canvas API** rendering directly applied to 3D meshes
- This approach avoids iframes or UI nodes, enabling raycasting and click detection in world-space
- The system works like a Game Boy screen texture-mapped onto 3D objects with real-time JavaScript canvas drawing
- A key optimization is **proximity-based rendering**, where arcade machines only render when users are nearby
- This optimization allows for potentially thousands of arcade machines in a world with only one actual render happening per client at any time
- Performance remains at 60 FPS due to these optimizations

### Project Plans
- The arcade implementation is part of a larger project that will include token-gated features
- Some test games will be available for all users to try
- Additional low-level APIs with security checks were exposed to ensure the implementation remains secure

### Market Discussion
- Brief mention by **Xukonth** predicting "Hyperfy" reaching at least "20m" again (likely market cap or valuation)
- **Saori** shared a link to a Streamflow Finance contract on Solana mainnet

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is this using iframes or UI nodes?** (asked by ash)  
**A:** Neither. Actually using canvas texture streaming without iframes, UI nodes or HTML/DOM elements. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)

**Q: Is this networked (can others in world watch OR wen pong)?** (asked by Shiffty)  
**A:** Unanswered

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **3rdEyeVisuals** helped **ash** understand the technical implementation of the arcade system, explaining how it uses Three.js CanvasTexture with 2D Canvas API rendering directly applied to 3D meshes rather than iframes or UI nodes

## Action Items

### Feature Development
- **Implement test games available for all users** | Create demo arcade games that aren't token-gated | *Mentioned by 3rdEyeVisuals*
- **Token-gated arcade features** | Develop premium arcade features accessible only to token holders | *Mentioned by 3rdEyeVisuals*

### Technical Implementation
- **Proximity-based rendering optimization** | Continue developing the system where arcade machines only render when users are nearby | *Mentioned by 3rdEyeVisuals*
- **Security checks for low-level APIs** | Ensure exposed APIs maintain security while enabling advanced functionality | *Mentioned by 3rdEyeVisuals*

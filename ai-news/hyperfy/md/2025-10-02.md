# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-02

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Security & Authentication
- **Authentication Challenges**: Gh0stt expressed a need for local/session storage access for user authentication in Hyperfy apps, which is currently restricted for security reasons.
- **Proposed Solution**: Discussion evolved into a potential permission-based system where apps could request specific access (like cookies/storage) with verification mechanisms.
- **Security Framework**: The proposed system would involve signature and hash validation to ensure security while enabling necessary functionality.
- **Alternative Solution**: Lastraum offered to share their Privy-based authentication solution that allows login with socials, email, or web3 without requiring a separate tab.

### Technical Updates
- **Connection Issues**: Numinia team identified and resolved connection issues affecting certain worlds.
- **Webviews Support**: A developer is actively working on webviews/iframe support.
- **Splats Technology**: Development of splats technology is showing impressive visual results.
- **AI Features**: AI features are pending release to all users in the next update.
- **App Sharing**: Community discussed the need for better app sharing solutions, with hyperworld.host/marketplace suggested as a potential option.

### 3D Development
- **Indoor Spaces**: Discussion about importing realistic indoor spaces into Hyperfy v2, with optimization advice for high-poly models.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Recommendations included using Babylon Press for GLB processing before adding models to worlds.

### Upcoming Events
- **Numinia Presentation**: PabloFM mentioned Numinia's upcoming presentation at mmerge.io regarding scalable Hyp apps.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Could you again explain how the transform fields work? Ideal would be a 0.01 value option in the transform fields loc/rot/scale.**  
A: Just hold the alt key and use the up and down arrows. (answered by ash)

**Q: Isn't there a way we can make verified apps that do access local/session storage?**  
A: Not directly answered, but discussion evolved into a potential permission system with verification mechanisms.

**Q: What's your actual use case for local storage?**  
A: User authentication. (answered by Gh0stt)

**Q: Has anyone tried to build semi-realistic indoor spaces with v2 in a hosted HyperWorld?**  
A: You can import the model as a .glb with drag and drop, but will likely need optimization for mesh (1.2m tris), though 12x 2k textures and 14 materials should be fine. (answered by vox)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Authentication Solutions
- **Helper**: Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz
- **Helpee**: Gh0stt
- **Context**: Gh0stt needed a solution for user authentication without local storage access
- **Resolution**: Lastraum offered to share their Privy-based authentication solution and help set up the forge in Gh0stt's world

### Security Framework Design
- **Helper**: ash
- **Helpee**: Gh0stt
- **Context**: Discussion about security concerns with local storage access
- **Resolution**: Collaborative development of a potential permission-based system concept with signature verification

### 3D Optimization Guidance
- **Helper**: vox
- **Helpee**: Fibelius
- **Context**: Building realistic indoor spaces in Hyperfy v2
- **Resolution**: Advised to convert to .glb format, optimize mesh (1.2m triangles is too high), process through Babylon Press (https://glb.babylonpress.org/) before adding to world, and offered help with lighting

## Action Items

### Technical
- **Release new main branch** to bring AI features to everyone (Mentioned by ash)
- **Resolve connection issues** in certain worlds with fix identified by Numinia team (Mentioned by ash)
- **Implement webviews/iframe support** - development in progress (Mentioned by ash)
- **Explore implementation of app permissions system** with security clearance verification where apps could request specific permissions with verification and hash validation (Mentioned by Gh0stt and ash)
- **Implement signature and hash validation** for verified apps where apps are signed and verified, with signatures invalidated if code changes (Mentioned by Gh0stt)

### Feature
- **Add permission dialogs** for apps requesting sensitive access to show warnings like "this app wants to access cookies" (Mentioned by ash)
- **Improve app sharing system** to find better way to share apps and updates than the current chaotic thread (Mentioned by ash)

### Documentation
- **Document the Privy authentication implementation** for Forge apps showing how authentication works with social/email/web3 login (Mentioned by Lastraum)
- **Create more examples of realistic indoor spaces** in v2 as reference examples for new builders (Mentioned by Fibelius)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Issues & Solutions
- **Math.random() Error**: A critical issue was identified where using `Math.random()` in Hyperfy apps causes a TypeError in secure mode, preventing world access. Ashxn resolved this by removing the problematic app for yung_algorithm.
- **Avatar Assignment**: Discussion about implementing random avatar assignment for users without connected wallets. The recommended solution is using the pre-built "Avatars" app that automatically assigns one of three VRM avatars.
- **World State Issues**: yung_algorithm reported code in their index.js file causing world crashes, seeking ways to reset world state.

### Platform Evolution
- **Hyperfy v2 Migration**: Confirmation that Hyperfy is transitioning to v2, which will build upon v1 and include Solana integration.
- **Embedding Worlds**: A user inquired about embedding Hyperfy worlds directly into external domains rather than using hyperfy.io. This isn't officially supported in v1, but an upcoming announcement might address this need.
- **Airdrop Registration**: Users were advised to register their old worlds to tie them to SOL addresses for an upcoming airdrop, with registration ending on January 7th.

### Miscellaneous
- **ElizaOS Integration**: Mentions of ElizaOS potentially having plugin integration with Hyperfy v2.
- **Shaw Avatar**: Clarification that Shaw is a 3D avatar created by Ashxn, not directly connected to the Hyperfy project.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Can I bring my Hyperfy world (NFT) into my app so it loads at my domain instead of hyperfy.io?  
   **A**: There are ways to do this with v1 but not officially. We have an upcoming announcement that might help with this. (Ashxn)

2. **Q**: How do I troubleshoot when I can't access my world after uploading an app with Math.random?  
   **A**: The Math.random function in secure mode was causing the error. I can remove that app for you. (Ashxn)

3. **Q**: What's the best practice for random avatar assignment for non-connected users?  
   **A**: We have a pre-built "Avatars" app that lets you add 3 VRMs which get randomly assigned to users without connected wallets. (Ashxn)

4. **Q**: How do I automatically set characters/avatars for people who join my world?  
   **A**: Load the person in a room with avatar options posed together, and consider using an avatar bot to explain the world. (maximus)

5. **Q**: Should I wait until the move to Solana is complete before creating a new world with wallet integration?  
   **A**: Yes, hold off on building new code on v1, though you can still mock up worlds. (maximus)

6. **Q**: Have you already taken a snapshot for the airdrop?  
   **A**: Yes. (felixdigit://)

7. **Q**: When does registration end?  
   **A**: On the 7th. (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **World Access Restoration**:
   - **Helper**: Ashxn
   - **Helpee**: yung_algorithm
   - **Context**: World broken after deploying app with Math.random() causing TypeError
   - **Resolution**: Ashxn removed the problematic app, restoring access to the world

2. **Avatar Assignment Implementation**:
   - **Helper**: Ashxn
   - **Helpee**: yung_algorithm
   - **Context**: Needed solution for random avatar assignment to non-wallet users
   - **Resolution**: Ashxn added a pre-built "Avatars" app to the world that handles this functionality automatically

3. **Support Timeframe Communication**:
   - **Helper**: maximus
   - **Helpee**: yung_algorithm
   - **Context**: Informing about timezone difference for support
   - **Resolution**: Provided estimated timeframe for when Ashxn would be available to help

4. **Migration Guidance**:
   - **Helper**: maximus
   - **Helpee**: SomeOtherGuy
   - **Context**: Whether to create a new world with wallet integration now or wait for Solana migration
   - **Resolution**: Advised to hold off on new code for v1 but can still mock up worlds

## Action Items

### Technical
- Be cautious with Math.random() in Hyperfy apps as it causes errors in secure mode (Mentioned by: yung_algorithm)
- Limit to one instance of the "Avatars" app per world as it's not tested for multiple instances (Mentioned by: Ashxn)
- Register old Hyperfy worlds to tie them to SOL addresses for the upcoming migration (Mentioned by: maximus)
- Fix code in index.js that's causing world crashes (Mentioned by: yung_algorithm)
- Implement random avatar assignment logic for world visitors (Mentioned by: yung_algorithm)

### Feature
- Official support for embedding Hyperfy worlds in external applications/domains (Mentioned by: salt√Ø)
- Integration between Hyperfy v2 and ElizaOS through plugins (Mentioned by: maximus)

### Documentation
- Document limitations of secure mode, particularly around Math functions (Mentioned by: yung_algorithm)
- Create instructions for migrating from v1 to v2 (Mentioned by: maximus, implied)

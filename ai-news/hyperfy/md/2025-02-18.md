## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: Is there a way to do raycasting?  
  **A**: Yes, it's now implemented in the core API (Saori, Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is it possible to make particles using hyp files?  
  **A**: Not directly supported, but Shiffty demonstrated a workaround using cloned objects

- **Q**: Is there a way to make GET/POST requests to external APIs via Apps?  
  **A**: Yes, you can use fetch, it works exactly the same as in standard JavaScript (Saori)

- **Q**: Is there a way to have apps load in sequence?  
  **A**: Events can coordinate this, and local events are synchronous (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do I add an mp3 slot to my follower bot?  
  **A**: Ashxn provided code with audio implementation and suggested adding loop:true to the audio

### Platform & Licensing
- **Q**: Is Hyperfy now free to use?  
  **A**: It's free for those who can self-host, which requires technical knowledge. Community-built hosting platforms like hyperworld.host offer subscription options (Ashxn, Saori)

- **Q**: Does the GPL3 license prevent game studios from using Hyperfy?  
  **A**: No, you can build revenue-generating companies on the tech; you only need to share improvements to the core engine, not your game code (Ashxn)

### 3D Design & Assets
- **Q**: How do you get a 3D model from an NFT into a Hyperfy space?  
  **A**: It appears in your inventory when you connect your wallet, and you can easily duplicate it with ctrl+copy and paste (untitled, xyz)

- **Q**: How do I make VRM animations work with Mixamo?  
  **A**: Mixamo works with VRMs; shared resources with pre-processed animations are available (peezy)

- **Q**: How do I parent accessories to a character's head so they move together?  
  **A**: Parent with empty groups to skeleton, edit mode, select all vertices, assign to head bone in data properties (brandonmanus)

### Blockchain & Web3
- **Q**: What if we relaunched on a different chain?  
  **A**: The tech is chain agnostic but Solana is where the token is best deployed; there will be no relaunches just to boost price (maximus)

- **Q**: Is it possible to mint an avatar as VRM NFT and use it in Hyperfy?  
  **A**: The new platform will allow avatar minting, but currently no Hyperfy V2 worlds support NFT avatars (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Development Support
- **Follower Bot Audio**: Ashxn provided MetaRick with code for audio implementation in his follower bot, including the loop:true suggestion
- **Raycasting Implementation**: Saori shared a screenshot showing raycasting possibilities, and Shiffty shared a link to a projectile example using ground collision
- **External API Requests**: peezy confirmed to MetaMike that fetch works for external APIs in Hyperfy
- **App Sequencing**: Ashxn provided code examples using synchronous local events to help MetaMike load apps in sequence

### 3D Design Assistance
- **Accessory Rigging**: brandonmanus helped devilsadvocate.sol with parenting horn accessories and earrings to character head bones, suggesting empty groups and weight painting techniques
- **Animation Resources**: peezy shared links to pre-processed Mixamo animations compatible with VRMs to help MetaRick
- **NFT Testing**: untitled.xyz sent treed ARQ NFTs to test and demonstrated how they appear in inventory for 3D NFT integration

### Blockchain & Platform Guidance
- **Chain Strategy**: Saori proposed a dual-chain approach to address Uuuuuuuuu's concerns about Solana, suggesting using Solana for token trading and Ethereum for building connected applications
- **Platform Access**: ApeironCreations and Saori directed Leon to resources for getting started with Hyperfy V2, including the GitHub link and hyperfy.how

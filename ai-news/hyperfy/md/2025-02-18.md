- **Hyper Token Integration**: Peezy demonstrated an implementation allowing players to throw and collect Hyper tokens in-world with blockchain integration.
- **Cross-Chain Strategy**: Saori mentioned plans to operate across both Solana and Ethereum chains, using Solana for token trading and Ethereum for building connected applications.
- **Animation Support**: Developers confirmed that GLB animations don't currently work with the custom scene graph in V2, though work is in progress to restore this functionality.

### Open Source Transition
- **V1 to V2 Transition**: Hyperfy has transitioned from V1 to V2, which is now open source under GPL3 license.
- **Self-Hosting Options**: Users can self-host Hyperfy or use community-built hosting platforms like hyperworld.host.
- **License Clarification**: The GPL3 license allows game studios to build on Hyperfy without sharing game code, only core engine improvements.

### 3D Design & Assets
- **Hyperfy Tools Milestone**: The Hyperfy Tools add-on for Blender reached 2000 downloads.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Discussion about using Storacha and Arweave for hosting assets outside Hyperfy servers to improve performance.
- **VRM Avatar Rigging**: Technical solutions shared for parenting accessories to head bones and converting A-pose models to T-pose for proper animation.
- **3D NFT Integration**: Users discussed how Hyperfy can read NFT metadata with `glb_url` parameters to import 3D models directly from wallets.

### Blockchain & Web3 Integration
- **Token Utility**: New feature allowing users to tip app creators directly through the App Marketplace using Hyper tokens.
- **Revenue Models**: Discussion about subscription tiers for hosted services and marketplace commissions (15-30% on sold items).
- **Web2/Web3 Balance**: Conversations about adding Google sign-in and Stripe payment options for non-crypto users while maintaining blockchain benefits.

### AI & Agents
- **AI Infrastructure**: Rick shared information about a new AI infrastructure from Recall, which requires an application process.
- **Development Focus**: MetaMike mentioned shifting focus from agents to game logic, noting interdependencies between the two.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
- **Q**: How can I add an mp3 slot to my follower hyp?  
  **A**: Ashxn provided code with audio implementation and suggested adding loop:true to the audio.

- **Q**: Is there a way to do raycasting?  
  **A**: Yes, but it's not documented or exposed in API yet. Saori and Shiffty shared code examples.

- **Q**: Is there a way to make apps load in sequence?  
  **A**: Events can coordinate this, and local events are synchronous. Ashxn provided a code example.

- **Q**: How to play GLB animations in Hyperfy V2?  
  **A**: Animations don't work with the custom scene graph yet, but development is in progress.

- **Q**: Is there a way to make GET/POST requests to external APIs via Apps?  
  **A**: Yes, using fetch which works exactly the same as standard JavaScript.

### 3D Design & Assets
- **Q**: How do I parent accessories to a VRM head so they move together?  
  **A**: Parent with empty groups to skeleton, edit mode, select all vertices, find head bone in data properties and assign.

- **Q**: How do I fix an avatar in A-pose to make animations work correctly?  
  **A**: Either follow a comprehensive conversion process via tutorial or use a simpler method by entering pose mode, manually adjusting arms to T-pose, and changing VRM export settings.

- **Q**: Is it possible to snap 3D objects when moving them?  
  **A**: In V2, some objects like the home kit snap by default. For custom objects, you can control snapping by using consistent grid measurements.

### Web3 & Blockchain
- **Q**: How do you get a 3D model from an NFT into a Hyperfy space?  
  **A**: It appears in your inventory when you own the NFT, and you can make duplicates with copy/paste.

- **Q**: How can I mint 3D NFTs?  
  **A**: You can use platforms like Manifold, which allows uploading .glb files and handles the metadata.

- **Q**: Does blockchain make games fair?  
  **A**: No, blockchain doesn't make games fair. Its main use case is for trustless exchange of information, storing save states or items.

- **Q**: Does the GPL3 license prevent game studios from using Hyperfy?  
  **A**: No, you can build revenue-generating companies on Hyperfy; you only need to share improvements to the core engine, not your game code.

### Platform & Access
- **Q**: Is Hyperfy now free to use?  
  **A**: It's free for those who can self-host, which requires technical knowledge. Community-built hosting platforms like hyperworld.host offer subscription options.

- **Q**: What happened to V1 world holders?  
  **A**: World holders received an airdrop that had to be claimed in January. V1 worlds still work and have been hosted for 2+ years for the original purchase price.

- **Q**: Is the Recall AI infrastructure openly available?  
  **A**: No, it requires an application process rather than being an open playground.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### VRM Avatar Rigging
ii_cable_ii provided detailed instructions for fixing avatar rigging issues, specifically converting from A-pose to T-pose for proper animation behavior in VRM models. They shared both a comprehensive approach using a video tutorial and a simpler alternative method involving pose mode adjustments and VRM export settings. Maximus offered to send Hyper tokens as appreciation and noted the information would be added to avatars documentation.

### 3D NFT Integration
untitled.xyz helped treed understand how to use 3D NFTs in Hyperfy by sending them ARQ NFTs to test and demonstrating how they appear in inventory. They also explained how to use Manifold to upload .glb files and set proper metadata with glb_url for minting 3D NFTs.

### Raycasting Implementation
Saori and Shiffty helped MayD524 with raycasting functionality by sharing information and code examples. Shiffty specifically shared a projectile example with ground collision detection to demonstrate the capability.

### Audio Implementation
Ashxn provided MetaRick with code for audio implementation in a follower bot, suggesting adding loop:true to the audio for continuous playback.

### Cross-Chain Strategy
Saori addressed Uuuuuuuuu's concerns about being on the Solana chain by proposing using both Solana and Ethereum chains - Solana for token trading due to UX/liquidity advantages and Ethereum for building connected applications with bridged HYPER.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-13

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Character Locomotion Improvements
- Ashxn proposed and implemented a strafe-based movement system (similar to Fortnite/UE) where players always face the camera direction
- Benefits include better VR/first-person support, improved handling of guns/tools, and better overall feel
- A prototype was deployed to play.hyperfy.xyz for community testing
- First-person mode was successfully implemented by the end of the day
- Discussion about animation timing improvements to better match movement actions

### Visual Effects & Environment
- Implementation of skybox rotation with sun direction updates
- Discussion about fog effects and their rendering behavior
- Suggestion to place objects in fog to enhance atmosphere
- Identified rendering issue with "the Grid" mist behavior that disappears when color is set

### Mobile Experience
- BallisticBanana reported issues opening Hyperfy on iPhone 14 Pro
- Ashxn noted it works fine on older iPhone 12 Pro, suggesting device-specific issues
- Discussion about making mobile UI buttons less intrusive
- Debugging challenges noted due to Apple's limited error reporting

### Avatar Quality & Optimization
- Fibelius tested various VRM files in Hyperfy with mixed results
- VOYAGERS avatars displayed well while CloneX (1.5MB VRM) had poor quality
- Mentioned using RTFKT Clone VRM converter and Blender optimization tools
- Discussion about optimization techniques for better avatar rendering

### Website & Community
- Clarification that hyperfy.xyz is the current official site (replacing hyperfy.io)
- New site contains more relevant information including a litepaper
- Emphasis on communicating that v1 is now considered legacy ("we had ps1, now we are on ps2")
- Security warning about increased scam attempts targeting the community

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why doesn't Hyperfy open on my iPhone 14 Pro?**

A: Yes, it's a scam. The current website is hyperfy.xyz. (NikkiFuego, hyp shaman)

**Q: Do we need a website like hyperfy.io?**  
A: The current website is hyperfy.xyz, which has more relevant info including the litepaper. (hyp shaman)

**Q: Has HYPER been listed on any exchanges, and is it affected by BTC and ETH price movements?**  
A: It has low 24h volume (12k), and is only affected if they become a liquidity suck. SOL doesn't move the price much. (jingo, general hyper)

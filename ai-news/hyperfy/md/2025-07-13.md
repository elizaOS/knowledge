## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why doesn't Hyperfy open on my iPhone 14 Pro?**  
A: It might be a memory issue, though it's surprising for a newer phone. It runs fine on iPhone 12 Pro, so it could be a settings issue. Apple doesn't provide detailed error information for debugging. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How do older avatar files perform in Hyperfy?**  
A: VOYAGERS look better than basic VRM files because they were more optimized. (answered by .hyp shaman)

**Q: We need a website like hyperfy.io, boss**  
A: Pretty sure it's WIP, URL is hyperfy.xyz (answered by .hyp shaman)

**Q: I really want to know if HYPER has been listed on any exchanges, and whether it is affected by the price movements of BTC and ETH.**  
A: Only affected really if they become a liquidity suck. Sol doesn't even really move the price much (answered by general hyper)

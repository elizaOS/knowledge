# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-01

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Optimization & Performance
- **Animation Throttling**: Ash shared a technique for throttling animation updates based on distance, significantly improving performance by reducing update frequency for distant objects.
- **Development Environment Issues**: Several users experienced build errors related to missing dependencies, highlighting the importance of running `npm install` when dependencies change.
- **World Data Management**: Discussion clarified that Hyperfy stores world data in separate folders that can be switched between using environment variables (`WORLD=world-2 npm run dev`).

### AI-Generated Content
- **Animation Generation**: Vox demonstrated AI-generated helicopter animations requiring no coding or 3D modeling.
- **Prompt Sharing**: Reneil suggested attaching text prompts to objects during drag-and-drop operations to inspire builders and allow for remixing content.
- **AI Development Resources**: Maximus noted the community is "coming full circle" by using GitHub repositories (specifically snarktank/ai-dev-tasks) to share AI coding tips.

### Community Activities
- **Hyptember**: Community members exchanged greetings for "Hyptember" event.
- **VR Experiences**: Dhin mentioned trying VR in Hyperfy for the first time.
- **Content Sharing**: Rick shared content related to Vibe, referencing writing by Max Cohen for the MOCA newsletter.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Do we have prompt length limits right now?**  
*Asked by: vox*  
A: "Don't think so?" (ash)

**Q: Where is the information for the space actually stored, as it's not in the .env file?**  
*Asked by: TheMattEmpire*  
A: "If you use `npm run dev` it creates/runs the `world` folder. You can have multiple world folders and switch between them by doing `WORLD=world-2 npm run dev` etc" (ash)

**Q: Would it be possible to attach the text prompt somewhere while drag and dropping stuff?**  
*Asked by: Reneil*  
A: "It's in the code for now, not ideal but a good start" (ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Development Environment Troubleshooting
- **Helper**: Shiffty  
  **Helpee**: TheMattEmpire  
  **Issue**: Build errors with "Could not resolve react-colorful" and environment issues  
  **Resolution**: Suggested running npm install and copying settings from .env.example

- **Helper**: ash  
  **Helpee**: TheMattEmpire  
  **Issue**: Confusion about build errors and world data storage  
  **Resolution**: Explained that "could not resolve react-colorful" means running npm install is needed due to new dependencies, and clarified world data storage location

### In-World Technical Support
- **Helper**: Valiant  
  **Helpee**: Dhin  
  **Issue**: Both users trapped in a collider at spawn  
  **Resolution**: Suggested to "reload, move away fast before it appears"

## Action Items

### Technical
- Implement throttling of animation updates based on distance for performance optimization *(Mentioned by: ash)*
- Integrate sound prompts with AI-generated animations *(Mentioned by: vox)*
- Add audio library integration for AI-generated content *(Mentioned by: vox)*

### Documentation
- Document the process for managing multiple world folders using the WORLD environment variable *(Mentioned by: ash)*

### Feature
- Attach generation prompts to models during inspection/movement in build mode to allow users to see and remix prompts used to generate objects *(Mentioned by: Reneil)*
- Make prompt sharing an optional setting that's on by default, especially useful for collaborative building scenarios *(Mentioned by: Reneil)*

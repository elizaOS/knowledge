# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-01

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI-Generated Content & Animation
- **Vox** demonstrated impressive AI-generated helicopter animations that required no coding or 3D modeling
- Discussion about prompt engineering practices, with **Vox** suggesting positive reinforcement yields better AI responses
- Potential for integrating sound prompts with animations was explored
- Brief comparison of prompt length capabilities between Midjourney and vibe.hyperfy

### Performance Optimization
- **Ash** shared a technique to throttle animation updates based on distance
- This method significantly improves performance by reducing update frequency for distant objects
- Implementation details were provided for developers to adopt this approach

### VR Experiences
- Community members discussed VR experiences within Hyperfy
- **Ash** mentioned flying over to "dots diner" in VR and appreciating the robots there
- **Dhin** expressed interest in trying the VR experience

### Game Development
- **Dhin** mentioned working on a game loop for "dot's game cube"
- Described the project as "all vibes and slop" (likely meaning casual/relaxed development)

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Do we have prompt length limits right now?**  
**A:** "Don't think so?" (asked by vox, answered by ash)

**Q: How can I escape a collider trap at spawn?**  
**A:** "Reload and move away fast before it appears" (asked by Valiant, answered by Valiant)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Performance Optimization Guidance**
   - **Helper:** ash
   - **Context:** Performance optimization for animations

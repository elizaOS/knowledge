# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-29

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Progress
- **V2 Platform Development**: Discussions focused on technical improvements to Hyperfy's V2 platform, including UI enhancements, asset optimization, and cross-chain integration.
- **EVM Chain Integration**: Peezy shared progress on integrating EVM chains, encountering and resolving issues with Buffer polyfills in the PhysX implementation.
- **Game Development Framework**: Proposals for standardized game development approaches, including a match node system with methods like `app.match.start()` and `app.match.addPlayerToTeam()` to simplify implementation.
- **Asset Optimization**: Conversations about material instancing to optimize memory usage, with suggestions to combine assets with shared materials into single GLBs for better performance.
- **360° Video Implementation**: MetaRick demonstrated a working example of a 360-degree video sphere in Hyperfy, created using VRChat techniques with render textures and cameras.

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- **World Deployment System**: Lastraum from theforgecore.xyz showcased a system allowing users to create their own Hyperfy worlds directly from within an existing world using chat commands, deployed on Digital Ocean with Docker.
- **Interconnected Worlds**: Community enthusiasm for connecting worlds through portals, with multiple developers working on similar implementations.
- **Mobile & VR Compatibility**: Discussions confirmed Hyperfy works on iPhone, with performance dependent on world optimization. Keeping worlds with low MB size improves performance across devices.

### HYPER Token & Economics
- **Token Price Discussions**: Community members discussed the HYPER token's significant price decline (93-98% from ATH according to various users), with some trading the volatility between $0.016-0.02.
- **Token Utility Plans**: Team members clarified that HYPER will have utility for DAO governance, purchasing in-world items for games, and buying premium add-ons not included in the open-source repository.
- **Team Commitment**: Representatives like jar0d emphasized that the team is focused on development rather than price action and confirmed they haven't sold their tokens.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Features
- **Q**: Can I spawn things like projectiles or enemies in V2?  
  **A**: Yes, you can `.clone()` anything from your app's model and move it around, embedding projectiles inside a GLB allows your app to spawn and shoot them.

- **Q**: Is there app-to-app communication or an events system?  
  **A**: You can use `app.emit(name, data)` and other apps can listen with `world.on(name, callback)`.

- **Q**: Is there something like a prefab system to set up an App outside of the world?  
  **A**: Apps themselves are essentially blueprints in Hyperfy. They'll soon add the ability to export an entire app as a .hyp file including all scripts, models and extra files.

- **Q**: Is there a way to instance materials on the backend when two separate GLBs share the same material?  
  **A**: Currently it doesn't do this. GLBs will have different material UUIDs even if they're identical.

- **Q**: What does a potential backup of a world in v2 look like?  
  **A**: There's a world folder you can just backup and restore anywhere. Just zip the world folder.

### Platform & Infrastructure
- **Q**: Is Hyperfy possible on mobile?  
  **A**: Yes, but performance depends on the specific world's optimization.

- **Q**: Can I run my .glb avatar in Hyperfy?  
  **A**: No, VRM only. You need conversion.

- **Q**: How are reflections handled in the environment?  
  **A**: Reflections are powered by static HDRIs that usually match the sky, and equirectangular snapshots of the world can be used as environment maps.

- **Q**: Are you able to deploy worlds yet?  
  **A**: Yes, users can spin up a world on their own through an interactive square in the main world that uses chat prompts.

### Token & Economics
- **Q**: Does the token have any utility?  
  **A**: Will be a DAO token once DAO is setup, used to purchase in-world items for games, and buy addons not included in the open source GitHub.

- **Q**: Did the project run away?  
  **A**: The team hasn't sold anything yet.

- **Q**: What is the correct token contract?  
  **A**: Contract address is at the top of channel #token-info.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Problem Solving
- **Peezy's EVM Integration**: Ashxn helped peezy debug an issue with Buffer polyfill in PhysX causing client crashes when integrating EVM chains. They identified that the `missingGlobal('buffer')` call in physx-js-webidl.js was causing conflicts with wallet packages, and removing it fixed the issue.

- **360° Video Implementation**: MetaRick shared a working example of a 360 video world with maximus, explaining the technical approach and providing the sphere asset for others to use.

- **World Deployment**: Lastraum helped ash troubleshoot an issue with world deployment caused by an infinite loop in the update script, successfully resolving the problem.

### Knowledge Sharing
- **Documentation Efforts**: devilsadvocate.sol shared his fork with a docs branch containing updated documentation (https://github.com/wyattlovesgrapes/hyperfy/tree/docs-getting-started/docs).

- **EVM Integration**: peezy shared his EVM fork (https://github.com/peezy/hyperfy/tree/evm_dev) with Omka that provides wagmi actions to the API, helping with EVM integration for Solana without rewriting contracts in Rust.

- **Developer Call Resources**: maximus provided links to call recordings and summary notes for community members who missed the developer calls.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-29

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Memory Optimization**: Significant discussions about reducing VRAM usage, with one example showing a car model reduced from 550MB to 34MB while maintaining visual quality.
- **Material Sharing**: Developers discussed implementing material sharing between GLB files with identical materials to reduce memory usage, as currently GLBs have different material UUIDs even when identical.
- **EVM Integration**: peezy shared a fork providing wagmi integration for blockchain functionality, helping users who want to make EVM/Solidity dApps work without rewriting contracts.
- **Preloader Improvements**: Developers discussed implementing overlay functionality for the preloader to enhance user experience.
- **CORS Issues**: Technical challenges were identified when downloading models from external services due to CORS restrictions.

### Game Development & Standards
- **Standardized Matchmaking**: Proposals for a standardized matchmaking system with methods like `app.match.start()` and `app.match.lobby.addPlayer()` to simplify game development.
- **Game Development Approaches**: Community members discussed both full-fledged games and portable mini-games (like Hyperball vs. poker) to increase platform exposure.
- **Roblox-like Approach**: Suggestions to follow Roblox's model by creating numerous games to increase platform exposure, with a main portal for discovering games.

### 360-Degree Video & Immersive Experiences
- **Sphere Implementation**: MetaRick shared a working example of a 360 video world created using VRChat avatar techniques with render textures and cameras.
- **Reflection Techniques**: Discussions about using equirectangular snapshots of the world as environment maps for more accurate reflections showing buildings.
- **Two-way Projection**: Maximus proposed using a projector with a camera inside the world to create a two-way projection between real and virtual environments.

### HYPER Token & Economics
- **Price Action**: The HYPER token has experienced a significant decline (93-95% from ATH), with active trading between $0.016-0.02.
- **Token Utility**: jar0d explained HYPER will function as a DAO token, be used for in-world purchases, and to buy add-ons not included in the open-source GitHub.
- **Team Commitment**: Development team emphasized they're focused on building technology rather than price action and confirmed they haven't sold their tokens.

### Platform Features & Compatibility
- **Avatar Format Support**: Clarification that Hyperfy only supports VRM format, requiring conversion from other formats like GLB/USDZ.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Confirmation that Hyperfy works on iPhone but performance depends on world optimization and "heaviness."
- **Version Differences**: References to Hyperfy's two versions: v1 (NFT-based worlds) and v2 (free, self-hosted but requiring development installations).

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: How can apps spawn things like projectiles?  
  **A**: You can .clone() anything from your app's model and move it around, so embedding projectiles inside a GLB allows the app to spawn and shoot them.

- **Q**: How do apps communicate with each other?  
  **A**: You can use app.emit(name, data) and other apps can listen with world.on(name, callback).

- **Q**: Is there a prefab/blueprint system to set up apps outside the world?  
  **A**: Apps themselves are essentially blueprints. Hyperfy plans to add the ability to export entire apps as .hyp files that include all scripts, models, and extra files.

- **Q**: Is there a way to instance materials on the backend when two GLBs share the same material?  
  **A**: Currently this isn't implemented. GLBs have different material UUIDs even when identical.

- **Q**: What does a potential backup of a world in v2 look like?  
  **A**: There's a world folder you can just backup and restore anywhere - just zip the world folder.

### Platform & Features
- **Q**: Is there any way to run a .glb/.usdz avatar in Hyperfy?  
  **A**: No, VRM only. You need conversion.

- **Q**: Does Hyperfy run on iPhone?  
  **A**: Yes, but performance depends on the world's optimization.

- **Q**: Is Hyperfy's land an NFT?  
  **A**: Version 1 uses NFTs, while Version 2 is free and self-hosted but requires development installations.

- **Q**: How are reflections handled in the environment?  
  **A**: Reflections are powered by static HDRIs that match the sky, and equirectangular snapshots of the world can be used as environment maps for more accurate reflections.

### HYPER Token
- **Q**: What is the purpose of the HYPER token?  
  **A**: Will be a DAO token once DAO is setup, used to purchase in-world items for team/community made games, and to buy addons not included in the open source GitHub.

- **Q**: Has the team sold their tokens?  
  **A**: The team has sold nothing.

- **Q**: Is the project still being worked on?  
  **A**: Yes, the team is actively working on development and shipping new features.

- **Q**: Why did the token fall so much?  
  **A**: Multiple factors including airdrop selling pressure and the AI narrative dying down.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **EVM Integration Support**: peezy helped Omka who wanted to make EVM/Solidity dApp work for Solana without rewriting contracts in Rust by sharing his EVM fork that provides wagmi integration.

- **Troubleshooting Upload Issues**: Ashxn helped emotionull who couldn't upload VRM or GLB files after launching via Digital Ocean by starting a troubleshooting process checking git clone status, branch, and changes.

- **Client Crash Resolution**: Ashxn assisted peezy with an issue where physx-js-webidl.js was causing client crashes related to buffer polyfill when integrating EVM chains. They identified that removing missingGlobal('buffer') call fixed the issue.

- **360 Video Implementation**: MetaRick shared a working example of a 360 video sphere with maximus, explaining the technique using VRChat avatars with render textures and providing the sphere asset.

- **Token Verification Help**: Ashxn and jar0d helped Mimsy verify the correct HYPER token contract address and understand how to check if she made a bad swap.

- **Mobile Access Issues**: bitpixi helped jay who couldn't access Hyperfy on iPhone, explaining that performance depends on world optimization and offering to add a spawn point to fix access issues.

- **Avatar Format Conversion**: ùöüùöòùö°ùöüùöíùöéùöóùöóùöé helped exHuman convert .glb/.usdz avatar to work in Hyperfy by providing information about VRM format support and sharing a link to VRM addon for Blender.

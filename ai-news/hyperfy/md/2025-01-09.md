# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-09

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy v2 Development
- **Open Source Release**: Hyperfy v2 is now available as an open-source project on GitHub, allowing developers to build and host their own worlds
- **Technical Architecture**: The platform is device-agnostic, working across browsers without downloads or wallet connections required
- **Deployment Methods**: Community members are actively exploring various deployment options including Docker, VPS, and nginx configurations
- **Performance**: Current architecture supports 100-300 concurrent users with potential for more through network optimizations
- **Instancing**: The platform automatically instances meshes, allowing thousands of identical objects with minimal overhead
- **Mobile & VR Support**: The platform works across devices including VR headsets, with ongoing work to improve mobile controls

### AI Integration
- **AI Agents**: Hyperfy supports AI agents (including Eliza) that can roam worlds, interact with users, and be controlled programmatically
- **Spatial Awareness**: AI agents are aware of objects in the world and can navigate independently
- **Voice Capability**: Work is underway to implement voice functionality for AI agents

### Token ($HYPER) Launch
- **Airdrop**: Distribution for v1 NFT holders and eligible ai16z token holders, with registration ending January 12th
- **Tokenomics**: Includes a DAO allocation (30%) for community governance, and founder tokens (15%) vested over 3 years
- **Price Action**: Token experienced significant volatility after launch, dropping to around $0.07 before recovering
- **Utility Development**: The team is working on integrating token utility into the open source codebase, expected within a month

### Community Building
- **Documentation**: Community is collaboratively documenting findings in a shared HackMD document
- **Pull Requests**: Multiple contributions already merged into the codebase
- **Hosting Solutions**: Several contributors have successfully deployed instances and are sharing their configurations

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical
- **Q**: How do I set up admin permissions in v2?  
  **A**: Currently if you don't set an admin code everyone is admin and builder. If you set an admin code, you can make yourself admin by typing `/admin <code>` in the chat.

- **Q**: How do I move objects vertically in the editor?  
  **A**: Hold shift and move the mouse.

- **Q**: How do I host Hyperfy v2 so it's accessible from outside localhost?  
  **A**: Add `host: '0.0.0.0'` to the fastify.listen() call in src/server/index.js.

- **Q**: Will it be possible to have mesh instances in worlds?  
  **A**: Everything is automatically instanced by default, allowing thousands of the same mesh with little overhead.

- **Q**: How many concurrent users can Hyperfy support?  
  **A**: Currently 100-300 is realistic, with potential for more through network optimizations and priority update systems.

- **Q**: Will audio/voice chat be supported in v2?  
  **A**: Planning to use LiveKit for voice chat. If you add credentials to .env it will use it, otherwise the feature won't be available.

- **Q**: Is VR support currently a thing on hyperfy?  
  **A**: Yes, 100% VR supported. It's device agnostic - if you can get HTTP into your device, you can visit a hyperfy world.

### Token
- **Q**: What is the role/usage of the token in the ecosystem?  
  **A**: The team has "cool ideas for how tokens can be used in the open source codebase" but details haven't been shared yet.

- **Q**: When will token utility be implemented?  
  **A**: Implementation is expected to begin within a month.

- **Q**: Why is the price dropping despite having real tech?  
  **A**: Multiple users suggested it's due to airdrop recipients selling.

- **Q**: Why was the airdrop claim extended?  
  **A**: People had only a month to submit and many supporters hadn't been paying attention.

- **Q**: What allocation did founders get?  
  **A**: They have a 15% allocation vested over 3 years.

- **Q**: Is the liquidity pool locked?  
  **A**: Yes.

- **Q**: How is one eligible for hyper airdrop?  
  **A**: Only holders of ETH NFT from the December snapshot and wallets with 100k ai16z tokens on December 25 are eligible.

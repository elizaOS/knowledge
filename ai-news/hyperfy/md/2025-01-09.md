# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-09

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy v2 Development
- **Open Source Release**: Hyperfy v2 has been open-sourced on GitHub, allowing developers to build and host their own worlds
- **Technical Architecture**: The platform is designed to be lightweight ("runs on a potato") while supporting complex interactions
- **Performance**: Impressive mesh instancing capabilities with little overhead, supporting thousands of the same mesh
- **Deployment Options**: Community members are deploying v2 instances using Docker, VPS hosting, and nginx configurations
- **Browser-Based Access**: Worlds can be accessed directly through browsers without downloads or wallet connections
- **Cross-Platform**: The platform is device-agnostic, working on any device that can handle HTTP requests, including VR support
- **Core Features**: Developers have implemented chat functionality, admin controls, and object manipulation (move, duplicate, delete)
- **Community Documentation**: A shared hackmd document has been created for collaborative documentation of findings

### Token ($HYPER) Discussion
- **Price Action**: The token experienced significant volatility, dropping to around $0.07 before recovering
- **Airdrop Claims**: Unclaimed airdrop tokens (for v1 NFT holders and eligible ai16z token holders) will be burned after the January 12th deadline
- **Token Distribution**: DAO controls 30% of supply for community initiatives, while founder allocations (15%) are vested over 3 years
- **Utility Development**: The team is working on integrating tokens into the open source codebase, expected in about a month
- **Registration Process**: Users must register ETH and SOL addresses on Hyperfy.io/airdrop, wait 24 hours, then claim on Hyperfy.xyz/claim

### Upcoming Features
- **AI Integration**: The team is working on Eliza AI agent integration, allowing AI characters to roam worlds and interact with users
- **In-Browser Coding**: v2 will include in-browser coding capabilities to streamline development
- **Physics & Scaling**: Enhanced physics and maps that scale were mentioned as upcoming technical features
- **Voice Chat**: Implementation of voice chat using LiveKit is planned

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical
- **Q**: How do I move objects vertically in v2?  
  **A**: Hold shift and move the mouse (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Will it be possible to have mesh instances in worlds?  
  **A**: Everything is automatically instanced by default with little overhead (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Does hyperfy multiplayer implement "network lods"?  
  **A**: Not yet, but development is heading there. Currently happy with 100-300 concurrent users (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do I fix mouse control issues in the local development environment?  
  **A**: In v2, you need to hold right-click to look around, unlike v1 which automatically locks the pointer (Saori/ash)

- **Q**: Is VR support currently available on hyperfy?  
  **A**: Yes, 100% VR supported. The platform is remarkably device agnostic (maximus)

### Token & Ecosystem
- **Q**: What is the role/usage of the token in the ecosystem?  
  **A**: The team has "cool ideas for how tokens can be used in the open source codebase" with implementation expected in about a month (Saori)

- **Q**: Why was the airdrop claim extended?  
  **A**: Many supporters hadn't been paying attention and only had a month to submit (Saori)

- **Q**: Can you share transaction where 15% founder supply was locked?  
  **A**: The biggest wallets are on Streamflow with a 9%, 4%, 1%, 1% split on 3-year linear vesting (Saori)

- **Q**: Will v1 be converted to v2 worlds?  
  **A**: No, the ETH NFT v1 worlds will remain in Hyperfy.io and will not have utility for v2 (maximus)

- **Q**: How do I prevent people posting illegal stuff in worlds?  
  **A**: For now, worlds are self-hosted so publishers would be liable for illegal content (Saori)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Implementations
- **peezy** created detailed documentation for VPS deployment with HTTPS, including firewall setup and domain configuration
- **~/HowiEDuhzit** created and shared a Docker setup with compose file and published image
- **HPrivakos** provided code fix to add host: "0.0.0.0" to the fastify.listen call to fix localhost binding issues
- **HPrivakos** created and submitted PR #2 for adding names in chat, which was merged
- **MetaMike** created a hackmd document for the community to document their findings and breakthroughs

### Token & Airdrop Support
- **PabloFM** helped **bard ionson** confirm that the airdrop works with Hyperfy NFTs on ETH if they had it on December 7th
- **Jona** provided links to relevant information for **samgittis.eth** who confirmed successful airdrop claim
- **maximus** helped multiple users understand the 3-step process for claiming eligible tokens
- **VTATV** advised **heavydev** to use PC or laptop instead of mobile for claiming the airdrop

### Platform Usage
- **Ashxn** explained to **SotoAlt** that objects spawning in the sky was likely due to GLB files not having a good origin point
- **Lastraum** confirmed to **vincentskele** that basic setup works on Digital Ocean droplets without modifications
- **ash** helped **MetaMike** with mesh placement constraints by suggesting a transparent ground mesh

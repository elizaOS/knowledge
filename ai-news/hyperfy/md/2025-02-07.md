# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Features
- **App Cloning & Object Manipulation**: Developers discussed techniques for cloning app objects with `app.clone(true)` for recursive cloning, useful for projectiles or duplicating complex objects. Object rotation was explained using `app.rotation.y = 45 * DEG2RAD`.
- **Control Systems**: Significant debate about implementing separate build and game modes, with many advocating for pointer lock controls similar to V1. Double-jumping to activate flying in build mode was highlighted as a useful feature.
- **Cross-App Communication**: Several developers worked on implementing communication between apps using `world.emit()` and `world.on()` to enable interaction between different applications.
- **3D Asset Optimization**: Discussions about mesh instancing confirmed that linked duplicates in Blender automatically instance in Hyperfy v2 without additional scripts. Users shared texture optimization techniques comparing JPEG, PNG, and WebP formats.
- **Docker Optimization**: HPrivakos created a PR to reduce Docker image size from 1.3GB to 460MB, improving deployment efficiency.

### AI & Agent Integration
- **Eliza App Development**: Progress with getting Eliza to understand spatial directions was mentioned by drdoge.eth. HPrivakos is working on Eliza hosting with the goal to load character files without restarting the server.
- **AI Tools**: Discussions about ai-news for automated Discord/Twitter/GitHub monitoring, with jin providing command syntax corrections.
- **RAG Systems**: Proposals to create a retrieval-augmented generation system with Hyperfy docs for AI assistance.

### Web3 & Blockchain Integration
- **HYPER Token**: Users discussed claiming HYPER tokens from an airdrop, with some achieving the "hyperflier" role by accumulating 100k tokens.
- **Wallet Integration**: Discussions about implementing Solana wallet connection in worlds and supporting web3 integration across different chains (Base, Optimism, Solana).
- **Subscription Payments**: Exploration of Streamflow and Superfluid integration for subscription-based payments to creators and worlds.

### Marketplace & Creator Economy
- **Marketplace Development**: Discussions about implementing a marketplace for buying/selling apps with features like "pay what you want" pricing and collections functionality.
- **Hosting Options**: Conversations about hyperworld.host pricing tiers, with HPrivakos mentioning the need to review the gap between $5 and $25 tiers.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Development & Technical**
- Q: How do I clone an app or mesh properly?
  A: Use `app.clone(true)` where the `true` parameter enables recursive cloning of all child elements.

- Q: How do I set an object's rotation?
  A: Use `app.rotation.y = 45 * DEG2RAD` to set rotation in degrees.

- Q: How can I get the actual avatar position?
  A: Use `world.getPlayer()` to get the player object and access its position.

- Q: How do I set a spawn point?
  A: Use the command `/spawn set`.

- Q: Will Hyperfy be moved to TypeScript?
  A: It's a longer-term consideration, currently focusing on stability and user-friendliness.

- Q: Does Hyperfy Tools work on Blender 4.0?
  A: It works on 4.2+ officially, but might work if manually installed on 4.0.

**Web3 & Marketplace**
- Q: How do I claim my hyper tokens?
  A: Maximus provided a link to FAQ about the token drop with detailed instructions.

- Q: What's a good way to let everyone who sees our twitter know we have a token?
  A: Suggestions included pinned post, linktree, or adding token link under existing links.

- Q: Do you have to have a certain amount to get the hyperflyer role?
  A: 100k hyper gets you the hyperflier role.

**User Experience**
- Q: What's the best way of getting started with Hyperfy v2 for a designer with limited coding skills?
  A: For designers, paying for hosting was recommended as the easiest option.

- Q: Is it technically possible to create a GTA San Andreas-esque game on Hyperfy?
  A: You can find a San Andreas map on Sketchfab and set it as the default space.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Asset Optimization**: 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 helped TheMattEmpire troubleshoot why exported GLB files were larger than expected, suggesting to check if textures were accidentally plugged into alpha channel, which forces PNG export.

- **Development Assistance**: Ashxn provided extensive help to devilsadvocate.sol on cloning app objects properly, explaining that `clone(true)` is needed for recursive cloning and providing code examples.

- **Local Environment Setup**: HPrivakos assisted treed with setting up a local development environment by providing simple npm commands to run locally.

- **Security Awareness**: devilsadvocate.sol warned the community about suspicious tokens, identifying red flags in code showing fake RPC products with placeholder comments.

- **Docker Optimization**: HPrivakos created a PR to reduce Docker image size from 1.3GB to 460MB, significantly improving deployment efficiency.

- **Control System Fixes**: Ashxn fixed the inverted mouse wheel zoom direction in Hyperfy v2 after feedback from maximus and 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎.

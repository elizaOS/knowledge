# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Tools & Infrastructure
- **App-Rollup Tool**: MayD524 created a tool using Rollup.js to enable multi-file development instead of single-file apps, solving a significant workflow issue for many developers.
- **Animation Repository**: Saori created a repository of animations for avatars, hosting them on a Vercel site (hyperfy-animations.vercel.app) for easy access.
- **Viewer Engine**: Ashxn worked on a "viewer" version of the engine for use in menus and avatar studios.
- **Pathfinding System**: Shiffty developed an impressive pathfinding system using A* algorithm and raycasting to generate a navmesh.

### Technical Implementations
- **Animation Origin Fixes**: Detailed discussions about fixing animation origin issues in Blender for proper avatar animations.
- **ESM Module Loading**: Developers worked through issues with module loading and imports.
- **Texture Rendering**: Solutions for fuzzy textures at a distance by changing interpolation settings from "Closest" to "Linear".
- **Networking Improvements**: Discussions about targeted network messaging with app.send(name, data, targetNetworkId).

### Community Apps & Creations
- Several developers shared apps including a swivel chair, cloud system, and follower scripts.
- Sceth iii shared animated GIFs/APNGs created in Unreal Engine for potential use as Discord stickers.

### Business & Tokenomics
- Saori discussed tokenomics philosophy, emphasizing focus on adoption over token flywheels.
- HYPER token showed significant volatility, with initial negative performance followed by recovery.
- Marketplace development previews were shared by Ash.

### AI & Future of Development
- Debate about AI coding tools like Cursor vs Copilot and their impact on programming careers.
- Some expressed concern about AI eventually managing entire projects while others emphasized the continued value of human experience.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: How do you fix animation origin issues in Blender?  
  **A**: In Blender, select the armature, hit tab for edit mode, shift+A to add a bone, rename to "Root", hold shift and select armature then root, then cmd+p to parent and keep offset. When exporting, set animation sampling to 3 for better file size.

- **Q**: How can I develop with multiple files instead of a single app.js?  
  **A**: Use the App-Rollup tool which packages multiple files together. Export from secondary files and import in your main file.

- **Q**: How can I see debug information like FPS and draw calls?  
  **A**: Use the lightning bolt at bottom left for mesh/material info, or enter /stats in chat to see fps/cpu/gpu stats.

- **Q**: How do you deploy a Hyperfy world to production?  
  **A**: You can follow the self-hosting guide at hyperfy.how/hosting/self/, use hyperworld.host for $5, or attend the upcoming tutorial.

- **Q**: What causes textures to get fuzzy at a distance?  
  **A**: Using "Closest" texture interpolation instead of the default "Linear" setting causes this issue.

- **Q**: Is VRM just a model that's boned and rigged in a specific way?  
  **A**: Yes, it's a GLTF format with specific rigging requirements.

### Platform & Features
- **Q**: Is it possible to make 2D games that launch from inside Hyperfy?  
  **A**: Not possible at the moment.

- **Q**: What happens if you disable the base environment?  
  **A**: There's a permanent physics floor at origin even if you disable the environment GLB. You can still place things without the visual floor.

- **Q**: Does unique only affect models duplicated after you set it?  
  **A**: Unique means any new duplicates will be completely disconnected from anything.

### Business & Tokenomics
- **Q**: What happened to the working flywheel in 3 weeks?  
  **A**: "I do not care about a token flywheel even slightly. I care about adoption." (answered by Saori)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Animation Origin Fixes**:  
   Ashxn helped peezy with detailed Blender workflow for fixing animation origins and export settings that were causing emotes to not line up properly in-world.

2. **Multi-file Development**:  
   MayD524 created and shared the App-Rollup tool to enable multi-file development with proper bundling, helping multiple developers improve their workflow.

3. **Animation Repository**:  
   Saori created and hosted an animation repository at hyperfy-animations.vercel.app with previews for the entire community to use.

4. **Swivel Chair App Fix**:  
   Ashxn helped devilsadvocate.sol by fixing networking issues with the swivel chair app and providing an updated version.

5. **GLB Replacement Guidance**:  
   Omka helped MetaRick with specific instructions for changing GLB, removing rotation, and adjusting anchor position.

6. **Texture Rendering Solution**:  
   Ashxn identified the cause of TheMattEmpire's fuzzy textures at a distance as incorrect texture interpolation settings.

7. **Pathfinding System**:  
   Shiffty created and shared an A* pathfinding system with navmesh generation using raycasting, which impressed many developers despite being described as "an abomination."

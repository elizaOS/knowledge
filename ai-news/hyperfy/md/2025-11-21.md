# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-21

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **UV Scrolling Limitations**: Currently only supported on regular meshes, not on skinned meshes despite implementation attempts. This is a technical limitation that the team is aware of. (💻│developers)
- **IFC File Integration**: Discussions about integrating Industry Foundation Classes files in Hyperfy using ThatOpen's engine components, though performance concerns were raised. (💻│developers)
- **Canvas-Texture Optimization**: Using dirty flags was discussed as an efficient method for implementing games in Hyperfy, specifically for optimizing redraw rates while maintaining FPS for in-world games like Space Invaders and slot machines. (💻│developers)
- **Mesh Grouping Techniques**: Conversation about grouping meshes to improve CPU/GPU performance while maintaining individual access to nested elements. (💻│developers)

### Platform Features & Ecosystem
- **Wallet Connectivity**: .hyp shaman pointed out that wallet connect functionality has been available through hypkg.sh for months, though it's not yet in the core/stable branch. (⚡│general)
- **Cars and Pets Features**: These features have been implemented but not iterated upon, suggesting opportunities for community development. (⚡│general)
- **Web3 Integration Approaches**: Discussion about web3 gating and smart contracts, with 3rdEyeVisuals noting they're taking a backend session-based approach rather than on-chain gaming to avoid transaction fees. (⚡│general)

### Community & Development Culture
- **Skill Development Discussion**: Tension noted between those who can modify code and those who cannot, with encouragement for community members to develop skills to contribute directly. (⚡│general)
- **Development Learning Curves**: Challenges of keeping up with rapidly changing technologies were mentioned. (⚡│general)
- **Token Discussion**: Brief mentions of HYPER token price predictions in the 🪙│hyper channel, though no substantive technical content was shared.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Do we have UV scrolling on skinned meshes? (asked by Valiant)  
   **A**: Only regular mesh currently. Skinned mesh support is a bit harder. (answered by ash)

2. **Q**: Is there a way to group individual meshes with ctrl+j and still access each nested mesh separately? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals)  
   **A**: Yes, use the group node or empties in Blender. (answered by .hyp shaman)

3. **Q**: Anything new on the horizon for the Github? (asked by Agent12)  
   **A**: "ngl it's pretty stable. on hyp." (answered by .hyp shaman)

4. **Q**: We got Cars, Pets, or Web3 Gating yet in Stable Dev? (asked by Agent12)  
   **A**: "cars and pets have been done for a minute now. afaik no one has looked at the code to iterate" (answered by .hyp shaman)

5. **Q**: Where is @179546010303856640? (asked by lambert2288)  
   **A**: "Usually when he goes quiet, it means he's working on something big." (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-21

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Status & Features
- **Wallet Connect Functionality**: Available through "hypkg" (https://hypkg.sh/) for months, though some users feel it's not accessible enough to non-developers
- **Cars and Pets Features**: Implementations exist but need review and iteration according to .hyp shaman
- **Developer Absence**: Community members noted the lead developer's absence, with speculation that silence typically indicates work on significant updates

### Technical Implementations
- **IFC File Integration**: A developer is working on implementing IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) files in Hyperfy using ThatOpen's engine components, though performance concerns exist
- **Canvas-Texture Approach**: Developers discussed using canvas-texture with dirty flags to optimize redraw rates for in-world games, including a slot machine with Solana integration
- **UV Scrolling Limitations**: Currently only supported on regular meshes, not on skinned meshes
- **Mesh Organization**: Discussion about grouping meshes while maintaining individual access using group nodes or empties in Blender

### Development Challenges
- **Learning Curve**: Frustration expressed about the difficulty in learning programming despite efforts
- **Technical Knowledge Barriers**: Tension between those who believe anyone can develop with AI assistance versus those who feel limited by technical knowledge
- **Blockchain Integration**: Some members taking alternative approaches to blockchain integration, preferring backend session-based approaches over on-chain games to avoid transaction fees

### Token Discussion
- Brief comments about the Hyperfy token price in the 🪙│hyper channel, including speculation about future value

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Do we have UV scrolling on skinned meshes?  
   **A**: Only regular mesh currently. Skinned mesh support is a bit harder. (answered by ash)

2. **Q**: Is there a way to group individual meshes with ctrl+j and still access each nested mesh separately?  
   **A**: Yes, use the group node or empties in Blender. (answered by .hyp shaman)

3. **Q**: Anything new on the horizon for the Github?  
   **A**: "ngl it's pretty stable. on hyp." (answered by .hyp shaman)

4. **Q**: We got Cars, Pets, or Web3 Gating yet in Stable Dev?  
   **A**: "cars and pets have been done for a minute now. afaik no one has looked at the code to iterate" (answered by .hyp shaman)

5. **Q**: Where is the lead developer?  
   **A**: "Usually when he goes quiet, it means he's working on something big." (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **UV Scrolling Clarification**:  
   ash helped Valiant by clarifying that UV scrolling only works on regular meshes currently, saving them from spending more time on an unsupported feature

2. **Mesh Organization Techniques**:  
   .hyp shaman assisted 3rdEyeVisuals by suggesting using group nodes or empties in Blender to organize meshes while maintaining access to individual components

3. **Map Tile Renderer Suggestion**:  
   ash suggested Cesium.js to mrtzhckr as a possible solution for implementing map tiles in Hyperfy

4. **Wallet Connect Information**:  
   .hyp shaman shared that wallet connect has been available through hypkg.sh for months and provided the link to Agent12

5. **Learning Encouragement**:  
   3rdEyeVisuals shared personal experience about the difficulty of learning 3D modeling (making a donut in Blender) and encouraged Agent12 to persist through failed attempts

## Action Items

### Technical
- Develop API for UV scrolling on skinned meshes (Mentioned by ash)
- Optimize IFC file implementation for better performance (Mentioned by mrtzhckr)
- Implement map tiles in Hyperfy (Mentioned by mrtzhckr)
- Explore webview implementation with consideration for memory overhead (Mentioned by .hyp shaman)
- Implement wallet connect functionality from hypkg into the main development branch (Mentioned by Agent12)
- Review and iterate on existing cars and pets code (Mentioned by .hyp shaman)
- Consider backend session-based approach instead of on-chain games to avoid transaction fees (Mentioned by 3rdEyeVisuals)

### Feature
- Add virtual controller UI for mobile similar to reference image (Mentioned by Akuma)
- Add Bluetooth controller key binding options (Mentioned by Akuma)
- Implement Web3 gating for access control (Mentioned by Agent12)

### Documentation
- Create documentation for database integration with Hyperfy builds (Implied need from unanswered question by 3rdEyeVisuals)

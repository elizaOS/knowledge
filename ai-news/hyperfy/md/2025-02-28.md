# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-28

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Flight & Vehicle Mechanics
- **Hyperduck Flight System**: Shiffty developed flight mechanics that were unexpectedly released, generating excitement in the community. The system includes barrel rolls, projectiles, and camera controls.
- **Vehicle Physics**: Ashxn explained that cars in V1 use a single box collider with 4 raycasts pointing down from wheel struts, applying upward force based on ground distance to simulate springs.
- **Space Flight Potential**: Shiffty mentioned that adapting the current flight mechanics to space flight would be relatively simple, sparking ideas for space-themed games including asteroid mining, resource trading, and fleet command systems.

### AI Agents Integration
- **Eliza Integration**: Peezy shared progress on connecting agents through Eliza's endpoint, creating a solution that doesn't require forking the codebase. They implemented a server approach (port 3001) that enables plugins to add endpoints to the Eliza server.
- **Agent Connection Methods**: Two approaches were discussed: the current "app" method where world owners add agents to enhance their worlds, and a proposed WebSocket connection method allowing agents to connect independently.
- **Agent Physics**: Discussion about using a controller node for agent physics/movement that accounts for collisions.

### Platform & Token Development
- **$HYPER Token Utility**: Ashxn shared that beyond engine development, they're building a platform at hyperfy.xyz that will utilize the $HYPER token for characters, emotes, vehicles, and agents.
- **Platform Plans**: The team is planning to build games and experiences with HYPER as part of the ecosystem, allowing others to create and publish content on the platform.
- **Fake Token Warning**: Community members identified a fake Hyperfy token on Base blockchain that's not affiliated with the official team.

### Technical Discussions
- **Audio Implementation**: ElevenLabs audio streaming integration was discussed, with Ashxn helping MetaMike implement binary audio data handling.
- **Networking APIs**: Ashxn explained the differences between app.emit() for world events and app.send() for app-specific events.
- **Docker Deployment**: HPrivakos clarified that Alpine-based images are available at ghcr.io/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy.
- **Blender Issues**: Users discussed backface culling problems in Blender 4.3 causing "funky x-ray surfaces," with some downgrading to earlier versions while others suggested specific solutions for transparency issues.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I handle ElevenLabs audio data in Hyperfy?** (MetaMike)  
A: You need to convert the binary data to a blob and create an objectURL, which Ashxn implemented and pushed to the dev branch. (Ashxn)

**Q: What's the difference between app.emit(), world.on(), app.on(), and app.send()?** (devilsadvocate.sol)  
A: app.emit() is for app emitting to world, world.on() is for listening to world events, app.on() is for app-specific events, app.send() sends events to same app on other clients/server. (Ashxn)

**Q: How can we implement realistic vehicle physics?** (drdoge.eth)  
A: Cars in V1 use a single box collider with 4 raycasts pointing down from wheel struts, applying upward force based on ground distance to simulate springs. (Ashxn)

**Q: Is WebAssembly support possible in Hyperfy?** (MayD524)  
A: It would require adding WebAssembly functions to the scripting API. (MayD524)

**Q: Why use Eliza right now for agent integration?** (MetaMike)  
A: It offers easy onchain integration via plugins, distribution to the self-host Eliza community, clear code for other frameworks to integrate, and avoids reinventing the wheel. (peezy)

**Q: What are the plans for the $HYPER token beyond what's outlined at token.hyperfy.xyz?** (Ricky)  
A: The token will be used for characters, emotes, vehicles, agents, in-world upgrades, passes, etc. on the hyperfy.xyz platform. (Ashxn)

**Q: Does anyone have tips for backface culling issues with Blender 4.3?** (untitled, xyz)  
A: Try turning off the transparency overlap and swapping from dithered to blended in material settings. For some items, this needs to be reversed to work normally. (drdoge.eth)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **ElevenLabs Audio Integration**: Ashxn helped MetaMike implement binary audio data handling for ElevenLabs audio streaming, adding support for blob loading and pushing the fix to the dev branch.

- **Player Position Fix**: Ashxn fixed an issue reported by Shiffty where player position was slipping during high-speed flight in Hyperduck by correcting position calculation timing.

- **Black Screen Bug**: ~/HowiEDuhzit fixed a black screen issue when clicking the ⚡ button by changing this.world to world in AppPane.js and submitted a pull request.

- **Docker Deployment**: HPrivakos helped ~/HowiEDuhzit with Docker image optimization for Coolify deployment, explaining that Alpine-based images are already available at ghcr.io/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy.

- **Blender Rendering Issues**: drdoge.eth provided specific solutions for transparency issues in Blender 4.3, recommending turning off transparency overlap and switching between dithered and blended settings in material properties.

- **Agent Physics**: Ashxn shared a link to a controller node that handles movement with physics considerations to help peezy with agent collisions.

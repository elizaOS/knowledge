## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Project Updates
- **Phetta Kart Development**: Emotionull shared progress on the Phetta Kart project, which now has movement functionality, though they noted the physics implementation needs improvement. The project can be viewed at phettaverse.games. Base "hyps" were created by doge, with other hyps being used for cursor guidance. [ðŸ’»â”‚developers]

### Feature Ideas
- **Eliza Agents**: Drdoge.eth suggested implementing Eliza agents with different versions that could spawn in and cause mayhem in the environment. [ðŸ’»â”‚developers]

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Physics Debugging**: 0mka helped emotionull by suggesting that the "glitch circling" issue in Phetta Kart might be caused by colliding colliders, providing insight into the physics implementation problem. [ðŸ’»â”‚developers]

## Action Items

### Technical
- **Improve physics math implementation** for Phetta Kart (mentioned by emotionull)

  - May need to address collider interactions

### Feature
- **Implement Eliza agents with different versions** (mentioned by ~/drdoge.eth)
  - Add agents that can spawn in and cause mayhem
  - Could add an interactive element to the environment

### Pending Questions
- When will hyperuber be available? (asked by 0mka, currently unanswered)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Rendering & Performance Improvements
Ashxn shared a breakthrough in rendering technology for Hyperfy using octree traversal with frustum and occlusion culling. This approach dramatically improves performance by efficiently handling scenes with hundreds of thousands of objects. The system renders objects from front to back, skipping those outside the camera view or hidden behind other objects. In a demonstration, a scene with 210,000 unique objects ran at just 1ms for CPU and GPU when not rendering all objects simultaneously. This performance improvement brings Hyperfy closer to Unity and Unreal games, enabling web-based virtual worlds with a quarter million unique objects to run smoothly on mobile and VR devices.

### Cross-World Connectivity
Several developers discussed implementing world-to-world connections to enable seamless travel between different virtual spaces. This would include a unified map showing geographic relationships between worlds, transportation systems, and potentially guild/faction systems with player identification (player.guildId) and visual indicators like icons under nametags. These features would enhance the social and exploratory aspects of the platform.

### UI Components & Mobile Experience
Lastraum shared a notification component that auto-scales to zero when not in use, which can be triggered with a simple API call. Carlosmu raised questions about mobile controls and device-specific content adaptation. The team discussed the interaction button functionality for mobile users and the need for better tutorials explaining mobile controls. There was also mention of creating a "look at camera" billboard option instead of "match camera rotation" for UI elements.

### Web3 Integration
Lastraum mentioned implementing web3 authentication with NFT verification for admin rights. HypPrivakos shared a marketplace link for .hyp domains. There was also discussion about creating a non-gatekept hyp database that could be used for AI training.

### Migration & Building
Carlosmu shared progress on migrating a building from Decentraland to Hyperfy v1, asking about adding glow effects and tutorials in the process.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What would such performance improvement look like?**  
A: It would be much more closely aligned with Unity and Unreal games, allowing web-based virtual worlds with a quarter million unique objects to run on mobile/VR. (Ashxn)

**Q: What about other web inherent limitations like websocket instead of UDP?**  
A: We use websockets and it does pretty well. There's also WebRTC for near-UDP networking, and WebTransport which is meant to offer UDP-like capabilities. (Ashxn)

**Q: How does the occlusion culling work with objects?**  
A: ThreeJS only checks if objects are in the camera frustum, but with occlusion culling we can skip everything outside the frustum and render inside the frustum from front to back, skipping occluded objects. (Ashxn)

**Q: Is there a way to add glow effect in hyp-v1?**  
A: Increase the emissive strength in Blender and adjust the colors there. (Ashxn)

**Q: Is it possible to change some contents depending on the device?**  
A: v2 lets you do custom UI in hyperscript, v1 doesn't have this capability. (Ashxn)

**Q: What is the utility of the hand button below the arrow?**  
A: That's the interaction button if someone needs to click on something to trigger it. (maximus)

**Q: Is there already a standalone notification app?**  
A: No, there are many UIs for worlds but not a standalone notification app that I'm aware of. (maximus)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Rendering Technology**: Ashxn provided detailed explanations to Jayzen and maximus about the new octree-based rendering approach and how occlusion culling works, helping them understand the technical improvements.

- **Visual Effects**: Ashxn advised carlosmu on adding glow effects in hyp-v1 by increasing emissive strength in Blender and adjusting colors there.

- **Mobile UI**: maximus helped carlosmu understand mobile UI controls, explaining the interaction button functionality and sharing UI asset examples.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-20

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### WebP Image Format in Hyperfy
- WebP format was identified as the preferred choice for .hyp metadata images due to superior compression
- Optimal image size for .hyp metadata is 400x400 pixels
- Animated WebP files work in this context, sparking interest about potential applications
- Technical comparison between WebP, PNG, and GIF formats highlighted WebP as having advantages of both with better compression
- Potential compatibility issues with WebP on iOS devices were mentioned

### Hyperfy Platform Features
- Images in .hyp metadata files are visible through a "+" icon in Hyperfy's interface
- "awesome-hyps" setup allows world hosts/builders to easily add hyps to the add section
- World images should be similar in size and load quickly for the loading screen, which is why they're blurred out to allow lower resolution

### HYPER Token Concerns
- Multiple community members expressed concern about the token's declining value
- Requests were made for more information on tokenomics and project direction
- Some frustration was evident regarding the token's performance

### Security Alert
- User jar0d warned about their hacked Twitter account

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Where/when would the image you can add to a .hyp's metadata be visible?**  
A: In Hyperfy there is a little + icon where you can see the image in the metadata. We setup "awesome-hyps" so anyone who is world hosting/building can add hyps to the add section easily.

**Q: Could animated WebP's be used as particles?**  
A: "I haven't tried. My guess is they don't animate on particles? Maybe just first frame."

**Q: Need tokenomics or a concept of a plan to keep moving forward?**  
A: One user responded with "more patience" but no official response was provided.

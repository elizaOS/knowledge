# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-20

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Discussions
- **Image Formats & Optimization**: Significant discussion about WebP vs PNG formats, with WebP emerging as the preferred format for Hyperfy worlds due to superior compression. Animated WebP files were confirmed to work in Hyperfy, generating excitement among users.
- **Metadata Implementation**: Technical details about .hyp metadata images were shared, with b0gie explaining they're visible via a "+" icon in Hyperfy and that 400x400 is the optimal size. Ashxn added that this metadata can be used by marketplaces and potentially as thumbnails.
- **Screen Sharing Limitations**: Ashxn explained that Chrome only allows audio sharing when sharing a specific tab rather than fullscreen, and even then only for that tab's audio. 0mka noted that webshare screen functionality has never supported audio since initial testing.
- **Documentation Updates**: hiroP shared information about adding a badge to GitHub repositories that automatically keeps documentation on "deepwiki" updated.

### Platform & Development Updates
- **UI Improvements**: 0mka mentioned improvements with message boxes and chat toggles.
- **Hyperfy Edit Mode**: cru is working on a Hyperfy edit mode fork.
- **Drifters Optimization**: Work is being done to optimize Drifters to work properly in Hyperfy.
- **Milestone Achievement**: A milestone of highest user count in a world was mentioned.

### HYPER Token Concerns
- **Token Value & Utility**: Community members expressed frustration about the HYPER token's declining value and lack of clear tokenomics. Several users noted that the token lacks utility and management.
- **Project Direction**: Users requested more information about the project's direction and tokenomics plan.
- **Team Presence**: A team member (general hyper) briefly appeared, noting they'd been away for a month.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Q&A
- **Q**: Where/when would the image you can add to a .hyp's metadata be visible?
  **A**: In Hyperfy there is a little + icon where you can see the image in the metadata. We setup "awesome-hyps" so anyone who is world hosting/building can add hyps to the add section easily. (b0gie)

- **Q**: Could these magical animated WebP's be used as particles?
  **A**: I haven't tried. My guess is they don't animate on particles? Maybe just first frame. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is there a way for the screenshare to have audio as well?
  **A**: Chrome only lets you share audio if you pick a specific tab to share instead of fullscreen, and only audio from that tab itself. Full audio would require an OBS stream or similar. (Ashxn)

### Token & Platform Q&A
- **Q**: Need tokenomics or a concept of a plan to keep moving forward (MUDBONE)
  **A**: Unanswered

- **Q**: Why mint a Hyperfy token if there's no minimum token LP managing? (jay)
  **A**: Unanswered

- **Q**: Is the token dead? (austin)
  **A**: Unanswered

- **Q**: Will the upcoming vehicles mint be on Solana or Base? (MFuture_aka_Pharaoh)
  **A**: Unanswered

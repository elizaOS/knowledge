# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-23

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **V1 to V2 Transition**: Discussions about Hyperfy's evolution from V1 (described as a "non-coder's sandbox") to V2 (more code-focused but with planned user-friendly features)
- **Production Update**: Ashxn confirmed a production branch update coming "tonight or tomorrow"
- **V2 Clarification**: Ashxn described V2 as "V1 on steroids" with app palettes coming soon, addressing concerns about it being too code-dependent

### Technical Implementations
- **UV Scrolling**: Voxvienne successfully implemented UV scrolling in V2 with help from Grok, sharing code for scrolling textures on meshes
- **Shadow Control**: Two methods discussed for controlling shadows in Hyperfy:
  1. Adding custom boolean properties in Blender (`castShadow=false`, `receiveShadow=false`)
  2. Using script commands (`mesh.castShadow = false`, `mesh.receiveShadow = false`)
- **Particle Effects**: Gert-Jan Akerboom shared a rocket launcher particle effect implementation, with Ashxn suggesting `rateOverDistance` for moving particle emitters
- **Mesh Optimization**: Discussion clarified that Blender exports meshes with multiple materials as separate meshes per material, and joining meshes only improves performance when they share the same material

### 3D Asset Optimization
- **Tree Models**: Voxvienne shared eztree.dev for creating GLB tree models, recommending processing through glb.babylonpress.org before using in Hyperfy
- **Texture Optimization**: Converting PNG to WebP format can reduce file size by ~80% while maintaining transparency needed for tree leaves
- **Polygon Challenges**: Tree models from eztree have high polygon counts (potentially 800k triangles) because leaves are implemented as numerous plane objects

### Community & Market
- **Token Performance**: Discussion about token price movements, potentially related to general market trends, particularly Solana's rise
- **Conference Representation**: Community members discussed representing Hyperfy at the Solana Conference
- **CloneX Metadata**: Side conversation about CloneX's metadata issues, highlighting the importance of decentralized storage solutions like Arweave

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Any estimated date for the next launch in the production main branch?** (PabloFM | Numinia)  
A: "Going to make one tonight or tomorrow" (Ashxn)

**Q: Is it possible to join all meshes to avoid drawcalls and just address specific materials?** (voxvienne)  
A: "Merging/joining in blender is only useful for performance if they all use one material" (Ashxn)

**Q: Can we make render ignore shadows from specific meshes?** (voxvienne)  
A: Use custom properties in Blender (`castShadow=false`, `receiveShadow=false`) or script commands (`mesh.castShadow = false`, `mesh.receiveShadow = false`) (Ashxn)

**Q: Why is the token pumping?** (johan)  
A: Likely due to general market movements, particularly Solana's rise, or recognition of recent V2 builds shared by community members (maximus)

**Q: How do you reduce file size for tree models?** (devilsadvocate.sol)  
A: "The original has a 7 mb png. WebP supports transparency and reduces file size almost 80%" (voxvienne)

**Q: What did General mean by this? Is there something about the LP I am not understanding fully?** (MUDBONE)  
A: Trading volume was high, reaching nearly 100% of total liquidity, which is unusual as it's typically under 10% (devilsadvocate.sol)

**Q: Can you get this perspective?** (peezy)  
A: "You can use drone + screenshare" (᲼)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Mesh Optimization**: Ashxn helped voxvienne understand that Blender exports separate meshes per material, and joining only helps performance when meshes share the same material
- **Shadow Control**: Ashxn provided voxvienne with two methods for controlling shadow casting/receiving for specific meshes
- **Particle Systems**: Ashxn suggested using `rateOverDistance` parameter for moving particle emitters to Gert-Jan Akerboom
- **Tree Model Optimization**: Voxvienne shared comprehensive guidance on creating and optimizing 3D tree models, including specific tools and techniques
- **Token Market Analysis**: Maximus explained to johan that token price movements were likely related to general market trends and Solana's performance
- **V2 Concerns**: Ashxn addressed voxvienne's concerns about V2 being too code-focused, clarifying that it will include user-friendly app palettes
- **Engine Showcase**: HPrivakos shared a link to uncannydev.hyperworld.host to showcase emissive models support when MUDBONE asked for examples

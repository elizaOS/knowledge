# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-23

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **V1 to V2 Transition**: Discussions about Hyperfy's transition from V1 to V2, with Ashxn clarifying that V2 will not be exclusively code-focused and will include "app palettes" similar to V1 but "on steroids" to maintain accessibility for non-coders.
- **Production Branch Update**: Ashxn announced plans to launch an update to the production main branch either tonight or tomorrow.
- **Cross-Chain Functionality**: Saori highlighted the importance of hypkg (developed by peezy), which enables cross-chain compatibility for Hyperfy, allowing builders to work with different blockchains including EVM, SVM, and MCP.

### Technical Implementations
- **UV Scrolling**: Voxvienne successfully implemented UV scrolling for materials despite not being a coder.
- **3D Model Optimization**: Detailed discussions about mesh joining and material handling for performance optimization, with Ashxn explaining that merging meshes in Blender only improves performance when they share the same material.
- **Shadow Control**: Methods for controlling shadows for specific meshes were shared, including using Blender custom properties (`castShadow=false`, `receiveShadow=false`) or script commands (`mesh.castShadow = false`, `mesh.receiveShadow = false`).
- **Texture Optimization**: Voxvienne highlighted WebP format for transparent textures instead of PNG, achieving up to 80% file size reduction while maintaining transparency support.
- **Particle Systems**: Gert-Jan Akerboom implemented a particle system for a rocket launcher effect, with Ashxn suggesting using `rateOverDistance` field for moving particles.

### Community Projects
- **New Applications**: Several community members shared their recent creations, including Vox's first .hyp app and multi-video streaming functionality, Metarick's world with emission effects, and Dr.Doge's world update with particle effects.
- **Tree Generation Tools**: Users discussed tools for tree generation and optimization, specifically highlighting eztree.dev for creating tree models and babylonpress.org for optimizing GLB files.

### Token Discussion
- **Token Allocation Transparency**: A heated discussion occurred regarding team token allocation (15% over 3 years with a 9%, 4%, 1%, 1% split) after Saori transferred 2 million HYPER tokens to peezy as a retroactive grant for his work on hypkg.
- **Token Performance**: Brief discussion about $HYPER token price increase, with maximus suggesting it could be due to general market movements (particularly Solana's rise) or recognition of recent V2 builds shared by community members.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: Any estimated date for the next launch in the production main branch?  
  **A**: "Going to make one tonight or tomorrow." (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is it possible to join all meshes to avoid drawcalls and just address specific materials?  
  **A**: "Merging/joining in blender is only useful for performance if they all use one material." (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Can we make render ignore shadows from specific meshes?  
  **A**: "Use Blender custom properties (boolean type) `castShadow=false` `receiveShadow=false` or via script with `mesh.castShadow = false` and `mesh.receiveShadow = false`." (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Would it be nice if the hierarchy was the 'live' one showing elements added via script?  
  **A**: "The hierarchy tab could have a 'live' toggle to switch between the two." (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do you reduce file size for tree models?  
  **A**: "The original has a 7 mb png. WebP is awesome because it supports transparency while jpeg can't. It reduces file size almost 80%." (Voxvienne)

- **Q**: Are transform handles planned for dropped GLBs?  
  **A**: "In build mode, hit 2 and 3 on your keyboard." (ash)

- **Q**: Any way to force delete a GLB that's stuck?  
  **A**: "Check the Apps window by hitting escape." (Shiffty)

### Token & Business
- **Q**: What is the team token allocation structure?  
  **A**: "15% over 3 years, with a 9%, 4%, 1%, 1% split among team members." (Saori)

- **Q**: Why is the $HYPER token pumping?  
  **A**: "Likely due to general market movements, particularly Solana's rise, or recognition of recent V2 builds shared by community members." (maximus)

- **Q**: What is hypkg?  
  **A**: "A quick standard way to add and distribute modifications/custom libraries/functionality to Hyperfy that allows builders to use different chains with documentation." (Saori)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **3D Optimization Guidance**:
   - Voxvienne shared tools for tree generation (eztree.dev) and GLB optimization (babylonpress.org), along with texture optimization techniques using WebP format.
   - Ashxn explained mesh optimization principles to Voxvienne, clarifying when joining meshes is beneficial for performance.

2. **Shadow Control Methods**:
   - Ashxn provided two methods for controlling shadows for specific meshes to Voxvienne: using Blender custom properties or script commands.

3. **GLB Model Management**:
   - Shiffty helped Roustan resolve an issue with deleting stuck GLB models by directing them to check the Apps window.
   - Ash provided keyboard shortcuts (2 and 3) for transform controls in build mode to Enryt.

4. **Particle System Implementation**:
   - Ashxn suggested using `rateOverDistance` field for moving particles to Gert-Jan Akerboom, making particle systems easier to configure correctly.

5. **Avatar Integration Support**:
   - Maximus directed Smol Preeminent to avatar documentation and the design elements channel for assistance with integrating Treasure's AI Smol as an avatar in Hyperfy.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Player Management System**: Ashxn shared updates about a new player management system with ranks (admin > builder > visitor) and features like teleporting to players, muting/unmuting, and kicking.
- **UI Performance**: Discussions about optimization revealed that UI is redrawn only when changes occur and batched for efficiency, making complex interfaces more performant.
- **Chess Implementation**: Gh0sTt demonstrated progress on a chess implementation with move highlighting, castling, and check features.
- **Audio Reactivity**: 0mka and hiroP shared implementation approaches for audio reactive particles using livekit -> audio analyser -> data to hyperfy.
- **App Installation**: Users discovered that apps in Hyperfy V2 can be installed by drag-and-dropping .hyp files directly into the browser.

### Platform Architecture
- **Centralization vs. Decentralization**: Participants debated approaches for metaverse platforms, with some preferring blockchain-based solutions while others advocated for database-driven approaches.
- **Cross-World Identity**: Discussions about enabling persistent identity and messaging across different worlds.
- **File Size Limitations**: SWISS documented challenges with file size limitations (30MB building model, 13.5MB avatar) despite environment variable adjustments.

### Community & Ecosystem
- **App Sharing**: Community members shared resources including app collections, with MetaRick directing users to specific channels and the "playworld" environment.
- **Token Activity**: A significant price drop occurred when a large holder ("whale") sold their entire position of Hyperfy tokens along with other cryptocurrencies in their portfolio.
- **V1 to V2 Migration**: SWISS documented their experience migrating from V1 to V2, highlighting various challenges and discoveries.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How is UI drawing optimized in Hyperfy?**  
A: UI is drawn optimally - it only redraws if nodes change, and changes are batched to redraw once per frame (Ashxn)

**Q: Can visitors equip custom avatars?**  
A: A world menu setting to allow visitors to equip custom avatars has been added to dev (Ashxn)

**Q: How do you implement audio reactive particles?**  
A: Using livekit -> audio analyser -> data to hyperfy -> dots programmed to read data (hiroP)

**Q: Does Hyperfy support WebSocket in apps?**  
A: No, only fetch is supported (Ashxn)

**Q: How can I access URL parameters in Hyperfy?**  
A: Using world.getQueryParam(key) method (Ashxn)

**Q: What's the current status of apps from V1 in V2?**  
A: Video player, screensharing and skybox/environment apps are already available (MetaRick)

**Q: Where can I find apps for Hyperfy V2?**  
A: In specific channels and a GitHub repository: https://github.com/akerb00m/.hyp-apps- (Gert-Jan Akerboom)

**Q: What does "networked" mean?**  
A: It means everyone in world sees the change, while "local" means only you would see the change happen (MetaRick)

**Q: What happened to cause the token price drop?**  
A: A whale sold all the tokens in his wallet, not only Hyperfy but all his tokens (Xukonth)

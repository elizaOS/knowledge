# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **Player Management System**: Ashxn shared updates about a new system replacing roles with a simplified rank hierarchy (admin > builder > visitor), allowing for muting, kicking, and teleporting to players based on rank.
- **Voice & Communication**: The team discussed implementing voice channels for team games and physical spaces, along with persistent party chat functionality that works across different worlds.
- **Cross-World Identity**: Discussions around developing a unified identity system that works seamlessly across different Hyperfy worlds.
- **AR Implementation**: Ashxn mentioned work on AR context implementation that would allow objects to behave differently when placed in augmented reality versus virtual worlds.

### Technical Implementations
- **Audio-Reactive Features**: hiroP explained the technical flow for audio-reactive particles (livekit → audio analyser → data to hyperfy → dots programmed to read data).
- **UI Performance**: Ashxn emphasized optimizing UI redrawing to only occur when changes happen, noting that drawing from scratch every frame hurts performance.
- **Networked Physics**: Gert-Jan Akerboom shared progress on a networked rocket with collision detection, though noted it might be moving too fast for practical use.

### Digital Asset Management
- Significant debate occurred about asset management approaches, with some advocating for blockchain/NFT integration while others preferred traditional database approaches for better performance and accessibility.

### Hyperfy V2 User Experience
- SWISS documented their V2 onboarding experience, highlighting challenges with file size limitations (30MB building model, 13.5MB avatar exceeding the 12MB limit).
- Users discussed the drag-and-drop functionality for apps in V2 and the concept of "networked" functionality (changes visible to all users versus local-only changes).
- App discovery and organization was described as "absolute chaos" by Ashxn, who mentioned they're adding basic features to the in-world "+" menu.

### Market Activity
- A significant price drop was discussed, apparently caused by a large holder ("whale") selling their entire Hyperfy token position.
- According to Xukonth, this seller liquidated all tokens in their wallet with an intention to potentially buy back when Hyperfy reaches a $200M market cap.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can visitors be allowed to drag in their own VRMs by default?**  
A: Ashxn will add an option to the world settings menu.

**Q: How was Anton making sound reactivity particles?**  
A: hiroP explained: "livekit → audio analyser → data to hyperfy → dots programmed to read data and do something"

**Q: Does someone have an example working with a WebSocket in-world?**  
A: Ashxn: "We don't have WebSocket support in apps, just fetch."

**Q: What's the current status of apps that made it easy to build out the world without writing code in V1? Are they available in V2?**  
A: MetaRick pointed to available apps in the marketplace channel and mentioned specific ones like video player, screensharing and skybox/environment apps.

**Q: What is "networked"?**  
A: MetaRick: "It means everyone in world sees the change, while local means only you would see the change happen."

**Q: Would it be possible to see the name of the .hyp file that code belongs to next to where it says SCRIPT?**  
A: Ash: "It's already implemented in the latest dev version."

**Q: What happened to cause the price drop?**  
A: Xukonth: "A whale sold all the tokens in his wallet, not only Hyperfy but all his tokens."

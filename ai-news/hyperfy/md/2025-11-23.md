# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-23

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Arcade Game Integration System
- 3rdEyeVisuals developed a system for integrating arcade games into Hyperfy using canvas texture streaming
- Implementation uses three.js CanvasTexture with 2D Canvas API rendering directly applied to 3D meshes
- Avoids iframes, UI nodes, or HTML/DOM elements while enabling raycasting and click detection in world-space
- Created "Super User" mode for lower-level API access while maintaining security
- System optimized to only render machines when users are in proximity, allowing for potentially thousands of arcade machines with minimal performance impact
- Space Invaders implemented as proof of concept, with plans to expand to more custom arcade games
- Plans to implement token-gating for premium features while providing some test games for all users

### Asset Development
- .hyp shaman provided an arcade cabinet model ready for Hyperfy with dynamic rigidbody properties and snap points
- Future plans include creating a v2 with animated joysticks and buttons using skinnedmesh

### Market Discussion
- Brief mention of Hyperfy price prediction ("at least 20m again" according to Xukonth)
- Shared link to a Streamflow Finance contract on Solana mainnet

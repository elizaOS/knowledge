# Hyperfy Discord - 2026-01-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Data Migration (v1 to v2)
- Jin is developing a converter tool to transform Hyperfy v1 world data into v2-compatible format
- The converter outputs a structured package containing:
  - V2 format files (db.sqlite, collections, assets)
  - Original v1 data (JSON and assets)
  - README documentation
  - Manifest file
  - The converter script itself
- Converted v2 files add approximately 270kb per world, which is minimal compared to overall archive size

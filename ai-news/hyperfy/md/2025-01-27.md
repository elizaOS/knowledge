# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-27

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Updates
- **Hyperfy V2 Development**: Significant focus on scripting capabilities, UI components, and documentation improvements. The platform is transitioning from V1 to V2, with ongoing work to port V1 functionality.
- **Script Editor Enhancements**: Monaco editor with autocomplete for app and world objects has been implemented, providing function suggestions and documentation snippets.
- **UI Components**: Discussions about event handling with event bubbling similar to web standards, with examples of using `stopPropagation()` to prevent event bubbling in nested UI components.
- **Sky & HDR Implementation**: Sky and HDR nodes have been combined into a single node with multiple properties for simplified configuration.
- **Programmatic Object Creation**: Developers shared undocumented methods to create primitive shapes programmatically, such as boxes and meshes.
- **Deployment Solutions**: Troubleshooting of Digital Ocean deployments, with focus on node version issues and environment configuration.

### Platform Vision & Roadmap
- **Hyperfy's Ultimate Goals**:
  1. Enable non-technical users to build and explore worlds
  2. Allow developers to create powerful apps/tools/platforms
  3. Empower 3D artists to bring content to life without code
  4. Create environments where AI agents can co-exist in worlds
- **Agent Development**: Hyperfy is working with companies to develop no-code solutions for launching Eliza agents with Hyperfy integration "out of the box."

### Community Projects & Innovations
- **Enhanced App Inspection**: A new feature allowing for precise positioning adjustments and "freezing" apps to prevent accidental movement.
- **Blender Integration**: Hyperfy Tools extension submitted to the Blender Extension Repository.
- **360° VR Experiences**: MetaRick demonstrated a technique for projecting 360° video onto a sphere with flipped normals for immersive VR experiences.
- **App Marketplace Plans**: HPrivakos shared plans for an open repository of scripts and an app marketplace on hyperworld.host, with a fee structure benefiting both the platform and the Hyperfy DAO.

### Token & Community
- **Token Utilization**: Saori discussed using a small portion of vesting tokens to fund hackathons and tournaments to drive development and engagement.
- **Community Focus**: Strong emphasis on building documentation and sharing knowledge to make development more accessible to non-coders.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I spawn a model programmatically?**  
A: There is a non-documented way to make boxes for testing: `const box = app.create('mesh'); box.type = 'box'; box.setSize(1,3,1); app.add(box);`

**Q: How do I get the player object?**  
A: There's no global player, especially on the server, but you can get the player object from events emitted on triggers and contacts like `world.on('enter|leave', e => e.player)`

**Q: How do I prevent nested UIViews from triggering parent onPointerDown events?**  
A: Use event.stopPropagation() in the child's onPointerDown handler to prevent event bubbling

**Q: How does fetch work in scripts?**  
A: fetch is a global you can use in scripts

**Q: Is it possible to connect Hyperfy to any blockchain?**  
A: Yes, Hyperfy is designed to be chain-agnostic. There's already a Solana branch in the official repo

**Q: How do I switch to first-person view?**  
A: Press the C key

**Q: What would be the easiest way to integrate the ability for visitors to buy merch in a Hyperfy world?**  
A: In v1 you can use a WebView to show your store website in-world or attach click listeners to digital versions that open a buy page in a new tab.

**Q: Is Hyperfy good for a 360 VR cinema experience?**  
A: It's possible but would require adjustments to player movement control and creating a custom screen content app.

**Q: Where are the tutorials to easily deploy on Digital Ocean?**  
A: Found at https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy/wiki/Deploy-a-world-(Digital-Ocean)

**Q: What are the plans for scripts and apps in Hyperfy?**  
A: Plans include an open repository of scripts and an app marketplace on hyperworld.host, taking small fees on paid apps and sharing between the platform and the Hyperfy DAO.

**Q: Where are we at with agents?**  
A: You can run your own Eliza server that connects to Hyperfy agents in world right now. Hyperfy is working with companies to make it possible to launch Hyperfy-enabled Eliza agents out of the box, no code.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **UI Event Handling**: Ashxn helped Lastraum with nested UIViews triggering parent events by providing code examples using e.stopPropagation().

- **Primitive Shape Creation**: Ashxn shared undocumented code with peezy to create box meshes programmatically.

- **App Positioning**: A community member created Enhanced App Inspection feature allowing for precise adjustments and freezing apps to address positioning difficulties.

- **Blender Integration**: ~/HowiEDuhzit created and submitted a Hyperfy Tools extension to the Blender Extension Repository.

- **Digital Ocean Deployment**: Multiple members (devilsadvocate.sol, HPrivakos, maximus) helped emotionull troubleshoot deployment errors, identifying node version issues and providing step-by-step commands for installing NVM and Node.js.

- **360° VR Experiences**: MetaRick demonstrated a working example of streaming 360° VR content in Hyperfy using a sphere with flipped normals, with voxvienne suggesting using the light app with video as source for dynamic illumination.

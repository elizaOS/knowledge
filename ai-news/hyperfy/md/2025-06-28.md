# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-28

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Value & Ecosystem
- **Hyperfy's Independence from ElizaOS**: Several community members pushed back against the notion that Hyperfy's success depends entirely on ElizaOS, highlighting the platform's broader capabilities and independent value proposition.
- **HYPER Token Utility**: Significant debate about whether HYPER will serve as the universal currency within the ecosystem or if creators will prefer launching their own tokens. Examples of current HYPER usage were shared, including tips, projectiles, and in-world transactions.
- **Platform Philosophy**: hiroP compared Hyperfy to Apple's "Think Different" campaign, emphasizing the platform's innovative approach to the metaverse.

### Technical Development
- **Agent Development**: Multiple users reported working on custom AI agents that don't rely on ELIZA, demonstrating alternative approaches to intelligent entities within Hyperfy.
- **Advanced Rendering Techniques**: Detailed discussion about implementing lightmaps in glTF models, comparing baked emissive lightmaps with additive lightmap overlay systems that preserve PBR material properties.
- **Optimization Challenges**: Exploration of combining additive lightmaps with UDIM textures to achieve high-resolution detail while minimizing draw calls - critical for WebXR performance.
- **Technical Limitations**: The conversation highlighted that glTF doesn't natively support UDIM textures, creating a barrier for implementing this optimization technique.

### Community Projects
- **Ongoing Developments**: 0mka highlighted various community projects including social worlds, games, AI agents, token integrations, and bridges to other metaverse platforms.
- **Existing Implementations**: Examples of HYPER token usage were shared, including HyperWorld.host tips, Omka's taco cart demo, Shifty's projectile tokens, and integration in Fallen.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why will Hyperfy not be successful unless elizaOS is successful?**  
A: "It's a very limited view of what Hyperfy can do. Eliza in world is great but far from the only thing that makes Hyperfy great." - 0mka

**Q: Couldn't HYPER be the universal currency so people can on and off ramp to specific project-lead currencies, while remaining compatible with the platform?**  
A: "Hyper is baked into the protocols of the platform and marketplace. This is no different than otherside + apecoin, decentraland + mana etc." - Ashxn

**Q: Where are examples of HYPER tokens being used?**  
A: "Like the HyperWorld.host tips, pretty sure omkas taco cart demo used hyper, I think shifty also made hyper tokens as projectiles... fallen of course has it baked in." - maximus

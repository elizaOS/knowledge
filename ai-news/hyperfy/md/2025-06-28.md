# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-28

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development & Vision
- **Hyperfy's Capabilities**: 0mka emphasized that Hyperfy is an expanding open-source meta game engine with capabilities far beyond ELIZA integration. Communities are building experiences, games, AI agents, token integrations, and bridges to other metaverse platforms.
- **Vision Comparison**: hiroP compared Hyperfy's approach to Apple's "Think Different" campaign, sharing the iconic advertisement featuring "the dreamers, the doers."
- **Custom Agent Development**: Multiple users mentioned creating their own agent implementations that don't rely on ELIZA, with ~/drdoge.eth noting they've created five different "Home Brewed agents."

### Technical Discussions
- **Advanced Lighting Techniques**: Detailed discussion about lighting methods for 3D web environments, comparing Baked Emissive Lightmaps versus Needle's Additive Lightmap Overlay approach.
- **UDIM + Lightmap Integration**: Vox proposed combining UDIM textures with additive lightmaps to achieve high-resolution texture detail while maintaining performance through reduced draw calls.
- **Existing Implementations**: Ashxn mentioned having already developed a proof of concept for native lightmaps in the Hyperfy Blender addon using the second UV channel.
- **WebSocket Connection Issues**: Some users reported problems joining worlds due to WebSocket (ws/wss) connection errors.

### HYPER Token Utility
- **Platform Currency Debate**: Discussion about whether HYPER should be the universal platform currency or if creators will prefer to launch their own tokens.
- **Current Implementations**: Several examples of HYPER token usage were shared, including HyperWorld.host tips, Omka's taco cart, Shifty's projectiles, and Fallen.
- **Integration Proposal**: Z aka MetaDJ suggested HYPER could serve as the universal currency for cross-world transactions while still allowing project-specific currencies.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Why will Hyperfy not be successful unless elizaOS is successful? (asked by cloudAI)  
   **A**: This is a limited view. Hyperfy has many capabilities beyond ELIZA integration and is already successful as an expanding open source meta game engine. (answered by 0mka)

2. **Q**: Couldn't HYPER be the universal currency so people can on and off ramp to specific project-lead currencies, while remaining compatible with the platform? (asked by Z aka MetaDJ)  
   **A**: Hyper is baked into the protocols of the platform and marketplace. This is no different than otherside + apecoin, decentraland + mana etc. (answered by Ashxn)

3. **Q**: What might cause users to see WebSocket (ws/wss) connection errors? (asked by Coinexpert)  
   **A**: Check if users have overprotective VPNs and review your server config file, particularly where WebSocket settings and upload size limits are defined. (answered by maximus)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Platform Misconceptions Clarification**
   - **Helper**: 0mka
   - **Context**: Misconception about Hyperfy's dependence on ELIZA
   - **Resolution**: Clarified that Hyperfy has broader capabilities as a meta game engine beyond ELIZA integration

2. **HYPER Token Usage Examples**
   - **Helper**: maximus
   - **Context**: Concern about creators not using HYPER tokens

   - **Resolution**: Shared that a proof of concept for native lightmaps using second UV channel already exists in the Hyperfy Blender addon

4. **WebSocket Troubleshooting**
   - **Helper**: maximus
   - **Context**: Users unable to join "the world" with WebSocket connection errors
   - **Resolution**: Suggested checking for VPN interference and reviewing server config file settings

5. **Screen Capture Tool Recommendation**
   - **Helper**: "᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/"
   - **Context**: Sharing development work
   - **Resolution**: Recommended ShareX (getsharex.com) as a screen capture and file sharing utility

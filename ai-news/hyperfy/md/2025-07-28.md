# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-28

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Network & Performance Optimization
- **Ashxn** implemented changes to reduce network jitter and improve smoothness in Hyperfy worlds
- **Cru** confirmed the improvements and mentioned increasing network rate to 1/24 for better responsiveness
- Discussion compared Hyperfy's tick rates with CS2's 64 tick rate, noting performance tradeoffs

### Platform Updates
- **Ashxn** announced a significant new version release featuring:
  - Improved movement mechanics
  - First-person perspective
  - Voice zones for better communication
  - Enhanced moderation tools for events
- These updates were developed in response to community requests to make virtual worlds more approachable
- Cross-platform functionality was highlighted, with mobile and VR compatibility for "Drifters"

### Developer Limitations & Workarounds
- **Gh0sTt** discovered limitations with WebSocket connections when trying to implement AI integration
- Current architecture doesn't support secondary WebSocket connections without forking the engine
- **.hyp shaman** suggested running Hyperfy headless as a potential workaround
- This sparked broader discussion about limitations for developers building interactive applications

### Game Development
- **Gh0sTt** implemented a chess game with 3D elements, finding it surprisingly easy to add
- Discussion about customizing chess pieces with VRM models and wallet-connected NFT avatars
- **Xukonth** expressed interest in spending tokens on platform games
- Clarification that independent developers create games that larger companies may later adopt

### Issues Reported
- **0mka** reported visual artifacts appearing as "seams" in world models
- Removal of "double jump" feature has made certain areas in built worlds inaccessible

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a way to set up a secondary websocket connection from an app?**  
A: Not without a forked engine. It's easy to add but not currently supported. Forking would make apps non-interoperable. (Ashxn)

**Q: Can't play in the play world anymore?**  
A: Free build mode was turned off but has been re-enabled. (Ashxn)

**Q: One day will we play games like Hyperfy's FPS, Open World, Battle Royale?**  
A: "You'll do more than spend on games." (Ashxn)

**Q: Who made Bathroom Blitz?**  
A: It was made by an independent team but Yuga decided to take it on. (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Network Performance Troubleshooting**
   - **Ashxn** helped **Cru** with network jitter issues by implementing changes and deploying them to dev and play environments
   - **Cru** confirmed the improvements worked, creating a positive feedback loop

2. **Play World Access**
   - **Ashxn** assisted **Gert-Jan Akerboom** who was unable to access the play world by re-enabling free build mode

3. **WebSocket Limitations Workarounds**
   - **.hyp shaman** suggested alternative approaches to **Gh0sTt** for working around WebSocket limitations
   - Proposed running Hyperfy headless to connect to world WebSocket URLs

4. **Chess Game Enhancements**
   - **Maximus** helped **Gh0sTt** with implementing wallet-connected VRM models based on the m3-org/avatars GitHub project
   - Suggested using NFT-based avatars as chess pieces through wallet connections

5. **New User Onboarding**
   - **𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓** encouraged **BallisticBanana** who had joined the platform and was ready to start building
   - Highlighted cross-platform functionality to enhance the new user's experience

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-28

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Updates
- **Upcoming Release**: Ashxn announced a new version coming soon with improved movement, first-person perspective, voice zones, and mod tools
- **Network Optimization**: Changes were implemented to reduce jitter and improve movement smoothness in Hyperfy worlds
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Confirmation that Drifters is available on mobile and VR platforms

### Technical Discussions
- **Network Performance**: Detailed discussion about network rate settings, with testing at 1/24 rate for better responsiveness, though this triples data transfer
- **WebSocket Limitations**: Significant debate about the inability to establish secondary WebSocket connections from apps, which limits AI interactions and games
- **Workarounds**: The shaman suggested using headless Hyperfy instances (similar to Eliza Hyperfy) as a potential solution for external connections

### Community Activity
- Some users reported purchasing more tokens despite price decline ("going down with the ship")
- Discussion about future gaming possibilities within the platform, including FPS, Open World, and Battle Royale games
- User BallisticBanana confirmed following instructions and being ready to build something new

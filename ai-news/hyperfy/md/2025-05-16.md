# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Text-to-Speech Implementation Challenges**: Users discussed limitations in the app environment for TTS functionality, with hiroP proposing a LiveKit API implementation to pipe TTS from a server through LiveKit and back to users.
- **Animation System Mechanics**: Ashxn explained that Hyperfy's animation system doesn't perform traditional retargeting but uses bone rotations when applying animations, providing a form of "cheap retargeting" that works for human-shaped avatars.
- **Eliza Plugin Updates**: Jin shared that multiple pull requests have been merged for the Eliza 3D Hyperfy starter.

### Platform Organization & Features
- **App Organization Debate**: Users discussed the merits of folder structures versus tagging systems for organizing apps and creating "scenes." Tags were suggested as offering more programmatic flexibility for enabling/disabling groups of apps.
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Discussions around implementing role-based security permissions for tagged objects to control access to content.
- **SOL Permissioning**: Interest in using SOL Permissioning apps for gating content in worlds.

### Infrastructure & Hosting
- **Server Costs & Resource Allocation**: HypPrivakos explained that Hyper servers cost around $10/month maximum if running 24/7, but users only pay for compute when actually using it, with storage costs being constant.
- **Resource Sharing Concerns**: Discussion about shared CPU resources potentially affecting performance if other users on the same machine are utilizing maximum resources.

### Community Resources
- **Marketplace Development**: Szjanko is developing a marketplace for Hyper applications with upcoming features for previewing hyp code and 3D assets.
- **Community Events**: Brief mention of a PizzaDAO pizza party event commemorating the famous Bitcoin pizza purchase.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Are there currently any text to speech capabilities yet?**  
A: The app SES environment has no access to browser APIs, which is where TTS is, so you'd need to fork and add it. (Ashxn)

**Q: Is it possible to have a folder app structure to build scenes that admins could toggle on/off?**  
A: Folders might be annoying to organize; tags might be better as they allow filtering and bulk enabling/disabling. (Ashxn)

**Q: How much does a Hyper server cost?**  
A: 10 USD a month maximum with that configuration, but only if the server is on 24/7 all month long. You pay for compute only when using it, and storage always. (HypPrivakos)

**Q: How can I get my custom VRM to work with custom animations?**  
A: Import the Mixamo FBX, add a root bone as the absolute parent at 0,0,0, then export to GLTF with animation sampling to reduce file size. (Ashxn)

**Q: Does Hyperfy perform animation retargeting?**  
A: The engine doesn't do retargeting but uses bone rotations when applying animations, providing a form of "cheap retargeting" that works for human-shaped avatars. (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **TTS Implementation Support**: Ashxn and hiroP helped ~/drdoge.eth understand why they were encountering btoa errors when implementing TTS, explaining the limitations of the app environment and suggesting alternative approaches.

- **Animation Workflow Guidance**: Ashxn provided detailed technical guidance to TheMattEmpire on getting custom VRM models working with animations, explaining the engine's approach and suggesting specific workflow steps.

- **Server Billing Clarification**: HypPrivakos helped ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì understand the server billing model, explaining the pay-as-you-go approach that results in costs well below the maximum.

- **Resource Discovery**: Szjanko shared marketplace links with vox who was having difficulty finding .hyp resources, and mentioned upcoming features for previewing hyp code and 3D assets.

## Action Items

### Technical
- Implement TTS using LiveKit API to pipe audio from server to browser (hiroP)
- Add a root bone at position 0,0,0 as absolute parent when preparing animations for Hyperfy (Ashxn)
- Export to GLTF with animation sampling to reduce file size for animations (Ashxn)
- Research methods to reduce latency between user and server (maximus)
- Preview feature for hyp code and 3D assets on marketplace pages (szjanko)

### Documentation
- Create tutorials on custom VRM animation workflow if approach is successful (TheMattEmpire)
- Better organization of .hyp resources that are currently difficult to find on Discord (vox)

### Feature
- Create a tagging system for apps to enable/disable groups programmatically (Ashxn)
- Implement folder structure for organizing apps into scenes (MetaRick)
- Add role-based security permissions for tagged objects (maximus)
- Improved search/sorting for apps marketplace (szjanko)

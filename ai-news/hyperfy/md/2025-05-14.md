# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### 3D Model Optimization
- **~/drdoge.eth** reported optimizing textures for a monorail model, reducing from 80MB to 18MB, bringing the entire world under 2GB for browser loading
- **Vox** suggested further optimization could reduce the monorail to 6MB with 18 draw calls
- Discussion emphasized material slot reduction and texture atlasing for performance
- **Valiant** recommended InstaLOD as an automated optimization tool with free options
- **Ashxn** expressed desire for a one-button "game-ready" converter for 3D models

### Technical Implementation
- **Ashxn** provided code examples for making GLB models clickable using both direct pointer events and action components
- **Vox** shared a UV scrolling technique for Hyperfy environments by manipulating mesh geometry with a custom script
- **HypPrivakos** and **maximus** discussed implementing auto-reconnect with exponential backoff for handling connection drops
- Discussion about programmatic scene creation as an alternative to the visual editor

### Platform Performance
- Conversation about Hyperfy world performance limitations based on avatar complexity
- With optimized avatars, >100 users is possible, but unoptimized VRMs might limit to 10 users
- Community members shared optimization tools including material combiners and collision generators

### Integration & Authentication
- Questions about token-gated access control for Hyperfy worlds using Solana authentication
- Brief mention of AI-generated 3D avatars integration possibilities
- **0mka** shared a link to the Recall Network documentation

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there code I can add to an existing GLB model that will make it a clickable hyperlink to a new tab?** (asked by ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì)  
**A:** Yes, you can use `app.onPointerDown = () => world.open("https://foo.com", true)` or create an action component with custom positioning (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Been thinking it would be super helpful if Hyperfy's docs included some notes on how many users a space can handle depending on CPU, memory, graphic load, and server usage. Anyone ever tested limits or seen how those factors scale with more players?** (asked by DevStarlight | Numinia)  
**A:** It depends on optimization. With optimized avatars, >100 users is possible, but with unoptimized VRMs, you might only get 10 users (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Is someone reskinning snake.io to sell shit coins?** (asked by jar0d)  
**A:** To me it looked different enough that I thought he built it from scratch (answered by nettuser)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Optimization Guidance**
   - **Vox** helped **~/drdoge.eth** with monorail model optimization, suggesting techniques to reduce from 18MB to 6MB
   - **Vox** shared VRChat wiki guide on texture atlasing as a resource for the community
   - **Ashxn** shared GitHub link to v-hacd collision decomposition library when **vox** mentioned needing a collision generator tool

2. **Code Implementation Support**
   - **Ashxn** provided **ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì** with two code solutions for making GLB models clickable - direct pointer events and action components
   - **Ashxn** helped **vox** troubleshoot an MP3 file issue, identifying the file as the source of the problem

3. **Platform Guidance**
   - **maximus** advised **carlosmu** against coding for Hyperfy v1, recommending v2 instead and sharing documentation links

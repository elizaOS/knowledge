# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-20

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Video Atlas Implementation**: Vox demonstrated creating a 16x tiled video atlas with CapCut, allowing multiple billboards to run from a single video source. Ash developed a solution enabling control of individual video tiles within the atlas through texture offset controls.
- **Animation Improvements**: Ash announced that particles can now utilize spritesheet/flipbook animations, and mentioned improved fitting options with "cover" and "contain" modes for videos.
- **Weather System**: ~/drdoge.eth mentioned developing a full weather system integrated with the auto day/night feature that can change randomly or be manually set.
- **Voice Chat**: HypPrivakos explained that users need to click "Update Building Key" in settings to redeploy their world with voice chat enabled on hyperworld.host.

### Graphics & Rendering
- **HDR Lighting**: Vox explained how to create equirectangular shots in Blender and export to HDR format for more coherent lighting for avatars and models.
- **Performance Issues**: Discussion about performance degradation on iOS devices (iPhone 16 Pro) where initially good performance (50 FPS) drops significantly (21 FPS) after some usage time, particularly in worlds with higher asset counts.

### Collaboration & Tools
- **Positioning Tool**: MetaRick shared a utility app for displaying location coordinates to help with teleporting objects.
- **Potential Partnerships**: Brief mentions of possible collaborations between Hyperfy, Dark, and "grph" (likely The Graph).

### Token Discussion
- JUAN mentioned making daily purchases of Hyperfy tokens and used a command to check Hyperfy's price.
- Chris Atherton asked about potential future minting of Hyperfy tokens.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do you clear chat?** (asked by MetaRick)  
**A:** Use `/chat clear` command (answered by ash)

**Q: How did you get voicechat on your hyperworld.host working?** (asked by vox)  
**A:** Click "Update Building Key" on the settings page to redeploy your world and enable voice chat (answered by HypPrivakos)

**Q: What could be causing sudden FPS drops after initially good performance across multiple worlds?** (asked by MetaRick)  
**A:** Possible memory leak, lack of LODs, inefficient particles, or too many static objects being redrawn (answered by vox and .hyp shaman)

**Q: Can you tell me how to toggle mesh visibility?** (asked by vox)  
**A:** Uncomment "mesh.active = false" and hit ctrl+s (answered by ash)

**Q: When we duplicate objects in world can we address/control those individually while keeping them instanced?** (asked by vox)  
**A:** Yes, this is possible with the new implementation (answered by ash)

**Q: What's the difference between desktop and mobile performance?** (asked by MetaRick)  
**A:** On desktop the GPU does most heavy lifting whereas on mobile the CPU handles everything (answered by .hyp shaman)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Performance Troubleshooting**:
   - .hyp shaman helped MetaRick diagnose iOS performance issues by suggesting checks for LOD implementation, particle system efficiency, and reducing resolution/post-processing effects.
   - Ash offered to help debug the performance issue and mentioned receiving a snapshot from "hp" to investigate whether it's an application-specific problem or an engine issue.

2. **Voice Chat Implementation**:
   - HypPrivakos guided vox on enabling voice chat functionality on hosted worlds by explaining the "Update Building Key" process.

3. **Video Atlas Development**:
   - Ash helped vox with mesh visibility toggling and then developed a comprehensive solution for controlling individual video tiles in an atlas, sharing a working implementation with on-screen controls.

4. **HDR Lighting Guidance**:
   - Vox explained to chat participants how to create HDR lighting using Blender to make equirectangular shots for export to HDR format, resulting in more coherent lighting for avatars and models.

5. **Positioning Tool Sharing**:
   - MetaRick shared a utility app with the community that displays location coordinates and rotation information to help with teleporting objects.

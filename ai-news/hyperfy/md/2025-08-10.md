## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Camera Functionality
- **Free Camera Implementation**: Discussion about the technical aspects of free camera functionality in v1, which consists of two main parts: the update() function and the setFreeCamTarget method.
- **V1 vs V2 Camera Systems**: Detailed comparison between camera systems across versions. V1 used a simple lerp/slerp interpolation at 0.05 with bracket controls for speed adjustment, while V2 offers more configuration options but some users find it difficult to replicate the smooth feel of V1.
- **Cinematic Features**: Strong interest in adding depth of field (DOF) functionality to enhance visual quality for content creation. Users discussed potential implementation approaches and configuration options.

### Development Environment
- **Build Issues**: A user (Valiant) reported build failures when trying to run the dev branch after local installation, which was partially resolved through troubleshooting.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Camera Implementation
- **Q**: How is free cam implemented in v1? (asked by Ashxn)
  **A**: It has two parts: one section in the update() function and one setFreeCamTarget method (answered by Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is it possible to get depth of field going? (asked by MetaRick)
  **A**: Easy to add, but not sure how it should be configured or used (answered by Ashxn)

- **Q**: Can you describe what is different with the drone camera in V1? (asked by Shiffty)
  **A**: V2 drone can do anything, V1 free cam was just `[` to slow movement, `]` to speed up with lerp/slerp interpolation @ 0.05 (answered by Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Build Issue Troubleshooting**
   - **Helper**: Ashxn
   - **Helpee**: Valiant
   - **Context**: Build failures on dev branch after local installation
   - **Resolution**: Partially resolved by running `npm install` and restarting with `npm run dev`, though one error remained

2. **Camera System Understanding**
   - **Helper**: Ashxn
   - **Helpee**: Shiffty
   - **Context**: Understanding differences between V1 and V2 camera systems
   - **Resolution**: Ashxn explained V1 used simple lerp/slerp @ 0.05 and offered to share the V1 camera code

3. **Camera Movement Replication**
   - **Helper**: Shiffty
   - **Helpee**: vox
   - **Context**: Difficulty replicating V1 camera movement feel in V2
   - **Resolution**: Shiffty offered to try implementing the exact V1 parameters to see if that helps

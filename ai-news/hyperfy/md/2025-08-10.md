# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Camera Implementation & Improvements
- **Free Camera Development**: Shiffty proposed a version with fixed linear interpolation instead of quadratic easing, which ash confirmed felt identical to v1
- **V1 vs V2 Camera Comparison**: Significant discussion about replicating the feel of V1's drone camera in V2
- **Technical Details**: V1 free cam used lerp/slerp interpolation at 0.05, which ash promised to share the code for
- **User Experience**: Vox reported difficulty replicating the "super fine maneuvering" of V1 despite adjusting easing settings

### Technical Challenges & Solutions
- **Skeletal Mesh Selection**: Ash highlighted a limitation where meshes with skeletons cannot be selected through raycasting (CPU vs GPU processing issue)
- **Local Installation Issues**: Valiant encountered build failures that were resolved by running npm install, restarting, and adding ASSETS=local to .env
- **World Connection Problems**: Vox diagnosed intermittent connection issues in their world, traced to an Audio App set to preload

### Visual Features & Performance
- **Depth of Field**: Discussion about adding DOF functionality, which ash indicated would be easy to implement but needed configuration guidance
- **UV Scrolling & PBR**: Vox's experimental world showcasing these capabilities received praise for performance and visual quality
- **Mobile Optimization**: References to Hyperfy's native support for smartphone devices

### Documentation & Resources
- **Domain Change**: Transition from hyperfy.how to docs.hyperfy.xyz was noted
- **GitHub Activity**: References to ongoing development and repository management

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it possible to get depth of field going?**  
A: Ash confirmed it's easy to add but wasn't sure how it should be configured or used

**Q: Can you describe what is different with the drone camera in V1?**  
A: Ash explained V1 free cam was just `[` to slow movement, `]` to speed up with lerp/slerp interpolation to target @ 0.05

**Q: Are primitives broke in dev?**  
A: Ash confirmed they weren't, stating "nah i'm on latest dev right now"

**Q: Is hyperfy.how coming back?**  
A: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 explained the domain had to be changed and it's not coming back

**Q: Can you make a Hyperfy tutorial video for smartphone and windows?**  
A: HypPrivakos explained it natively works on smartphone with no special configuration needed, and provided server hosting options (docker, nodejs locally, fly.io, or hyperworld.host)

### Documentation
- Check .env.example for proper environment configuration (Mentioned by Ash)
- Update references from hyperfy.how to docs.hyperfy.xyz (Mentioned by Mtv969.eth)

### Feature
- Implement DOF (Depth of Field) slider (Mentioned by Vox)
- Add depth of field to core functionality, off by default but configurable via hyp files (Mentioned by MetaRick)

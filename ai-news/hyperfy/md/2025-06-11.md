# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Terrain Generation**: Ashxn explained the technical challenges of implementing heightmaps (potentially 4 million quads for a 2km x 2km area) versus 3D voxel terrains, noting the need for LOD systems and networking considerations. The community expressed strong desire for terrain alternatives to the current flat grass plane.
- **Lightmap Implementation**: Detailed discussion about supporting lightmaps from external tools like Needle. Ashxn investigated the technical implementation, examining code to apply lightmap textures with proper offsets.
- **UV Scrolling Scripts**: hiroP shared two script versions for texture scrolling in Hyperfy - a basic version and an advanced version with X/Y scrolling, loop/bounce playback modes, and easing functions.
- **Audio Manipulation**: Ashxn mentioned audio manipulation capabilities via the `audio.setPlaybackRate()` function for effects like car sounds.
- **Ambient Occlusion**: Ashxn pushed ambient occlusion (AO) to the dev branch.
- **Scene Apps**: Upcoming functionality for scene apps and plans for drop-in environments were mentioned.

### Platform Strategy & Tokenomics
- **Development Philosophy**: Ashxn emphasized building for long-term sustainability rather than short-term hype.
- **HYPER Token Utility**: Clarification that HYPER is the exclusive currency for the marketplace (for emotes, avatars, wearables, apps), used for governance through staking and voting.
- **Staking Rewards**: Will come from platform fee distribution.
- **Ecosystem Position**: MUDBONE described Hyperfy as a base layer with "solana network -> Hyperfy -> Eliza integrations -> your world/project community" stack.

### Community Projects
- **Link-sharing App**: Being developed by 0mka.
- **Portal Functionality**: Discussion about portal features with promises of video demonstrations.
- **VR Festivals**: MetaRick mentioned Raindance Immersive VR festival as an inspiring event spanning multiple platforms.
- **Instance Management**: Strategies for single-player experiences were discussed, with Reneil asking about creating a "curation world" for MOCA where users could work independently.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical
- **Q**: "Does someone have experience designing a world which always spins up single player instances?" (Reneil)  
  **A**: "It's possible to create a custom client without networking systems or use a smaller pool of servers that launch when someone joins a specific world." (Ashxn)

- **Q**: "Can we get terrain generation officially?" (peezy)  
  **A**: "The reason it's not in the core yet is because we need to decide on which type to use and come up with a simple UX." (Ashxn)

- **Q**: "Is it possible to create a hyp file that could connect lightmap data like needle does?" (MetaRick)  
  **A**: Ashxn investigated but couldn't fully implement it, noting the code they use is not open source.

- **Q**: "or can you quickly show me where to find it?" (vox, regarding audio pitch)  
  **A**: "audio.setPlaybackRate(rate) where 1 is the default speed" (Ashxn)

### Tokenomics
- **Q**: "What would create demand for the HYPER token?" (PurpleSack)  
  **A**: "The platform is HYPER-centric, used for governance and marketplace transactions." (Ashxn)

- **Q**: "Will people be restricted to only use HYPER or can they use other cryptos in the marketplace?" (PurpleSack)  
  **A**: "HYPER is the only currency on the platform." (Ashxn)

- **Q**: "Where will the staking rewards come from?" (PurpleSack)  
  **A**: "Staking rewards come from the platform fee distribution." (Ashxn)

### Platform Issues
- **Q**: "Why is Saori crashing out on bird app?" (Spook_Handy)  
  **A**: "It was due to Elon blocking a backdoor API that Eliza was using to have bots on X, but it doesn't affect Hyperfy." (MUDBONE)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Instance Management Solutions**
   - **Helper**: Ashxn & HypPrivakos
   - **Helpee**: Reneil
   - **Context**: Creating single-player instances for a curation world
   - **Resolution**: Explained two approaches - creating a custom client without networking or using a pool of servers that launch on demand. HypPrivakos offered to help set up instances, noting they can spin up near instantaneously.

2. **Lightmap Implementation**
   - **Helper**: Ashxn & marcel ðŸŒµ
   - **Context**: Implementing lightmaps from Needle tools in Hyperfy
   - **Resolution**: Ashxn investigated the code but couldn't fully implement the solution. Marcel offered to provide more information about how lightmap offset+scale is stored in NEEDLE_components.

3. **UV Scrolling Scripts**
   - **Helper**: hiroP
   - **Helpee**: Channel users
   - **Context**: Needed texture animation capabilities
   - **Resolution**: Shared two versions of UV scrolling scripts with different capabilities for texture animation.

4. **Portal Functionality Help**
   - **Helper**: 0mka & á²¼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/
   - **Helpee**: Cayden0207
   - **Context**: Portal functionality confusion
   - **Resolution**: 0mka offered help via voice chat, while b0gie promised to make a video demonstration.

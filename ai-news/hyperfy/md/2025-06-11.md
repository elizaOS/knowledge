# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Terrain Generation & World Building
- Ashxn detailed technical challenges for terrain implementation, including performance considerations for large terrains (2km x 2km would require 4M quads/8M triangles)
- The team is evaluating heightmaps versus 3D voxel terrains approaches
- Smaller terrain sizes with portal systems are being considered as a solution
- Ash is actively working on terrain and floating islands features as part of core engine improvements

### Graphics & Rendering
- Significant discussion around lightmap support in GLB files
- MetaRick demonstrated how Needle Tools properly renders lightmaps that don't appear in Hyperfy
- Ashxn attempted to implement code to read and apply Needle's lightmap data
- Marcel offered to provide more information about how lightmap offset+scale data is stored in NEEDLE_components
- HiroP shared two UV scrolling scripts for texture animation in Hyperfy:
  - Basic version that ramps up scrolling speed and holds it
  - Advanced version with X/Y scrolling, multiple easing functions, and loop/bounce playback modes
- Vox showcased a mega texture with UV scroll technique for animated-looking but performant models

### Platform Economics & Strategy
- Ashxn emphasized building for long-term sustainability rather than short-term hype
- HYPER token was confirmed as the exclusive currency for the marketplace (emotes, avatars, wearables, apps)
- Governance will be implemented through staking and voting
- Staking rewards will come from platform fee distribution
- Discussion about incentivizing creators to build complete experiences beyond tech demos

### Tools & Utilities
- New Hyp repository created by b0gie and Omka
- HP's team released World Exporter and Importer features for HyperWorld.Host
- Shifty updated the hyper camera
- A Teleport app is now available
- Audio manipulation capabilities via the audio.setPlaybackRate() function were highlighted

### Integration & Interoperability
- Discussions about governance models for user-generated content interoperability
- Lastraum reported progress on Forge/Hyperfy integration
- Questions raised about Eliza integration with Hyperfy
- Discussion about LLM awareness of Hyperfy and its potential impact on adoption

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does someone have experience designing a world which always spins up single player instances?**  
A: It's possible to create a custom client without networking systems or use a smaller pool of servers that launch when someone joins a specific world (Ashxn)

**Q: Can we get terrain generation officially?**  
A: The team is working on it but needs to decide on implementation type (heightmap vs voxel) and UX considerations (Ashxn)

**Q: What would create demand for the HYPER token?**  
A: The platform is HYPER-centric, used for governance and marketplace transactions (Ashxn)

**Q: Will people be restricted to only use HYPER or can they use other cryptos in the marketplace?**  
A: HYPER is the only currency on the platform (Ashxn)

**Q: Where will the staking rewards come from?**  
A: Staking rewards come from the platform fee distribution (Ashxn)

**Q: Why is Saori crashing out on bird app?**  
A: Due to Elon blocking a backdoor API that Eliza was using to have bots on X, but it doesn't affect Hyperfy (MUDBONE)

**Q: How does the portal work?**  
A: Voice chat help was offered and a video demonstration was promised (0mka and b0gie)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Lightmap Implementation**: Ashxn attempted code implementation for Needle Tools lightmaps in Hyperfy, with Marcel offering additional information about how lightmap data is stored
- **Single Player Instances**: Ashxn and HypPrivakos helped Reneil with designing a world that spins up single player instances for MOCA's art curation
- **Portal Functionality**: 0mka and b0gie offered to help Cayden0207 understand portal functionality through voice chat and promised a video demonstration
- **UV Scrolling**: HiroP shared two versions of UV scrolling scripts with different capabilities for the community
- **Audio Manipulation**: Ashxn provided guidance on the audio.setPlaybackRate() function for sound modulation
- **PBR Texturing**: Vox shared a sample Hyp app demonstrating PBR atlas texture implementation
- **Development Environment**: HiroP suggested Replit as an easy-to-use option for various projects

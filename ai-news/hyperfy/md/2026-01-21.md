# Hyperfy Discord - 2026-01-21

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Vehicle & Physics Implementation
- Discussion about vehicle implementation in Hyperfy, with preference for a system that supports any GLB model
- Valiant mentioned a recent update with "support for applying physics force to push players"
- Reference to a stadium, ball, and PvP Arena created by user Vox
- WebGPU water rendering demo was shared as a reference

### AI & Agent Implementation
- Interest in implementing AI agents in Hyperfy worlds, particularly for creating sentient objects
- Fibelius discovered the "eliza hyperfy starter" project and wants to apply it to a Yayoi Kusama-inspired world with interactive balloons
- Discussion about shifting from scripted dialogue to dynamic agent-based interactions
- Concept of "animism" in virtual worlds where objects are imbued with agency and personality

### Development Tools & Documentation
- Conversation about using LLMs to generate documentation from codebases
- FrankyLimon shared that Codex xhigh is effective for documentation generation even with large repositories
- Discussion about LLMs being outdated (typically 2 years behind) in their training data
- Suggestion that posting about Hyperfy on X (Twitter) might help models like Grok learn about it

### UI/UX Improvements
- Request for grouping functionality to move multiple Apps collectively
- Reference to NEOS/Resonite's implementation of parent-child relationships and "Glue Gun" tool for similar functionality
- Highlighted pain point when repositioning completed modular structures

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What kind of vehicle system is preferred?**  
A: "Preferably something I can slap any GLB on like v1." (Agent12)

**Q: How to deploy in Hyperfy?**  
A: "Did you check out #1336620320748212224? Quite a bit info there." (BallisticBanana)

**Q: Can LLMs be used to create documentation for a codebase?**  
A: "Yes, you can feed your codebase to an LLM and have it create documentation, even for large codebases by building docs in subsections. Codex xhigh is particularly good for large context repositories." (FrankyLimon)

**Q: Could sentient spheres be used with balloons in a Kusama-inspired world?**  
A: "Yes absolutely, balloons that you could infuse with personalities and converse with would be amazing." (untitled, xyz)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Deployment Documentation**
   - BallisticBanana directed Cybermike to the documentation channel for information on deploying in Hyperfy

2. **AI Agent Implementation**
   - untitled, xyz helped Fibelius understand how to implement conversational AI in balloons using Eliza's Hyperfy plugin with Claude Code, sharing a GitHub repository link

3. **LLM Documentation Generation**
   - FrankyLimon explained to .hyp shaman how to use LLMs to generate documentation from codebases, recommending Codex xhigh for large repositories

4. **Hyperball World Information**
   - .hyp shaman shared a Discord message link with Dhin containing information about the hyperball world

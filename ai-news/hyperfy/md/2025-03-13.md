# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-13

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Model App Development**: Ashxn developed a new Model app that allows importing any GLB file with toggles for collision and scale adjustment, similar to v1 functionality. This required adding geometry sharing capabilities to the core system.
- **Procedural Generation**: Shiffty demonstrated procedural terrain generation using Perlin noise, modifying core functionality to access and update vertices, which sparked discussion about primitive shape creation capabilities.
- **Particle Systems**: Ashxn introduced a CPU-based particle system to replace UI nodes, highlighting that it supports collision and is easy to prompt with AI.
- **Instancing Optimization**: Detailed discussion about model instancing in Hyperfy V1 vs V2. Voxvienne shared a specific script for instancing GLB files in V1 using gltf-transform functions, while Ashxn explained that V2 automatically instances linked duplicates.
- **Docker & Database**: Several developers discussed Docker and PostgreSQL configuration issues, with devilsadvocate.sol seeking advice on securely connecting to a containerized database without exposing ports.

### Content Creation
- **AI-Generated Textures**: Paradoxx and others explored using AI-generated textures for building facades, sharing detailed prompts used with Krea.ai to create cyberpunk building textures.
- **Animation Techniques**: Gert-Jan Akerboom shared updates on a butterfly animation app, discussing challenges with rotating butterflies composed of multiple meshes. Ashxn suggested using an empty container in Blender with wings inside to simplify the animation logic.
- **Non-Humanoid Rigs**: Significant discussion around implementing non-humanoid rigs, with Mugenomics attempting to create a fish model by splitting it into two objects in Blender and using scripting to animate the tail.
- **UV Scrolling**: The community discussed UV scrolling techniques for creating special effects, with cru demonstrating a seamless alpha texture implementation.

### Platform Features & Integration
- **Discord Integration**: Peezy shared a Discord webhook integration that broadcasts player entry/exit events and chat messages.
- **AI Agents**: Omka shared links to Hyperfy guides about AI agents and mentioned plans to update guides on coding with AI and adding "super prompts" to the AI prompts guide.
- **Player Routing**: Discussions about implementing player routing between worlds with player.route('instance') functionality.

### Community & Documentation
- **Avatar Resources**: The community shared resources for avatar creation, including marketplaces like Vket, BOOTH, Jinxxy, and Vroid Hub.
- **Documentation Updates**: Omka updated avatar-specific documentation, including guides and marketplace listings.
- **Token Discussion**: Brief mentions of the Hyperfy token ($HYPER/$HYPERFY) with price checks being performed, with clarification that there was no fundraising round, only a token launch.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How does instancing work in Hyperfy V1 vs V2?**  
A: In V1, you need to manually instance using gltf-transform functions, while V2 automatically instances linked duplicates. World building by default auto-instances everything, so players only download the model once.

**Q: How can I connect to a Docker PostgreSQL container for admin tasks without exposing ports?**  
A: Exposing the port is the most straightforward solution, but using PG admin in another Docker container or Tailscale were suggested alternatives.

**Q: Is there a video tutorial that takes you from cloning git to launching your world and loading your first asset?**  
A: Yes, check https://hyperfy.how/community/tutorials/

**Q: Can I disable flying for my world?**  
A: Flying is only enabled in build mode.

**Q: How do you set up the camera panning/cinematic mode?**  
A: Use the idle cam system, available as a hyp in the hyp channel.

**Q: How can I open multiple instances of my world for testing?**  
A: Use a different browser or run one in incognito mode due to recent changes.

**Q: Is there support for non-humanoid rigs?**  
A: No direct support yet, but workarounds include splitting models into multiple objects and using scripts for animation, or experimenting with VRM by modifying bone structures.

**Q: Did the team do a fundraising round?**  
A: No raise, just a token launch. Token information is available in the resources channel.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Animation Assistance**:  
   Ashxn helped Gert-Jan Akerboom with butterfly model rotation challenges by suggesting using an empty container in Blender with wings inside to simplify animation logic.

2. **Non-Humanoid Rigging**:  
   Valiant and HowiEDuhzit assisted Mugenomics with implementing a fish model by suggesting VRM modifications and sharing an existing water surface implementation.

3. **Instancing Optimization**:  
   Voxvienne helped Paradoxx with model instancing in Hyperfy V1 by sharing a specific gltf-transform script:
      import { instance } from '@gltf-transform/functions'; 
   await document.transform(instance({ min: 2 }));
   
4. **AI Texture Generation**:  
   Paradoxx shared detailed prompts used with Krea.ai for generating cyberpunk building textures, while Valiant demonstrated how to use Krea's scene transfer feature for color grading and matching building textures to skyboxes.

5. **Bug Fixes**:  
   Ashxn helped Saori fix Math.sqrt issues in the procedural city by pushing a fix that enables all Math functions properly.

6. **Component Sharing**:  
   Peezy provided fractilians with a working version of the Avatar Swap Hyp compatible with the current release.

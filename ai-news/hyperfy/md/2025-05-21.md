# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-21

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Curve-Based Mesh Manipulation
- Gert-Jan Akerboom shared progress on a "followcurve" app that allows meshes to follow a 2D curve
- The app includes configurable parameters like amount and radius
- Discussion about the need for line/curve support in GLTF exporters
- Potential implementation of curve nodes in Hyperfy V2 was discussed

### Developer Tools & Integrations
- Peezy announced the release of IDE scripting functionality via hypkg
- An alternative GitHub branch is available for those not using hypkg
- Lastraum integrated .hyp files into a UGC Catalog with 6,300+ assets
- Users can now download these assets for free and drag-and-drop them into Hyperfy worlds

### Hyper Token & Platform Integration
- Clarification that the Hyper platform will automatically inject wallet and Hyper integrations into all worlds
- Developers won't need to implement anything on their end for basic integration
- Discussion about the open-source nature of the project and potential for custom ecosystems
- Team may develop incentives for projects to incorporate HYPER into their economies

### Character & Animation Topics
- Questions about implementing NPCs in Hyperfy v1
- Discussion about VRM emotes and animation challenges
- Specific issue raised about keeping feet planted on ground when using Mixamo animations

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a way to add NPCs in Hyperfy v1?**  
A: Yes, a VRM can be an app that moves around, and you can even prompt AIs and put the response in chat (answered by peezy)

**Q: Can I create a parent object in Hyperfy v1?**  
A: Not directly within apps yet, but you could export objects as one from a 3D program or handle it programmatically by setting the model as a prop of the app (answered by peezy)

**Q: How do I solve the problem of feet not staying planted on the ground when using Mixamo animations for emotes?**  
A: Root bone (answered by 0mka)

**Q: Are there plans to make the coin a native part of the open source platform? Or does it require the SOL hypkg to integrate?**  
A: The platform will inject wallet and hyper integrations directly into all worlds without needing to do anything on the world side. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What if New Agents built & connected to hyper world but they only promote & accept their own tokens?**  
A: It is an open source project, if people want to use it to create their own ecosystem they will be able to do that. (answered by jar0d)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Curve-Based Mesh Manipulation**
   - Gert-Jan Akerboom shared a working implementation of the "followcurve" app with UI controls
   - This tool helps creators arrange meshes along a curve with customizable parameters

2. **Character Animation Support**
   - 0mka helped carlosmu with the issue of feet not staying planted during animations
   - Identified "root bone" as the solution to the Mixamo animation problem

3. **NPC & Object Hierarchy Implementation**
   - Peezy provided workarounds for implementing NPCs and parent objects in Hyperfy v1
   - Explained how to use VRMs as NPCs with AI responses and suggested approaches for object hierarchies

4. **Asset Integration**
   - Lastraum announced integration of Hyperfy's file format (.hyp) into their catalog of 3D assets
   - This allows community members to easily access and use 6,300+ assets in their Hyperfy worlds

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-21

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Occlusion Culling Implementation**: Ashxn is working on occlusion culling using pre-pass depth checking, which will significantly improve performance by skipping rendering of objects hidden behind walls or other structures. Objects can be marked as "occluders" with a simple option.
- **Curve Support**: Gert-Jan Akerboom shared progress on a "followcurve" app that allows meshes to follow curves. There's discussion about implementing curve/line nodes in V2 and adding GLTF exporter support for curves/splines.
- **IDE Scripting**: Peezy announced the release of IDE scripting functionality via hypkg, enhancing development capabilities.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Community call highlights included reduced memory usage, smaller Docker images, and server usage monitoring capabilities.
- **Animation Issues**: Several developers discussed animation problems, particularly regarding root bones and foot planting in VRM-compatible emotes.

### Asset Integration & Management
- **Hyperfy File Format Integration**: Lastraum announced integration of Hyperfy's `.hyp` file format into their catalog of 6,300+ assets, allowing users to download and drag-and-drop 3D assets into Hyperfy worlds.
- **3D Design Best Practices**: Technical recommendation to avoid transparency in 3D models for better performance on non-desktop platforms, with alpha-cutout suggested instead of alpha-blend.

### Platform & Token Ecosystem
- **Hyper Token Integration**: Ashxn clarified that the platform will automatically inject wallet and Hyper integrations into all worlds without requiring additional work from creators. The platform is designed to be Hyper-centric, with creators only able to forge objects using Hyper.
- **Open-Source Considerations**: Despite being open-source (which means others could potentially build their own ecosystems without Hyper), the team believes this approach is beneficial for all parties.

### Community Projects
- **NPC Implementation**: Discussions about implementing NPCs in Hyperfy v1, with confirmation that VRMs can be used as apps that move around and even use AI for chat responses.
- **Pudgy Penguins Integration**: Interest in implementing Pudgy Penguins in Hyperfy, with Ashxn mentioning they had previously created a Pudgy model and started developing a game called "Icebreaker".
- **Documentation Migration**: The Hyperfy documentation site has moved from hyperfy.how to docs.hyperfy.xyz.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a way to add NPCs in Hyperfy v1?**  
A: Yes, a VRM can be an app that moves around and can even use AI responses in chat (answered by peezy)

**Q: Can I create a parent object in Hyperfy v1?**  
A: Not directly within apps yet, but you could export objects as one in a 3D program or spawn and position with code (answered by peezy)

**Q: Do we have a database of VRM compatible emotes?**  
A: Some are available in shared resources and at hyperfy-animations.vercel.app (answered by Valiant and b0gie)

**Q: How do I solve the problem of feet not staying planted on the ground with Mixamo animations?**  
A: Need to add a Root bone that doesn't move (answered by 0mka and Ashxn)

**Q: Is occlusion culling set up manually or automatically?**  
A: You mark big objects as "occluders" by ticking an option, and it automatically tests other objects (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Are the community meetings recorded somewhere?**  
A: Yes, they're recorded but need to be migrated to another YouTube channel (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Are there plans to make the coin a native part of the open source platform?**  
A: The platform will inject wallet and hyper integrations directly into all worlds without needing to do anything on the world side (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What if new agents built & connected to hyper world but they only promote & accept their own tokens?**  
A: It is an open source project, if people want to use it to create their own ecosystem they will be able to do that (answered by jar0d)

**Q: Is hyperfy.how offline?**  
A: Yes, it has been moved to docs.hyperfy.xyz (answered by maximus and 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Animation Root Bone Issues**: peezy shared a GitHub script for programmatic root bone addition to help carlosmu with animation issues. b0gie clarified that hips shouldn't be connected to root and shared animation resources.

- **Custom Animation Tutorial**: TheMattEmpire helped carlosmu with custom animation issues by sharing a tutorial link and suggesting renaming root_bone to root.

- **Occlusion Culling Explanation**: Ashxn explained to TheMattEmpire how to mark objects as occluders and demonstrated with screenshots.

- **Model Extraction Resources**: Lastraum shared resources to help drdoge.eth extract models from Cryptovoxels world.

- **3D Asset Catalog**: Lastraum shared integration of Hyperfy file format (.hyp) into catalog of 6,300 free assets for drag-and-drop use, benefiting the entire community.

- **Hyper Platform Integration**: Ashxn explained to Mugenomics how the Hyper platform integrates with worlds, clarifying that wallet and Hyper integrations are injected directly without requiring additional work.

- **Documentation Site Migration**: maximus and 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 informed Reneil about the documentation site moving from hyperfy.how to docs.hyperfy.xyz.

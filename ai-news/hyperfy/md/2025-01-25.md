# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Physics & Collision System Improvements**: Ashxn fixed issues with trimesh colliders and implemented teleportation. A significant bug with mesh colliders generating multiple meshes when materials are attached was resolved after extensive debugging. The solution involved the engine's glbToNodes.js automatically fixing colliders by switching to bufferGeo.
- **UI Component Development**: Implementation of UIDropdown, UIImage, and fixes for file input fields. A breaking change in UI mounting caused inspection windows to crash, which was later fixed.
- **Networked Applications**: Several developers worked on a soccer game ("Hyperball") with client-authoritative ball physics. The community discussed stadium design, game mechanics, and team organization.
- **Grid Snapping**: Upcoming feature confirmed by Ashxn that will allow apps to configure their own snap sizes. Community members compared this to other platforms like Rhino and UE, suggesting toggles for different snapping types and alignment tools.
- **UV Animation**: Developers shared techniques for UV texture scrolling animations, with the syntax `sample_uvscroll_0.1.0.0` as a material name suffix.

### Infrastructure & Hosting
- **Self-hosting vs. Services**: Discussions about self-hosting Hyperfy worlds versus using third-party services like hyperworld.host (formerly hyperfy.host).
- **File Size Limitations**: The default size limit for .glb uploads is approximately 12-16MB, requiring environment variable updates for larger files.
- **Docker Optimization**: HPrivakos provided insights on reducing Docker image size to lower hosting costs.

### Community & Project Direction
- **Token Concerns**: Significant discussion about $HYPER token price action, with team members emphasizing focus on long-term development rather than short-term price fluctuations.
- **Documentation Efforts**: Several members contributing to clarify concepts like the entity hierarchy (World → Entities → Apps → Nodes → Subnodes) and creating getting-started guides.
- **Community Tools**: Proposal for a "starred" message system for helpful technical solutions, with HPrivakos offering to build a Discord bot to implement this feature.

### Model Conversion
- Brief technical discussion about converting safetensor model files to GGUF format for use with Koboldcpp and SillyTavern applications, using llama.cpp's "hf_to_gguf.py" script.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: How do I set up a sky and HDR in my world?  
  **A**: Attach a script to a model with sky and HDR nodes, configure file inputs for textures, and add them to your app.

- **Q**: How do apps communicate with each other?  
  **A**: Currently through events with app.send() and app.on(), with world.emit() for global events and world.sendTo() for single player events.

- **Q**: How do I handle chat commands?  
  **A**: Listen for world.on('chat') events and parse the message body to extract commands and arguments.

- **Q**: What is the world hierarchy in Hyperfy?  
  **A**: World → Entities (Apps or Players) → Nodes → Subnodes.

- **Q**: How can animated UVOffset be done for banners in V1?  
  **A**: Add a suffix to the material name, for example: sample_uvscroll_0.1.0.0.

- **Q**: Any idea why I can go through walls despite adding a rigidbody in Blender?  
  **A**: Check normals and face orientation; need to create an empty with custom property node=rigidbody, add building mesh with node=collider and type=static.

### Infrastructure & Hosting
- **Q**: What is the file size limit for uploading .glb files?  
  **A**: The default size limit on local install is 16MB, possibly even 12MB. You need to update your env for max upload size.

- **Q**: What is the recommended hosting platform for installing your own instance of Hyperfy v2?  
  **A**: You can use any VPS provider such as Digital Ocean or Hetzner, or use services like hyperworld.host.

- **Q**: Is it a browser issue if you drag .glb into a v2 world and nothing happens?  
  **A**: It could be related to file size limits or specific glb issues. Try running it locally to test.

### Token & Business
- **Q**: Why doesn't Hyperfy have a SOL pair?  
  **A**: It does have a SOL pair, as confirmed by Saori who shared links to prove it.

- **Q**: How can Hyperfy monetize?  
  **A**: People are already paying for hosting services, and there will be other speculation-based opportunities.

- **Q**: What is our biggest pain point right now?  
  **A**: Applying collision to objects, which requires using a Blender addon.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **HPrivakos helped DevStarlight** with routing ~60 Hyperfy worlds, finding a solution during voice chat.

- **Saori helped devilsadvocate.sol** find model names in a GLB by providing the code `app.traverse((node) => console.log(node))` to debug and find node names.

- **peezy helped amtraq** with a pinned app script crashing browser by identifying a bad commit and suggesting using an earlier version (git checkout 520dea8).

- **Ashxn helped devilsadvocate.sol** create a sky/HDR system by providing a complete script for implementation with test files.

- **Saori helped the community** understand client-authoritative ball physics by annotating the soccer ball app almost line by line to explain implementation.

- **hiroP helped DevStarlight** get collisions working in Blender by providing detailed step-by-step instructions for setting up rigidbody and collider with proper custom properties.

- **𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 helped TheMattEmpire** create animated UV scrolling for stadium banners by providing the correct syntax for material naming.

- **HPrivakos helped Taqman2** fix a 404 error when trying to access a newly created world.

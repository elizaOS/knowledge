# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-12-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Tips
- **Video Streaming Performance**: User 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰 shared that rendering m3u8 video streams directly on VideoScreen in V1 performs poorly. Using an m3u8 player within a WebView component instead provides significantly better performance and user experience.

### VR Implementation Issues
- **Quest 2 Compatibility**: User Enryt reported issues with Quest 2 standalone where video and buttons are not visible when using main branch 5d20037435 (dated 12/18/2025).
- **PCVR Interaction Problems**: When using Meta Horizon Link with PCVR, videos and buttons are visible but buttons remain non-interactive.

### Development References
- **.hyp shaman** mentioned finding a "decent example" of something previously discussed that resembles "hyperfy's wind shader."

### Platform Updates
- **Version 0.16 Improvements**: User Enryt confirmed that with version 0.16, they can now interact with "rocket.hyp," suggesting a previous issue has been resolved.

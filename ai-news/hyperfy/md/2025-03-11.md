# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Tools & AI Assistance
- Developers shared tools for improving AI assistance with Hyperfy development, including custom Cursor rules and Claude prompts
- Significant productivity gains reported when working with LLMs like Claude 3.7
- Maximus expressed excitement about Gemma2, highlighting its quality responses compared to other small models, increased context window (32k), and multi-modal capabilities
- Discussion about local vs. cloud AI models, with some preferring local models for data sovereignty despite smaller context windows

### UI Components & Reusable Code
- Developers shared reusable code snippets (hyp files) for UI billboards, images, and other elements
- Efforts to create a centralized repository for these components at roz.grape.wtf/search/hyp with keyword search functionality
- Omka created and shared UI billboard with configurable settings and basic uiimage components
- Discussions about creating an official subdomain (hyps.hyperfy.how) for hosting reusable components

### Dynamic App Modification
- Major focus on enabling in-world script editing without requiring page refreshes
- Ricky demonstrated a working implementation using MCP that allows editing scripts directly from chat
- Discussions about creating an API for app manipulation to allow apps to be changed on the fly
- Exploration of local development workflows to sync world apps to local filesystem for editing in VSCode

### Game Development Examples
- Shiffty shared a procedural city generator that can be customized and tiled
- Saori created and shared third-person shooter controls
- Ashxn mentioned development of a PvP game mode described as "a properly fleshed out game" that will allow users to create their own versions (similar to Roblox)
- Discussions about adding Halo-style shield mechanics to the combat system

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- Conversation about SpacetimeDB as a tool for managing game states (used by Bitcraft)
- Discussion about Coolify for deployment, with peezy confirming it supports docker-compose files, creates separate volumes for worlds, and enables modded world setups
- Interest in decoupling database and server components for more flexible infrastructure

### Platform Updates
- ToxSam announced a new version of Open Source Avatars (opensourceavatars.com)
- Brief mentions of a token website (token.hyperfy.xyz) and work on a new website
- User reported a CORS error with the hyperbridge functionality during "waiting for wormhole consensus" stage

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a way to not have clones use the same instanced geometry?**  
A: Yes, set mesh.linked=false (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How are you sending that reload signal for in-world script editing?**  
A: Initially used manual page refresh, but later improved to work without refreshing (answered by Ricky)

**Q: Can you upload different models or just cubes for the procedural city generator?**  
A: Yes, it pulls in a node for each color cube and clones them as needed, so could distribute anything (answered by Shiffty)

**Q: Can you choose road layout in the procedural city generator?**  
A: Yes, currently there's randomness for road placement within a block but main roads go straight through for tiling purposes. Could all be customized (answered by Shiffty)

**Q: How come there's no link out to dexscreener etc from the hyperfy website... or any mention of the token / tokenomics?**  
A: The first thing in #1014016264252969021 is our CA and link to tokenomics. We're working on a new site soon. There's a whole site for token at token.hyperfy.xyz. (answered by Ashxn, Saori, and Omka)

**Q: Is there a way to remove the ground object in your world file?**  
A: It's the base-environment.glb (answered by Saori)

**Q: What makes Gemma2 exciting?**  
A: The increased context window and motivation for multi-modal capabilities (image/OCR/etc) (answered by maximus)

**Q: Why focus on local models when Claude and ChatGPT have 128-200k context?**  
A: For unlimited usage and data sovereignty (answered by maximus)

**Q: Is Coolify similar to an auto-configuration tool for servers?**  
A: Yes, Coolify offers various deployment methods including docker-compose (answered by peezy)

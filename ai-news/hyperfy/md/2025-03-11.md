## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a way to load models from a URL currently?** (asked by devilsadvocate.sol)  
A: Not from inspectpane, but potentially could be added to a hyp (answered by Omka)

**Q: How are you sending that reload signal?** (asked by peezy)  
A: Initially with manual page refresh, but later improved to work without refresh (answered by Ricky)

**Q: Is there a way to not have clones use the same instanced geometry?** (asked by Shiffty)  
A: Yes, set mesh.linked=false (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Can you upload different models or just cubes for the procedural city?** (asked by ToxSam)  
A: It pulls in a node for each color cube and clones them, so could distribute anything (answered by Shiffty)

**Q: Is hyperbridging working?** (asked by peezy)  
A: No, transactions go through but get stuck on "waiting for wormhole consensus" with CORS errors (answered by peezy)

**Q: How can I implement a top-down camera view?** (implied by maximus)  
A: Override the camera and put an if statement to disable cursor locking (answered by smickelbeard)

**Q: What makes Gemma2 exciting?** (asked by Ashxn)  
A: The increased context window and motivation for multi-modal capabilities (image/OCR/etc.) (answered by maximus)

**Q: Why focus on local models when Claude and ChatGPT have 128-200k context?** (asked by Ashxn)  
A: For unlimited usage and data sovereignty (answered by maximus)

**Q: What's the difference between Hyperfy v1 and v2?** (implied by Zen)  
A: V2 is a rebuild with new features to make it easier for people to build on and share apps (answered by maximus)

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Topics
- **Hyperfy vs. Unity**: Discussion about Hyperfy's efficiency compared to Unity, with Lastraum mentioning they quickly created a forge leaderboard in Hyperfy.
- **Animation Issues**: Technical problem raised regarding cloned skinned meshes in GLB files where only 1/3 of animations play properly with "bones are missing" errors.
- **Three.js Updates**: Marcel shared links to audio episodes about Three.js WebGPU/WebXR updates and Blender engineering.

### 3D Design & Hardware
- **Hardware Requirements**: Fibelius discussed returning to 3D space-art creation after being limited by corporate laptop capabilities, planning to purchase a new MacBook.
- **Software Environment**: Plans mentioned to update Blender from version 3.4 and install necessary plugins.
- **Asset Generation**: A link was shared for generating assets, though no discussion followed about its effectiveness.

### Cryptocurrency & NFTs
- **HYPER Token**: Brief discussion about price predictions, with speculation about the price declining toward 0.00001 and mentions of a potential "alt season" in 2029.
- **NFT Utility**: Questions raised about the relevance of NFTs in current projects, with suggestions that crypto should be "invisible" and "noob friendly" rather than explicitly showcasing NFTs.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: "I have a bunch of models in one `.glb` some are skinnedmesh bc they have animations. I'm cloning them and scattering them about. Works well but only 1/3 of my skinned mesh clones are playing animations. Logs complain that `bones are missing`"  
   **A**: Ash offered to examine the GLB file, but final resolution wasn't captured in the transcript.

2. **Q**: "Need specs for a mac book that works [for hyperfy/3D work]"  
   **A**: Not directly answered in this segment, though Fibelius mentioned Vox had provided specs previously.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Animation Troubleshooting**:
   - **.hyp shaman** reported issues with cloned skinned meshes not playing animations properly
   - **Ash** offered assistance and requested to check the GLB file via DM

2. **Hardware Specifications**:
   - **Vox** was mentioned as having previously provided computer specifications for 3D work to **Fibelius**

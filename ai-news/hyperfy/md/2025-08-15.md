# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-15

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Portal Rendering Technology**: Ash demonstrated work on a "spirit realm" feature implementing portal rendering, allowing objects to be visible only through portals, which received enthusiastic responses from other developers.
- **Animation Issues**: A technical problem was raised regarding animation problems with cloned skinned meshes in .glb files, where only 1/3 of clones play animations with "bones are missing" errors.
- **Development Resources**: Marcel shared links to audio episodes about Three.js and Blender for community learning.
- **Platform Philosophy**: Discussion about keeping projects engine-agnostic rather than tied to proprietary systems like Unity, with HypPrivakos advocating for platform independence.

### NFT & Blockchain Integration
- **NFT Utility Debate**: Community members debated the value of NFTs beyond simple display functionality, with .hyp shaman arguing that NFTs without meaningful use cases create unnecessary friction.
- **Innovative Applications**: Suggestions for more creative blockchain integration included "playdrops" where defeating in-game bosses could trigger on-chain rewards.
- **User Experience Concerns**: Discussion highlighted tension between blockchain integration and user experience, with calls for making crypto "invisible" to improve accessibility.
- **Asset Management**: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 expressed preference for the "backpack" system from v1 that allowed users to connect and select assets including VRMs.

### Cryptocurrency
- Brief discussion about cryptocurrency valuation, with mentions of price declining toward 0.00001 and waiting for the next "alt season" in 2029.
- MFuture_aka_Pharaoh suggested that lower valuation presents an opportunity to "Bridge to Base and go crosschain" on EVM.

### Community & Hardware
- Fibelius expressed plans to invest in a new computer to learn Hyperfy after receiving specifications from Vox, planning to update from Blender 3.4.
- Lastraum mentioned creating a forge leaderboard quickly with Hyperfy, highlighting development efficiency.
- Maximus shared research on "Beyond DNS: Unlocking the Internet of AI Agents via the NANDA Index and Verified AgentFacts."

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: What's the appeal of adding NFTs to the platform?  
   **A**: Enryt explained it enables users to easily add media and 3D objects they own once the site connects to wallets.

2. **Q**: When is the next alt season expected?  
   **A**: CloudAI suggested 2029.

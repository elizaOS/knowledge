- **Potential Collaboration**: Ash mentioned reaching out to Nikita Bier, who recently joined Solana to help scale applications.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
- **Q**: How do you detect that an entity is inside a hitbox?  
  **A**: "Add a rigidbody and collider to the mob with a specific tag, then check for that tag when the sword hits it" (ash)

- **Q**: How do you make a collider work properly with a concave mesh?  
  **A**: "Turn off convex for a mesh with that shape" (ash)

- **Q**: How do I later update a fly.io deployment without overwriting world changes?  
  **A**: "It won't overwrite your files, the [[mounts]] section in fly.toml controls this" (𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 and smickelbeard)

- **Q**: Can I redirect the user to a link when the user clicks on something?  
  **A**: "Use world.open() function which is available in the dev branch" (0mka)

- **Q**: How do app position and root rigidbody position work?  
  **A**: "If you set the rigidbody node position, the object position will be set relative to the position the user originally placed the app in the world. If you set app.position, it overrides the user-placed position." (general hyper)

### 3D Design
- **Q**: Are materials always 2 sided or is that a new thing?  
  **A**: "They can be either single or double sided, you can set that in Blender" (ash)

- **Q**: How do I change single/double sided settings for GLB export in Blender 4.3?  
  **A**: "Check the 'Backface Culling > Camera option' in the Material settings" (ash)

- **Q**: Why is Hyperfy tools rotating all my models 90 degrees?  
  **A**: "It was likely compensating for models coming in backwards in Hyperfy, which might be fixed now" (0mka)

### Business & Community
- **Q**: Is hyperfy over?  
  **A**: Implied no, with Ash responding "Where am i gonna run 😂" and "We have runway for years" (ash)

- **Q**: Are you the only core developer of the current platform?  
  **A**: "I'm the main dev yes." (ash)

- **Q**: Any plans to hire more devs to help you out?  
  **A**: "It's less about raw development power... there's lots of developers that know hyperfy and are actively doing mods. Main thing i could see is a type of product/marketing manager" (maximus)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Collision Detection Assistance**:
   - Ash helped peezy with detecting when a sword hits a mob by providing code examples for adding rigidbody and collider with tags to mobs
   - Ash created example apps demonstrating rigidbody contacts, triggers, and cross-app raycasting to help Shiffty understand how tags work with raycasting

2. **3D Design Support**:
   - Mattimus shared a HackMD link with instructions on applying colliders in Blender when general hyper was looking for documentation
   - Ash helped TheMattEmpire with confusion about single vs double-sided materials in Blender exports by providing visual examples and explaining the "Backface Culling > Camera option" setting

3. **Deployment & Configuration Help**:
   - 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 and smickelbeard helped Mugenomics understand how to update fly.io deployment without overwriting world changes
   - 0mka shared example of world.open() function to help McCoder with redirecting users to links

4. **Branding Resources**:
   - Valiant and 0mka provided Hyperfy V2 logo files to Gert-Jan Akerboom
   - 0mka updated the branding page with logo options at hyperfy.how/community/branding/

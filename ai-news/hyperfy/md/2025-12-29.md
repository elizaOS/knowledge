# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-12-29

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Project Direction & Philosophy
- Discussion around the concept of "Life-Like Virtual World Models" as a potential goal for the platform
- References to Dr. Michael Levin's definition of life in relation to virtual world development
- Some users expressed disappointment about Hyperfy's current performance and value proposition

### Content Sharing
- User MetaDJ shared links to their build preview (no technical details provided)
- PabloFM | Numinia shared a Twitter/X post in the share channel

### Technical Workflows
- Methods for converting .hyp (Hyperfy) files to .glb (GL Transmission Format) were discussed:
  1. "Shift-clicking" on the box icon to download GLB directly (works only for non-primitive models)
  2. Using the Hyperfy Tools plugin to import .hyp files into Blender

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What should be the target for those with a builder mindset?**  
A: "Life-Like Virtual World Models" (answered by Fibelius)

**Q: What is meant by "life like v world models"?**  
A: Fibelius referenced Dr. Michael Levin's definition of life and shared a Grok link without providing a clear explanation

**Q: How can I convert .hyp files to .glb format?**  
A: Two methods were shared:
- "Shift-click" on the box icon to download GLB directly (for non-primitive models)
- Use the Hyperfy Tools plugin to import .hyp files into Blender

## Community Help & Collaboration

- A user shared information about file format conversion between .hyp and .glb formats, providing two different methods to accomplish this task

## Action Items

### Feature Development
- **Develop "Life-Like Virtual World Models"**
  - Description: Creating more advanced virtual world models based on concepts of life as defined by Dr. Michael Levin
  - Mentioned By: Fibelius

### Technical Improvements
- **Improve file conversion workflows**
  - Description: Current methods for converting between file formats have limitations (e.g., shift-click method doesn't work for primitive-based models)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-23

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### App Development & Communication
- Discussion on app communication patterns in Hyperfy, with emphasis on event-based communication rather than direct access between apps
- Events are described as being as efficient as function calls and widely used in production
- Apps are intentionally isolated for security and simplicity, making the portable app format possible
- HypPrivakos shared code for implementing drag-and-drop functionality for .hyp files

### 3D Assets & Technical Implementation
- Clarification on the difference between .hyp and .glb files: .hyp files contain scripts that automatically convert Decentraland colliders to Hyperfy colliders
- Animation capabilities in v2 are currently limited to GLBs with bones/armatures
- Some Decentraland models with external textures are causing failures when converted to .hyp format
- Discussion about implementing footstep sounds for character animations using collision detection on feet

### Community Building & Events
- Community members discussed organizing live collaborative building events where people can build while others spectate
- Ideas for "Builder Royale" competitions were proposed
- Implementation of a "Deleter/Janitor" agent was suggested to manage world size and prevent crashes
- World size limitations were discussed, noting that Doge's entire world is just over 1GB

### Platform Comparisons
- One user shared their experience with Decentraland, describing it as high-friction requiring multiple applications (web browser, Creator Hub App, and Decentraland app)
- Despite usability challenges, they noted that their Decentraland world "looks beautiful"

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can I access AppsList.js Apps Pane stuff in a hyp directly without knowing the instanceIds?**  
A: No, apps can't do that. If two apps want to communicate, use events - this is by design for security and simplicity. (Ashxn)

**Q: Are there any memory leak concerns with audio/video loops?**  
A: There are zero memory leaks that I'm aware of at the moment. (Ashxn)

**Q: Has anyone played with adding footstep sounds to the character animations?**  
A: Good idea, should be doable but probably won't be 100% in time, only estimated. Using foot colliders to trigger sounds and check surface types was suggested. (Ashxn, hiroP)

**Q: Can I animate a scene GLB similar to v1?**  
A: You can only animate GLBs that have bones in v2 for now. (á²¼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)

**Q: Any reason to use hyp instead of just a glb?**  
A: Hyp files contain scripts that convert Decentraland colliders to Hyperfy colliders automatically, making them more user-friendly without manual manipulation. (Lastraum)

**Q: How many applications are needed to build and launch a world in Decentraland?**  
A: Three applications - web browser for account verification, "Creator Hub App" for building, and "Decentraland" app for previewing. (untitled, xyz)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **App Communication Patterns**: Ashxn helped 0mka understand event-based communication between apps, explaining that events are as efficient as function calls and demonstrating a pattern for location syncing between apps.

- **Footstep Sound Implementation**: hiroP assisted Mugenomics by suggesting the use of foot colliders to trigger sounds and check surface types for realistic footstep audio.

- **Portal Functionality**: maximus provided carlosmu with information about v1 syntax for place targeting in portals (hyperfy.io/world?place=NAME), though noted uncertainty about exact implementation.

- **.hyp File Technical Details**: Lastraum explained to HypPrivakos the technical purpose of .hyp files versus .glb files, sharing script code that converts Decentraland colliders to Hyperfy colliders.

- **Drag-and-Drop Implementation**: HypPrivakos provided Lastraum with a React code snippet for implementing drag-and-drop functionality for .hyp files.

## Action Items

### Technical
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality for .hyp files using provided React code (Mentioned by HypPrivakos)
- Write script to detect Decentraland models with external textures to prevent showing incompatible hyps (Mentioned by Lastraum)
- Implement collision-based footstep sound system with surface type detection (Mentioned by hiroP)
- Streamline the Decentraland platform to reduce the number of applications needed for world creation and preview (Mentioned by untitled, xyz)

### Documentation
- Document the differences between v1 and v2 portal/place targeting functionality (Mentioned by carlosmu)

### Feature
- Support for animating GLBs without bones/armatures in v2 (Mentioned by emotionull)
- Add footstep sounds to character animations with surface-specific sounds (Mentioned by Mugenomics)
- Organize live collaborative building events with spectators (Mentioned by Gert-Jan Akerboom)
- Implement a "Deleter/Janitor" agent that cleans and deletes objects on a schedule (Mentioned by Gert-Jan Akerboom)
- Create "Builder Royale" competitions where builders compete against each other (Mentioned by TheMattEmpire)

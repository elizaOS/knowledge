# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-17

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Voice Chat Implementation
- Discussion about implementing voice chat functionality in Hyperfy worlds using LiveKit
- Configuration requires setting up a LiveKit server or using LiveKit cloud service
- Environment variables need to be properly configured in the .env file
- For Numen-hosted worlds, special arrangements may be needed for voice chat enablement

### Role Management & Permissions
- Clarification on how admin and builder roles work in Hyperfy worlds
- Without an admin code set, everyone gets builder privileges by default
- After setting an admin code, the "Free Build" option can be used to manage builder access
- Discussion about how to manage player permissions after fresh repository pulls

### Data Storage Limitations
- Conversation about storage options for scripts in Hyperfy
- Current limitation: scripts cannot access browser's localStorage directly
- Scripts are sandboxed and cannot access the window object
- world.storage API stores data in the world JSON rather than in the user's browser
- Interest expressed in having browser-side storage capabilities

### Market Activity
- Brief mention of price movements in the HYPER token
- References to a price drop and potential buying opportunity

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I add voice chat to my space?**  
A: You need to setup a LiveKit server or use LiveKit cloud service and set the parameters in the .env file. The necessary environment variables were provided.

**Q: How do I manage roles for players?**  
A: Use the Free Build option in world settings or give people builder role in the players list. Without an admin code everyone is a builder by default.

**Q: Is there a reason we can't access the localStorage directly?**  
A: Scripts are sandboxed, so you can't access the window object. Currently, the world.storage API only stores data in the world JSON rather than in the user's browser.

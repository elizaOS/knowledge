## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I add voice chat to my space?**  
A: You need to setup a LiveKit server yourself or use the LiveKit cloud service and set the parameters in the .env file.

**Q: Is there a new process for admin public toggle for people in world?**  
A: Bottom of the world settings menu is a Free Build option. If you haven't set an admin code then everyone is a builder anyway.

**Q: Is there a reason we can't access the localStorage directly?**  
A: Scripts are sandboxed for security reasons. It's a security issue if apps can read cookies as they could steal auth tokens.

**Q: Does the screen flickering happen only when looking at specific assets?**  
A: No, the flickering occurs across different worlds and predates specific assets.

**Q: Is the project dead?**  
A: No.

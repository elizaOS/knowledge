# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-12

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### UI Development
- 0mka shared several UI examples demonstrating both screen space and world space positioning techniques
- Examples included a clock UI, a hello UI with toggle functionality, and a button UI with pointer events
- Key positioning concepts were explained: using alignContent, alignItems, and justifyContent for UI elements
- Parent-child relationships were demonstrated using ui.add() and app.add() methods
- The examples were designed as easily modifiable templates for developers to use as starting points

### App Architecture & Collectibles
- Discussion on implementing collectible items like coins revealed two main approaches:
  1. Multiple apps with a manager app for coordination
  2. Single app handling all aspects (spawning, collection, UI feedback)
- The single-app approach was highlighted for its shareability and simplicity
- Ashxn shared a PR (#107) for scene improvements with a recommendation to backup world folders before testing

### Mobile Compatibility
- BallisticBanana reported issues opening Hyperfy on iPhone 14 Pro through Twitter/X
- Ashxn noted it works fine on older iPhone 12 Pro, suggesting a device-specific issue rather than platform limitations
- Discussion pointed to possible memory issues or browser settings as potential causes

### Avatar Compatibility
- Fibelius tested older avatar files in Hyperfy, specifically CloneX VRM files
- Comparison between VOIDS and VOYAGERS avatars revealed optimization differences
- RTFKT Clone VRM converter tools were mentioned as still functional after 2+ years

### Tokenomics
- PurpleSack proposed a comprehensive model for $HYPER token centered around four staking mechanisms:
  1. Directing platform fees to stakers for organic growth
  2. Using unclaimed airdrop tokens for a staking pool with modest inflation
  3. Offering exclusive rare drops for stakers
  4. Creating exclusive access areas and status items for stakers
- Ashxn confirmed plans to make $HYPER the exclusive cryptocurrency payment solution on the platform
- Web2 on-ramps would be provided while maintaining $HYPER as the underlying token
- Staking was agreed upon as a way to reduce volatility
- The airdrop claiming period has officially ended

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I position UI elements properly?**  
A: Use alignContent, alignItems, justifyContent for flex positioning of UI elements. UI views are positioned using these properties while position.set depends on screen/world space.

**Q: How can I implement audio that plays on collision?**  
A: Initialize audio with app.create('audio'), add it to a node, and play it in the rigidbody's onTriggerEnter callback.

**Q: Can apps create or destroy other apps?**  
A: No, apps can't create other apps or destroy themselves as this would lead to issues, but they can be made dormant by hiding meshes.

**Q: What's the best approach for implementing collectible coins?**  
A: Either use multiple apps with a manager app for coordination, or implement everything in a single app that handles spawning, collection, and UI feedback.

**Q: Why couldn't Hyperfy open on my iPhone 14 Pro?**  
A: It might be a memory issue, though unusual for that model since it works on older iPhones like the 12 Pro. Could be related to browser settings.

**Q: Why do VOYAGERS look better than VOIDS in Hyperfy?**  
A: The VOYAGERS were more optimized.

**Q: Can people still claim the airdrop?**  
A: No, the claiming period has ended.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-12

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### UI Development
- **Flex-based Positioning**: 0mka provided detailed guidance on UI positioning using `alignContent`, `alignItems`, and `justifyContent` for flexible layouts
- **UI Examples**: Three UI examples were shared: a clock UI in screen space, a UI with world/screen toggle, and a button UI with pointer events
- **Button Implementation**: Detailed implementation of buttons using `onPointer` events with UI views, sound effects, and click counters

### Audio & Interaction
- **Sound Implementation**: Discussion on implementing audio elements and handling sound playback in response to trigger events
- **Collision Events**: Implementation of sound playback when rigidbody trigger events occur
- **GitHub Updates**: PR #107 was merged into dev branch, related to scene management

### App Architecture
- **Collectible Items**: Two approaches discussed for creating collectible items:
  1. Single app approach with world storage for persistence
  2. Master app with duplicated child objects
- **App Limitations**: Clarification that apps can't create or destroy other apps, but can be made dormant by hiding meshes

### Platform Performance
- **Mobile Compatibility**: BallisticBanana reported issues opening Hyperfy on iPhone 14 Pro, while Ashxn noted it works fine on older iPhone 12 Pro
- **Avatar Optimization**: Discussion about avatar compatibility, with VOYAGERS noted as being more optimized than other avatar types like VOIDS
- **Legacy Support**: Testing of older avatar files (CloneX VRM) in Hyperfy with mixed results

### Tokenomics
- **$HYPER Token**: Discussion of future tokenomics centered around four staking mechanisms:
  1. Directing platform fees to stakers
  2. Utilizing unclaimed airdrop tokens with modest inflation
  3. Offering exclusive rare drops for stakers
  4. Creating exclusive access areas for stakers
- **Platform Integration**: Agreement that $HYPER should be the exclusive cryptocurrency payment solution on the platform
- **Web2 Onboarding**: Need for web2 on-ramps while maintaining $HYPER as the underlying value token
- **Airdrop Status**: Confirmation that the airdrop claiming period has ended

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How to position UI elements properly?**  
A: Use `alignContent`, `alignItems`, `justifyContent` for positioning; UI views are positioned with flex properties (0mka)

**Q: How to implement sound playback on collision events?**  
A: Add audio to a node and call `play()` in the rigidbody's `onTriggerEnter` callback (0mka)

**Q: Can apps create or destroy other apps?**  
A: No, apps can't create other apps or destroy themselves, but they can be made dormant by hiding meshes (Ashxn)

**Q: What's the best approach for implementing collectible coins?**  
A: Either use a single app with world storage or have coins emit events when collected that other apps can listen for (0mka and Ashxn)

**Q: Why couldn't I get Hyperfy to open on my phone from Twitter/X?**  
A: It happens when you run out of memory; some older or budget iPhones can't handle it, though it's surprising on an iPhone 14 Pro (Ashxn)

**Q: Why do VOYAGERS look better than other avatars in Hyperfy?**  
A: Because the voyagers were more optimized (.hyp shaman)

**Q: Can people still claim airdrop?**  
A: Ended (Sceth iii)

## Action Items

### Technical
- **Implement UI positioning using flex properties** (alignContent, alignItems, justifyContent) for proper UI element positioning (Mentioned by: 0mka)
- **Use world.set()** to store locations of collectible items and player progress using world storage keyed by player ID (Mentioned by: 0mka)
- **Add sound effects to interaction events** by implementing audio playback on trigger events (Mentioned by: Gh0sTtüëªü™Ñüêò)
- **Test GitHub PR #107** for scene management and back up world folder before testing the merged changes (Mentioned by: Ashxn)
- **Debug mobile memory issues** on newer iPhones by investigating why Hyperfy fails to load on iPhone 14 Pro despite working on older models (Mentioned by: Ashxn)
- **Improve error reporting from Apple devices** as Apple doesn't provide clear error information for debugging purposes (Mentioned by: Ashxn)
- **Implement staking system** for $HYPER token with mechanisms that distribute platform fees, utilize unclaimed airdrops, and provide exclusive benefits (Mentioned by: PurpleSack)
- **Develop $HYPER as exclusive crypto payment solution** making it the only cryptocurrency used for transactions on the platform (Mentioned by: PurpleSack)

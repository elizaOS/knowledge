# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Deployment
- **Self-hosting options** for Hyperfy worlds were discussed, with recommendations for Fly.io, Coolify, and hyperworld.host ($5/month)
- A new **documentation website** was highlighted for developers
- MayD524 released significant developer tools including **TypeScript definitions** for Hyperfy's API and a **Rollup configuration** for modular app development
- Saori mentioned an upcoming "insane web3 app" launching in approximately one month

### Technical Innovations
- A **navmesh generator with A* pathfinding** was shared, creating walkable areas by raycasting in a grid pattern
- MetaMike is working on integrating **ElevenLabs for voice responses** in under 2 seconds
- A web-based **GLB model renderer** (wizard.grape.wtf) was developed that generates animated GIFs of 3D models for Discord sharing
- Discussion of **vehicle physics implementation** with the "hyperduck" model modified with F-35 jet dynamics

### AI & Agents
- Microsoft's **Phi-4 AI model** release was mentioned as potentially worth testing when available on Ollama
- Brief discussions about **Anthropic AI** and the **Oracle Framework**
- Interest in AI integration for building games on Hyperfy, including voice command functionality

### Avatar & Environment
- **Avatar scaling and customization** discussions, with drdoge.eth working on making avatar scale changes persist when equipped
- Exploration of **texture handling**, physics floors, and environment customization
- Discussion about the "unique" flag behavior in Hyperfy's app system and how it affects duplicated models
- Future **water physics implementation** ideas, using swimming mode with buoyancy and animated surfaces with splash effects

### Tokenomics & Community
- Saori clarified the team's focus on **adoption over token flywheel mechanics**, emphasizing HYPER as a currency with community governance
- Despite market volatility with Solana dropping significantly (~30%), users noted that HYPER has maintained relative stability around $0.01
- Community events highlighted, including "Hyperfy.How #2" focusing on self-hosting tutorials

## Key Questions & Answers

**Deployment & Hosting**
- Q: Is now the way to deploy a hyperfy world to prod to just like clone the repo work on it locally and they deploy it to vercel?
  A: Hyperfy offers self-hosting options including Fly.io and Coolify, or hyperworld.host for $5 (Saori, maximus)

**Technical Implementation**
- Q: Can we just replace the glb? Or will that just get written over next update?
  A: We can replace it if we use a different name or directly modify in src/core/assets, but cannot just replace the glb in world data as those are overwritten on restart (HPrivakos, Ashxn)

- Q: If I am trying to have one node make another node appear in front of it, what's the best way to do it?
  A: You can clone nodes and add them to the app (Ashxn)

- Q: Does unique only effect models duplicated after you set it?
  A: Unique just means any new duplicates will be completely disconnected from anything (Ashxn)

**Avatar & Environment**
- Q: Were you able to get the scale to stick to the avatar by any chance?
  A: Not yet, working on it today (drdoge.eth)

- Q: I've noticed the texture size is much bigger in the outliner than the jpgs loaded? Was just curious as to why that might be?
  A: That's texture VRAM, uncompressed and pushed to the GPU (Ashxn)

**Audio & Media**
- Q: We don't have streaming audio yet do we?
  A: Only for user dedicated audio sources, nothing like YouTube or Spotify (drdoge.eth)

**Tokenomics**
- Q: What happened to the working flywheel in 3 weeks?
  A: "I do not care about a token flywheel even slightly. I care about adoption... the thing that makes most sense for hyperfy is simply using hyper as a currency for the economy and incorporating community governance wherever applicable" (Saori)

- Q: How is $HYPER staying strong at 0.01 when solana has dropped like 30%?
  A: "The weak hands were shaken out in low caps before they were shaken out in large caps. Probably also some panic hyper sellers swapped into SOL, then later panic sold sol into stables." (abinge05)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **TypeScript Support**: MayD524 created and shared TypeScript definitions for Hyperfy's API, enabling better development workflows
  
- **Modular Development**: MayD524 created and shared App-Rollup for working with multiple files instead of the single-file app scripting environment

- **Audio Implementation**: Ashxn provided code snippets showing how to create and play audio from a URL to help MetaMike with ElevenLabs API integration

- **Environment Customization**: Ashxn & HPrivakos explained to MetaRick how to disable the default environment while keeping the physics floor

- **Model Rendering**: TheMattEmpire received help from Ashxn for fixing fuzzy textures by changing settings from 'Closest' to 'Linear' in node settings

- **Market Analysis**: abinge05 explained market dynamics to Knar regarding HYPER price stability despite SOL dropping 30%

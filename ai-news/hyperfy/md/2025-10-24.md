# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Announcements
- **New Teleport Trigger Box**: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 announced the creation of a simple customizable teleport trigger box, their first .hyp file implementation.
- **Gaussian-VRM Tool**: A user shared a link to Gaussian-VRM, a tool for creating 3D avatars, along with an X post about it.

### World Storage & Management
- **Storage Limits Discussion**: Users discussed concerns about world storage sizes reaching 5GB and potential billing implications.
- **Automatic Cleanup Feature**: It was clarified that newer worlds have automatic cleanup enabled by default via the "CLEAN=true" environment variable, which removes deleted entities that still occupy disk space.
- **Snapshot Storage Impact**: HypPrivakos explained that snapshots count toward storage limits, with 5GB snapshots potentially exceeding free tier limits if multiple are taken.
- **Billing Threshold**: The platform likely doesn't charge for amounts under $1 due to transaction fees.
- **Deployment Snapshots**: Automatic snapshots created during deployments may contribute to increased storage usage.

### 3D Design & Blender
- **Transparent/Glowing Effects**: A user sought and received help with creating a fading transparent/glowing cone effect in Blender.
- **Blender Version Differences**: Users discussed interface changes between Blender versions, noting that newer versions can be confusing for those familiar with older interfaces.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Does the platform auto clean worlds now?  
   **A**: By default it cleans now, but only on newer worlds. You can check your .env for `CLEAN=true` (answered by ash)

2. **Q**: Could anyone help me out with a node configuration/settings for a fading transparent/glowing cone?  
   **A**: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 provided a solution that matched the reference GIF shared by the user.

3. **Q**: When will 402x integration or blockchain integration be available?  
   **A**: This question remained unanswered.

4. **Q**: Is it possible to stream on custom 3D objects yet (I know video is in there, but can you update the mesh?)  
   **A**: This question remained unanswered.

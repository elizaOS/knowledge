# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### 3D Development & Tools
- **Tencent Hunyuan 3D Model Generator**: Users are testing this new tool that produces clean meshes with better topology. The generated models include rigging and animations, though texture quality is often poor. Users are developing workflows that use the generated meshes but replace or improve the textures. (.hyp shaman, Valiant, cwe)
- **Dynamic 3D Model Loading**: Ashxn shared an experimental method to dynamically load GLB models from URLs using the `world.load()` function. This allows developers to load models at runtime rather than bundling them with applications. (Ashxn, creazy.eth)
- **Sitting System Enhancements**: 0mka shared an updated sitting system with multiple new features including emote choices, VR-friendly triggers, and extensive customization options. Roustan implemented this system on their website by copying scripts from v2 and replacing v1 scripts. (0mka, Roustan)

### Technical Discussions
- **File Size Optimization**: Discussion about optimizing GLB files for sitting animations, with some files being significantly larger than others (500kb+ vs 100-200kb). (Roustan)
- **WebSocket Disconnection Issues**: A user reported frequent WebSocket disconnections on world.visualworld798.xyz. Another user suggested performing a speed test, while a third shared their experience of resolving a similar issue by refreshing the page. (0xLittle dog, .hyp shaman, ash)

### Platform Strategy & Vision
- **Hyperfy Positioning**: Discussion about whether Hyperfy should position itself as a "brand coin." Ashxn mentioned that Hyperfy was considered as a brand coin in early development stages, as the company builds various interconnected technologies including AI, VR, virtual worlds, avatars, and digital collectibles. (Rick, Ashxn)
- **Web3D Capabilities**: Conversation about the technical feasibility of creating No Man's Sky-like aesthetics in web environments. Agent12 suggested it's possible but would require significant development resources. (Jayzen, Agent12)

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it possible to make worlds as aesthetically pleasing as No Man's Sky or is the web too limiting?**  
A: "I think it's well within reason to pull that off. But just as it took a Large Experienced teams Years to 'Refine' what No-Mans sky is. It would take as much or more Dev-Power to make something like that native for Web/ or on Hyperfy." (Agent12)

**Q: Should Hyperfy position itself as a brand coin?**  
A: "Hyperfy considered being a brand coin in early days due to building various interconnected technologies" (Ashxn)

**Q: What's wrong with the textures from the Tencent tool?**  
A: "They look drawn on by a child" (.hyp shaman)

**Q: Is there a way to dynamically replace or load a 3D model into the world on load?**  
A: "Yes, you can use `const model = await world.load('model', 'https://somewhere.com/something.glb')` followed by `world.add(model)`" (Ashxn)

**Q: Does the dynamically loaded model become attached to the script? How would you toggle its visibility?**  
A: "Yes, it's spawned in the context of the app that loads it and behaves like any other node hierarchy where meshes can be deconstructed independently" (Ashxn)

**Q: Are query parameters implemented right now?**  
A: "No, they are not currently implemented" (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Sitting System Implementation**
   - Helper: 0mka | Helpee: Roustan
   - Context: Implementing seat functionality with Actions
   - Resolution: 0mka suggested a copy-pasta technique that saved Roustan about an hour of implementation time and later provided an enhanced chair system with multiple new features

2. **3D Model Optimization**
   - Helper: Roustan | Helpee: 0mka
   - Context: Identifying and optimizing a heavy GLB file for sitting animation
   - Resolution: Roustan optimized the file and shared a lighter alternative, though with positioning issues

3. **Dynamic Model Loading**
   - Helper: Ashxn | Helpee: creazy.eth
   - Context: Needed a way to dynamically load 3D models into the world
   - Resolution: Provided code example using experimental world.load() function to load GLB files from URLs

4. **3D Character Creation Workflow**
   - Helper: Valiant | Helpee: .hyp shaman
   - Context: Sharing workflow for character creation
   - Resolution: Explained process using Sparc 3D (1M tris), Quadremeshing (10k) and baking

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### 3D Development & Implementation
- **Seat Functionality**: Roustan successfully implemented "seat v2" with Actions functionality by copying scripts from v2 to replace v1 scripts, then re-adding emotes. This approach saved significant time compared to manually positioning approximately 40 seats across three instances. The implementation works on mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Model Loading**: Ashxn shared an experimental method to dynamically load GLB models from URLs using `world.load()` and `world.add()` functions. This capability was noted as significant, with HypPrivakos mentioning it had been requested for years in Decentraland.
- **3D Model Generation Tool**: Discussion about a new tool from Tencent Hunyuan that produces cleaner meshes with better topology. The tool generates models with rigging and animations in a basic Mixamo-style armature without fingers, though textures were considered poor quality.
- **Model Optimization**: Conversations about file size optimization for 3D models, with Roustan noting they optimized particularly heavy sitting models and shared lighter alternatives.

### Platform Strategy & Development
- **Market Positioning**: Debate about Hyperfy's market positioning, with some suggesting it should be positioned as a "brand coin." Ashxn mentioned this approach was considered in early development stages as the company builds various interconnected technologies.
- **Development Philosophy**: Tension between community members wanting faster market results versus those advocating patience with the development process.
- **Technical Capabilities**: Discussion about the technical feasibility of creating No Man's Sky-like aesthetics in web environments, with Agent12 suggesting it's possible but would require significant development resources.
- **Cambrian Partnership**: Brief mention of a potential partnership that some members consider significant.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: Is there a way to dynamically replace or load a 3D model into the world on load?  
  **A** (Ashxn): You can dynamically load GLB from a URL using `world.load('model', 'https://somewhere.com/something.glb')` followed by `world.add(model)`

- **Q**: Does the dynamically loaded model become attached to the script? How would you toggle its visibility?  
  **A** (Ashxn): It's spawned in the context of the app that loads it, and works like any other node hierarchy where meshes can be deconstructed independently

- **Q**: Are query parameters not implemented right now?  
  **A** (Ashxn): Correct, they are not implemented

- **Q**: What's wrong with the textures from the Tencent Hunyuan tool?  
  **A** (.hyp shaman): It looks drawn on by a child

- **Q**: Does the tool have rigging and animations?  
  **A** (Valiant): Yes, it does have rigging + anims. Armature is mixamo mode...basic, no fingers

### Platform Capabilities
- **Q**: Anyone here played No Man's Sky? Is it possible to make worlds as aesthetically pleasing as that game or is the web too limiting to allow for that?  
  **A** (Agent12): I think it's well within reason to pull that off. But just as it took a Large Experienced team Years to "Refine" what No-Man's sky is. It would take as much or more Dev-Power to make something like that native for Web/ or on Hyperfy.

- **Q**: Should Hyperfy position itself as a brand coin?  
  **A** (Ashxn): Mentioned they considered this approach in early days due to their diverse technology focus

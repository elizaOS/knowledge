# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-27

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Vehicle Physics Implementations**: Several users shared impressive vehicle projects, including Shiffty's Hyperduck 2.0 flying vehicle with F-35-like performance characteristics and drdoge.eth's motorcycle implementation. Ashxn explained that realistic vehicle physics could be achieved using raycasts from wheel struts to simulate spring dynamics.

- **AI Agent Integration**: Discussions focused on integrating AI agents into Hyperfy worlds, with two main approaches emerging: an app-based method for world owners and a WebSocket connection method allowing external agents to connect to worlds. Peezy explored using Eliza as a framework, highlighting benefits of creating an Eliza plugin for Hyperfy.

- **Audio Implementation**: MetaMike worked on integrating ElevenLabs for fast voice responses, with Ashxn helping implement blob loading for audio data from the ElevenLabs API.

- **Space & Flight Mechanics**: Shiffty mentioned that flight mechanics could be adapted for space flight, sparking discussions about potential space-themed games including trading simulations, asteroid mining, and fleet command systems.

### Platform & Ecosystem
- **HYPER Token Utility**: Ashxn shared that beyond engine development, they're building a platform at hyperfy.xyz that will utilize the $HYPER token for characters, emotes, vehicles, and agents, creating a flywheel for in-world upgrades and passes.

- **Modular Building System**: TheMattEmpire is developing road pieces with snap points for a modular building system, with general hyper suggesting optimal snap point positioning for better connectivity.

- **Marketplace Development**: szjanko shared progress on a marketplace feature showing downloads, views, and reviews, noting significant work remains before release.

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Code Editor Enhancement**: A suggestion to add a save button to the code window received positive feedback from moderators, with an additional suggestion to highlight the button when there are unsaved changes.

- **Emote Management**: Discussions about improving emote handling by allowing users to drag them directly into app configuration spaces or providing a searchable repository of emotes.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I scale a GLB in V2?**  
A: Use app.scale.set(x,y,z) (answered by devilsadvocate.sol)

**Q: How can I make one node create a duplicate of another node?**  
A: Use clone method: const dog2 = dog1.clone(true); app.add(dog2) (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How can I handle ElevenLabs audio response data in Hyperfy?**  
A: Ashxn implemented blob loading support for this specific use case

**Q: Is there a way to use the collider already on the vehicle instead of creating a new box collider?**  
A: Yes, you can use the collider in the GLB, there's no difference (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Why use Eliza for agent integration?**  
A: It offers easy onchain integration via plugins, distribution to self-hosting communities, clear code for other frameworks, and avoids reinventing the wheel (answered by peezy)

**Q: What model works best for agents?**  
A: Anthropic is best from testing (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What are the plans for the $HYPER token beyond what's on token.hyperfy.xyz?**  
A: The token will be used for characters, emotes, vehicles, agents, in-world upgrades, passes, etc. on the hyperfy.xyz platform (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How to fix sitting animations that keep looping?**  
A: Need a sitting emote that loops, like the swivel chair (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How to deal with water physics?**  
A: If inside volume use swimming mode with buoyancy (answered by Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Audio Integration**: Ashxn helped MetaMike implement blob loading to handle binary audio data from ElevenLabs API and provided code examples for playing audio from URLs.

- **Object Cloning**: Ashxn assisted Omka with making one node create another node by providing code examples using the clone method.

- **Vehicle Physics**: Ashxn helped Shiffty fix a player slipping issue with the flying vehicle by correcting a position calculation that was off by one frame.

- **Road Component Design**: general hyper provided TheMattEmpire with detailed feedback on snap point design for road components, proposing a simplified system with 4 main snaps and 2 accessory snaps.

- **Agent Integration**: Ashxn shared the Hyperfy Eliza fork repository with peezy and explained physics integration for agents, pointing to a controller node that handles movement with physics considerations.

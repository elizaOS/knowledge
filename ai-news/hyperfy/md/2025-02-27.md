# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-27

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Vehicle & Physics Development
- **Flight Mechanics**: Shiffty developed a Hyperduck 2.0 flight simulator with projectiles and camera controls, featuring "performance of an F-35" that could be adapted for space flight
- **Motorcycle Physics**: drdoge.eth implemented motorcycle physics with collision handling
- **Vehicle Challenges**: Developers discussed collision detection improvements and handling player position slipping at high speeds
- **Water Physics**: Consensus reached to use swimming mode with buoyancy inside invisible water volumes rather than complex water rendering, allowing users to create their own water visuals

### AI & Agent Integration
- **Agent Architecture**: Debate between endpoint vs. websocket connections for agents, with Peezy suggesting websockets would allow agents to initiate actions rather than just react
- **Voice Integration**: MetaMike worked on implementing ElevenLabs API for audio streaming, with Ashxn providing critical support for blob loading
- **Hyperfy Eliza Fork**: Ashxn shared information about a Hyperfy fork of Eliza that includes prompts to prevent unwanted agent responses
- **Physics for Agents**: Discussion about using controller nodes to handle agent movement with physics considerations

### Platform & Token Development
- **Platform Roadmap**: Ashxn revealed details about the platform being built at hyperfy.xyz that will utilize $HYPER token for characters, emotes, vehicles, and agents
- **Web3 App**: Saori mentioned they're building a web3 app launching in approximately one month
- **Token Bridging**: Saori suggested Portal Bridge could be used to bridge HYPER tokens without code and offered to add liquidity if someone puts it on Base

### 3D Design & Tools
- **Model Wizard**: devilsadvocate.sol shared a 3D model wizard tool (wizard.grape.wtf) that automatically downloads models upon upload
- **Animation Issues**: Significant discussion about sitting animations that loop instead of holding a pose, revealing confusion about animation track control
- **Blender Compatibility**: Technical issues with Blender 4.3 were discussed, specifically backface culling problems causing x-ray surface artifacts

### Game Concepts
- **Space Simulation**: Community members discussed potential game implementations leveraging flight capability, including space trading simulations, asteroid mining, and fleet command systems
- **Casual Games**: Suggestions for farming simulation, fishing gameplay, and "Overcooked" style gameplay

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I make one node create a duplicate of another node?**  
A: Use clone method like `const dog2 = dog1.clone(true)` and then add it to the app with `app.add(dog2)` (Ashxn)

**Q: How do I set a scale size for a GLB in V2?**  
A: Use `app.scale.set(x,y,z)` (devilsadvocate.sol)

**Q: Is there a way to use the collider already on the vehicle instead of creating a new box collider?**  
A: Yes, you can use the collider in the GLB with no difference (Ashxn)

**Q: Why use Eliza right now?**  
A: It offers easy onchain integration via plugins, distribution to the self-host Eliza community, clear code for other frameworks to integrate, and avoids reinventing the wheel (peezy)

**Q: How to handle sitting animations that keep looping instead of holding a pose?**  
A: Need a sitting emote that loops, like the swivel chair animation (Ashxn)

**Q: How to deal with water physics?**  
A: If inside volume use swimming mode with buoyancy (Ashxn)

**Q: What has been outlined about the token outside of token.hyperfy.xyz?**  
A: Platform utilizing $HYPER for characters, emotes, vehicles, agents, and building games with HYPER for in-world upgrades (Ashxn)

**Q: Is hyperfy.base.eth the official team?**  
A: No (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Audio Integration**: Ashxn helped MetaMike process ElevenLabs audio responses for streaming by adding support for blob loading and explaining how to use audio URLs with `app.create('audio', { src: 'http://...' })`

- **Vehicle Physics**: Ashxn assisted Shiffty with fixing player position slipping at high speeds in Hyperduck 2.0 by correcting a position calculation that was off by one frame

- **Node Cloning**: Ashxn provided Omka with code examples using the clone method to duplicate nodes

- **Asset Hosting**: devilsadvocate.sol offered to host images and audio files for Hyperfy scenes

- **Agent Development**: Ashxn shared the GitHub comparison link showing the differences between main Eliza repository and Hyperfy fork to help peezy with agent integration

- **Water Physics**: Ashxn guided devilsadvocate.sol on implementing water physics using swimming mode with buoyancy in water volumes

- **3D Tools**: devilsadvocate.sol created and shared wizard.grape.wtf for model uploads to benefit the community

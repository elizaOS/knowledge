# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI & Technical Development
- **3rdEyeVisuals' Consciousness Framework**: A personal AI project with semantic and temporal memory capabilities that runs offline. The system mimics Apple's unified memory approach, allowing larger models to utilize both RAM and CPU resources. It can run a 7B parameter model locally on a 4080 GPU and supports dynamic model swapping for multi-modal deliberation. Models were converted to gguf format for cross-OS compatibility.

### Tools & Resources
- **Forest Generator**: Gert-Jan Akerboom shared a forest generator that incorporates trees from quickmesh.dev. The tool features a circle-shaped forest option with configurable inner radius to prevent tree placement in the center area, creating a Central Park-like effect.

### Hosting & Infrastructure
- **Hyperfy Hosting Options**: Discussion about hosting costs for educational purposes, with options ranging from paid services starting at $5/month to free alternatives using fly.io. HypPrivakos mentioned offering discounted rates for educational purposes.

### Technical Issues
- **Firefox Audio Support**: Ozymandias analyzed a GitHub commit that attempted to fix Firefox audio support. The fix was combined with a performance improvement, making it difficult to isolate the specific audio issue. The implemented solution doesn't fully resolve Firefox audio support problems, particularly for scenes loaded for the first time, suggesting a possible caching issue.

### Security Concerns
- Brief mention of the recent shai-hulud npm worm, though no technical details were discussed about this security threat.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: I'm curious about the costs of Hyperfy long-term, is there anyone I can ask a few questions?**  
A: "You can run hyperfy very cheap on a single vps depending on your requirements (nr of concurrent users & world size)" - smickelbeard

**Q: Is there somewhere where I can get estimates of those costs? I was wondering if there's a subscription or what are other costs I should keep in mind.**  
A: "Hyperfy itself doesn't have subscriptions but needs to be hosted somewhere which might have cost. Hosting services start at 5 USD a month per world with lower rates possible for education." - HypPrivakos

**Q: What dat cpu do?**  
A: "A few too many things in my world I guess 😅" - Gert-Jan Akerboom

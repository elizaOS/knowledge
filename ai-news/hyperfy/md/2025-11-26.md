# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI Development Projects
- **Consciousness Framework Development**: User 3rdEyeVisuals shared progress on their offline AI system with semantic and temporal memory capabilities
- **Technical Architecture**: The framework was upgraded from Ollama to llama.cpp for improved performance
- **Memory Management**: Implementation of a system mimicking Apple's unified memory approach, allowing 7B parameter models to utilize both GPU and RAM resources on a 4080 GPU
- **Model Compatibility**: Development of a GGUF converter to ensure compatibility with open-source models
- **Dynamic Model Swapping**: Implementation of functionality for multi-modal deliberation through model swapping

### Personal Updates
- 3rdEyeVisuals mentioned balancing development work with family responsibilities and multiple projects

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How does the Consciousness Framework run offline?**  
A: It runs "100% offline/Airplane mode" with llama.cpp after being upgraded from Ollama (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-12-02

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Movement & Interaction Mechanics
- Users discussed the importance of enhanced movement capabilities in Hyperfy, with specific interest in wall climbing/hanging features demonstrated by Dhin
- Dhin suggested implementing various movement control schemes as "hyps" that could be dropped into worlds, similar to mechanics from games like Super Mario 64 or Uncharted
- Pete praised the current avatar locomotion as a strong foundation but requested spring bone support for avatar accessories like tails and ears

### Development & Deployment
- Several users discussed self-hosting options for Hyperfy, with .hyp shaman suggesting Coolify and fly.io as potential solutions
- 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 noted that Coolify was too complex for non-coders, while ash suggested dokploy as an alternative with better documentation
- CarTarL mentioned difficulties migrating from V1 to V2, noting that V1 "just works" but V2 deployment has issues
- Ozymandias discussed how SaaS-based topology might limit GPLv3 exposure to only boilerplate code and mentioned plans to modify draft PRs based on this conclusion

### Intellectual Property & Asset Protection
- Extensive discussion about protecting 3D assets (GLTF files) from being copied
- 3rdEyeVisuals shared an experience of having honeycomb hexagonal patterns potentially stolen from a Decentraland build
- Ash argued that DRM is ultimately ineffective since content protection can always be circumvented, similar to music and video piracy
- Ozymandias countered that encryption creates a barrier requiring expertise to overcome, making specialized rippers easier targets for law enforcement

### AI Agent Development
- Darkfallx.phng sought advice on building an AI agent for X (formerly Twitter) that responds to tags and mentions, but was concerned about the high cost of X's developer API
- .hyp shaman suggested using Farcaster instead of X, describing X as "for grandpas"
- Recommendations included exploring Neynar for Farcaster API access and using ElizaOS as a starting framework

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can DRM be applied to GLTF content if it can't be encrypted?** (asked by Ozymandias)  
**A:** There are ways to obscure and prevent GLTFs from being easily ripped, but it's ultimately futile as protection can always be circumvented, similar to music and movies. (answered by ash)

**Q: So I'm trying to build an AI agent on X... Basically, I want it to respond to tags and mentions. But X developer API cost wayyyy too much bruhhh... Is there a way to bypass this?** (asked by Darkfallx.phng 🥷🦇)  
**A:** Get on farcaster, figure out neynar. ElizaOS is an awesome way to get started. (answered by .hyp shaman)

**Q: I can use it [Farcaster] to build the AI agent without making use of the expensive X API?** (asked by Darkfallx.phng 🥷🦇)  
**A:** x is for grandpas (answered by .hyp shaman)

**Q: Should wall hang be default?** (asked by Akuma)  
**A:** That'd be cool. Would be crazy to be able to grab anything. (answered by Dhin)

**Q: How should I proceed with wallet login issues?** (asked by MerlinaRañi)  
**A:** Try clearing site data in dev tools; might need admin reset (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **.hyp shaman helped Darkfallx.phng** with alternatives to the expensive X API for building an AI agent, suggesting Farcaster with Neynar and ElizaOS as a starting framework. Also shared links to resources including babylon.market and mentioned retake.tv for educational streams.

2. **𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 assisted MerlinaRañi** who was unable to access their worlds with their MetaMask wallet across multiple browsers. Suggested clearing site data and indicated possible need for admin intervention.

3. **Ozymandias provided insights to 3rdEyeVisuals** regarding asset protection after 3rdEyeVisuals mentioned someone potentially stealing honeycomb hexagonal patterns. Ozymandias suggested that encryption creates barriers requiring expertise to overcome, making specialized content rippers easier targets for law enforcement.

4. **Dhin explained to Akuma** that wall climbing has many variations and isn't used in every world, providing context for the discussion about movement mechanics.

5. **ash suggested dokploy** as an alternative to Coolify for deployment, noting it has better documentation and AI assistance capabilities.

## Action Items

### Technical
- **Modify draft PRs** to leverage SaaS-based topology that limits GPLv3 exposure to only boilerplate code (Mentioned by Ozymandias)
- **Explore Farcaster and Neynar** as alternatives to X API for building AI agents (Mentioned by .hyp shaman)
- **Use ElizaOS** as a starting framework for AI agent development (Mentioned by .hyp shaman)
- **Implementation of wall hanging/climbing** as default movement (Mentioned by Akuma)
- **Spring bone support** for avatar accessories like tails and ears (Mentioned by Pete)
- **Investigate MetaMask wallet login issues** across multiple browsers (Mentioned by MerlinaRañi)
- **Explore dokploy** as alternative to Coolify (Mentioned by ash)
- **Address migration issues** from V1 to V2 (Mentioned by CarTarL)
- **Run with modified hyperparameter** for longer than 1 second to improve speed performance (Mentioned by Dhin)

### Documentation
- **Create better documentation/videos** for Coolify setup as current documentation is confusing for non-coders (Mentioned by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)
- **Check out retake.tv** for educational streams about AI agent development (Mentioned by .hyp shaman)

### Feature Requests
- **Modular movement mechanics** - Create different control scheme "hyps" that can be dropped into worlds (like Mario 64 triple jump or Uncharted climbing) (Mentioned by Dhin)
- **Parkour movements** - Add parkour-style movement capabilities (Mentioned by Akuma)

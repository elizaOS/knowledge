# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-22

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Vehicle Physics & Development
- **Ash** shared progress on basic vehicles and hover cars using raycasting for ground detection
- **Shiffty** detailed his car implementation using raycasts instead of colliders for wheel positions and suspension
- Current vehicle implementations are client-side only but could be fully simulated on server
- Discussions about improving anti-roll functionality to prevent vehicles from tipping over
- **TheMattEmpire** proposed a car customization system similar to character studio with options for chassis, bumpers, spoilers, etc.

### World Building & Features
- **Vox** proposed creating a collaborative cyberpunk-themed world with a racing track to showcase Hyperfy's capabilities
- Discussions about procedural dungeon generation using GLB files with designated spawn points for mobs, loot, and bosses
- **HypPrivakos** explained technical approach for portal functionality between different worlds, requiring disconnection from one world's websocket and connection to another's
- NPC development discussions, particularly "Susan" and "Deathclaw" characters, including spawning and despawning systems

### Permissions & Infrastructure
- Detailed discussion about implementing more granular permissions system beyond the current binary admin/non-admin model
- Proposals for intermediate permission levels (like DJs or game masters) to use provided assets without full admin privileges
- Concept of marking objects as "temporary" to prevent permanent world changes by limited-permission users
- URL parameter support for spatial navigation in worlds (e.g., `play.hyperfy.xyz?x=5&y=5&z=5`) as an alternative to `/spawn set`

### Technical Optimizations
- Performance recommendations for Hyperfy V1, particularly regarding lights (use 2-3 maximum, preferably none)
- Some users reported issues with in-world commerce functionality, with certain objects not accepting payments
- Documentation improvements discussed, with **jin** submitting a GitHub pull request that **Ash** merged after changing the target branch to dev

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How resource intensive are the Lights in Hyperfy V1?** (asked by Paradoxx)  
A: Use 2-3 at maximum. Best is none. (answered by vox)

**Q: Have people used AI to help with Hyperfy development?** (asked by ash)  
A: People have used claude/chatgpt to get hyperfy running from zero. (answered by ash)

**Q: How are the vehicle physics implemented?** (asked by ash)  
A: Shiffty explained using raycasts at wheel positions without colliders, affecting wheel heights with suspension calculations. (answered by Shiffty)

**Q: Do the wheels have colliders or are you using raycast to calculate upward force?** (asked by ash)  
A: Only raycasts with no colliders at all. (answered by Shiffty)

**Q: Is it possible to portal over to different worlds in v2?** (asked by ~/drdoge.eth)  
A: HypPrivakos suggested it would require decoupling web from server and managing websocket connections between worlds. (answered by HypPrivakos)

**Q: Could we limit users to only using game assets they can directly manipulate in-world?** (asked by Agent12)  
A: That level of permissions already exists, but intermediate roles like "MC/DJ" or "game master" would be a great addition. (answered by 0mka)

**Q: How can I link a user to a certain location in my Hyperfy world?** (asked by general hyper)  
A: You could use URL parameters like play.hyperfy.xyz?x=5&y=5&z=5 as an alternative to /spawn set. (answered by general hyper)

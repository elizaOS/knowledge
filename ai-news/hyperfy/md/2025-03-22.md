# Hyperfy Development Updates & Cyberpunk Racing Project (2025-03-22)

## Technical Discussions & Decisions

### Vehicle Physics
- Basic vehicle system implemented; server-side simulation planned.
- Hover cars use raycasts for suspension instead of colliders.
- Anti-roll improvements added.

### NPC & World Systems
- Radiation zones and NPC damage systems implemented.
- NPC spawning/despawning system in progress.
- NPC_Raptor_1.1 updated with jumping and collision detection.

### Procedural Dungeon Generation
- Proposal for random dungeon generation using `.glb` rooms with spawn points for mobs, loot, and bosses.

### Portals & World Linking
- Discussion on decoupling web from the server for seamless world transitions.
- Exploration of portal mechanics for world switching.

### Documentation & Platform Development
- Proposal for versioned documentation using Docusaurus.
- Hyperfy.xyz confirmed as a platform similar to Roblox.
- Suggestion to use GitHub Pages for documentation.

### Cyberpunk-Themed World Project
- Large-scale project including a city racing track, car physics, sound design, time trials, and multiplayer racing.
- Aims to showcase Hyperfy’s capabilities, frontend scripting, and AI integration.

### Lighting Optimization in Hyperfy V1
- Lights are resource-intensive; recommended usage is 2-3 max, ideally none.

### AI-Powered Scam Handling
- Discussion on using LLMs (e.g., Eliza) to automate scammer interactions.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What led to the decision to remove native $HYPER integration from the main branch?**

**Q: Can you use Crypto in your Hyperfy V2 Core build yet?**  
A: Dhin suggested using other branches, while Roustan mentioned "you could implement EVM connectivity through your own servers hosting your worlds"

**Q: Has there been any discussions of not sticking to the token that you've heard of?**  
A: Saori stated "He has said multiple times that HYPER will be the only token, just hasn't mentioned anything about dilution."

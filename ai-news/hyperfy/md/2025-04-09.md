- Proposals to change from percentage-based to flat rewards for better balance

### Technical Developments
- **Voice Chat Implementation**: LiveKit-based voice functionality being tested with positive feedback
- **Animation Systems**: Detailed discussions on custom animations, movement overrides, and character controller integration
- **Environmental Effects**: Gert-Jan working on rain effects (now in V3) with texture scrolling and positioning
- **Physics Implementation**: Code examples shared for rigidbodies and colliders, with clarification on parameters
- **Hyperfy Blender Add-on**: Tool that allows easy addition of collisions and snap points to 3D models
- **Video Capabilities**: Upcoming geometry video projection for curved screens and groundwork for screen sharing

### Platform Updates
- **Hyperworld App Marketplace**: Launched at hyperworld.host/marketplace with tipping functionality
- **Crypto Tax Software**: general hyper developing free crypto tax reporting software as alternative to paid services
- **EVM Module**: peezy created an EVM mod in hypkg, generating excitement

## Key Questions & Answers

### Game Development
- **Q**: What are the core mechanics of Fallen? (johan)  
  **A**: PvP and staking, with plans to add a second currency for kills for new skins (ash)
- **Q**: Will voice messages be proximity chat? (MUDBONE)  
  **A**: It's spatial/proximity now, but will add option for global (ash)

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: How can I change animation speed in Hyperfy? (general hyper)  
  **A**: Add "?s=2" to the animation URL to change speed to 2x (ash)
- **Q**: How do I move players in animations that move the player? (peezy)  
  **A**: Apply an effect and anchor them, then animate the anchor (ash)
- **Q**: How do I change spawnpoint? (vox)  
  **A**: Use "/spawn set" command or escape -> world -> set spawn (ash and general hyper)
- **Q**: Should two dynamic rigidbodies collide with one another? (smickelbeard)  
  **A**: Yes, but only if they are 'convex' (.hyp shaman)
- **Q**: Does that mean the screen would be a glb? (Gert-Jan Akerboom)  
  **A**: Yes, in v1 it was a GLB with a "live" video stretched across the surface (maximus)

### Troubleshooting
- **Q**: Could loading issues be device-specific? (ash)  
  **A**: Yes, confirmed working on a newer computer but not on others (Pearl Hyacinth)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Assistance
- **Gert-Jan Akerboom** helped **johan** with description visibility issues, promising a fix in the next version
- **maximus** assisted **MUDBONE** with loading issues related to VPN usage
- **~/drdoge.eth** directed **Cluny_the_Scourge** to the Hyperfy Blender add-on for adding collisions to 3D models
- **ash** helped **TheMattEmpire** successfully implement voice chat with emotes while speaking
- **ash** clarified for **smickelbeard** that kinematic rigidbodies don't move and dynamic should be used instead
- **peezy** explained to **smickelbeard** that for sphere colliders, radius should be used instead of size
- **Gert-Jan Akerboom** provided **vox** with instructions on how to aim at circles and press 'r' to grab and move objects

### Resource Sharing
- **Cluny_the_Scourge** committed to converting GLB models with collisions and snap points for the public library
- **peezy** shared the CCXT library for standardizing exchange interfaces with **general hyper**
- **general hyper** shared improved Etherscan API documentation with **peezy**
- **cru** shared original blend file with **Gert-Jan Akerboom** for texture scrolling implementation reference

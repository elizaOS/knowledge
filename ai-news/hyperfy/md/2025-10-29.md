# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-29

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Blender Integration & Tools
- **Gert-Jan Akerboom** is developing a Blender add-on for bidirectional conversion between Blender objects and Hyperworld prims
- The tool will support features like collision toggle and trigger zones
- Users will be able to paste prompted hyp code and export to GLB format

### Advanced Rendering Techniques
- **3rdEyeVisuals** demonstrated direct THREE.js access as a "super user"
- Showcased a "Tardis effect" that creates hidden worlds through dynamic visibility control
- This technique makes meshes invisible when viewed from outside, allowing for larger-than-apparent interior spaces

### UI Component Development
- **3rdEyeVisuals** shared progress on a shape-based UI component with multiple shapes (circles, ovals)
- The component includes a "lit" property that interacts with HDR
- Implementation challenges included oval shape alignment and mesh orientation issues
- A bug in the bundling script affecting hash generation for JavaScript files was discovered and fixed

### Game Development
- **Gert-Jan Akerboom** announced a dragon shooting game with climbing mechanics
- Invited community members to test the game

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can you use the Blender tool to paste prompted hyp code and export GLB?** (asked by mrtzhckr)  
A: Yes, Gert-Jan plans to implement this bidirectional functionality in a Blender add-on (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)

**Q: Does the Blender tool support toggle collision, trigger zones, etc.?** (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals)  
A: Yes, "all that good stuff!" (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)

**Q: Is the "lit" property working correctly?** (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom)  
A: It may be reversed - "lit" being affected by HDR and "off" not being affected. Will look into it later. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)

**Q: Why does the oval shape have a different center than other shapes?** (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom)  
A: Because the oval uses the same circle shape mesh, requiring a manual offset. Was having issues with rotating the actual oval mesh. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Blender Integration Testing
- **Gert-Jan Akerboom** shared a dragon shooting game for community testing
- Provided a link to the game with instructions on how to play

### UI Component Feedback
- **Gert-Jan Akerboom** tested 3rdEyeVisuals' shape-based UI component
- Identified issues with the "lit" property appearing reversed
- Pointed out alignment problems with the oval shape
- This feedback helped 3rdEyeVisuals identify issues to fix in future updates

### THREE.js Implementation Sharing
- **3rdEyeVisuals** demonstrated the "Tardis effect" implementation
- Shared screenshots and explained the dynamic visibility control technique
- Contributed to community knowledge about advanced rendering possibilities

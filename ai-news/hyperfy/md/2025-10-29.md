# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-29

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Advanced Development Tools & Techniques
- **Blender Integration**: Gert-Jan Akerboom is developing a Blender-to-prims export tool that allows editing prompted objects in Blender, potentially becoming a full Blender add-on with support for collision toggles and trigger zones.
- **Miniverse Concept**: 3rdEyeVisuals shared work on creating worlds-within-worlds by manipulating THREE.js directly, requiring player position and camera control access to enable proximity toggles and prevent clipping issues.
- **THREE.js Access**: Discussions about direct THREE.js access for advanced world development, enabling more sophisticated graphics and interactions.
- **WebGPU Exploration**: Interest in upgrading from WebGL to WebGPU for improved graphics capabilities and ray-tracing potential.

### Component & Asset Development
- **Shape/Video Enhancement Tool**: 3rdEyeVisuals shared a new component with circle and oval shape functionality, though it needs some polish regarding the "lit" feature and oval shape alignment.
- **Avatar Format Conversion**: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 successfully converted Avatar GLB files to VRM format for use in Hyperfy, noting that movement animations are superior in Hyperfy compared to Otherside.
- **Snap Points System**: Discussion about implementing snap points in Blender using empties with custom properties set to "node" with "snap" value.

### Platform News
- **Nuggets Identity Verification**: Maximus shared news about Nuggets launching a Verified Identity Plugin for ElizaOS, bringing zero-trust verification capabilities to AI agents.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Can the Blender export tool work in reverse to edit prompted objects?  
   **A**: Yes, Gert-Jan Akerboom is working on making that functionality available.

2. **Q**: Does the Blender tool support collision toggles and trigger zones?  
   **A**: Yes, "all that good stuff!" according to Gert-Jan Akerboom.

3. **Q**: Has anyone created a snap placement system?  
   **A**: Yes, snap points exist using Blender empties with string type custom properties set to "node" with value "snap".

4. **Q**: Has anyone tried upgrading from WebGL to WebGPU?  
   **A**: It has been discussed before, users should search for WebGPU in the channel history.

5. **Q**: Why does the oval shape have a different center than other shapes?  
   **A**: Because the oval uses the same circle shape mesh with adjustable width/height ratios, requiring a manual offset.

6. **Q**: Is the "lit" feature working correctly?  
   **A**: It may be reversed - "Lit" being affected by HDR and "off" not being affected. 3rdEyeVisuals will address this issue.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **.hyp shaman** helped **3rdEyeVisuals** implement snap points in Blender by explaining that they're created using empties with custom properties set to "node" with "snap" value.

2. **Valiant** assisted **3rdEyeVisuals** regarding WebGPU implementation by directing them to previous discussions in the channel history.

3. **Gert-Jan Akerboom** provided feedback to **3rdEyeVisuals** on their new component, identifying issues with the "lit" feature and oval shape alignment that helped pinpoint bugs for future fixes.

4. **𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓** shared their experience converting Avatar GLB files to VRM format, demonstrating successful cross-platform compatibility while noting Hyperfy's superior animation quality.

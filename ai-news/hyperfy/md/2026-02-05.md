# Hyperfy Discord - 2026-02-05

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Tools & Documentation
- Jin created a script that generates tests for converted apps in isolated grid worlds, solving the issue of finding apps in test worlds
- Jin proposed creating a dedicated repository for "skills" - specialized knowledge modules to help AI agents understand Hyperfy development
- Jin demonstrated success using these skills to create a pet app in one attempt
- Discussion about the "hyperfy-ref" repository, which is an older reference repository that served as a blueprint for v2

### UI Improvements
- Jin made UI improvements to the Hyperfy interface:
  - Added labels to previously unlabeled columns
  - Added pitch/yaw/roll labels to enhance usability
  - Submitted pull request (#151) with these changes

### 3D Assets & Avatars
- Discussion about potentially adding the "Visitors Of Imma Degen / VOID" NFT collection to the open-source-avatars repository
- Technical implementation would involve uploading 3D assets (VRM/GLB files) to GitHub, creating collection JSON files
- Licensing concerns were raised since the original project isn't open source, especially regarding what happens when NFTs are sold

### Technical Infrastructure
- Brief discussion about Kubernetes requirements for "worlds"
- Ash clarified that v2 is very lightweight and can "run on a raspberry pi"
- Jin suggested that "janus servers" could run on inexpensive hosting

### AI & Testing
- Jin mentioned testing with Opus 4.6, which they found impressive
- Discussion about using combined skills (Solana + building-Hyperfy-apps) to experiment with Hyperfy tokenomics ideas

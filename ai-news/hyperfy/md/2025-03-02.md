# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-02

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **V1 to V2 Transition**: The team is rebuilding the platform with V2 offering significant performance improvements and a less limiting SDK compared to V1
- **Business Strategy**: Saori mentioned their goal is to "flip Roblox" and they're building a marketplace around their token that will provide revenue if successful
- **Financial Runway**: The team has "a few years runway" for development, with core team members being financially stable regardless of token performance
- **Developer Experience**: MayD524 confirmed that V2 has made development "super easy to iterate on and make custom tools," making development faster

### Technical Discussions
- **Grabbable Objects**: Ashxn shared code examples for creating attachable anchors and grabbable objects, allowing users to pick up and drop items in-world
- **Material Properties**: Only emission and UV scrolling can be modified at runtime
- **UI Implementation**: Discussions about bringing images into V2, with current solution requiring texturing a plane in Blender
- **Clicker Game Development**: Several developers discussed implementing a simple clicker game using onPointerDown events
- **App Scaling**: Bear asked about scaling apps in a forked environment, discovering that app.root is needed to access an App's Node

### 3D Design & Lighting
- **Lighting Implementation**: Discussion about enabling lights versus baking lighting, with Ashxn explaining lights were disabled due to performance concerns
- **Compromise Solution**: ii_cable_ii proposed using minimal key lights with emissive materials for accent lighting in dark spaces
- **Tonemapping Techniques**: Shared resources advised against using ACES tonemapping

### Token Economics
- **$HYPER Token**: Significant price volatility observed, with values ranging from $14.2M with 22.2% gains to $9.4M with 37.5% losses
- **Vesting Periods**: Saori explained the difference between legitimate tokens with vesting periods versus pump.fun tokens with instant unlocks
- **Value Mechanisms**: Comparisons between crypto tokens and traditional stocks, particularly regarding dividends and value creation

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What is the endgame for Hyperfy?**  
A: The team is focused on building the platform and tools, with the direction evolving as development progresses (answered by bear and Saori)

**Q: How is the team sustaining development?**  
A: The token gave them a few years runway, and they're creating a marketplace that will provide revenue if successful (answered by Saori)

**Q: Why rebuild before launching a marketplace when v1 looked good enough?**  
A: Long-term competitiveness requires the rebuild, with big performance improvements and a less limiting SDK (answered by Saori)

**Q: Is there currently an easy way to bring in an image into V2?**  
A: For now the only way is to texture a plane in blender (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Been thinking a lot about building a simple clicker game, is that something doable atm?**  
A: Absolutely (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Where do I even start? Been trying to force it but can't even get to click an object to add up points**  
A: OnPointerDown is what you need (answered by MetaMike)

**Q: Does `scale` work yet in v2?**  
A: app.scale.y or app.scale.set(3,3,3) (answered by Saori)

**Q: Can we have lights enabled instead of having to bake lighting?**  
A: It's not hard to enable lights, but it was disabled due to downstream performance issues when users place too many lights. People can fork and enable lights if needed. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What is the alternative to a "rug" and how are coin creators supposed to profit?**  
A: They're not supposed to profit until vesting terms end; real tokens come with vesting unlike pump.fun which has instant unlocks (answered by Saori)

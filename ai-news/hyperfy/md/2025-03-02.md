# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-02

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Updates
- **V2 Platform Progress**: Discussions centered on the transition from v1 to v2, with Saori mentioning the addition of "hypkg" and app rollup features. The v2 update offers significant performance improvements and a less limiting SDK compared to v1.
- **Grabbable Objects**: Ashxn shared code examples for creating attachable anchors and grabbable objects, allowing users to pick up and drop items in-world.
- **Material Properties**: Confirmation that only emission and UV scrolling can be modified at runtime in the Hyperfy engine.
- **Scaling Apps**: Bear asked about scaling apps in a forked environment, discovering that app.root is needed to access an App's Node.
- **Clicker Game Development**: Several developers discussed implementing simple clicker games using onPointerDown events.

### 3D Design & Lighting
- **Lighting Approaches**: Discussion between ii_cable_ii and Ashxn about lighting in 3D environments. While enabling lights is technically feasible, it creates performance issues when users place too many lights.
- **Alternative Lighting Techniques**: ii_cable_ii described their approach to building dark spaces with minimal lighting (key lights only) and using emissive glows for accent lighting.
- **ACES Tonemapping Warning**: A warning was shared against using ACES tonemapping based on a YouTube video.

### Business & Token Discussion
- **Project Sustainability**: The team clarified they have "few years runway" for development and are building a marketplace around their token that will provide revenue if successful.
- **Token Economics**: Saori explained that legitimate tokens have vesting periods unlike instant-unlock tokens on platforms like Pump Fun.
- **Price Volatility**: $HYPER experienced both gains (+22.2%) and significant drops (-37.5%) over the period, prompting discussions about market conditions.

### UI & UX Improvements
- **Outliner Feature**: TheMattEmpire suggested adding buttons to the outliner that would open other windows, implementing tabs that could be pulled out as separate windows, and making these elements dockable.
- **Route Parameters**: A request was made for implementing route parameters to specify player spawn location on world load.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: Is there currently an easy way to bring in an image into V2?  
  **A**: For now the only way is to texture a plane in blender (answered by Ashxn)

- **Q**: Do you know what the shortcut is to drop it after I pick it up?  
  **A**: Q (answered by Ashxn)

- **Q**: Been thinking a lot about building a simple clicker game, is that something doable atm?  
  **A**: Absolutely (answered by Ashxn)

- **Q**: Where do I even start? Been trying to force it but can't even get to click an object to add up points  
  **A**: OnPointerDown is what you need (answered by MetaMike)

- **Q**: Does `scale` work yet in v2?  
  **A**: app.scale.y = 2 or app.scale.set(3,3,3) (answered by Saori)

- **Q**: Can we have lights in the engine instead of having to bake everything?  
  **A**: It's not hard to enable lights, but it creates downstream performance issues when people place too many lights. Amazing spaces can be created without baked lighting. (answered by Ashxn)

### Business & Vision
- **Q**: What is the endgame for Hyperfy?  
  **A**: The team is focused on building the platform and tools, with bear suggesting "keep building and see where it goes" (answered by bear and Saori)

- **Q**: How does Hyperfy sustain development?  
  **A**: The token gave them a few years runway, and they're creating a marketplace around it that will provide revenue if successful (answered by Saori)

- **Q**: Why rebuild before launching a marketplace when v1 looked good enough?  
  **A**: Long-term v2 will be more competitive with big performance improvements and a less limiting SDK (answered by Saori)

- **Q**: What is the alternative to a "rug" and how are coin creators supposed to profit?  
  **A**: They're not supposed to profit until vesting terms end; real tokens come with vesting unlike Pump Fun's instant unlock (answered by Saori)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Code Sharing & Examples
- **Ashxn** helped **fractilians** by sharing two .hyp files for chair and sword attachments, and later created and shared a networked grabbable object with basic functionality.
- **Ashxn** assisted **Ricky** with fixing a wrong texture encoding issue for image displaying with incorrect color.
- **MetaMike** helped **ToxSam** with building a clicker game by sharing code example with onPointerDown event handlers.
- **Ashxn** created and shared a basic clicker game example with pointer events for **ToxSam**.
- **Ashxn** helped **peezy** by creating and sharing examples for emission and UV scrolling material properties.

### Technical Guidance
- **Saori** explained to **bear** how to access and modify scale properties when scaling App objects in a forked environment.
- **Ashxn** provided **ii_cable_ii** with technical reasoning behind not enabling lights by default and suggested alternatives, leading ii_cable_ii to refine their approach using minimal key lights and emissive glows.
- **MayD524** explained to the community that v2 has made it super easy to iterate and make custom tools, making development faster.

### Knowledge Sharing
- **Shiffty** helped **Curtisdonthurtus** by sharing a tweet from Ash Connell about the ecosystem vision when they were seeking clarity on Hyperfy's vision.
- **Omka** shared details about upcoming tutorial covering assets in world, Hyperfy Tools Blender Add-on, and asset optimization.
- **Saori** provided **Knar** with a detailed explanation of how token launches should work and the problems with instant unlocks.

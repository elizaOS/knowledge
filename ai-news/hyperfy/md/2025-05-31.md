# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-31

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Rendering & Performance Optimization
- **Ashxn** shared insights about a new rendering pipeline with occlusion culling capabilities that provides performance benefits even when occlusion culling is disabled
- The renderer could potentially enable web-based engines (Three.js, Babylon, PlayCanvas) to better compete with traditional game engines (Unity, Unreal, Godot)
- Particularly promising for VR/mobile applications with complex scenes like city environments, which currently struggle on these platforms

### 3D Model & Scene Development
- Discussion about handling collision in GLB models to prevent clipping issues
- Brief mention of terrain creation using splatmaps authored in Blender
- **b0gie** is developing a "cruiser" project with a web interface accessible at specific domains (255242621.xyz and tattedalien.club)

### Project Reflections
- Community members reminisced about "Upstreet," a discontinued project
- Discussion about the challenges entrepreneurs face, including loneliness and dealing with "token extractors"
- Speculation about potentially recreating Upstreet-like functionality on Hyperfy

### Cryptocurrency
- Brief mention of liquidity issues, with **jingo** suggesting adding more liquidity to a pool

### Security Concerns
- **MetaRick** warned the community about a scammer cloning profiles and sending friend requests/DMs

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How does the new rendering pipeline affect performance?**  
A: It provides a performance boost even with occlusion culling off, with huge gains when occlusion culling is enabled and scenes have many occluded objects. (Ashxn)

**Q: What's the trade-off with occlusion culling?**  
A: It uses extra CPU time, so if not many objects are occluded, you lose CPU time for no benefit. (Ashxn)

**Q: Can VR/mobile handle big city environments?**  
A: Currently no, but the new renderer should make it possible. (Ashxn)

**Q: Why do I experience clipping issues when I add the scene GLB?**  
A: Use the Model app which comes with a collision button. Otherwise you need to author your own colliders. (Ashxn)

## Action Items

### Technical
- Test new renderer with city kits in VR/mobile environments to evaluate performance of occlusion culling with complex urban scenes (Mentioned by Ashxn)
- Practice implementing occlusion culling techniques (Mentioned by b0gie)
- Create a demonstration of terrain splatmap workflow in Blender via stream (Mentioned by Ashxn)

### Documentation
- Write a thread about rendering limitations in web engines to explain how naive rendering approaches limit Three.js, Babylon and PlayCanvas compared to Unity, Unreal and Godot (Mentioned by Ashxn)
- Document the process for adding proper colliders to GLB models, explaining how to use the Model app's collision feature or author custom colliders (Mentioned by Ashxn)

### Feature
- Complete development of "cruiser" project by finishing tweaks and adding vanity features (Mentioned by b0gie)
- Add more liquidity to the pool, possibly to address price dips (Mentioned by jingo)

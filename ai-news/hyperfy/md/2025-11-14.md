# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **Mobile Usability**: Discussion about the need for touch-based controls for GLB model manipulation on mobile devices, as the current desktop controls (scroll wheel and shift) don't translate well to touchscreens.
- **Physics Implementation**: Hyperfy has implemented physics for GLB models with working collisions, though synced falling platforms were noted to be "glitchy" when colliding with objects.
- **UI Development**: 3rdEyeVisuals is updating the UIVideo component for compatibility with a new z-indexing system and finalizing a visual UI customization overhaul for their first beta machine.

### Marketplace & Community
- **Marketplace Awareness**: Some active community members were unaware of the marketplace at hyperworld.host, suggesting a need for better promotion or integration.
- **Marketplace Curation**: Discussion about improving the marketplace with better curation to avoid confusing new users.
- **World Connectivity**: Suggestions for a map feature to connect Hyperfy worlds, with recommendations to make it opt-in.

### Technical Features
- **Environmental Controls**: Solar panels in Hyperfy control skybox, sunlight, and fog effects.
- **Three.js Learning**: Brandon Manus shared that he's learning Three.js as a stepping stone toward using Hyperfy for his personal website.

### Community Concerns
- **Cryptocurrency Integration**: Debate about the role of cryptocurrency in the platform, with some users expressing frustration about limited crypto functionality in V2 compared to V1.
- **Project Attribution**: Discussion about a controversy regarding a project called "HyperScape" and its alleged similarity to "Hyperfy," with concerns about potential code copying without proper attribution.

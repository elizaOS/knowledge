# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-20

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development & Direction
- Debate about Hyperfy's positioning between a game engine and platform, with TheMattEmpire suggesting it's currently an engine that could evolve into a platform with a hub connecting spaces
- Discussion about monetization as a way to incentivize creators to complete projects, with ash noting that server costs for 500 concurrent users shouldn't be an issue for quality experiences
- Community members suggested outreach to web3 gaming communities, noting the platform appears undervalued
- A GitHub repository was mentioned with a goal of reaching 200 stars before April

### Technical Improvements
- Ash fixed octree errors that improved performance, especially with particle systems and fire particles that were scaling to zero
- Ash resolved an engine issue related to a campfire object in Play.World that was preventing player movement
- Discussion about implementing URL parameters like "?clear-cache" and "?safemode=true" to help users recover from graphics settings issues

### Community Projects
- Shiffty created a Camera Manager app with multiple modes (Follow, Orbit, Static)
- Peezy developed an MCP (Mission Control Protocol) server for AI integration, allowing Claude/Cursor to interact with Hyperfy worlds
- TheMattEmpire showcased track/road pieces for a racing game, including Y-shaped intersections and split configurations
- BallisticBanana suggested adding pit lane elements with specific design features for racing tracks
- Vox proposed a cyberpunk-themed racing world collaboration

### Design & Asset Optimization
- Discussion about texture memory usage, with ash explaining that 24MB is normal for assets with three textures because textures get decompressed and uploaded to the GPU in raw format
- Conversation about AI-generated building facades with color matching to skyboxes for creating immersive environments
- ToxSam mentioned concerns about bone naming conventions and VRM compatibility for animation assets

## Key Questions & Answers

**Door Functionality in V1**
- Q: How do I make a door open and close with the same button in V1? (Paradoxx)
- A: Pretty sure you can do it all in one, but using two buttons might be simpler for implementation. (ash)

**Code Extraction**
- Q: Is there a way to extract the code from apps without having to open them in a v2 world? (Gert-Jan Akerboom)
- A: appTools.js in the engine shows how to do this. (ash)

**Web3 Gaming Guilds**
- Q: What's a web3 gaming guild? (smickelbeard)
- A: It's both a group of web3 game developers and players, but also investors in crypto gaming stuff. (rando1337 and peezy)

**Template Visibility**
- Q: Should I be using .active = false or .visible = false to hide templates I want to clone? (Cybernetic-O-Cult)
- A: .active works on everything, it essentially unmounts and disables. .visible is deprecated because it only worked on some things. (ash)

**Texture Memory Usage**
- Q: Does 24Mb sound like a lot for texture memory? It only has 3 textures on the asset. (TheMattEmpire)
- A: That sounds about right. It doesn't matter if you png crush your texture etc they all get decompressed and uploaded to the GPU in a raw format, which is much larger. (ash)

**Mobile Graphics Settings Issue**
- Q: I set the graphics on high on my mobile (iPhone).. now it reloads and breaks infinity loop.. but I can't manage to stay long enough to change the settings back down.. what do I do in this case? (vox)
- A: Clear storage just for that website would be ideal. (ash)

**Setting Spawn Points**
- Q: How do you set a spawn point? (0mka)
- A: Use "/spawn set" which sets it to where you are standing when you execute the command. (0mka)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Camera Manager App**
   - Shiffty created a reusable Camera Manager app with multiple modes (Follow, Orbit, Static) to solve the problem of repetitive camera code across different projects

2. **Script-Only Apps Workaround**
   - Peezy demonstrated a workaround using an empty GLB file to create script-only apps without requiring substantial 3D assets

3. **Mobile Graphics Recovery**
   - Ash helped vox recover from an infinite reload loop caused by setting graphics too high on iPhone, suggesting clearing website-specific cache

4. **Template Cloning Guidance**
   - Ash explained to Cybernetic-O-Cult that .visible is deprecated and suggested removing templates from the app and cloning them when needed instead of using .active = false

5. **Building Facade Technique**
   - Valiant explained to general hyper that AI-generated facades color-matched to skyboxes create more immersive environments

## Action Items

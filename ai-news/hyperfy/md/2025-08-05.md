# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-05

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Architecture
- **Server-Client Execution Model**: Clarification that Hyperfy scripts run simultaneously on both server and client sides, with server executing first on boot and clients running after receiving the initial snapshot. Developers need to use `world.isClient` and `world.isServer` conditionals to control execution context.
- **Material Linking System**: Discussion about how duplicated objects share materials by default, requiring the `linked = false` property to enable individual material modifications. This affects state management for duplicated interactive objects.
- **Server-Client Communication**: Explanation of event listeners for detecting when players enter or leave a world, enabling responsive applications.

### Applications & Projects
- **Music Player App**: A music player pulling playlists from Audius was discussed, with plans for trending categories and synchronized listening zones.
- **Confetti Popper**: Troubleshooting of a confetti popper implementation where state changes (hover/cooldown) were affecting all instances instead of individual objects.

### 3D Design & Optimization
- **Model Optimization**: Two-step process recommended: using gltf.report to reduce VRAM usage, followed by gltf-compressor for texture optimization. "Hypercompresser" was mentioned as a tool combining both functions.
- **World Structure**: The importance of world folder structure for backup/restore functionality was highlighted, along with automatic mesh optimization through linking.

### Strategic Discussions
- **Holographic Technology**: Natefrog explained that Hyperfy builds infrastructure layers (servers, networking, physics, social systems, creator tools) that would be enhanced rather than threatened by hologram technology.
- **Industry Trends**: Brief mentions of AI developments (DeepMind's Genie-3) and NFTs potentially making a comeback.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can the app still be updating if no one is in the world?**  
A: Code runs on both the server and the clients. The server is always running so you can have things like plants growing over time. (Ashxn)

**Q: Is it exemplified in the docs anywhere that code runs on server even without an isServer block?**  
A: Scripts execute on both server and clients, with server executing first on boot and clients running after receiving initial snapshot. (Ashxn)

**Q: Is there a way for the server to know when a client has left and stop doing something?**  
A: Yes, using `world.on('leave', e => {})` event listener on the server. (Ashxn)

**Q: Why do all my confetti poppers share the same state when I add multiple to the world?**  
A: Duplicated apps share the same materials by default. You need to set `mesh.linked = false` to make materials independent. (.hyp shaman, Valiant)

**Q: What is the role of Hyperfy in a world where holograms are a reality?**  
A: Hyperfy is building the infrastructure layer - the servers, networking, physics, social systems, and creator tools. Holograms are just another display technology. (Natefrog)

**Q: What machines is Genie-3 running on?**  
A: "Very very big ones that Google owns." (hiroP)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-23

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Progress
- **Vehicle Physics**: Ash shared progress on new physics for vehicles with a basic car implementation that's currently client-side but could be simulated server-side in the future.
- **Mob Systems**: Peezy demonstrated work on server-side mobs with weapon capabilities, discussing implementation challenges with multiple clones causing client crashes.
- **Race Track Components**: 0mka and Valiant collaborated on race track components including gates and waypoints for timing and anti-cheat measures.
- **Animation Workflows**: General Hyper shared a workflow for importing animations from Hyperfy, which required downloading GLBs from a specific site, importing them as VRMs to Blender, and deleting transforms on the hips.

### Project Direction & Token Concerns
- **Token Price Decline**: Community members expressed concern about a significant price dip after one wallet dumped approximately $10,000 worth of tokens.
- **Development Reassurance**: Ash provided reassurance about ongoing development efforts across multiple fronts: attracting content creators, building games internally, developing a Roblox-like platform, and continuing core engine work.
- **Team Changes**: It was mentioned that co-founder Saori has left the project, with ash mentioning burnout as the reason.

### Technical Limitations & Solutions
- **3D Model Importing**: Ash provided a solution for importing 3D models with collisions using an app that auto-enables collisions for models.
- **Texture Support**: KTX/Draco compression isn't yet supported on the server side, with webp recommended as an alternative.
- **URL Parameters**: Discussion about implementing URL parameters for spatial navigation in Hyperfy worlds (e.g., `play.hyperfy.xyz?x=5&y=5&z=5`).

### Upcoming Events & Education
- **Educational Series**: Session 6 on Git and GitHub is currently taking place, with future sessions planned on Architectural 3D design and Optimization.
- **Community Events**: Announcements about upcoming M3 Demo Day, Poly's Immersive Award show.
- **In-World Commerce Issues**: Community members mentioned issues with in-world commerce functionality, noting that stands weren't accepting payments.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: How resource intensive are the Lights in Hyperfy V1? (asked by Paradoxx)  
  **A**: Use 2-3 at maximum. Best is none. (answered by vox)

- **Q**: What is the player controller speed? (asked by general hyper)  
  **A**: Smickelbeard shared code showing running is twice as fast as walking (8 vs 4 * mass)

- **Q**: Is there a reason why PR #64 hasn't been merged? (asked by jin)  
  **A**: It was on a list of many things to do and needed to merge to dev branch (answered by ash)

- **Q**: When will elementals be available? (asked by peezy)  
  **A**: Soon, after completing the new world menu UI (answered by ash)

- **Q**: How can I link a user to a certain location in my Hyperfy world? (asked by general hyper)  
  **A**: You could use URL parameters like play.hyperfy.xyz?x=5&y=5&z=5 as an alternative to /spawn set (answered by general hyper)

### 3D Design & Assets
- **Q**: Does somebody know how to import collisions or a 3D model with collisions in a world? (asked by MiaHigashikata)  
  **A**: This app lets you auto-enable collisions for its model. Drop it in the world, click "Model" to choose your glb, and toggle collision on etc (answered by ash)

- **Q**: Is this still the case? We have been having problems with some textures and we have been wondering if it's the ktx texture support (asked by MiaHigashikata)  
  **A**: Yup no ktx/draco support yet because we haven't solved loading them on the server (answered by ash)

### Project Status
- **Q**: Why's the market cap so low now? What happened to it? (asked by chckyo)  
  **A**: Someone gave us a big sale on hyper! One wallet dumped 10k worth. (answered by 0mka)

- **Q**: What I'm curious about is the actual release and commercialization of real games? (asked by eigb)  
  **A**: Engines and games take time to finish. Check more channels than hyper to see what's happening. Roadmap updates are underway. (answered by 0mka)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Assistance
- **Valiant** helped **general hyper** by sharing a link to hyperfy-animations.vercel.app for Mixamo animations converted for Hyperfy.
- **Peezy** assisted **general hyper** by sharing a rifle script example that implements strafing for player movement animation overrides.
- **Smickelbeard** helped **ash** identify that commenting out onPress handler or break statement fixed an issue with mouseLeft.down not working.
- **General hyper** discovered and shared that animations needed to be "running in place" to work properly for animation synchronization.
- **Jin** updated PR #64 to target the dev branch instead after ash mentioned conflicts.

### 3D Design Support
- **Ash** helped **MiaHigashikata** with importing 3D models with collisions by suggesting an app that auto-enables collisions for models.
- **Ash** advised **MiaHigashikata** to use webp as an alternative to KTX for textures since KTX/Draco compression isn't supported yet on the server.
- **General hyper** shared a workflow for importing Hyperfy animations into Blender as VRMs, including the step to delete hip transforms for proper functionality.

### Community Guidance
- **0mka** helped **chckyo**, a non-native English speaker, by suggesting using auto-translate captions on YouTube videos and providing a specific video link to follow project updates.
- **Smickelbeard** assisted **Jayzen** by providing information about the project's founders and directing them to a specific channel for more details.

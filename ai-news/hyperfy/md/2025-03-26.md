# Hyperfy Development Report – 2025-03-26

## 1. Technical Discussions and Updates

### 1.1 Raycasting and Rigidbody Tagging
- Tags must be applied to the Rigidbody parent, not individual colliders, for raycasting to detect objects.
- Behavior is consistent across all apps.
- Pointer events (onPointerEnter/Down/Up) are supported on visual nodes like meshes.

### 1.2 Cross-App Raycasting
- Confirmed to function identically across apps.
- A demo is in development to showcase this behavior.

### 1.3 Authentication and Deployment
- Explored iframe-based authentication and session cookies.
- Proposed addition: `world.getQueryParams()` in Apps.js to read URL parameters.
- Fly.io deployment preserves world files when using `[[mounts]]`.

### 1.4 UI and Controller Enhancements
- Suggested UI improvements:
  - Slider for corner rounding
  - Consistent label formatting
- PR accepted to clean up UI inconsistencies.
- PhysX controllers have limited tag/contact support, affecting movement logic.

### 1.5 GIF and Media Optimization
- GIFs perform poorly in Hyperfy V1, especially at high resolutions.
- Recommended converting GIFs to MP4 for better performance in VR/mobile.
- Suggested tool: built-in GIF-to-video converter.

### 1.6 Model Exporting and Asset Tools
- Limitations in Hyperfy’s default exporter led to a custom batch exporter for Blender.
- Centralized .hyp object library requested; links shared to Discord thread and Hyperworld marketplace.

### 1.7 Material Rendering in Blender
- Blender materials are double-sided by default.
- To ensure single-sided rendering in Hyperfy, enable "Backface Culling" in Blender (v4.3+).

## 2. Community Engagement and Feedback

### 2.1 AI-Assisted Game Creation
- Encouraged for non-technical users in Hyperfy V2.
- Recommended starting with `app.configure` and using existing code examples.
- Documentation improvements are in progress.

### 2.2 Marketing and Visibility
- Suggestions to increase posting frequency on X (Twitter).
- Proposed sharing:
  - Daily updates
  - Community call summaries
  - Improved branding asset visibility
- Limited team bandwidth noted as a constraint.

### 2.3 Survey Form Bug
- Bug reported: optional fields marked as required.
- Issue was quickly fixed, demonstrating responsive UX support.

### 2.4 Token Transparency

# Hyperfy Discord - 2026-01-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Architecture
- **Hyperfy 2.0 Engine**: The new version uses a completely different engine from legacy v1, making direct world migration impossible
- **Architecture Design**: v1 was tightly integrated with the platform, while v2 offers more flexibility ("freedom")

### Development Infrastructure
- **Fly.io File System**: Discussion about Fly.io's temporary file system limitations, noting that data is lost when services shut down
- **Persistence Solutions**: Recommendation to use persistent volumes for data that needs to survive shutdowns

### Tools & Integrations
- **3D Modeling**: "Quad Filler" tool from SuperHive Market was shared to help speed up manual 3D modeling tasks
- **Agent Technology**: Implementation of an "eliza hyperfy plugin" with "openrouter" for agent-based interactions
- **Pull Request**: Positive mention of PR #147 in the hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy repository

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Are we able to copy paste a world from legacy to 2.0?**  
A: "Nope completely different engine. v1 was super intertwined with the platform itself, v2 is freedom." (answered by ash)

**Q: I am confused on how to get to the new platform and use it. Does it require a server?**  
A: "This is a good place to start: https://docs.hyperfy.xyz/welcome/quickstart/" (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)

**Q: How does Fly.io handle file storage?**  
A: Fly provides a temporary file system that disappears when the service shuts down; persistent volumes are needed for data that should survive shutdowns (answered by ash)

**Q: agent?**  
A: "yeeeee" (answered by .hyp shaman, who later clarified they used an "eliza hyperfy plugin" with "openrouter")

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **New User Onboarding**
   - Gert-Jan Akerboom helped Harambe Advocate understand how to access the new platform by providing documentation links
   - ash explained the technical differences between v1 and v2 engines to help set proper expectations about world migration

2. **Development Support**
   - ash provided guidance on Fly.io file persistence issues, recommending persistent volumes as a solution
   - Valiant shared a productivity tool (Quad Filler) to help community members speed up manual 3D modeling tasks

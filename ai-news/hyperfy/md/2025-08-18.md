# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-18

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI-Generated Primitives System
- **ash** showcased a significant new feature allowing users to create complex 3D scenes by describing them in natural language
- The AI generates primitive shapes (boxes, spheres, cylinders) with various colors and behaviors
- System includes support for animations, trigger zones, and interactive elements
- Technical achievement: Implemented instancing that groups objects by type and uses shaders for color
- Performance optimization reduced draw calls dramatically (from 1000 to 100 in one example)
- System can handle scenes with hundreds of thousands of primitives while maintaining performance (~3ms CPU time)
- Uses Sonnet 4 AI model for its balance of speed and design capabilities
- Outputs editable .hyp files that work in the latest dev build

### 3D Asset Management & Instancing
- Discussion about selecting, duplicating, and moving multiple assets simultaneously
- Linked duplicates in Blender are automatically instanced in Hyperfy
- Instancing works across nested objects ("everything instances")
- Hyperfy maintains efficient draw calls even across duplicated objects in-world
- Updated Blender addon from GitHub provides better results and supports LOD (Level of Detail)

### Project Management & Community
- Dispute regarding claims made by Twitter user saori_xbt about project funds and credit
- **ash** refuted allegations about purchasing a house with project funds
- Clarification that **ash** only received LP fees, not profits from NFTs
- Discussion about proper attribution of work on the project

## Key Questions & Answers

### AI Primitives
- **Q**: Is the AI generation with primitives inside latest dev? (**Gert-Jan Akerboom**)  
  **A**: It works on latest dev, might work on older versions but not optimally (**ash**)

- **Q**: Can the AI create moving objects like orbiting satellites or planes? (**vox**)  
  **A**: Yes, demonstrated with a plane example (**ash**)

- **Q**: Can it create interactive elements like tiled floors where tiles emit when stepped on? (**vox**)  
  **A**: Yes, the AI now knows how to do trigger zones (**ash**)

- **Q**: Will AI creations have frontend scripts and can we download them as .hyps? (**vox**)  
  **A**: Yes, they create hyp files that can be edited (**ash**)

- **Q**: How many colors does the AI system currently use? (**vox**)  
  **A**: Infinite - it writes colors it likes (**ash**)

### 3D Design & Instancing
- **Q**: Is there any way to select a bunch of assets in world to duplicate and/or move it all around at one time? (**TheMattEmpire**)  
  **A**: No, that's tough but something I want to tackle (**ash**)

- **Q**: Does the Hyperfy Tools addon export linked assets...or how are instances exported from Blender? (**TheMattEmpire**)  
  **A**: Everything is automatically instanced as long as in blender you create "linked duplicates" not just regular duplicates (**ash**)

- **Q**: If I make the building in Blender with instanced parts, put that in world, then instance the building...would the parts be instanced per building, or all instances would be instanced? (**TheMattEmpire**)  
  **A**: Everything instances (**ash**)

### Vehicle & Player Mechanics
- **Q**: How can I make my ride/vehicle be recognized when crossing race triggers? (**Valiant**)  
  **A**: Player collision is disabled when anchored, you have to track the moving vehicle instead (**hyp shaman**)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Vehicle Collision Detection**
   - **Helper**: .hyp shaman
   - **Helpee**: Valiant
   - **Context**: Player collision not being detected when riding vehicles in race track
   - **Resolution**: Explained that player collision is disabled when anchored, suggested tracking the vehicle instead

2. **AI Primitive Generation Capabilities**
   - **Helper**: ash
   - **Helpee**: vox
   - **Context**: Questions about AI primitive generation capabilities
   - **Resolution**: Demonstrated with examples including a plane .hyp file and explained how the system works with instancing

3. **Blender Instancing for Hyperfy**
   - **Helper**: ash
   - **Helpee**: TheMattEmpire
   - **Context**: Needed clarification on how to properly use instancing in Blender for Hyperfy
   - **Resolution**: Provided link to updated GitHub addon and explained that linked duplicates in Blender automatically instance in Hyperfy

## Action Items

### Technical
- Fix issue with plane .hyp file disappearing after world reload (**Gert-Jan Akerboom**)
- Optimize AI primitive generation to reduce draw calls further (**ash**)
- Complete runescape-style movement controller (point-to-click navigation) (**shaw**)
- Implement multi-object selection, duplication, and movement functionality (**TheMattEmpire**)
- Create a hierarchy/outliner tool similar to Blender/Unity (**TheMattEmpire**)
- Develop unified method for vehicle racing that works with player-owned vehicles (**Valiant**)
- Continue development of Hyperfy product (**ash**)

### Feature
- Implement voice prompting for AI generation in VR (**ash**)
- Consider allowing users to use their own API keys and AI models of choice (**Shiffty**)

### Documentation
- Update documentation on instancing behavior with nested objects (**TheMattEmpire**)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-18

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI-Generated Content
- Ash is working on AI-generated world building using primitives
- Spent approximately $5 on various AI models (OpenAI and Anthropic)
- Sonnet 4 offers the best balance of speed and design capabilities
- Implementing optimizations to group objects by type and use shaders for colors
- These optimizations should reduce CPU usage from ~8ms to ~3ms in a world with 400 AI-created objects
- Potential collaborative world-building features where users might use their own API keys

### Asset Management & Instancing
- Discussion about selecting, duplicating, and moving multiple assets simultaneously
- Linked duplicates in Blender are automatically instanced in Hyperfy
- Instancing allows for efficient rendering (single draw call) even with multiple duplicates
- LOD support is available through empty objects in the scene
- The updated Blender addon from GitHub provides better results

### Vehicle Physics & Racing
- Player collision is disabled when anchored to vehicles
- For race checkpoints, developers need to track the vehicle itself rather than the player
- This creates challenges for race detection when players bring their own vehicles

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there any way to select a bunch of assets in world to duplicate and/or move them all at once?**  
A: No, that functionality isn't currently available but is planned for future development. (answered by ash)

**Q: How can I make a vehicle be recognized as the player when crossing race checkpoints?**  
A: Player collision is disabled when anchored; you have to track the moving vehicle instead. (answered by .hyp shaman)

**Q: Does the Hyperfy Tools addon export linked assets...or how are instances exported from Blender?**  
A: Everything is automatically instanced as long as in Blender you create "linked duplicates" not just regular duplicates as those are completely unique meshes. (answered by ash)

**Q: If I make the building in Blender with instanced parts, put that in world, then instance the building...would the parts be instanced per building, or all instances would be instanced?**  
A: Everything instances. (answered by ash)

**Q: Does the addon support LODs yet?**  
A: Yes, it has LODs. Add an empty to the scene. (answered by ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **.hyp shaman helped Valiant** with race checkpoint detection, explaining that player collision is disabled when anchored to vehicles, so the solution is to track the vehicle movement instead
- **ash helped TheMattEmpire** with understanding instancing between Blender and Hyperfy, explaining that linked duplicates in Blender automatically instance in Hyperfy for efficient rendering
- **ash provided TheMattEmpire** with a GitHub link to the latest version of the Blender addon

## Action Items

### Technical
- Implement multi-asset selection, duplication, and movement functionality (mentioned by ash)
- Implement a unified method for vehicle race detection so players can bring their own vehicles to race meets (mentioned by Valiant)
- Optimize AI-generated worlds by grouping objects by type and using shaders for colors to reduce CPU usage (mentioned by ash)
- Create buildings with linked assets in Blender for efficient instancing in Hyperfy (mentioned by TheMattEmpire)

### Feature
- Consider an event where worlds are built purely through AI prompting (mentioned by ash)
- Allow users to use their own API keys and AI models for collaborative world building (mentioned by Shiffty)
- Add outliner/hierarchy similar to Blender/Unity to manage and select multiple objects at once (mentioned by TheMattEmpire)

### Documentation
- Create guide for LOD implementation using empty objects in the Blender addon (mentioned by ash)

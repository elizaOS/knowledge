# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-15

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **Hyperfy v2 Development**: The team is actively building v2 as an open-source metaverse platform, with parts available for technical users while a more accessible version for non-technical users is expected within weeks.
- **Performance Improvements**: Ashxn fixed a critical bug where models with morph targets caused 100% CPU usage and crashes. V2 offers significant performance improvements over V1.
- **In-World Development**: V2 allows coding while in the world multiplayer rather than requiring local SDK development, making it more accessible.
- **Hosting Solutions**: Discussions about self-hosted vs. official hosting options, with the team planning to offer both approaches to accommodate different user needs.

### Technical Features
- **Drone Script Implementation**: A new drone script demonstrates interaction nodes, networking state, events, and camera/keyboard control capabilities.
- **AI Integration**: The team is working on implementing embodied AI agents that go beyond simple chatbots, aiming to create multiplayer-aware agents that can interact with users and each other.
- **3D Asset Management**: The platform now supports drag-and-drop of GLB files (limited to 16MB in test worlds), with shift+mouse movement enabling vertical positioning of objects.
- **Environment Variables**: The v0.3.0 release includes improvements to saving functionality and environment variables.

### 3D Design & Creation
- **AI-Assisted 3D Generation**: Users discussed tools like Meshy3D for AI texturing and Stability AI's point-aware 3D model in ComfyUI.
- **Model Optimization**: Techniques shared include using Quad Remesher in Blender and focusing on edge flow in low-poly modeling.
- **Workflow Approaches**: Some users start with Luma for 3D templates before creating low-poly versions in Blender.

### Token & Economics
- **$HYPER Token Utility**: The team is cautious about revealing specific plans to prevent competitors from copying features, but confirmed the token will be used for DAO governance, world creation services, and potentially in-world economies.
- **Token Distribution**: 10.9% of tokens remain unclaimed, with 30% allocated to the DAO and 15% to the team (vested over 3 years linear, with no team members having touched their allocation yet).

## Key Questions & Answers

### Platform & Development
- **Q**: How do I update my Hyperfy v2 installation?  
  **A**: `git pull, npm run build, pm2 restart all` (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Where can I find documentation for the scripting API?  
  **A**: https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy/tree/main/docs (MetaMike)

- **Q**: When will V2 launch?  
  **A**: Few weeks maybe, possibly sooner (Uuuuuuuuu)

- **Q**: What are the recommended specs for the server to run a V2 world smoothly?  
  **A**: The free-build world has 2GB of RAM but 1GB is fine for basic stuff (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How many people can be in the same world?  
  **A**: 100, but it's bad for performance with V1. Haunted house is set to single player (𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)

### Technical Features
- **Q**: Can we NFT gate a metaverse on hyperfy?  
  **A**: Yes, plugins for different chains will be available (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do I apply code to an object?  
  **A**: Use the editor and ctrl+s to save (Saori)

- **Q**: How do I move objects up and down in the world?  
  **A**: Hold shift and move the mouse (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is it strictly 16MB GLB files I can drag in?  
  **A**: Yes, it's set to 16MB for this free build world, and we'll add drag and drop images eventually (Ashxn)

### 3D Design
- **Q**: What models do you use for 3D stuff?  
  **A**: I use Luma to lay out 3D templates then I make them in Low poly in Blender. Edgeflow is the most important thing to me. (scoe)

- **Q**: Is there a way to control tris?  
  **A**: Decimate modifier (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Does anyone happen to have a good Animation for a Character of like "Lying Down"?  
  **A**: Mixamo has a ton if that works? https://www.mixamo.com/#/?page=1&query=lying+down&type=Motion%2CMotionPack (TheMattEmpire)

### Token & Economics
- **Q**: What is the utility of the token in the Hyperfy ecosystem?  
  **A**: Not fully disclosed yet for strategic reasons, but will involve DAO governance and service utilization (Saori)

- **Q**: What percentage of tokens are unclaimed?  
  **A**: 10.9% unclaimed, 30% DAO, 15% team vested 3-year linear but nobody has touched their allocation yet (Saori)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Server Setup & Troubleshooting
- **vincentskele** helped **Unchained Ninja** set up a Hyperfy server on DigitalOcean, successfully getting the server running.
- **Ashxn** assisted **vincentskele** in fixing a broken world after git pull by identifying missing environment variables from updated .env.example.
- **HPrivakos** helped **hiroP** track down a wayward drone in the database, identifying that drone position is stored in the entities table's data field as JSON.
- **Ashxn** helped **MetaMike** resolve an error with process.env.PUBLIC_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE by identifying a missing environment variable and the need to run npm build.

### Platform Access & Onboarding
- **maximus** added **Uuuuuuuuu** to a V1 world accessible through hyperfy.io when they needed access to build.
- **merk** provided **dooberthefifth** with the GitHub link and advised on security precautions when they wanted to understand how to get started with Hyperfy.
- **maximus** explained to **rektrob** that V1 worlds are now relics and V2 is being rebuilt for developers when they asked what to do with their NFT worlds.

### Technical Assistance

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-15

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy v2 Development
- **v2 Platform Status**: Currently available for technical developers through GitHub, with a more accessible version for non-technical users expected in the coming weeks
- **Version 0.3.0 Released**: Includes improvements to saving functionality and environment variables
- **Self-Hosting Model**: Users can run worlds locally or on servers (DigitalOcean, Replit), with potential managed hosting services being considered
- **Docker Support**: Being added through community contributions
- **Performance**: Worlds can handle up to 100 users, though performance optimization is ongoing

### Technical Features
- **Scripting API**: Ashxn released documentation and example code for app scripting
- **Drone Script Example**: Demonstrates interaction nodes, networking state, events, and camera/keyboard control
- **AI Integration**: ElizaOS AI agent framework works out-of-the-box, with focus on creating embodied agents beyond simple chatbots
- **Asset Management**: Platform supports drag-and-drop of GLB files (up to 16MB), with image support coming
- **Cross-Chain Support**: Integration with various blockchains (anything EVM-compatible should be easy)
- **Avatar Support**: Plans to implement MML format for NFT avatars like Bored Apes

### 3D Design & Optimization
- **Asset Optimization**: Discussions about polygon count reduction, using Quad Remesher in Blender
- **AI-Assisted 3D Generation**: Users sharing experiences with Meshy3D, Luma, and Stability AI's point-aware 3D model in ComfyUI
- **Model Workflow**: Scoe mentioned using Luma for 3D templates before creating low-poly versions in Blender
- **Optimization Standards**: Community discussing best practices for 3D assets to ensure good performance

### Token & Ecosystem
- **$HYPER Token**: Currently valued around $0.15, with discussions about its utility in the ecosystem
- **Token Distribution**: About 50%+ of tokens are not circulating (10.9% unclaimed, 30% DAO, 15% team vested over 3 years)
- **Potential Use Cases**: Community speculates about DAO governance, world creation services, and in-world economies

## Key Questions & Answers

### Platform & Development
- **Q**: How can I get started on the platform?  
  **A**: You can serve up an instance locally using the GitHub repository, or wait for V2 to be public in a few weeks

- **Q**: When will V2 be released?  
  **A**: In a few weeks, possibly sooner

- **Q**: What are the recommended specs for running a V2 world server?  
  **A**: 1GB of RAM is fine for basic stuff, the free-build world has 2GB

- **Q**: How do I upgrade my Hyperfy installation?  
  **A**: git pull, npm run build, pm2 restart all

- **Q**: Can we run worlds on replit?  
  **A**: Yes, it works well

- **Q**: What's the difference between V1 and V2?  
  **A**: V2 is more performant and allows coding while in the world, multiplayer rather than needing to run SDK locally

### Technical Features
- **Q**: Can we NFT gate a metaverse on hyperfy?  
  **A**: Yes, plugins for different chains will be available

- **Q**: What technology skill set is required to build out a AAA world?  
  **A**: Blender for custom models, otherwise drag/drop models and add scripts

- **Q**: How do I apply code to an object?  
  **A**: Use ctrl + s to save the code

- **Q**: Is it strictly 16mb glb files I can drag in?  
  **A**: Yes, it's set to 16MB for this free build world, and they'll add drag and drop images eventually

- **Q**: How do I move stuff up and down? Can only rotate.  
  **A**: Hold shift and move the mouse

- **Q**: Is it expected behavior that if you copy a model then apply a script to one, that script applies to all copies?  
  **A**: Yes, but there is an unlink button that lets you decouple

### Token & Business
- **Q**: What is the utility of the token in the Hyperfy ecosystem?  
  **A**: Not fully disclosed for strategic reasons to prevent competitors from copying their ideas

- **Q**: What's the circulating market cap?  
  **A**: About 50%+ of tokens are not circulating: 10.9% unclaimed, 30% DAO, 15% team vested over 3 years

- **Q**: How difficult would it be to integrate Hyperfy with Berachain?  
  **A**: Anything EVM should be easy

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Support
- **vincentskele** helped **Unchained Ninja** get started with Hyperfy v2, offering to help set up a server either locally or with DigitalOcean

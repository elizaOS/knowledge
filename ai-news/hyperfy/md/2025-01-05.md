# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-05

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### $HYPER Token Launch
- The $HYPER token launched on Solana with significant interest, reaching approximately 200-300M market cap on the first day
- Tokenomics breakdown: 30% for world holders, 20% for DAO, 20% for liquidity, 20% for founders (vested over 3 years), 5% for ai16z partners, and 5% for marketing
- Claim process requires linking ETH wallets to SOL wallets at hyperfy.io/airdrop, then claiming at hyperfy.xyz/claim
- Eligibility includes ETH NFT world holders (snapshot Dec 7th) and ai16z partners with 100k+ tokens
- The official contract address is: 8vBMibwpn8wpfYKbQ9xqzodymg3LjmYec2tSNGRy23K8

### Platform Evolution (v1 to v2)
- Hyperfy is transitioning from v1 (NFT-gated) to v2 (more open and permissionless)
- v1 worlds will continue to function on hyperfy.io while v2 will operate on hyperfy.xyz
- v1 worlds cannot migrate to v2 but will remain supported
- There are plans to open-source the platform, with developers mentioning "giving human race a gift of the ages"

### Technical Development Issues
- A user encountered an error with Math.random() in secure mode that prevented world access
- Developers discussed implementing random avatar assignment for non-connected users
- 3D model bone hierarchy issues were identified where animations connect to hip instead of root bone
- Some Mixamo emotes exhibit animation problems while others don't, making troubleshooting difficult

## Key Questions & Answers

### Token & Claiming
**Q: What is the correct contract address for $HYPER?**  
A: 8vBMibwpn8wpfYKbQ9xqzodymg3LjmYec2tSNGRy23K8

**Q: Who is eligible for the airdrop/claim?**

**Q: How many tokens do you get per world NFT?**  
A: Around 150,000 tokens per world

**Q: Is there a deadline to register for the claim?**  
A: The original deadline was January 7th, but it has been extended as it's now a claim process rather than an airdrop

**Q: Is the liquidity locked?**  
A: Yes, it's locked in the lowest fee pool

### Development & Technical
**Q: How can I implement random avatar assignment for non-connected users?**

**Q: Has anyone ever written a Hyperfy tutorial that includes some REACT basics (specific to the platform)?**  
A: Jin and knarr started work on documentation that might help: https://github.com/madjin/hyperfy-docs/blob/main/docs/developers/quick-start.md

**Q: What might be causing animations to connect to hip instead of root bone in Hyperfy?**  
A: It could be related to how Hyperfy interprets bone hierarchies, especially with complex rigs or custom bones

A: Yes, v1 worlds will continue to work on hyperfy.io

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Development Assistance
- **Ashxn** fixed a Math.random() error in secure mode that prevented a user from accessing their world
- **Ashxn** added a pre-built "Avatars" app to a user's world that handles random assignment of 3 VRMs for non-connected users
- **JUAN** analyzed GLB files for **ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì** to troubleshoot bone hierarchy issues, suggesting potential solutions with retargeting tools

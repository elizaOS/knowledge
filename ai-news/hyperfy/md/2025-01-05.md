# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-05

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### $HYPER Token Launch
- Hyperfy launched $HYPER token on Solana with claims available to ETH NFT world holders (snapshot from December 7) and ai16z partners with 100k tokens
- The claim process requires linking ETH wallets to SOL wallets at hyperfy.io/airdrop, then claiming at hyperfy.xyz/claim
- Tokenomics include 30% for world holders, 20% for team (vested over 3 years), 20% for liquidity, and 30% for DAO
- The token reached approximately 200-300M market cap within 24 hours of launch
- Each eligible world holder receives 150,000 tokens (worth approximately $20k+ at current prices)
- Liquidity is locked in Raydium but doesn't show up correctly on Dexscreener

### Hyperfy v1 to v2 Transition
- Hyperfy is transitioning from v1 (NFT-gated) to v2 (open and permissionless)
- V1 worlds will continue to function on hyperfy.io while v2 will launch on hyperfy.xyz
- V2 will be open source, removing the NFT gating that existed in v1
- The team emphasized that buying v1 NFTs now won't qualify for airdrops and isn't recommended for speculation
- There's no migration path from v1 to v2 worlds; they will remain separate

### Development Challenges
- Several developers encountered technical issues in the platform:
  - Math.random() errors in secure mode preventing world access
  - Bone hierarchy issues in 3D models causing animation problems
  - Challenges implementing random avatar assignment for non-connected users
- Developers discussed the extensive scripting possibilities with the React SDK and expressed excitement about Hyperfy 2.0

## Key Questions & Answers

### Token & Airdrop
**Q: What is the correct contract address for $HYPER?**

A: The original deadline was January 7, but it's been extended as it's now a claim process

**Q: Why does my wallet show as "not eligible" after registration?**  
A: Registration data must be manually transferred to the claim site by the dev team, which can take up to 24 hours

**Q: What if I held my NFT in a smart wallet (Argent/Gnosis Safe)?**  
A: This is a special case the team will need to address

### Development
**Q: How can I implement random avatar assignment for non-connected users?**

**Q: Has anyone written a Hyperfy tutorial that includes React basics specific to the platform?**  
A: Jin and knarr started work on documentation that might help: https://github.com/madjin/hyperfy-docs/blob/main/docs/developers/quick-start.md

**Q: What might be causing animations to connect to hip instead of root in Hyperfy?**  
A: It could be related to how Hyperfy interprets bone hierarchies, especially with complex rigs or non-standard hierarchies

**Q: Why are there two different domains (hyperfy.io and hyperfy.xyz)?**  
A: hyperfy.io is for v1 worlds, hyperfy.xyz is for v2

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Token Claim Support

- **Browser Compatibility**: KronosLuxx identified that Brave browser prevents reconnecting with ETH address and suggested using Chrome instead
- **MetaMask Connection**: TropixMusic provided step-by-step instructions for clearing cache to resolve MetaMask connection issues

### Development Assistance
- **Math.random() Error**: Ashxn helped yung_algorithm fix a TypeError with Math.random() in secure mode that was preventing access to their world
- **Random Avatar Assignment**: Ashxn added a pre-built "Avatars" app to yung_algorithm's world that handles random assignment of 3 VRMs
- **3D Model Conversion**: Whambammy⚡ helped Saori by converting a GLB model to VRM format, though there were some texture issues

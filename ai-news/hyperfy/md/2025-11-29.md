# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-29

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Licensing & Legal
- **GPL-3 License Clarification**: Ash provided detailed explanation of how GPL-3 applies to the Hyperfy v2 engine. While engine modifications must remain open-source, apps added via the UI interface are not subject to the same restrictions.
- **License Enforcement Philosophy**: Ash clarified that GPL-3 is primarily used to prevent profit from forked versions with substantial improvements that should have been contributed back to the main repository. Enforcement would only occur in cases of significant profit from valuable improvements.

### Technical Issues
- **Deployment Challenges**: A user reported difficulties setting up a Hyperfy world on a DigitalOcean droplet, encountering build errors related to esbuild service stopping on Node.js v22.11.0.
- **Node.js Compatibility**: Issues with Node.js v22.11.0 were mentioned, including deprecation warnings for fs.Stats constructor.

### Development Workflows
- Brief discussion about coding workflows for Hyperfy, with minimal guidance provided.

### Agents
- A user inquired about examples of live agents in .xyz worlds or .hyp environments, specifically referencing an example by drdoge.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: When someone mods this engine, the result has to stay open-source, right? However, Apps which can be added via the UI interface, those can remain closed-source, if required?**  
A: Under GPL-3, which Hyperfy v2 engine uses, engine modifications must remain open-source. The license doesn't apply to apps as they aren't part of the codebase the license covers.

**Q: What's the main reason for using GPL-3 license?**  
A: The main reason is to deter people from making profit off a fork that has nice improvements that should have been PR'd back into the main repository.

**Q: What's everyone's workflow when trying to vibe code on top of hyperfy?**  
A: `/create` (minimal response provided)

**Q: How can I fix the esbuild error when setting up Hyperfy on a DigitalOcean droplet?**  
A: No direct solution was provided, though a suggestion to try local setup first was made.

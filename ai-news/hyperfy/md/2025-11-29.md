# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-29

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Licensing & Open Source
- **GPL-3 License Clarification**: Ash explained that the Hyperfy v2 engine uses GPL-3, which requires modifications to the engine itself to remain open-source, while apps added via the UI interface are not subject to these license restrictions.
- **License Enforcement Philosophy**: Hyperfy team would only enforce license rights if someone was making substantial profit from a fork with valuable improvements that should have been contributed back to the main repository.
- **Reasoning Behind GPL-3**: The license was specifically chosen to ensure that significant improvements to the codebase would benefit the entire community rather than allowing forks to profit from improvements without sharing them back.

### Development Workflows
- A community member inquired about workflows for developing code on Hyperfy, though this question remained unanswered in the observed timeframe.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: When someone mods this engine, the result has to stay open-source, right? However, Apps which can be added via the UI interface, those can remain closed-source, if required?**  
*Asked by Ozymandias*  
**A:** "Under GPL-3, which Hyperfy v2 engine is, that seems correct." - HypPrivakos  
"License doesn't apply to apps, those aren't part of the codebase the license is for." - Ash

**Q: Why was GPL-3 chosen as the license?**  
*Implied question*  
**A:** "The main reason it has this license is to deter people from making profit off a fork that has nice improvements that should have been PR'd back into our repo." - Ash

**Q: What's everyone's workflow when trying to vibe code on top of Hyperfy?**  
*Asked by emotionull*  
**A:** No response recorded in this summary period.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **License Clarification**: HypPrivakos and Ash both helped Ozymandias understand the licensing implications for the Hyperfy v2 engine, with Ash providing additional context about the reasoning behind using GPL-3 and how it applies specifically to engine modifications versus apps.

## Action Items

### Documentation
- **Licensing Documentation**: Consider creating clear documentation about licensing implications for engine modifications vs. apps *(Implied from Ozymandias' question)*

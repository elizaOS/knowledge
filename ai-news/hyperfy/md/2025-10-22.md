# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-22

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Dragon-Shooting Game**: Gert-Jan Akerboom shared progress on a dragon-shooting game mechanic where users can fire cannonballs using the "o" key. The basic functionality is working, though development continues.
- **Omarchy Integration**: HowieDuhzit created a pull request (#2726) to incorporate Hyperfy directly into Omarchy (a Linux-based tool) by default and promoted this integration on Twitter.
- **Terminal Tools**: HowieDuhzit recommended Warp, a terminal tool that simplifies Linux command execution through natural language instructions, which Dhin confirmed was "awesome."

### Project Status & Token Discussion
- **$HYPER Token Concerns**: Some users expressed frustration about the token's declining value, prompting a detailed defense of the project.
- **Tokenomics Clarification**: A community member explained that while the token price is disappointing, the tokenomics are solid with healthy allocations (team, liquidity, 10% burned from unclaimed airdrop tokens, 30% for DAO).
- **Development Philosophy**: The integration of the token with marketplace and world-building features is being developed carefully rather than rushed, with reference to the Hyperfy Litepaper for the project's vision.

- **Metaverse Implementation Challenges**: Agent12 shared experiences implementing NFTs in platforms like NEOS (now Resonite) and Upstreet (now defunct), expressing frustration about current limitations in Hyperfy's blockchain integration.
- **3D Exhibition**: Valiant shared information about a live 3D exhibition accessible via a Hyperworld host URL.

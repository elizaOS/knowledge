# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-28

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI Integration & Content Creation
- **GPT-5 for 3D Modeling**: Dhin created Star Wars AT-T models for "vibe world" using GPT-5, reporting it performed significantly better than other AI models despite being slower. They used high reasoning level settings with multiple iterations.
- **Collaborative AI Development**: Users enhanced a dragon in "playworld" by adding fire and flight capabilities through AI prompts rather than manual coding.
- **AI-Generated Games**: A working networked flash memory game was created in "vibe world" through AI prompts alone.
- **Custom AI Integration**: Ash provided guidance on integrating additional AI models into Hyperfy by modifying the ServerAI.js file.

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Network Connectivity Issues**: Several users reported disconnection problems when accessing Hyperfy worlds.
- **Server Location**: Servers are currently located in France, with plans to expand hosting options.
- **Reconnection Design**: Hyperfy uses a manual reconnect button rather than auto-reconnect functionality because the networking is based on an initial state snapshot with delta updates.

### Partnerships & Discovery
- Several users mentioned discovering Hyperfy through Project89's partnership.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Where are the servers located?** (asked by vox)  
**A:** "France (looking to get other servers to provide options to people to host elsewhere)" (answered by HypPrivakos)

**Q: Is there a reason for not having an auto reconnect in Hyperfy?** (asked by HypPrivakos)  
**A:** "Auto reconnect is the same as refreshing. Since all networking is based on an initial snapshot of state and then delta updates, the only way to resume from a disconnect is to restart essentially." (answered by ash)

**Q: Who made the star wars ATT stuff in vibe world?** (asked by ash)  
**A:** "I did the star wars stuff. Was testing out different AIs. GPT-5 was best by a fair margin for me." (answered by Dhin)

**Q: What reasoning level did you use?** (asked by ash)  
**A:** "High reasoning" (answered by Dhin)

**Q: Can we already plug in kimi k2 or deepseek 3.1 from comput3?** (asked by Reneil)  
**A:** "Not built in but its easy to add your own at the bottom of this file: https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy/blob/dev/src/core/systems/ServerAI.js" (answered by ash)

**Q: How do you do the edits?** (asked by Gh0stt)  
**A:** "/edit an edit" (answered by .hyp shaman)

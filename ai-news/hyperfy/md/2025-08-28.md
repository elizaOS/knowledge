# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-28

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI Integration & World Building
- **Vibe World Collaboration**: Users are actively building upon each other's work in the "vibe world," creating features like dragons with fire effects, flash memory games, and "squid games" with randomized colliders.
- **AI Model Performance**: Dhin reported using GPT-5 with high reasoning level for Star Wars-themed assets, noting it was effective but slower than other options.
- **Custom AI Integration**: Ash shared that additional AI models can be integrated by modifying the ServerAI.js file in the Hyperfy GitHub repository.
- **Content Generation Pipeline**: Marcel discussed creating nano banana thumbnails for a radio and his custom pipeline for generating podcast-like content from code repository updates.

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Network Connectivity Issues**: Users discussed troubleshooting disconnection problems, with one user resolving issues by switching to a 5G network.
- **Reconnection Mechanics**: Ash explained that Hyperfy doesn't implement auto-reconnect because networking is based on initial state snapshots with delta updates, making reconnection equivalent to refreshing.
- **Server Locations**: HypPrivakos confirmed that hyperworld.host servers are located in France, with plans to expand to other locations.

### Community & Governance
- **Token-Based Systems**: Discussion about implementing token-gated build permissions and voting mechanisms for community curation of AI-generated content.
- **Open-Source Collaboration**: Users expressed enthusiasm about the intersection of open-source worlds, AI game modifications, and blockchain technologies.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Where are the hyperworld.host servers located?**  
A: France, with plans to add servers in other locations to provide more hosting options. (HypPrivakos)

**Q: Is there a reason for not having an auto reconnect in Hyperfy?**  
A: Auto reconnect is the same as refreshing. Since all networking is based on an initial snapshot of state and then delta updates, the only way to resume from a disconnect is to restart essentially. (ash)

**Q: How do you make edits in the world?**  
A: Use `/edit an edit` command while pointing at the object you want to edit. (hyp shaman & Gert-Jan Akerboom)

**Q: Who made the Star Wars ATT stuff in vibe world?**  
A: "I did the Star Wars stuff. Was testing out different AIs. GPT-5 was best by a fair margin for me." (Dhin)

**Q: Can we already plug in kimi k2 or deepseek 3.1 from comput3?**  
A: "Not built in but it's easy to add your own at the bottom of this file: https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy/blob/dev/src/core/systems/ServerAI.js" (ash)

**Q: Are you using an OS pipeline (info gathering -> audio file) to generate this or did you roll your own?**  
A: "Rolled my own. Not that hard if you did something like this before + have some AI to write fast." (marcel 🌵)

## Action Items

### Technical
- Investigate network connectivity issues causing immediate disconnections (mentioned by vox)
- Integrate additional AI models (kimi k2, deepseek 3.1) into Hyperfy by updating ServerAI.js (mentioned by Reneil)
- Update Comput3 AI integration which may need refreshing (mentioned by ash)

### Feature Requests
- Implement FPS games functionality in Hyperfy (mentioned by Xukonth)
- Add prompt to code for moving objects to make editing easier (mentioned by Gert-Jan Akerboom)
- Create visual indicator for generating content with different colors when content is still generating from prompts (mentioned by Gert-Jan Akerboom)
- Add fallen mechanics to Vibe World to implement falling physics (mentioned by johan)
- Implement token-gated build permissions for "Meme-Worlds" where editing permissions are controlled by token possession (mentioned by Agent12)
- Develop AI x Human asynchronous world building with token voting to allow users to vote with tokens on AI-generated content (mentioned by Agent12)

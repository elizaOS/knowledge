# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Tools & Features
- **Debug Dashboard & Hyp Bundler**: 3rdEyeVisuals shared progress on development tools, successfully generating a .hyp bundle that was imported as an in-world app
- **NFT Holder Scanner**: ðŸ†‚ðŸ…´ðŸ…±ðŸ…¶ðŸ…° announced a new tool that tracks NFT holders across Ethereum, Polygon, and Optimism networks, requiring only a contract address and Alchemy API key
- **Remote 3D Model Loading**: Ash shared an experimental but stable method using `world.load()` function with a URL parameter to load 3D models from remote sources

### 3D Asset Generation
- Discussion about 3D model generators, with 3rdEyeVisuals expressing plans to set up a pipeline for local inference using the Hunyuan model for in-world 3D asset generation
- Ash mentioned experience with both open source and closed source 3D model generators

### Community Interaction
- Brief morning greetings exchanged between johan, Fibelius, 3rdEyeVisuals, and .hyp shaman in the general channel

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there an effective way to increase UI resolution?**  
*Asked by: 3rdEyeVisuals*  
A: (Unanswered)

**Q: Have you experimented with open source 3D model generators or are you using API keys to popular closed models?**  
*Asked by: 3rdEyeVisuals*  
A: "I played around with a bunch of both open source and closed source ones." *(ash)*

**Q: How to fix VRM upload error in Hyperfy 1?**  
*Asked by: Fredm*  
A: "Could be anything hehe. There are a few VRM validator/tester tools online, maybe try something like this: https://vrm-validator.fern.solutions/" *(ash)*

**Q: Can we load 3D models from remote URLs?**  
*Asked by: (Implied from conversation)*  
A: "You can use `world.load(url)` which returns a promise that resolves to a root object that you can add to your app. It's experimental but stable and unlikely to change." *(ash)*

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **VRM File Troubleshooting**: Ash helped Fredm with VRM file upload issues by suggesting online validator tools
- **Remote Asset Loading**: Ash shared experimental functionality with TheMattEmpire and 3rdEyeVisuals who were both interested in loading remote 3D models
- **3D Model Generation**: Brief knowledge sharing about different 3D model generation approaches between ash and 3rdEyeVisuals

## Action Items

### Technical
- **Debug Dashboard development**: Create debugging interface for performance monitoring *(Mentioned by: 3rdEyeVisuals)*
- **Hyp Bundler development**: Continue work on tool for generating .hyp bundles that can be imported as in-world apps *(Mentioned by: 3rdEyeVisuals)*
- **Local 3D asset generation pipeline**: Set up system for using Hunyuan model for local inference and dynamic 3D asset generation *(Mentioned by: 3rdEyeVisuals)*
- **Remote model loading implementation**: 3rdEyeVisuals to implement and share progress on remote 3D model loading functionality *(Mentioned by: 3rdEyeVisuals)*

### Feature
- **NFT Holder Scanner tool**: Tool to track NFT holders across Ethereum, Polygon, and Optimism networks *(Mentioned by: ðŸ†‚ðŸ…´ðŸ…±ðŸ…¶ðŸ…°)*

### Documentation
- **Remote asset loading**: Consider documenting the experimental `world.load(url)` function if usage increases *(Implied from ash's comments)*

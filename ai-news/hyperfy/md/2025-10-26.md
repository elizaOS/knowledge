# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Tools & Technical Implementations
- **Debug Dashboard & Hyp Bundler**: 3rdEyeVisuals shared progress on their Debug Dashboard and Hyp Bundler tools, successfully generating a .hyp bundle that was imported as an in-world app.
- **Remote 3D Model Loading**: Ash shared an experimental but stable method for loading 3D models from remote URLs using `world.load('model', 'https://...glb')`, which returns a promise with the root object.
- **NFT Holder Scanner**: 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰 announced a new tool for tracking NFT holders across Ethereum, Polygon, and Optimism networks.

### 3D Asset Generation & Management
- **3D Model Generation**: Discussion about approaches to 3D model generation, with 3rdEyeVisuals planning to set up a local inference pipeline using the Hunyuan model.
- **VRM File Issues**: Fredm encountered problems uploading a VRM file exported with a Blender extension, with ash suggesting online validator tools.
- **World Export Feature Request**: emotionull requested functionality to download all worlds as single GLB files in a zip format, which ash confirmed was possible to implement.

### Blockchain Platform Considerations
- **EVM Migration Discussion**: Several users expressed support for migrating from Solana to EVM-compatible chains, citing better token gating, governance tools, and NFT infrastructure.
- **Monad as Potential Target**: Specific mention of Monad, an upcoming L1 EVM-compatible chain launching in November, suggested as a migration target due to its scalability advantages.
- **Multi-chain Approach**: Suggestions to split functionality across chains, potentially moving the DAO/treasury (30% of supply) to Ethereum while maintaining other components elsewhere.
- **Solana Governance**: Tone mentioned Realms.today as an existing Solana-based governance solution.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Could you add a button for world builders to download a zip of all worlds as single GLBs per world?**  
A: "I think that's possible yeah" (answered by ash)

**Q: Have you experimented with open source 3D model generators or just using API keys to popular closed models?**  
A: "I played around with a bunch of both open source and closed source ones." (answered by ash)

**Q: How to fix VRM upload error in Hyperfy 1?**  
A: "Could be anything hehe. There are a few VRM validator/tester tools online, maybe try something like this: https://vrm-validator.fern.solutions/" (answered by ash)

**Q: Would Hyperfy have working token gating if it were on EVM?**  
A: Implied yes, as Agent12 stated "if we were still on EVM we would have working Token_Gating"

**Q: What are the benefits of Monad compared to other EVM options like Base?**  
A: "It's a L1... they can just deploy and scale without all the compromises u have using Ethereum or any of those L2s" (answered by vox)

**Q: Is there a governance platform available on Solana?**  
A: "https://realms.today is a hosted platform on solana and it's open source" (answered by Tone)

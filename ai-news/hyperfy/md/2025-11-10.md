# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### UI Development Advancements
- **3rdEyeVisuals** implemented z-indexing support for UIView components, significantly enhancing UI capabilities
- A new UIVideo component was created using THREE.VideoTexture to display video in UIs at 60FPS without performance degradation
- Custom shaders were developed for rounded corners and proper color space conversion from sRGB to linear
- Discussions about combining 3D models with UI elements to create hybrid interfaces that avoid redraw limitations

### Game Development
- Work in progress on slot machine-like game interfaces
- Plans for multiplayer poker game development
- Ticket system implementation for gamified raffle entries

### VR-Specific Issues
- Triggers behaving differently in VR mode compared to non-VR environments in the dev branch
- Functionality that works properly in non-VR testing fails in VR contexts

### World Catalog
- Comprehensive collection of Hyperfy worlds and experiences was shared, showcasing the platform's versatility
- Includes art exhibitions, sandbox environments, games, tutorials, and test worlds

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is button interaction distance a combination of direct forward looking, distance, AND height cutoff?**  
A: It's direct distance from the player to the thing, possibly distance to camera to allow interaction while using drones or free cam (answered by ash)

**Q: How can I adjust the interaction distance for action nodes?**  
A: You can set the distance parameter, default is 3m: `const action = app.create('action', {distance: 10})` (answered by ash)

**Q: Is it possible to add a UI button for fullscreen mode?**  
A: Not sure if anyone has tried yet (answered by ash)

**Q: Do both trigger types not work on the dev branch?**  
A: Yes, confirmed in VR environment (answered by Enryt)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### UI Implementation Guidance
- **ash** provided guidance to **3rdEyeVisuals** on action nodes and interaction distances
- **ash** shared code examples showing proper usage of action nodes with label, distance and onTrigger handler

### VR Issue Troubleshooting
- **Gert-Jan Akerboom** helped **Enryt** troubleshoot trigger functionality issues in the dev branch
- They identified that the problem might be VR-specific, as triggers worked correctly in non-VR environments

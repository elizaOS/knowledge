# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Game Development & UI Implementation
- Developers discussed technical aspects of action nodes in the Hyperfy environment, with focus on interaction distances and implementation methods
- 3rdEyeVisuals shared progress on a slot machine game project, highlighting challenges with UI redraws during animations
- A hybrid approach combining UI elements with 3D models was proposed as a solution to avoid redraw issues for animated elements like spinning wheels
- The slot machine project was clarified to be for educational purposes only, with potential implementation of a ticket system for NFT raffles

### Technical Implementation Details
- Action nodes were explained to work based on distance to the camera (default 3m) and can be customized with different distances
- Discussions around fullscreen mode implementation for UI elements occurred, though no definitive solution was provided
- A git clone issue was briefly mentioned but not resolved in the conversation

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is button interaction distance based on direct forward looking, distance, AND height cutoff?**  
A: It's direct distance from the player to the thing, and for action nodes it might actually be distance to the camera to allow interaction while using drones or free cam. (answered by ash)

**Q: Are you adding action node code to the particular app's script or in src code applied to all apps?**  
A: That's an app script. (answered by ash)

**Q: How can I add a button toggle in the custom UI for full screen mode?**  
A: I'm not sure if anyone's tried yet. (answered by ash)

**Q: Is there a way to feed animations into UI's without redraws?**  
A: (Unanswered in the discussion)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Action Node Implementation**: ash provided detailed guidance to 3rdEyeVisuals on how action nodes work, including a complete code example showing how to create and add an action with label, distance, and onTrigger callback
- **Custom Distance Settings**: ash shared code examples demonstrating how to set custom distances (10m) for action nodes, helping 3rdEyeVisuals understand the configuration options

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-13

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Implementation
- **Optimization Techniques**: Developers shared significant file size reductions through WebP compression for textures, reducing file sizes by up to 90%. One developer mentioned reducing weapon assets to under 2MB per HYP file.
- **Docker & Environment Security**: Ashxn clarified that .env files aren't copied into Docker containers for security reasons, maintaining proper separation of configuration and code.
- **VR Implementation**: Significant discussion about VR interaction controls, with DevStarlight implementing basic button mapping for VR controllers to improve the experience.
- **Audio Optimization**: Developers troubleshooted seamless audio looping issues, with Ashxn recommending tools for crossfading to create smoother audio transitions.
- **Development Workflow**: DevStarlight shared their approach using separate development and production worlds with version control for efficient iteration.

### Platform Status & Community
- Users inquired about Hyperfy's platform status, with confirmation that at least one showcase game (fallen.hyperfy.xyz) is available.
- A user reported crashes when trying to access a community world (tattedalien.club), with another user mentioning that changes were in progress for that world.
- Brief discussion about water effects in 3D design, with Ashxn clarifying that their implementation used a simple plane with a normal map and UV scrolling rather than a complex simulation.

### HYPER Token
- Limited substantive discussion about HYPER token, with vague mentions of "big plans" but no specific details shared.
- Some users expressed caution about potentially misleading information being shared.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there version control?** (asked by jin)  
**A:** The world folder stores everything for backup/sharing, but app scripts require manual tracking in your own git repo (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Would it make sense to let users configure the LiveKit roomId?** (asked by tcm390)  
**A:** That's not necessary as the token already has the room ID embedded and LiveKit Client handles it automatically (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Are controls in VR working, or I have to do something in the apps?** (asked by DevStarlight | Numinia)  
**A:** Interact button just isn't mapped yet (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Can I make the transition of a looping audio a tiny bit more seamless?** (asked by vox)  
**A:** You can test and do seamless crossfading using a recommended tool (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Is the platform live, can we play game to earn hyper?** (asked by alhxss)  
**A:** One of the games created as a showcase of the platform is available now at fallen.hyperfy.xyz (answered by maximus)

**Q: What water effect implementation was used?** (paraphrased)  
**A:** It was simply a plane with a normal map and a script to scroll UVs, rather than a complex water simulation app (answered by Ashxn)

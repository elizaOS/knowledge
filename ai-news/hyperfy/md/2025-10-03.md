# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Security & Authentication
- **App Security Concerns**: Gh0stt raised the need to access local/session storage for user authentication, which is currently restricted for security reasons.
- **Authentication Solutions**: Lastraum shared their implementation of Privy accounts in their Forge app, allowing login with socials, email, or web3.
- **Permission System Proposal**: A discussion emerged about implementing a permission-based system where apps could request specific access (like cookies or local storage) with user approval.
- **Verification Process**: Gh0stt suggested a verification system for apps requiring higher security clearance, with signatures becoming invalid if app code changes.
- **Interoperability**: Ash noted similarities between the proposed verification system and how interop apps are designed to work across different worlds.

### 3D Modeling & World Building
- **Indoor Space Creation**: Fibelius inquired about building semi-realistic indoor spaces in Hyperfy v2.
- **Optimization Workflow**: Vox provided guidance on converting 3D models to .glb format and optimizing meshes before adding to worlds.
- **Resource Management**: Discussion of acceptable texture and material counts for world performance.

### Community
- **World Sharing**: Shiffty shared a link to a world (https://void.hyperworld.host).
- **Community Appreciation**: Several users expressed appreciation for Ash and the Hyperfy project.
- **Humorous Exchanges**: Light-hearted discussion about outdated technology like CD-ROMs and USB drives, with jokes about Neuralink and "HyperLink."

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q**: Has anyone tried to build semi-realistic indoor spaces with v2 in a hosted HyperWorld?  
**A**: Buy it, make a .glb, drag and drop it. You will likely need to optimize the mesh (1.2m tris), but 12x 2k textures and 14 mats seem fine. (answered by vox)

**Q**: Isn't there a way we can make verified apps that do access local/session storage?  
**A**: Ash suggested a potential permission system where apps request access, and Lastraum offered their Forge solution using Privy accounts for authentication.

**Q**: How did you handle user authentication in the Forge platform?  
**A**: We authenticate via Privy accounts - so login with socials, email or web3 (answered by Lastraum)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Authentication Solutions
- **Helper**: Lastraum (theforgecore.xyz)
- **Helpee**: Gh0stt
- **Context**: Gh0stt needed a solution for user authentication without local storage access
- **Resolution**: Lastraum offered to help set up their Forge solution in Gh0stt's world and share their hyp file

### 3D Model Optimization
- **Helper**: vox
- **Helpee**: Fibelius
- **Context**: Building semi-realistic indoor spaces in Hyperfy v2
- **Resolution**: Provided workflow guidance (convert to .glb, optimize mesh) and shared Babylon Press tool for processing 3D models

## Action Items

### Technical
- **Process 3D models through Babylon Press**: Use https://glb.babylonpress.org/ for model optimization before adding to worlds (Mentioned by vox)

### Feature
- **Implement app permissions system**: Create a system where apps can request specific access (like cookies/local storage) with user approval (Mentioned by ash)
- **Create a verification process**: Develop a verification system for apps requiring higher security clearance, with signatures that become invalid if app code changes (Mentioned by Gh0stt)

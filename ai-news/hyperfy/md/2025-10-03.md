# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Security & Authentication
- **App Security Concerns**: Discussion centered on the security limitations preventing Hyperfy apps from accessing local/session storage
- **Authentication Solutions**: Lastraum shared their implementation of Privy accounts in the Forge app, allowing login via socials, email, or web3
- **Potential Permission System**: Ash suggested implementing app permissions where users would be prompted before adding apps with elevated access requirements (e.g., "this app wants to access cookies")
- **Verification Proposal**: Gh0stt suggested a verification system for apps requiring higher security clearance, with signatures remaining valid as long as the app's hash persists

### 3D Modeling & World Building
- **Realistic Indoor Spaces**: Fibelius inquired about building semi-realistic indoor spaces in Hyperfy v2, sharing a Blender Eevee render
- **Model Optimization Guidance**: Vox provided workflow advice for importing high-detail models, noting that while 12 2K textures and 14 materials should work fine, the 1.2 million triangles would need optimization
- **Processing Tools**: Babylon Press (glb.babylonpress.org) was recommended for processing models before adding them to worlds

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Isn't there a way we can make verified apps that do access local/session storage?**  
A: Ash suggested app permissions could be implemented where users are prompted before adding apps with elevated access (e.g., "this app wants to access cookies").

**Q: How did you handle user authentication in the Forge platform?**  
A: Lastraum explained they authenticate via Privy accounts, allowing login with socials, email, or web3.

**Q: Why can't we have browser tools in the browser?**  
A: Ash explained it's different from a regular browser for security reasons, as it allows executing code directly on the page.

**Q: Has anyone tried to build semi-realistic indoor spaces like this (blender eevee render) with v2?**  
A: Vox advised to convert the model to GLB format, drag and drop it into Hyperfy, and optimize the mesh as it contains 1.2 million triangles (though the 12 2K textures and 14 materials should work fine).

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Authentication Solutions
- **Helper**: Lastraum (theforgecore.xyz)
- **Helpee**: Gh0stt
- **Context**: Gh0stt needed a solution for user authentication without local storage access
- **Resolution**: Lastraum offered to help set up the Forge in Gh0stt's world and share their hyp file

### Security Discussions
- **Helper**: Ash
- **Helpee**: Gh0stt
- **Context**: Discussing security concerns with local storage access
- **Resolution**: Suggested a potential app permissions system that could allow verified apps to access sensitive browser features

### 3D Model Optimization
- **Helper**: Vox
- **Helpee**: Fibelius
- **Context**: Building semi-realistic indoor spaces in Hyperfy v2 with a Blender model
- **Resolution**: Provided workflow guidance (convert to GLB, optimize mesh), offered lighting help, and shared a tool (Babylon Press) for processing the model

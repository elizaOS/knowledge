# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Asset Placement Improvements**: Ashxn implemented a fix to make drag-and-drop place objects on 5-degree snap points by default, addressing alignment issues.
- **State Management Approaches**: MetaMike shared progress on a system where agents can access world state directly.
- **Code Organization**: Discussions about splitting large apps into multiple files and managing version history in the Monaco editor.
- **Local Development Challenges**: Several developers troubleshooted port conflicts and world folder management issues.
- **Fall Guys Clone**: Shiffty shared progress on a Fall Guys-style hexagon game with nearly 1000 lines of code.

### 3D Modeling & Optimization
- **Avatar Rigging Challenges**: Extensive debate about manual versus programmatic approaches to fix T-pose issues with VRM models.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Users shared methods for reducing GLB file sizes, including texture compression and polygon reduction.
- **IKEA 3D Models**: Discussion about using IKEA's GLB files in Hyperfy, noting they need optimization due to multiple textures and high triangle counts.

### Web3 Gaming Concepts
- **Transaction-Based Gameplay**: Debate about implementing on-chain transactions for gameplay actions like shooting.
- **SOUL-bound NFTs**: ApeironCreations proposed using NFTs to unlock gameplay content as players progress rather than requiring upfront purchases.
- **Cultural Divide**: Discussion about why web2 game developers are often resistant to web3 concepts.

### Community & Events
- **Build Competition**: References to an ongoing build competition, though winners had not yet been announced.
- **Tutorial Event**: Mention of an upcoming tutorial event organized by fractilians.
- **NFC Integration**: Interest in connecting physical objects to Hyperfy worlds using NFC tags.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
- **Q**: Is there a plan to create weapons/pickups standards?  
  **A**: It would be up to the community to create a standard combat system, better implemented as an app that anyone can add rather than an engine feature.

- **Q**: How do you get assets to align to 5 degree snap points?  
  **A**: Drag and drop will now put it on the 5 degree snap by default.

- **Q**: Which way should assets face in Blender for proper orientation in Hyperfy?  
  **A**: Currently if you look top down in Blender, up is forward, but this will be changed to be more intuitive.

- **Q**: How can I keep UI open while changing configs in the inspect panel?  
  **A**: Add a switch at the top called "Edit Mode" that forces the UI to open while changing other props.

### 3D Design
- **Q**: How do I get my avatar into the correct T-pose for Hyperfy?  
  **A**: Apply the pose in pose mode, then apply it to the rest pose; use front view with X symmetry and side view with Y constraints to align joints properly.

- **Q**: How can I reduce the file size of my 3D models?  
  **A**: Save textures externally, resize them in image editing software, convert PNGs to JPGs, and use compression tools like glb.babylonpress.org.

- **Q**: What happens to a .hyp file when placed in a world?  
  **A**: It's unpacked and becomes an entity which is a database entry that stores the model, attached script, and all configuration/props.

### Web3 & Gaming
- **Q**: Why are web2 game devs anti-crypto?  
  **A**: They view it as an evolution of exploitative loot crates/microtransactions and consider it a pyramid scheme to extract gamer funds.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Assistance
- **Ashxn** helped **TheMattEmpire** with asset alignment issues by implementing a fix for drag-and-drop placement.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Asset Placement Improvements**: Ashxn pushed updates to make drag-and-drop items align to 5-degree snap points by default, addressing GLB asset alignment issues.
- **Model Orientation Standards**: The team decided that 3D assets should face the user when placed, establishing a consistent orientation standard for Blender exports.
- **Voice Chat Implementation**: Voice chat options and volume control sliders were added as new features to Hyperfy.
- **App Management**: A delete button for inaccessible apps was added, and discussions about "world vacuuming" to clean up old app versions were initiated.
- **T-pose Issues**: Extensive discussion about properly configuring VRM models to match Hyperfy's expected T-pose, with debate about manual versus programmatic approaches.

### Game Development
- **Standardizing Combat Systems**: TheMattEmpire proposed standardizing weapons/pickups with a socket-based system similar to Valorant, while others suggested implementing this as an optional app rather than an engine feature.
- **Fall Guys-inspired Game**: Shiffty shared progress on a hexagon game with nearly 1000 lines of code.
- **On-chain Gaming Mechanics**: Users like ApeironCreations and treed proposed concepts around on-chain gaming mechanics, including SOUL-bound NFTs and transaction-based gameplay.

### Platform Strategy & Marketing
- **Positioning Discussion**: Conversation about Hyperfy's marketing strategy, comparing it to Second Life and Roblox, with suggestions to "niche down" messaging while maintaining open-ended technical capabilities.
- **Creator Economics**: Brief comparison of Hyperfy to Roblox and Minecraft, with comments about improving creator commissions and discovery features.

### 3D Design & Optimization
- **File Size Optimization**: Discussion about reducing 3D model file sizes by compressing textures (converting PNGs to JPGs) and reducing polygon counts.
- **IKEA 3D Models**: Community shared information about IKEA's 3D models being available online, with GitHub repositories for downloading these assets.
- **Avatar Creation**: Detailed workflow shared for creating VRM avatars in Blender, including using the VRM Humanoid armature, positioning bones, and exporting.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: Is there a plan to create weapons/pickups standards? (TheMattEmpire)  
  **A**: It would be better implemented as an app that anyone can easily add rather than an engine feature. (Knar, Ashxn)

- **Q**: How can I fix GLB assets not aligning properly when placed? (TheMattEmpire)  
  **A**: Ashxn pushed an update to make drag-and-drop put items on the 5-degree snap by default, and recommended putting the origin in the center of road pieces. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Which way should assets face in Blender for proper orientation in Hyperfy? (TheMattEmpire)  
  **A**: Ashxn changed it so assets will face the user when placed. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How can we split up code in .hyp apps across multiple files? (szjanko)  
  **A**: Could implement fake tabs that combine into one file behind the scenes, but handling imports would be challenging. (Ashxn)

### Troubleshooting
- **Q**: How can I fix the "port 3001 already in use" error? (7OROY)  
  **A**: You need to shut down the process using that port. (ToxSam)

- **Q**: How do I reset my world if it's broken? (7OROY)  
  **A**: Type `rm -rf world` inside your project and restart the server with `npm run dev`. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How can I remove an entity's collider that persists after deletion? (Berk 🌐🏛)  
  **A**: Use the app panel in dev branch to find it, or look in world>assets folder. (Omka)

### 3D Design
- **Q**: How do I fix my avatar's T-pose to match what Hyperfy expects? (Knar)  
  **A**: Move bones in pose mode, apply to rest pose; use X-symmetry for efficiency. (devilsadvocate.sol)

- **Q**: How can I reduce the file size of my 3D models? (devilsadvocate.sol)  
  **A**: Compress textures by converting PNGs to JPGs and reduce polygon counts. (TheMattEmpire)

- **Q**: How do I optimize a VRM model in Blender? (saltï)  
  **A**: Install the Blender VRM plugin, add VRM Humanoid armature, position bones to match mesh, parent mesh to armature with automatic weights, then export as VRM. (Knar)

### Web3 & Gaming
- **Q**: Why are web2 game devs anti-crypto? (Spook_Handy)  
  **A**: They view it as an evolution of exploitative loot crates/microtransactions and consider it a pyramid scheme to extract funds from gamers. (maximus, peezy)

- **Q**: Did pudgy penguins drop a little game world a while back? (Ashxn)  
  **A**: Yes, they did. They're building a webgl social experience with mini games and that was just the teaser. (Saori)

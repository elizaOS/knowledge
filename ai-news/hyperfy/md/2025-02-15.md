# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-15

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **App Spawning Capabilities**: Discussions about making one app spawn another, with current limitations requiring workarounds like embedding everything in one GLB and unmounting/spawning as needed.
- **Combat Systems**: Consideration of adding native combat functionality to Hyperfy, including player health and damage concepts to the core, with weapons being handled by apps that would attach to players.
- **Code Organization**: Discussions about organizing code in multiple files for better maintainability, with suggestions for implementing "fake tabs" for multiple files while combining into one file behind the scenes.
- **Asset Placement**: Issues with drag-and-drop not putting objects on 5-degree snap points by default, with a fix pushed to the dev branch.
- **Hyperfy Tools Update**: Major visual update making the interface more compact and efficient, with backend code restructuring to improve intuitiveness and expandability.

### VR & Controller Support
- **VR Interaction**: Discussions about opening objects like fridges using VR controllers and implementing an interact button functionality.
- **Controller Compatibility**: Demonstration of PS5 controller working in Hyperfy on Solana mobile using a browser extension, though camera angles weren't properly mapped with mouse movements.
- **VRM Arms Integration**: Interest in implementing VRM arms with controllers or hand tracking for improved immersion.

### Physical-Digital Integration
- **NFC Integration**: Ideas for creating physical keyrings with embedded NFC tags that could connect to Hyperfy worlds, bridging physical objects and digital experiences.

### Asset Creation & Compatibility
- **GLB Animation Support**: Confirmation that Hyperfy v2 doesn't yet support GLB animations, causing issues for users trying to implement animated assets.
- **File Format Compatibility**: Clarification that .hyp files are only supported in V2 worlds, not V1.
- **3D Avatar Creation**: Interest in creating 3D avatar NFT collections and implementing minting experiences directly within Hyperfy worlds.

### Community & Governance
- **Standardization Discussions**: Suggestions for creating standards for weapons and pickups to ensure interoperability across different worlds.
- **Community Guidelines**: Concerns about tone and language used in some channels, with suggestions for clearer community guidelines.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-15

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Combat System Development**: Discussions about implementing combat systems in Hyperfy, with plans to add player health and damage concepts to the core while keeping weapons as app-specific attachments. Debate about whether combat systems should be standardized or left to individual developers.
- **App Spawning Limitations**: MayD524 inquired about making one app spawn another app, with Ashxn explaining this isn't currently possible but suggesting workarounds like embedding everything in one GLB and unmounting/spawning as needed.
- **Asset Alignment**: TheMattEmpire raised questions about standardizing snap points for asset alignment. Ashxn pushed an update to make drag-and-drop assets align to 5-degree snap points by default.
- **Game Development Progress**: Shiffty shared progress on a hex-a-gone game derivative with nearly complete game loop functionality, showing examples of large hex grids and discussing performance considerations.
- **GLB Animation Support**: Fractilians discovered that Hyperfy v2 doesn't yet support GLB animations, though they confirmed their animations worked in v1.
- **Hyperfy Tools Update**: HowiEDuhzit announced a significant visual update to Hyperfy Tools, making it more compact and efficient, though noting potential bugs due to backend code restructuring.

### VR & Hardware
- **VR Interactions**: Discussions about controller integration for VR interactions, such as opening a fridge using the interact button.
- **VRM Integration**: Questions about potential VRM arm integration with hand tracking for more natural interactions.
- **PS5 Controller Compatibility**: Mentions of PS5 controller compatibility with Hyperfy on Solana Mobile.
- **AI Hardware**: Evaluation of the Turing RK1 compute module with 32GB RAM for running AI models, with discussions about its NPU capabilities and compatibility with Jetson boards.

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Asset Selection Visibility**: Suggestions for implementing outlines for assets to improve visibility and selection clarity in build mode.
- **Ghost Collision Bug**: A bug was reported where a deleted ramp's collider remained in the environment despite the visual mesh being removed.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Arc Browser on Windows has issues with drag and drop functionality that works properly in Chrome.

### Marketing & Community
- **Platform Positioning**: Discussion about marketing strategy for Hyperfy, with insights from comparing Second Life and Roblox. Suggestion to focus on specific niches for marketing while keeping the platform capabilities open-ended.
- **3D Avatar NFTs**: Interest in creating 3D avatar NFT collections with potential in-world minting experiences.
- **Physical-Digital Integration**: CheddarQueso proposed creating 3D printed keyrings with embedded NFC tags that could serve as physical keys to digital worlds.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I make an app spawn another app?**  
A: You can't yet, but you can embed everything in one GLB and unmount/spawn as needed. (Ashxn)

**Q: Is there a plan to create weapons/pickups standards?**  
A: It would be up to the community to create a standard combat system. (Knar)

**Q: Is there any chance we could load GLBs into the world and they all line up to 5 degrees (to start)?**  
A: Ashxn pushed an update to make drag and drop put assets on the 5 degree snap by default.

**Q: I have a GLB with animations and wondering why they are not showing up in world?**  
A: v2 doesn't support GLB animations yet. (Saori)

**Q: Does focusing on a niche for marketing limit the platform?**  
A: You can keep it totally open-ended but focus on one niche for marketing. (Knar)

**Q: How do I optimize a VRM in Blender?**  
A: Install the Blender VRM plugin, add VRM Humanoid armature, position bones, parent mesh to armature with automatic weights, then export as VRM. (Knar)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Asset Alignment Fix**: Ashxn identified an issue with snap points not aligning properly for road assets and pushed an update to fix this for TheMattEmpire.

- **VRM Creation Guidance**: Knar provided step-by-step instructions for using the VRM plugin in Blender, adding humanoid armature, positioning bones, and exporting when saltï needed help with VRM creation.

- **Local Development Troubleshooting**: Multiple community members (ToxSam, MetaMike, maximus) helped 7OROY resolve issues with port conflicts and broken local worlds after adding problematic GLBs.

- **NFC Implementation**: StrawberrySith offered expertise to CheddarQueso on implementing NFC functionality that could affect worlds when tapped, supporting the physical keyring project.

- **Marketing Strategy**: Knar helped ash understand how to effectively market an open-ended platform by suggesting focusing on specific niches while keeping the platform capabilities open-ended.

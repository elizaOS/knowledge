# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Build Mode & Developer Experience
- **New Build Mode**: Ashxn demonstrated significant improvements to the build mode with flying capabilities (activated via double jump), pointer lock controls, and a reticle for more precise interaction. This addresses needs for both casual builders and technical developers.
- **UI Components**: New dropdown UI components were implemented, enhancing the developer toolkit.
- **TypeScript Consideration**: Discussions about potentially moving the codebase to TypeScript for improved developer experience, though current focus remains on stability and user-friendliness.
- **Control System Overhaul**: Ashxn mentioned plans for a complete overhaul of the control system to improve user experience.

### Inter-App Communication & Integration
- **App-to-App Interaction**: MetaMike demonstrated a system allowing apps to detect and interact with each other, opening possibilities for complex game mechanics.
- **IoT Integration**: HPrivakos showcased integration between real-world Philips Hue lights and Hyperfy worlds, controlling in-world sky intensity with physical devices.
- **External Systems**: Discussions about Arduino/Raspberry Pi compatibility for further IoT integration.

### AI Agents & Virtual Characters
- **Agent Development**: MetaMike is working on an agent named Eliza that can perceive surroundings, respond to needs, and interact with the environment.
- **Location Training**: Drdoge.eth has been training agents (Eliza and Victor) to recognize locations and provide directions within virtual worlds.
- **Living City Vision**: The community expressed excitement about creating environments with multiple NPCs that interact naturally with users and the environment.

### 3D Asset Optimization
- **File Size Reduction**: Discussions about optimization strategies, with examples of reducing a 43MB GLB to 1.5MB using gltf.report (a tool sponsored by Hyperfy).
- **Z-fighting Issues**: Users reported clipping problems with objects placed close to the ground plane, with Ashxn confirming a fix in the next release.
- **VRM Implementation**: Several users working on VRM models encountered skeleton-related errors.

### Infrastructure & World Portability
- **Docker Optimization**: HPrivakos shared a multi-stage Dockerfile that reduces image size to 300MB by separating build and production stages.
- **World Export/Import**: Discussions about standardizing world portability between hosting services, with proposals for zip exports, a specialized .hyp format, or dashboard export functionality.

### Community & Events
- **Educational Use**: A university professor (treed) joined seeking guidance on using Hyperfy for teaching 3D modeling.
- **Super Bowl Metaverse Event**: VTATV announced a Super Bowl 2025 Metaverse Watch Party across multiple platforms including Hyperfy, scheduled for February 9, 2025.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Development of Solana integration was confirmed, with multiple teams working on various chain integrations.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Build Mode & Controls**
- Q: How can I implement flying in my world? (ToxSam)
  A: Double jump to activate flying (Ashxn)
- Q: Is there a way to add a spawnpoint? (ToxSam)
  A: Use "/spawn set" command (HPrivakos)
- Q: Will Hyperfy be moved to TypeScript? (0xBison)
  A: It's a longer-term consideration, currently focusing on stability and user-friendliness (maximus)
- Q: Is the editor available in V2 when setting up a local world? (treed)
  A: No traditional editor yet, but you can drag and drop GLB models and right-click things to bring up menus (Ashxn)

**Asset Creation & Optimization**
- Q: How do I make a .hyp file? (Shiffty)
  A: Click download on the app window (Saori)
- Q: Which format would be best to convert into GLB? (treed)
  A: FBX is recommended, then import to Blender and export as GLB (MetaMike and Saori)
- Q: How do you convert FBX to GLB optimized for Hyperfy? (treed)
  A: Import FBX to Blender, then export as GLB; use gltf.report to compress further if needed (Saori and maximus)
- Q: Is there a plan for allowing custom shaders on Hyperfy? (TheMattEmpire)
  A: Yes most likely. Just need a good API for it (Ashxn)

**AI & Agents**
- Q: How did you train the agent to know where things are? (maximus)
  A: By repeatedly asking/telling it to scan around its location for points of interest and asking for directions from different spots until it gets accurate (drdoge.eth)
- Q: How was the development pace in v1 compared to this? (devilsadvocate.sol)
  A: Nobody coded much besides Saori and Ash in terms of apps, partly because React required local dev environment, and AI has improved (Saori)

**Platform & Infrastructure**
- Q: Can we use the Hyperfy logo on our website if we're building on Hyperfy? (Dominic)
  A: Yes, it's nice to call out that your site is powered by Hyperfy (maximus)
- Q: Is the team doxxed? (kcrypt.)
  A: Yes, team members are public, e.g., https://x.com/ashconnell (jin)
- Q: Is it technically possible to create a GTA San Andreas-esque game on Hyperfy? (PurpleSack)
  A: Yes, you can import maps and assets, add AI for NPCs, though performance considerations are important (maximus)
- Q: Are there any plans to add Solana? (MikeBroco)
  A: Yes, there's a Solana branch of the code being worked on, with others working on integrating other chains (maximus)

## Community Help & Collaboration

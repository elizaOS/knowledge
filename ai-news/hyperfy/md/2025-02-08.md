# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Build Mode Improvements
- **New Build Mode Development**: Ashxn demonstrated progress on a new build mode with pointer lock controls and flying capabilities (double jump to fly), allowing for more intuitive object manipulation.
- **Control Scheme**: Tab toggles build mode, left click moves objects, right click duplicates, x deletes objects.
- **Planned Enhancements**: Gizmos for object manipulation, outlines for selected objects, and multi-select functionality are in development.

### Agent Development
- **Environment Perception**: MetaMike is working on an agent named Eliza that can perceive surroundings, respond to needs, and interact with the environment.
- **Location Training**: Drdoge.eth has been training agents (Eliza and Victor) to recognize locations and provide directions within virtual worlds.
- **Living City Vision**: The community is excited about creating a "living city" with multiple NPCs that can interact with users and the environment.

### Inter-App Communication
- **World Events**: MetaMike showcased a working example where apps can communicate with each other through world events using `world.emit()` and `world.on()`.
- **Smart Object Interaction**: Peezy explained the concept of apps detecting nearby apps for interaction.

### 3D Asset Optimization
- **Quality Rating System**: Discussions about implementing a quality rating system for 3D assets based on both visual quality and optimization level.
- **Z-Fighting Solutions**: Strategies for handling z-fighting/clipping issues in 3D scenes, with a solution involving proper elevation of objects above the ground plane.
- **File Size Reduction**: Hyperfy is sponsoring the gltf.report tool, which demonstrated impressive file size reduction capabilities (43MB to 1.5MB).

### Real-World Integration
- **IoT Connection**: HPrivakos demonstrated integrating real-world IoT devices with Hyperfy worlds by connecting Philips Hue lights to control in-world sky intensity.
- **World-Merging**: Discussions about creating apps for interactions between IRL and Hyperfy worlds.

### Onboarding & Education
- **New User Support**: Several new users, including a university architecture professor (treed), sought guidance on getting started with Hyperfy V2.
- **Educational Applications**: Strong interest in educational applications, with HPrivakos offering to host worlds for students.

### Technical Discussions
- **TypeScript Adoption**: Debate about TypeScript adoption, with 0xBison offering to help with migration while others questioned the timing and priority.
- **Custom Shaders**: Discussions about implementing a quality API for custom shaders in Hyperfy.
- **Lightmapping Support**: Exploration of lightmapping support for GLB files and potential workarounds.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: How can apps communicate with each other?  
  **A**: Use world.emit() and world.on() to broadcast and listen for events between different app instances (MetaMike)

- **Q**: Is TypeScript adoption planned for Hyperfy?  
  **A**: It's a longer-term consideration, currently focus is on stability and user-friendliness (maximus)

- **Q**: How do you fly in the new build mode?  
  **A**: Double jump (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is there a plan for allowing custom shaders on Hyperfy?  
  **A**: "Yeah most likely. Just need a good API for it" (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How can I prevent z-fighting/clipping issues with objects near the ground plane?  
  **A**: "This should be fixed in next release" (Ashxn)

- **Q**: What kind of overhead is there for having instanced basic shapes?  
  **A**: "As long as they're ultra optimized almost zero overhead" (Ashxn)

### Getting Started & Workflow
- **Q**: How do I set a spawn point?  
  **A**: Use "/spawn set" command (HPrivakos)

- **Q**: How do I make a .hyp file?  
  **A**: Click download on the app window (Saori)

- **Q**: What's the best way of getting started with Hyperfy V2 for a designer with limited development skills?  
  **A**: "If you're a designer, probably just pay for hosting - easiest. You basically just drag a GLB or VRM in, then add scripts if you want." (Saori)

- **Q**: How do you usually convert FBX to GLB optimized for Hyperfy?  
  **A**: "You import FBX to Blender, then export GLB." (Saori)

- **Q**: How did you train the agent to know where things are?  
  **A**: By repeatedly asking/telling it to scan around its location for points of interest and asking for directions from different spots (drdoge.eth)

### Platform & Community
- **Q**: Do we have dropdown UI components yet?  
  **A**: Yes, just added (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Can we have a way to track features or ideas for new developers?  
  **A**: GitHub projects/discussions would be appropriate (maximus)

- **Q**: Is it technically possible to create a GTA San Andreas-esque game on Hyperfy?  
  **A**: "You can probably find a San Andreas map on Sketchfab and set it as the default space instead of the green plane." (merk)

- **Q**: If we are building on Hyperfy can we use the logo on our website?  
  **A**: "I think it's a nice call out to say your site is powered by Hyperfy." (maximus)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Assistance
- **HPrivakos** helped **ToxSam** set spawn points in a world by providing the "/spawn set" command.

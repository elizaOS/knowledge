# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-13

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **Core Functionality Modifications**: 3rdEyeVisuals implemented a change allowing users to upload raw .js files as apps instead of requiring .hyp bundles, making the platform more accessible to users unfamiliar with bundling
- **System Stability**: Ash mentioned that v1 has been running smoothly for almost a year without intervention
- **Legacy System**: There was a brief mention that a "Legacy" system may be coming back online soon

### Interactive Features
- **Enhanced Avatar Movement**: Discussion about creating objects that could make non-admin avatars jump higher in virtual environments
- **Interactive Objects**: Dhin suggested a book object that allows avatars to perform flips or double jumps when users press the F key

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Have you played around with V2 at all?** (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals)  
**A**: "No I dont know how to code" (answered by Harambe Advocate)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓** offered help to **Harambe Advocate** via direct message regarding an unspecified topic from an earlier conversation
- **Dhin** provided a solution to **Nicola Bertoglio** about creating objects that enhance avatar movement capabilities

## Action Items

### Technical
- **Modify core files**: Consider extending current implementation to allow .js files to appear properly in the Layers world view by handling missing metadata (Mentioned by 3rdEyeVisuals)
- **Upload implementation examples**: Share various implementation examples as promised (Mentioned by MetaRick)
- **Undisclosed feature development**: Work on feature that won't appear in updates channel; involves relearning v1 system (Mentioned by Ash)

### Implementation Challenges
- The current .js file support implementation has a limitation: while the sidebar apps menu can detect .js files as apps, the Layers world view cannot display these properly because they lack the metadata present in .hyp bundles

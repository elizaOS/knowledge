# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-13

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Legacy Platform (v1) Status
- **Restoration Success**: Ash announced "v1 is back baby!" after working to relearn how the legacy platform functions
- **Platform Stability**: v1 has been running smoothly for almost a year without requiring maintenance
- **User Preference**: Some users expressed preference for v1 despite its technical limitations, particularly for its token-gated features

### Development Initiatives
- **JS File Support**: 3rdEyeVisuals is modifying the core system to support direct .js file uploads as apps alongside existing .hyp bundles
- **Implementation Challenges**: While the sidebar apps menu was updated to recognize .js files, the Layers world view doesn't detect these files due to missing metadata
- **Open Source Consideration**: Fibelius suggested maintaining v1 as an open-source project to provide stability for creators who rely on it

### 3D Design & Functionality
- **Avatar Movement Enhancement**: Discussion about implementing "jumper" functionality for non-admin avatars
- **Trampoline Objects**: Dhin shared resources for trampoline-like objects that can make avatars jump higher

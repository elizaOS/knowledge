# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### App-to-App Communication
The main technical discussion centered on implementing app-to-app communication in Hyperverse. Valiant was working on a race system with four interconnected apps (StartRace, RaceGate, FinishRace, and RaceManager) that needed to communicate with each other. Ashxn provided a detailed explanation of two primary communication methods:
- `app.send()`/`app.on()` for same-app communication across the network
- `app.emit()`/`world.on()` for inter-app communication on the same client/server

It was clarified that `world.emit()` is now deprecated and replaced by `app.emit()`. 0mka suggested additional options including `world.set` and `world.get` for app communication.

### 3D Design & Assets
There was a brief discussion about V1-friendly grass assets, with a user seeking alternatives to "ash's grass" (referred to as "grash"). The conversation was redirected to a more appropriate channel.

### Community Events
A Community Call was mentioned with some discussion about social media promotion. CheddarQueso offered help with social media, and maximus posted about the event on Twitter.

### Future Technologies
There was brief interest in implementing Gaussian splats in v2, with hiroP mentioning PlayCanvas repositories as a potential integration path.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I implement app-to-app communication for a race system with multiple apps?**  
**A:** Use `app.send()`/`app.on()` for same-app communication across network and `app.emit()`/`world.on()` for different-app communication on same client/server.

**Q: What replaced the deprecated world.emit()?**  
**A:** `app.emit()` replaced it because "it is the app emitting an event to the world".

**Q: Has anyone implemented Gaussian splats in v2 yet?**  
**A:** "Not that I know of... That's going to be COOL AF" (Agent12)

**Q: Anyone got some sweet v1-friendly grass I could use?**  
**A:** The question was redirected to a more appropriate channel.

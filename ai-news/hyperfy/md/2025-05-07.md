# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **V1 to V2 Transition**: Hyperfy v1 is now in maintenance mode with no major updates planned. The focus has shifted entirely to v2, which features an open-source world engine that can be self-hosted or used through services like hyperworld.host. A roadmap for v2 is coming soon. [Ashxn]
- **UI Overhaul**: A major UI redesign is in progress based on community feedback and prototypes. [maximus]
- **Community Call Announcement**: An upcoming community call will cover platform updates, UI changes, and potential vehicle implementation. [maximus]

### Technical Implementations
- **App-to-App Communication**: Detailed discussion on implementing communication between apps in Hyperfy, particularly for a race system comprising multiple apps (StartRace, RaceGate, FinishRace, and RaceManager). Two main methods were highlighted:
  - app.send()/app.on() for same-app communication across the network
  - app.emit()/world.on() for inter-app communication
  - world.emit() is deprecated and replaced by app.emit() [Ashxn]
- **Community Contributions**: Several community projects were highlighted:
  - NEON sign app now in v2 [Gert-Jan]
  - Lightweight world magic [Vox]
  - Improvements to scaling and level of detail (LOD)
  - Door mechanics [b0gie]
  - Power admin UX prototype [cru]
  - hypkg UI integration [Peezy]
  - Agent functionality in Hyperfy worlds

### Emerging Technologies
- **Gaussian Splats**: Discussion about potential integration of Gaussian splats with PlayCanvas for Hyperfy v2. [hiroP]
- **VRM Exports**: Questions about exporting generated VRMs with blendshapes across multiple meshes in Blender. [lucii.io]

### Token & Business
- Brief discussions about HYPER token purchases and price movements
- Speculation about potential exchange listings following AI16Z's listing on Crypto.com

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I implement app-to-app communication for a race system with multiple apps?** [Valiant]  
A: Use app.send()/app.on() for same-app communication across network and app.emit()/world.on() for different-app communication. [Ashxn]

**Q: What replaced the deprecated world.emit()?** [Valiant]  
A: It was replaced by app.emit() because "it is the app emitting an event to the world". [Ashxn]

**Q: I want to create a new world/land in Hyperfy v1. Is it not possible anymore?** [carlosmu]  
A: The v1 world NFTs are no longer available as we're transitioning to a new v2 engine and platform. [Ashxn]

**Q: Is there any chance to try the v2 builder or is it not released yet?** [carlosmu]  
A: Yes, the v2 world engine is open source. You can self-host it if you're savvy or use a hosting service like hyperworld.host. You can also build locally or in play.hyperfy.xyz where everyone has build permissions. [Ashxn]

**Q: Is this the right link for v2 docs?** [carlosmu]  
A: Documentation has moved to https://docs.hyperfy.xyz. [Ashxn]

**Q: Has anyone done anything to show Gaussian splats in v2 yet?** [hiroP]  
A: Not that I know of... That's going to be COOL AF. [Agent12]

**Q: Has anyone been successful in exporting generated VRMs with blendshapes through Blender?** [lucii.io]  
A: I could have sworn blender VRM supported blendshapes on more than one mesh. [Ashxn]

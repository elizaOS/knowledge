# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-30

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development & Technical Updates
- **Portable Apps System**: Ashxn detailed plans for a system allowing objects to be used across different worlds, with publisher verification and performance ratings ("flux levels") in an official "codex" list.
- **Data Persistence**: Discussion about using `world.get()` and `world.set()` methods for storing data at the world level to persist after reload.
- **WebSocket Issues**: Troubleshooting of connection problems in a modified Fliza OS implementation, where incorrect protocol usage (https:// instead of wss://) was causing inconsistent user access.
- **LiveKit Modifications**: 0mka mentioned needing to make changes to LiveKit functionality at the core level rather than via hyp.
- **Whitepaper Release**: Ashxn announced an upcoming whitepaper release "in the next couple of days."

### Creative Development
- **Weight Painting App**: Gert-Jan Akerboom demonstrated an app for particles that allows users to place elements like grass and flowers in worlds.
- **Content Layering**: HiroP shared a concept called "leaves" for layering content in virtual worlds, allowing users to subscribe to specific content themes visible across different worlds.
- **Private Projects**: MetaRick noted many community members are developing significant projects privately before sharing them publicly.

### Community & Project Direction
- **Communication Concerns**: MUDBONE expressed frustration about lack of visible progress compared to January promises, with Ashxn acknowledging communication weaknesses (describing the team as "99% building, 1% marketing").
- **Moderation Approaches**: Discussion about content moderation, with some favoring human/AI moderation through channels and others suggesting token-based systems for proof of engagement.
- **Metaverse Narratives**: Some members suggested combinations with AI and agents as more current technological directions for the metaverse.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I store data in my world to persist after reload?** (Gert-Jan Akerboom)  
A: You can use world.get(key) and world.set(key, value) to store data at the world level. (Ashxn)

**Q: How will portable apps work across different worlds?** (hiroP)  
A: Objects can be signed with a publisher, and world owners can choose what objects can be used in their world through various permission levels. (Ashxn)

**Q: When will the whitepaper be released?** (zzzzzzzzzzz)  
A: In the next couple of days. (Ashxn)

**Q: What progress has been made in the last 6 months?** (MUDBONE)  
A: Progress is visible in weekly community calls on YouTube and plugin development in another channel. (Reneil)

**Q: Why isn't there better communication about project direction?** (MUDBONE)  
A: The team acknowledges poor communication but is prioritizing building the product first before marketing. (Ashxn)

**Q: Why can some people join but some cannot?** (Coinexpert)  
A: Some devices/browsers allow using https:// for websocket urls but it's not valid to the specification. (ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Server Resource Management**:  
   hiroP recommended netdata for monitoring server resources and explained how it helped identify and clean up 28GB of Docker data when disk space was running low.

2. **Data Persistence Guidance**:  
   Ashxn helped Gert-Jan Akerboom understand how to use world.get() and world.set() methods to store data at the world level.

3. **WebSocket Troubleshooting**:  
   ash helped Coinexpert identify that while their .env file had the correct wss:// protocol, it was being overridden elsewhere with https://, causing connection issues.

4. **Avatar Rendering Issue**:  
   ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/ offered voice chat assistance to ovo who was experiencing an issue where shorts looked different in-world than in Blender.

5. **Project Direction Concerns**:  
   Reneil directed MUDBONE to YouTube community calls and plugin development channels to see progress, while Ashxn acknowledged communication issues and explained the focus on building before marketing.

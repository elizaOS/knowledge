# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Vehicle Implementation**: Ashxn shared a pivot to using a single armature with bones for vehicle components (wheels, doors, lights, trunk) instead of empties as in v1. This approach achieves better rendering efficiency with a single draw call.
- **3D Optimization**: TheMattEmpire discussed VRM optimization techniques in Blender, specifically how combining multiple mesh blendshapes into one can reduce file size.
- **Deployment Options**: Discussion around embedding Hyperfy worlds in Next.js applications, with clarification that while Next.js is primarily for 2D websites, Hyperfy worlds could be embedded via iframes or by pointing subdomains to hyperworld.host.
- **Server Requirements**: Limitations of deploying on Vercel were discussed, as Hyperfy's multiplayer component requires a server rather than serverless architecture.

### Platform Capabilities
- **Vehicle Customization**: Ashxn confirmed that vehicle customization is fully possible using the engine's existing capabilities, mentioning specific functions like `skinnedmesh.getBone(name)` for manipulating bone transforms and physics functions.
- **Mobile Development**: React Native was mentioned as becoming viable for a hypothetical Hyperfy mobile app.
- **Use Cases**: Users explored potential applications beyond social/gaming, particularly highlighting 3D environment portfolios for businesses and artists as a promising market.

### Token Economics
- **Hyper Token Utility**: Ashxn explained that Hyper is central to the ecosystem, powering the marketplace, DAO, and a narrative-driven experience with digital items and avatars.
- **Forge Feature**: A "forge" feature allows users to mint digital items backed by the token.
- **Future Plans**: Staking functionality is planned but not imminent.
- **Market Cap Clarification**: Discussion about Hyperfy's token economics, with clarification on market cap versus fully diluted valuation.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a max file size/video length for videos?**  
A: It's a setting per world (Ashxn)

**Q: Will vehicle preparation be similar to v1?**  
A: "We're pivoting to a single armature with bones instead of empties. Similar but different." (Ashxn)

**Q: Is it possible to start making our own cars this way?**  
A: "10000% possible. Everything is in the engine with functions for bone transforms and physics." (Ashxn)

**Q: Can you clarify the actual market cap for Hyper, is it currently 6.2 or 2.7?**  
A: "Fully diluted 6.2, market cap takes into account circulating supply" (Ashxn)

**Q: Do you think it's possible to spin a world on a next.js vercel web app?**  
A: "Nextjs is specific to building 2D websites, you could embed your world in a nextjs app with an iframe though" (Ashxn)

**Q: Do you have a strategy for hyperfy token?**  
A: "Hyper is at the center of everything, it powers the marketplace, dao, an official story driven narrative with digital items and avatars, our forge mints digital items made by anybody backed by our token, we have plans for staking but thats a way off" (Ashxn)

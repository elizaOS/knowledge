# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Vehicle Implementation**: Ashxn explained the pivot to a single armature with bones for vehicle parts (wheels, doors, lights) to achieve better performance through single draw calls. This approach differs from V1 by using bones instead of empties.
- **Docker Optimization**: Multi-stage builds were implemented in the Dockerfile, reducing image size by 59% (from 98MB to 40MB) and improving build performance through better cache layer utilization.
- **Post-Processing Effects**: Discussions about how tonemapping (specifically AgX) affects visual fidelity, particularly when creating pure white environments. Users explored workarounds including unlit materials and emissive materials.
- **VRM Optimization**: TheMattEmpire shared techniques for optimizing VRM files in Blender by combining multiple mesh blendshapes into single presets using "Make shape from mix" to reduce file size.
- **UI Updates**: The return of the v1 loader was announced for world menu and loading screens based on user preferences.

### Platform Integration & Deployment
- **Next.js Integration**: Users discussed embedding Hyperfy worlds in Next.js applications via iframes or pointing subdomains to Hyperworld.host.
- **Deployment Limitations**: The multiplayer component of Hyperfy was identified as a blocker for serverless deployments like Vercel, though single-player experiences remain possible.
- **World Importing**: Discussion about importing existing worlds into the platform, with some users experiencing difficulties with digital ocean droplets and collision fixing.

### Business & Tokenomics
- **Hyper Token Utility**: Ashxn provided an overview of the token's utility, mentioning that Hyper powers the marketplace, DAO, and a narrative with digital items. A "forge" feature mints digital items backed by the token, with staking functionality planned for the future.
- **Cryptocurrency Integration**: Brief discussion about on-ramps and a new platform that standardizes wallet API integration, with speculation about regulatory implications and benefits compared to traditional payment systems.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a max file size/video length for videos?**  
A: It's a setting configurable per world (Ashxn)

**Q: Is it possible to start making our own cars or does the core/dev engine not allow for it yet?**  
A: "10000% possible. Everything is in the engine. skinnedmesh.getBone(name) lets you read and write bone transforms. Physics has everything for raycasting suspension and applying forces for wheels etc." (Ashxn)

**Q: Do you think it's possible to spin a world on a next.js vercel web app?**  
A: "Nextjs is specific to building 2D websites, you could embed your world in a nextjs app with an iframe though" (Ashxn)

**Q: Is it possible to deploy Hyperfy on Vercel?**  
A: "It's a little difficult to deploy on vercel because hyperfy requires a server to be running and vercel focuses on serverless applications" (peezy)

**Q: Do you have a strategy for hyperfy token?**  
A: "Hyper is at the center of everything. It powers the marketplace, dao, an official story driven narrative with digital items and avatars, our forge mints digital items made by anybody backed by our token, we have plans for staking but thats a way off." (Ashxn)

**Q: When trying to add VRM as base for World Image, why doesn't it load after selecting the file?**  
A: Check for errors in console/network tab and try a different VRM file (ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Post-Processing Troubleshooting**:
   - Helper: Ashxn | Helpee: MetaRick
   - Context: MetaRick was trying to create a pure white world but post-processing was darkening it
   - Resolution: Ashxn identified the issue as tonemapping (specifically AgX) and bloom being triggered when sunlight pushes 100% white into HDR range

2. **Next.js Integration**:
   - Helper: Ashxn | Helpee: Sceth iii
   - Context: Integrating Hyperfy worlds with Next.js website
   - Resolution: Suggested using hyperworld.host and either embedding iframe in Next.js website or pointing a subdomain to hyperworld

3. **VRM Optimization Techniques**:
   - Helper: TheMattEmpire | Helpee: Community
   - Context: Optimizing VRM file sizes in Blender
   - Resolution: Shared technique of combining multiple blendshapes into one using 'Make shape from mix' feature to reduce file size

4. **Dockerfile Improvements**:
   - Helper: ash | Helpee: HypPrivakos
   - Context: Previous build system issue requiring a `| exit 0` hack in the Dockerfile
   - Resolution: ash fixed the underlying build system issue, allowing removal of the workaround

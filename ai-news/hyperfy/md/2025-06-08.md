# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Tools & Features
- **Collections/Palettes Management**: Ashxn explained that collections are currently simple folders in the repo, with only one called "default". The system is designed so the plus button UI could have tabs for each collection. Peezy confirmed hypkg files can contain more hyp files in collections.
- **Camera Controls**: Shiffty shared a freecam system with 6DOF movement and smooth rotation/movement controls for cinematics. The implementation includes configurable settings and mouse control capabilities.
- **Build/Play Mode Separation**: Cru mentioned working on separating build/editor mode from play mode to create more focused experiences for both creators and players, potentially mounting the editor on a different URL while maintaining real-time updates.
- **Minimap System**: 0mka demonstrated a working minimap that tracks players and portals across different locations.
- **Plot/Parcel Permissions**: Developers discussed concepts where scripts would only run within their designated areas, using volumes to apply permissions to users.

### Community & Events
- Community members coordinated watching Apple's WWDC25 event together in a virtual theater, with a Discord event link shared by Cynnx.
- Several "gm" (good morning) greetings highlighted the global nature of the community, with particular mentions of late/early hours for members in Asian time zones.

### Tokenomics & Project Direction
- Ashxn clarified that the Hyperfy token serves a dual purpose as both a governance and marketplace token.
- MUDBONE mentioned an upcoming new website that will provide a more streamlined explanation of the project.
- Community members suggested that Hyperfy is undervalued compared to another token called $VERSE.

### Technical Issues
- Agent12 reported problems with a teleportation/storage mechanic, receiving troubleshooting help from ash who suggested using the "/cake" command and updating to the latest version.
- 0mka provided detailed instructions on setting up teleportation points and configuring commands.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Collections & Asset Organization**

## Community Help & Collaboration

**Camera Systems Development**
- Shiffty helped vox/Ashxn by creating a camera manager with 6DOF movement, smooth rotation, and configurable settings, sharing code and implementation details.
- Shiffty assisted drdoge.eth by sharing code for pointer lock and camera rotation with mouse input.

**Collections Management**
- Ashxn explained to 0mka how Eliza bot can interact with hyps by simulating drag and drop functions to load hyps, making it usable as a collections manager.

**Minimap Implementation**
- 0mka demonstrated a working minimap to b0gie that tracks players and portals across different locations.

**Teleportation System**
- ash helped Agent12 troubleshoot a teleporter/location setting feature by confirming it works in play world using the "/cake" command and suggesting updates.
- 0mka provided detailed instructions on setting up teleportation points and configuring commands.

**Event Organization**
- Cynnx created and shared a Discord event link for community viewing of WWDC25 after untitled, xyz asked about watching it together.

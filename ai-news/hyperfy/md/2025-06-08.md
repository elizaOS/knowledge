# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Collections & Asset Management
- Discussions centered on Hyperfy's collections/palettes system, with debates about organization and sharing of asset collections
- 0mka and Ashxn explored UI improvements for collections, suggesting tabs for each collection with buttons to create, edit, import and export
- Developers discussed methods for sharing collections between users
- Ashxn mentioned the need to add audio to collections

### World Building & Permissions
- Conversations about plot/parcel permissions in shared worlds
- TheMattEmpire suggested using volumes for permission management, where anything within a volume applies to the permissions granted to users
- Ashxn proposed that apps should only run scripts within their designated plots to prevent griefing
- Discussion about multi-role permissions for parcels

### Camera & Visualization Features
- Significant interest in camera functionality with vox offering 35,000 HYPER tokens for developing a versatile freecam
- Shiffty shared code for a freecam implementation with 6DOF movement and mouse rotation control
- drdoge.eth shared a camera switcher implementation allowing objects to be clicked to move the camera to configurable positions
- hiroP expressed interest in camera path functionality for scene transitions

### Platform Development
- Cru mentioned work on separating build/editor mode from play mode to create more focused experiences
- The goal is to mount the editor on a different URL while maintaining real-time updates
- Developers aim to create a professional dev experience comparable to Unity
- Brief discussion about enabling menu functionality for mobile/VR building capabilities

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What are your thoughts on how hyp packs are working?** (asked by 0mka)  
**A:** They're currently called collections, with only one default collection in a folder in the repo. The UI could have tabs for each collection with buttons to create, edit, import and export collections. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What's the easiest way to share collections?** (asked by 0mka)  
**A:** You could modify the default folder and make it whatever you want and then share that with people if needed. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Have you tried to fetch or load a hyp from a URL?** (asked by 0mka)  
**A:** One hyp can't load another hyp, but Eliza can simulate drag and drop by running the same function that loads a hyp. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How would plots work in a single world where people can only build on certain plots?** (asked by Ashxn)  
**A:** One approach would be using volumes, where anything within the volume applies to the permissions granted to users. (answered by TheMattEmpire)

**Q: Where can metadata be found in Hyperfy?** (asked by Ashxn)  
**A:** In the metadata of the hyp (answered by 0mka)

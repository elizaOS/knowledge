# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Visual Rendering & Post-Processing
- **Post-Processing Effects Issue**: MetaRick identified that post-processing in Hyperfy worlds darkens white backgrounds and affects video playback, particularly problematic when aiming for pure white environments.
- **Technical Root Cause**: Ashxn explained that AgX tone mapping in the post-processing pipeline affects colors regardless of material settings. When combined with sunlight, white materials are pushed into HDR range, triggering bloom effects.
- **Workarounds Discovered**:
  - Setting sun intensity to 0 fixes the issue
  - Using emissive materials provides partial improvement
  - A potential hyp to disable tone mapping was discussed as a future solution

### Platform Updates
- **Loading Screen Enhancement**: Ashxn announced the reintroduction of the "v1 loader" to world menu and loading screens on Chill Hyperfy, responding to positive user feedback about the previous version.
- **Favicon Implementation**: Discussion about adding favicon customization to world settings, with plans to create a pipeline generating various icon sizes from a single SVG upload.
- **Mobile Integration**: Plans to enable worlds to function more like mobile apps with proper "add to homescreen" support.

### Cryptocurrency Integration
- **On-Ramp Solutions**: Brief discussion about a new platform (likely Coinbase-related) that standardizes wallet API integration for converting fiat currency to cryptocurrency.
- **Regulatory Considerations**: Speculation that users might be able to load funds easily but would need full documentation to withdraw.
- **Business Benefits**: Cryptocurrency payments for online stores could save on credit card processing fees, offer quicker settlement times, and allow token holders to exchange directly into other tokens without bank settlement.

### Development Status
- HypPrivakos mentioned having a backend ready for importing (context unspecified) and needing to finish the frontend portion.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a way to turn post processing off as world owner so it can't be turned on by user?**  
A: No direct answer provided, but discussion revealed it's not currently possible.

**Q: Do unlit materials ignore post processing?**  
A: No, they ignore light information but post-processing still affects them (answered by vox)

**Q: What's causing the white background to appear darker with post-processing on?**  
A: It's the tone mapping in the post-processing pipeline using AgX (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How did they solve the on-ramp issue?**  
A: Possibly through standardizing Coinbase's wallet API and establishing partnerships rather than purely technical solutions (answered by maximus)

**Q: How might regulators treat this new platform?**  
A: Possibly by regulating the off-boarding process, requiring full documentation to withdraw funds (answered by maximus)

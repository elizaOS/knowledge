# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Post-Processing & Rendering
A significant technical discussion occurred around post-processing effects in Hyperfy worlds. MetaRick discovered that pure white worlds appear darker when post-processing is enabled due to tonemapping in the post-processing pipeline (specifically AgX). The issue is compounded when sunlight pushes 100% white colors into HDR range, triggering bloom effects. Various solutions were explored including unlit materials, emissive materials, and adjusting sun intensity, with setting sun to 0 emerging as a viable workaround.

### UI & Loading Experience
Ashxn announced the addition of a new image option to world menus and loading screens, including a "v1 loader" that was positively received by the community. 0mka noted recent improvements showing world name/description and images during loading. There are also plans for favicon support to enable app-like experiences on mobile devices, allowing worlds to function like mobile apps with "add to homescreen" functionality.

### Infrastructure Improvements
Ash implemented multi-stage Docker builds resulting in faster build times through better cache layer utilization and a 58% reduction in final image size (from 98MB to 40MB). This change also removed a previously needed `| exit 0` hack that HypPrivakos had implemented as a workaround for a build system issue.

### Cryptocurrency & Token Strategy
Brief discussions occurred about cryptocurrency on-ramps and a new platform (likely related to Coinbase) that simplifies crypto transactions. The Hyper token's price movements were noted, with strategic suggestions to focus on growing liquidity, expanding the holder base, and building narrative-driven strategies before implementing DAO or staking features. CEX listings were suggested as a strategic move to bring in more users and stabilize the price.

### Technical Issues
0mka reported being unable to add VRM files as a base - when selecting a file through the browser, the application returns to a blank VRM placeholder without loading. Ash suggested checking for console errors and trying different VRM files, noting the functionality was working correctly for them.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What's causing the white skybox to appear darker with post-processing on?**  
A: It's the tonemapping in the post-processing pipeline, specifically using AgX (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Do unlit materials ignore post processing?**  
A: No, unlit materials ignore light information but post-processing still affects them (answered by vox)

**Q: What should be prioritized before implementing DAO or staking?**  
A: Growing liquidity, expanding holders, building narrative-driven strategies, and considering CEX listings (answered by simk)

**Q: How did they solve the on-ramp issue for crypto?**  
A: Possibly through partnerships rather than technical solutions, with partners likely getting a cut to support it (answered by maximus)

**Q: What changes were made to the Dockerfile?**  
A: Multi-stage builds were implemented, resulting in faster builds and reduced image size from 98MB to 40MB (answered by ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

**Post-Processing Troubleshooting**  
Ashxn and vox helped MetaRick diagnose issues with white worlds appearing darker with post-processing enabled. They identified the cause as tonemapping in the post-processing pipeline and bloom effects triggered by sunlight. Various solutions were suggested, with MetaRick eventually discovering that setting sun to 0 fixes the issue.

**Loading Screen Optimization**  
Ashxn advised vox on optimizing loading screen images, recommending small jpg/png/webp files under 300kb for faster loading. Several members also discussed using webp format for optimizing texture sizes in worlds.

**VRM File Loading Issue**  
Ash responded to 0mka's report about VRM files not loading by suggesting console error checking and trying different files, offering a path to diagnose the problem.

**Docker Build Improvements**  
Ash improved the Hyperfy Dockerfile with multi-stage builds, which HypPrivakos acknowledged would automatically benefit their platform that fetches images directly from the GitHub repository.

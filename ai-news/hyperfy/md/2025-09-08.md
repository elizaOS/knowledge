# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Hyper-nat Update**: Teknopath announced updates to hyper-nat, making it npx-based and Hyperfy-friendly for pair programming without servers. Users can now share local Hyperfy games directly via the "npx hyper-nat" command.
- **Error Reporting PR**: Teknopath shared progress on a PR related to error reporting for blueprint modifications, focusing on state consolidation for debugging tooling.
- **Platform Status**: Ash mentioned that Vibe World was temporarily down with building and AI features disabled.
- **Security Alert**: A discussion about npm package security occurred, with ash confirming Hyperfy wasn't affected due to its intentionally minimal dependencies.

### VR/AR Development
- **OpenXR Compatibility**: Teknopath noted that Hyperfy works on Quest 3 with some limitations, particularly around controller button mapping.
- **AR Use Cases**: Discussion about potential AR applications included card games with AI-generated models and interactions, ping pong games, and assembly/disassembly simulations on tabletops.

### Project Philosophy
- **Token Economics vs. Technology**: A debate emerged about whether investor focus on token transparency (unlock schedules, allocations) should take priority over technological development.

### 3D Design
- Brief mentions of prompting techniques being used by community members, with vox creating a "Prop Library" and Dhin working on a "franchise."

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Do you have any suggestions for an animated .glb object that doesn't animate in my space?** (asked by Nicola Bertoglio)  
**A:** "Download the .hype file, drag and drop it in your world, click the cube icon and upload your .glb and then in the .hype app UI select the animation." (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)

**Q: How do I toggle the free roam camera in v2? This was "P" in v1.** (asked by untitled, xyz)

**Q: Does anyone have an AR use case?** (asked by MetaMike)  
**A:** "The main one I have is playing card games where you can play a card and AI/code generates a model and interaction between the cards in play." (answered by maximus)

**Q: Are the npm packages in the security alert used by Hyperfy?** (asked by maximus)  
**A:** "Nah I think we good. We intentionally don't have many dependencies to avoid bloat, which I guess is useful here." (answered by ash)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-20

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Progress
- **Chat Clear Command**: Developers are implementing a `/chat clear` command with proper server-client synchronization, requiring careful handling of network events to ensure all clients receive updates.
- **Builder Mode Improvements**: Work continues on object scaling in builder mode using shift+scroll, though implementing scale persistence when placing objects has proven challenging.
- **VR Integration**: Controller models have been added to the main branch, improving the VR experience. VR functionality is now available on both dev and main branches.
- **Asset Optimization**: Extensive discussions about optimizing 3D assets for web performance, with focus on draw calls, material consolidation, and polygon reduction techniques.
- **Skybox Implementation**: Users showcased projects using Blockade Labs skyboxes, noting good reflection quality despite using low-resolution HDR images (400x200).

### Avatar & VRM Standards
- **Spring Bones**: Detailed technical exchange about adding spring bones to VRM avatars for dangling elements like earrings.
- **A-pose to T-pose Conversion**: Methods shared for converting between pose standards in Blender.
- **VRM Performance Guidelines**: Discussion of optimal material counts and polygon limits for avatars (1 material is best, 2-3 is fine, 3-6 is high end, 6+ is heavy).
- **Non-humanoid VRMs**: Interest in developing standards for non-humanoid digital avatars.

### Integrations & APIs
- **Venice AI Integration**: Discussion about integrating Venice AI with existing applications, potentially bypassing the Eliza app to connect directly to Venice AI agents.
- **Solana Wallet Integration**: Ongoing work on token transactions through Solana wallets.

### Market & Token Discussion
- **HYPER Token**: Users tracked the price of Hyperfy (HYPER/SOL) token, with market cap fluctuating between approximately 9.1M and 10.9M SOL.
- **Market Sentiment**: Some users described current conditions as a "mini bear market inside a bull market" with continued DCA strategies.

## Key Questions & Answers

**VR & Interactions**
- Q: Does VR work on the dev branch?  
  A: Yes, it's also on main branch but without controller models.

- Q: How can I make an action ontrigger activate by player proximity and not E?  
  A: Don't use an action. Instead create a trigger zone using rigidbody with a collider.

- Q: How do I set up automatic doors with proximity triggers?  
  A: Use the same approach as other triggers, probably with a sphere collider for distance-based activation.

**UI & Development**
- Q: How do we add an image into a UI window?  
  A: Use UIImage component.

- Q: How can I use the .onPointerDown on a uiview?  
  A: It works with the crosshair pointer, check the stereo app on hyperworld.

- Q: Are there docs somewhere for packaging things up into .hyp apps?  
  A: After you write a script with a model, click the download button - only way to create apps.

**3D Design & Optimization**
- Q: How do I add spring bones for dangling elements like earrings in VRM?  
  A: Extrude new bones from the head armature, position them along the chain links, assign vertex weights, and set them as spring bones in the VRM panel.

- Q: How do I convert an A-pose to T-pose for VRMs in Blender?  
  A: Use the "Set Current Position as Rest Pose" technique described at egneva.com, or use the export pose option in VRM for Blender.

- Q: How many materials should a VRM have for optimal performance?  
  A: 1 is best, 2-3 is fine, 3-6 is on the high end, 6+ is heavy.

- Q: How do draw calls work with materials and meshes?  
  A: Each material creates a draw call. 1 mesh with 5 materials is 5 draw calls, 5 meshes with 1 material each is 5 draw calls, 5 meshes with 5 materials each is 25 draw calls.

- Q: Does Hyperfy support vertex colors?  
  A: Yes, vertex colors applied in Blender or other software will display in Hyperfy.

**Integration & Assets**
- Q: Should the chat be pointed to a different Venice AI agent or set up on the code side instead?  
  A: It could be set up to bypass Eliza and go directly to Venice.

- Q: Can I get the Hyperfy vending machine?  
  A: It's in the Hyperfy.how repo.

- Q: Is there any guide on how do you mint an NFT that contains VRM?  
  A: You can try to mint a VRM using Manifold.

## Community Help & Collaboration

**Developer Assistance**
- **Ashxn** helped **devilsadvocate.sol** implement the chat clear command with proper network synchronization by explaining how to simplify the implementation using broadcast parameters and removing unnecessary code.
- **Omka** assisted **devilsadvocate.sol** with adding images to UI windows by sharing code examples showing how to use the UIImage component with proper properties.
- **Ashxn** guided **Omka** in creating proximity-based triggers without requiring E key press by explaining how to use rigidbody with collider instead of actions.

**3D Design Support**
- **ii_cable_ii** provided **devilsadvocate.sol** with detailed step-by-step instructions for adding spring bones to VRM avatars, including bone extrusion, weight painting, and VRM panel configuration.
- **voxvienne** helped **treed** with optimizing 3D architectural assets for web performance, providing feedback on triangle count and file size, suggesting checking gltf.report, and sharing examples of well-optimized architecture.
- **Sceth iii** demonstrated to **treed** how to reduce polygon count from 105k to 60k using ZBrush decimation while maintaining model fidelity.
- **Ashxn** clarified for **TheMattEmpire** how draw calls work with materials and meshes, explaining that materials equal shaders and each creates a draw call, with detailed examples.

**Integration & Tools**
- **MetaMike** offered to help **saltï** set up an agent that bypasses Eliza and connects directly to Venice AI.
- **decentralize*** shared specific optimization tools (gltf.report, glb.babylonpress.org) for checking RAM usage and optimizing images, and recommended Spark AR add-on for Blender.
- **ToxSam** explained to **treed** that VRM can be stored in NFT metadata, mentioned previous projects (Cryptoavatars and VIPE), and suggested using Manifold for minting.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-21

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Updates

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Is there a way for the screenshare to have audio as well? (asked by ~/drdoge.eth)  
   **A**: Chrome only lets you share audio if you pick a specific tab to share instead of fullscreen and only audio from that tab itself. Full audio would require an OBS stream or similar. (answered by Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

   Ashxn helped ~/drdoge.eth understand Chrome's limitations with audio sharing during screen sharing and suggested OBS as an alternative for full audio capture.

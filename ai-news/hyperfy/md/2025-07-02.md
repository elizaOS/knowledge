## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Does anyone know if there is a .hyp that uses world.get(key) and world.set(key, value)?  
   **A**: The portal app uses these functions to store teleport positions.

2. **Q**: Is there some kind of open "hyps we want" board?  
   **A**: There isn't a formal board, but looking at v1 apps provides a reference for hyps that could be ported.

3. **Q**: Do we have an app that can show a designated webpage in the world?  
   **A**: No webview functionality exists in v2 yet. Screen sharing can be used as a workaround.

4. **Q**: Is there a screensharing .hyp yet?  
   **A**: Yes, but with limitations - users can't interact with it like a website.

5. **Q**: The screen.hyp only shares video but no audio - is that by design or a bug?  
   **A**: (Unanswered in the chat)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-02

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Topics
- **Hyperfy Engine Development**: Ash was identified as the primary developer working on the Hyperfy engine, with ongoing work on various platform capabilities.
- **Wallet Connect Changes**: Discussion about potential deprecation issues due to wallet connect changes, with speculation that it's related to wallet connect changing to "reown".
- **Data Storage Solutions**: Exploration of IPFS/Arweave integration for storing NFT metadata and world folders, with interest in streaming world folders from these decentralized storage solutions.
- **Hyps Development**: Conversations about porting existing v1 apps to the new hyp format, with references to examples like the portal app that uses world.get(key) and world.set(key, value) functions.
- **VR Functionality**: Interest in expanding VR controls beyond basic "action" functionality, with suggestions for implementing raycasting from player bones to UI elements in-world (similar to Resonite/Neos).
- **Web Content Display**: Clarification that v2 doesn't yet support webviews, though screensharing is available as a workaround. There's mention that iframe/webview functionality might be added to core/nodes in the future.
- **Media Sharing**: Discussion about screen.hyp which shares video but not audio, with uncertainty whether this is intentional or a bug.

### Project Status & Business
- **Financial Runway**: When asked about the project's financial situation, Ashxn confirmed they have runway for "a few years" but indicated this will change upon launch.
- **Project Longevity**: Discussion about Hyperfy's sustainability, with Agent12 noting that "World Owners" have been using Hyperfy without airdrops for nearly 4 years, suggesting strong community support.
- **Token Performance**: Some users expressed concern about token prices, while others emphasized the importance of building and contributing rather than focusing solely on token value.
- **Project89**: Mentions of Project89, which was built on Hyperfy, with clarification that it's an established AI project showcasing Hyperfy technology through their partnership.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does anyone know if there is a .hyp that uses world.get(key) and world.set(key, value)?**  
A: "Yeah ummm the portal app iirc. It uses it to store the teleport position." (Ashxn)

**Q: Is there some kind of open "hyps we want" board?**  
A: "Yeah there is a board of hyps you simply gotta look at v1 again and scroll through the available apps." (b0gie)

**Q: Do we have an app that is a screen in the world can show a designated webpage?**  
A: "Nope no webview in v2 yet. But you can use screenshare and show a tab or a stream." (0mka)

**Q: Is there a screensharing .hyp yet?**  
A: A link was provided to an existing resource, with the note that you can't interact with it like a site from in-world. (0mka)

**Q: Why project89 mega pump?**  
A: "Two completely different projects that do different things. Not sure how you would compare them. I think you're only looking at price and that's why you're confused." (Shiffty)

**Q: How much runway do you have?**  
A: "Right now we're good for a few years but this will change when we launch 🚀" (Ashxn)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-22

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI-Generated Content
- A new feature allows users to prompt AI to create 3D objects in Hyperfy worlds
- The "vibe world" contains 300+ AI-generated objects with impressive stats (1 million triangles)
- Several AI models are being used for generation (Sonnet 4, Grok 4, Qwen 3 Coder via OpenRouter)
- Cost efficiency is a consideration - the vibe world cost around $5-10 to generate
- Technical challenges include world crashes from overly complex AI-generated objects

### Technical Infrastructure
- Discussions about self-hosting LiveKit servers on affordable VPS ($4/month)
- Configuration details shared for using S3 storage for assets and PostgreSQL for databases
- Environment variables needed for external storage and database configuration
- Performance evaluation of different storage solutions being considered

### 3D Design & Animation
- Implementation of water animation in a 3D planet model created with Hyperfy Tool in Blender
- Techniques for maintaining collision properties while animating textures
- Node referencing in scripts for animation control
- UV distortion for realistic water movement effects

### Project Development Concerns
- Community frustration about delayed features (economic flywheel, asset marketplace, agent-ran worlds)
- Tension between users expecting faster development and team members explaining behind-the-scenes work
- Reassurances from team members that significant work is happening despite lack of visible progress

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What are the stats for the vibe world?**  
A: 21 materials, 39 geometries, 84 draw calls, 1 MILLION triangles, 300 AI generated objects (answered by ash)

**Q: Which AI models are best for balance of speed and price?**  
A: Sonnet 4 and Grok 4 are best balance of speed and price without blowing credits (answered by ash)

**Q: Is there a way to add OpenRouter support?**  
A: Just changing the endpoint URL is needed as the API is identical to OpenAI (answered by HowieDuhzit)

**Q: How can we handle crashes from complex AI-generated objects?**  
A: Adding a limit to the prompt to prevent creation of objects that crash the world (answered by ash)

**Q: What was promised that hasn't been delivered?**  
A: Economic flywheel, interoperable in-game asset marketplace, agent-ran worlds (e.g. agent-ran stock market) (answered by zobo)

**Q: How to self-host LiveKit?**  
A: Follow the documentation at https://docs.livekit.io/home/self-hosting/vm/ (answered by HypPrivakos)

**Q: How to configure S3 storage for assets?**  
A: Set up environment variables including ASSETS=s3, ASSETS_BASE_URL pointing to your CloudFront or S3 URL, and ASSETS_S3_URI with your access credentials and S3 path (answered by DevStarlight)

**Q: Is there a way to make water move while keeping collision in Hyperfy?**  
A: Yes, the script will use the mesh with applied texture you want scrolling. Collision will stay intact. (answered by vox)

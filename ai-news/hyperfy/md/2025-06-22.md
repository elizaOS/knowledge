# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-22

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Issues
- **App Contexts System**: Ashxn proposed a concept where apps could have different contexts - either "being placed in the world" or "being held by a player," allowing items like fishing rods to behave differently based on context.
- **Inventory System Debate**: The team discussed implementing a standardized inventory system versus maintaining flexibility for developers. Some argued a conventional approach would improve UX but might limit creativity, while others suggested providing core functionality with an option to disable it.
- **Rendering Pipeline Issues**: Transparency issues and light leaking problems were reported in the "89 world" project. The render-pipeline branch was intended to fix transparency ordering issues, but some problems persisted.
- **Asset Deployment Problems**: Multiple users reported assets appearing as red cubes when deployed to online servers despite working perfectly in local testing. This affected files between 20MB and 90MB, possibly related to version mismatches or file size limits.
- **LiveKit False Errors**: A LiveKit error incorrectly warns about including API secrets in web client bundles. This was identified as a false error caused by LiveKit's code incorrectly detecting the environment.

### HYPER Token Concerns
- **Token Management**: Community members expressed worry about the HYPER token's declining value and perceived lack of management strategy.
- **Tokenomics Requests**: Several users requested more active token management, including market making, a clear tokenomics plan, and a visible roadmap.
- **Value Approach Debate**: Some members compared HYPER to the REKT token approach, where value derives from brand recognition rather than direct utility or revenue sharing.
- **Project vs. Token Focus**: There's tension between the team's focus on long-term project development versus addressing short-term token performance concerns.

### Documentation & Resources
- **Documentation URL Change**: The Hyperfy documentation URL changed from hyperfy.how to docs.hyperfy.xyz, causing confusion for some users.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is an inventory system broadly applicable to a 3D immersive experience?**  
A: Ashxn agreed with concerns but suggested a minimal backpack button approach with disable option.

**Q: What is the "light leak" issue?**  
A: It refers to sun leaking through mesh in a cookie cutter style, possibly not working due to flipped normals.

**Q: Why do some models only work on local server but show as red boxes on online servers?**  
A: Potentially due to version mismatches between local and server environments. File size (20-90MB) may also be a factor.

**Q: Do triggers work in VR?**  
A: They should work in VR according to 0mka, who offered to test and update if needed.

**Q: Why is LiveKit throwing an API secret error?**  
A: It's a false error because LiveKit incorrectly detects the environment by checking for 'document' global variable.

**Q: What do you think about concerns regarding lack of token management?**  
A: Ashxn: "I can't give financial advice. Founders have 15% vesting over three years. If you understand our tech and platform economics, you can make your own judgment calls."

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Inventory System Implementation**: hiroP helped Ashxn by suggesting using engine functionality with reference implementation that developers could use or customize.

- **89 World Navigation**: 0mka helped Ashxn who couldn't find items/wearables in the 89 world, explaining that Ashxn only saw the dock and needed to set their name.

- **Deployment Troubleshooting**: HypPrivakos (who runs HyperWorld.Host) offered to help ovo troubleshoot assets appearing as red cubes when deployed to online servers.

- **Documentation Access**: HypPrivakos helped CheddarQueso by providing the correct docs URL (docs.hyperfy.xyz) when the old URL was down.

- **Token Perspective**: Rick shared a tweet about REKT's approach to tokens as brand coins, which johan expanded upon to explain how tokens can derive value from project success rather than direct utility.

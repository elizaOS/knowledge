## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Architecture
- **App Contexts & Inventory System**: Ashxn proposed expanding app contexts beyond "placed in world" to include "held by player," enabling different behaviors for items like fishing rods depending on context. This sparked debate about implementing inventory systems in 3D environments.
- **Flexibility vs. Convention**: The team discussed balancing developer freedom with standardized systems. Several members suggested an inventory system with an off switch would provide the best compromise.
- **Reference Implementation**: The "89 world" was mentioned as having implemented an items/wearables system that could serve as a reference for others.

### Asset Rendering Issues
- A user reported assets appearing as red cubes when deployed to online servers despite rendering correctly in local testing, potentially due to version mismatches.

### Token Economics & Community Concerns
- **Token Value Concerns**: Community members expressed worry about declining token value and perceived lack of tokenomics strategy.
- **Team Response**: Ashxn noted founders have 15% vesting over three years and emphasized focus on technology over short-term price action.
- **Strategic Planning**: Community members requested more visibility on roadmap, milestones, and token management strategy.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
- **Q**: Who designed the room shown in the image? (Ashxn)  
  **A**: "home and 89" (0mka)

- **Q**: Where can items/wearable items be found in the 89 world? (Ashxn)  
  **A**: Ashxn only saw the dock because they didn't set their name (0mka)

### Technical Issues
- **Q**: How can I fix uploaded assets turning into red cubes when deploying to an online server? (ovo)  
  **A**: It may be due to mismatched versions between local and server worlds (b0gie)

### Token Economics
- **Q**: What do you think about this [concern about patient/patience in crypto projects]? (simk)  
  **A**: "I can't really give financial advice. Founders have 15% vesting over three years. People lose their minds when the market as a whole is in a bad place." (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Inventory System Implementation**
   - **Helper**: hiroP
   - **Helpee**: Ashxn
   - **Resolution**: Suggested a middle-ground where the engine enables functionality while providing a reference implementation that developers can choose to use or replace

2. **89 World Navigation**
   - **Helper**: 0mka
   - **Helpee**: Ashxn
   - **Resolution**: Explained Ashxn needed to set their name to see beyond the dock area

3. **Asset Rendering Troubleshooting**
   - **Helper**: b0gie
   - **Helpee**: ovo
   - **Resolution**: Suggested checking for version mismatches between local and server worlds

## Action Items

### Technical
- Develop standard hooks (events) for backpack/inventory system (Shiffty)
- Develop a "standard item" implementation for interoperability (Shiffty)
- Verify version consistency between local and server worlds when assets appear as red cubes (b0gie)
- Develop a token management strategy and tokenomics action plan (simk)
- Evaluate relationship with ai16z to minimize potential negative impacts (haihui)
- Consider strategic timing for token value initiatives relative to unlocking periods (ai16zgm)

### Documentation
- Document common causes for assets appearing as red cubes in deployed worlds (ovo)
- Create visible roadmap with short and long-term milestones (simk)

### Feature
- Implement cross-device controls for picking up and placing apps with action bar/backpack (Ashxn)
- Create app contexts (world placement vs. being held by player) (Ashxn)
- Ensure inventory/backpack system has an off switch for flexibility (b0gie and 0mka)
- Implement market making or token management mechanisms (simk)

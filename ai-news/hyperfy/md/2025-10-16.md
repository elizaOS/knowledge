# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Architecture
- **App Structure Requirements**: A fundamental discussion clarified that all applications in the platform require a GLB file as their foundation, even when the app's functionality is primarily script-based. JavaScript files should be packaged with a "tiny invisible GLB" since apps are built into the core as GLB files first, with scripts and configuration attached optionally.

### Token Utility & Integration
- **HYPER Token Applications**: Discussions about the utility of the HYPER token (an SPL token on Solana) focused on potential integrations with custom smart contracts and world access gating.
- **Community-Driven Utility**: Agent12 proposed "Pump.World" concept where users could create initial liquidity positions and gate world access using custom tokens, allowing the community to create its own utility.

### VR Interaction Mechanisms
- **Dual Interaction Support**: Recent development changes now support both action interaction and click interaction with a trigger in VR environments.
- **VR Rendering Issue**: A potential issue was identified where the trigger with a circle on E is not visible in Quest 2 when viewing non-main branch worlds.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Do I need a GLB file even if my app is just a JavaScript script that spawns a floating UI with no visible 3D elements?  
   **A**: Yes, you still need a .glb file - even if it's empty or invisible. Apps require a GLB file as the physical entity in the 3D world, while the script file provides the behavior and logic.

2. **Q**: Is it possible to gate a world with tokens?  
   **A**: It's possible but would require going backwards on the current dev fork.

3. **Q**: Could we create utility with Hyper using our own smart contracts on Solana?  
   **A**: Yes, as HYPER is a standard SPL token on Solana, it can be integrated into custom smart contracts for transactions.

4. **Q**: How do I make an avatar sit on the floor with crossed legs?  
   **A**: Use "the emote app" (with a Discord channel link provided for reference).

## Action Items

### Technical
1. **Automatic GLB Packaging**: Consider implementing automatic packaging of JavaScript files with tiny invisible GLB files when users drop a JS file (Mentioned by ash)
2. **VR Trigger Visibility**: Investigate why the trigger with circle on E is not visible in VR (Quest 2) on non-main-branch worlds (Mentioned by Enryt)
3. **Token-Gated Access**: Explore implementation of world gating using HYPER tokens by investigating reverting to previous dev fork (Mentioned by Agent12)
4. **Smart Contract Development**: Develop community-driven utility for HYPER token through custom smart contracts (Mentioned by MetaDJ)

### Feature Requests
1. **Token Staking**: Implement staking functionality for HYPER token to provide utility and incentivize holding (Mentioned by MetaDJ)
2. **Pump.World Functionality**: Create system allowing users to create liquidity positions and gate worlds with custom tokens (Mentioned by Agent12)

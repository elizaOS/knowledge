# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Progress
- **Hyperfy V2 Development**: Significant progress with new features including UI pointer events, physics improvements, and primitive shape creation capabilities.
- **Domain Change**: Transition from hyperfy.host to HyperWorld.host with automatic redirects being implemented.
- **Engine Performance**: Impressive capabilities demonstrated with Ashxn stacking approximately 50 full buildings with collision detection without performance issues.
- **Hyperball Game**: Development of a team-based game with lobby mechanics, including player sorting into teams and game initialization.

### Technical Implementations
- **Chat Commands**: Implementation using `world.on('chat')` to listen for messages and process commands with or without the "/" prefix.
- **Physics and Collision**: Debugging of mesh collider issues with solutions involving cooking parameters for physics objects.
- **UI Development**: New pointer events (onPointerDown, onPointerEnter, onPointerLeave) and event bubbling behavior similar to web standards.
- **New Features**: UV scrolling for animated textures, global events with world.emit(), player-specific events with world.sendTo(), camera controls, and primitive shape creation.
- **App Communication**: Consensus that apps should communicate via events rather than directly accessing each other's state.

### Platform Strategy
- **Marketplace Plans**: Development of a modular code/script marketplace where developers can share or sell components with revenue sharing between Hyperfy and its DAO.
- **Environment Specialization**: play.hyperfy.xyz should be curated as a playground featuring various interactive elements, while build.hyperfy.xyz should be for free building.
- **Marketing Strategy**: ckbubbles provided detailed marketing advice, suggesting documentation on brand identity, target audiences, and campaign goals.
- **Merchandise Integration**: Discussion about using WebView in v1 to show store websites in-world or attach click listeners to digital versions.

### Token Discussion
- **HYPER Price Action**: Significant downward movement (dropping over 39%) with team members emphasizing the long-term vision of Hyperfy as a platform.
- **Monetization Strategy**: People are already paying for hosting services, and there will be a marketplace with fees shared between Hyperfy and the DAO.

### Technical Tools
- **Model Conversion**: Discussion about converting safetensor model files to GGUF format using llama.cpp's "hf_to_gguf.py" script.
- **Discord Bot**: HPrivakos offered to code a bot for "starring" helpful messages within 15 minutes.
- **Enhanced App Inspection**: Tool for precise positioning and "freezing" apps to prevent accidental movement.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
- **Q**: How are chat commands handled in Hyperfy?  
  **A**: Commands with '/' are handled in core, but apps can listen for them using world.on("chat") and process the command by stripping the slash.

- **Q**: How do we output to chat?  
  **A**: Use world.chat() with message object and broadcast flag.

- **Q**: How can apps communicate with each other?  
  **A**: Apps should use events rather than directly accessing state, using app.send(), app.on(), world.emit(), and world.sendTo().

- **Q**: How do I scale a model?  
  **A**: Use app.scale.set(x,y,z) but you must first set app.position.set(x,y,z).

- **Q**: How do I create primitive shapes programmatically?  
  **A**: Use app.create('mesh') with box.type = 'box' and box.setSize(1,3,1).

- **Q**: How do I prevent event bubbling in nested UI elements?  
  **A**: Use e.stopPropagation() in the child element's event handler.

- **Q**: Is collision applied automatically to objects?  
  **A**: No, in V1 it happened automatically but now requires a Blender addon.

### Platform & Business
- **Q**: In a hyperfy world what would be the easiest way to integrate the ability for visitors to buy some merch?  
  **A**: In v1 you can use a WebView to show your store website in-world or attach click listeners to digital versions that open a buy page in a new tab.

- **Q**: When is v2 expected to be released?  
  **A**: It is released, check the links.

- **Q**: How will Hyperfy monetize?  
  **A**: People are already paying for hosting services, and there will be a marketplace with fees shared between Hyperfy and the DAO.

### Technical
- **Q**: Does anyone have a recommendation for converting safetensor files to gguf files?  
  **A**: Try unsloth, there's something in the colabs that convert to gguf. Also, llama.cpp's "hf_to_gguf.py" script can handle the conversion.

- **Q**: How is it possible to stack so many buildings with no performance issues?  
  **A**: Due to Hyperfy's engine optimization, suggesting to "study the code" for understanding.

- **Q**: Would adding grass with sway animation and duplicating thousands of times be a good approach for environment grass?  
  **A**: Using shaders instead of animations with armatures would be better for grass implementation.

## Community Help & Collaboration

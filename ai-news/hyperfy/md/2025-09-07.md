# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Updates
- **hyper-nat Update**: The tool has been updated to be npx-based and Hyperfy-friendly, enabling direct game sharing without servers. This facilitates pair programming without requiring server setup.
- **Vibe World Downtime**: A temporary downtime was reported for the "vibe world" with building and AI features disabled.
- **Error Logging PR**: A proposed PR for enhanced error logging functionality aims to improve remote debugging capabilities.

### Technical Discussions
- **3D Model Imports**: Several users discussed challenges with importing and animating .glb files in Hyperfy spaces.
- **Security Concerns**: A discussion about potential npm package security vulnerabilities concluded that Hyperfy is likely unaffected due to its intentionally minimal dependencies.
- **OpenXR Compatibility**: Questions were raised about Hyperfy's compatibility with OpenXR standards.

### Community & General
- The general channel had minimal technical discussion, mostly consisting of greetings and brief comments about token prices.
- One user (lucyhail) mentioned buying dips as a hedge, expecting a future shift from 2D smartphones to metaverse technology.
- HypPrivakos suggested that focusing on token price misses the value of the underlying technology.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: How do I make an animated .glb object work in my Hyperfy space? (asked by Nicola Bertoglio)  
   **A**: Download the .hype file, drag and drop it in your world, click the cube icon, upload your .glb, and select the animation in the .hype app UI. (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)

2. **Q**: Are the npm packages in the recent security breach affecting Hyperfy? (asked by maximus)  
   **A**: No, Hyperfy intentionally has minimal dependencies to avoid bloat, which helps in this case. (answered by ash)

3. **Q**: Why focus on token price instead of the technology? (asked by HypPrivakos)  
   **A**: "Because I already know there is good technology, that's why I looked at the price" (answered by lucyhail)

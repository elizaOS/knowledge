# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy v2 Release & Development
- Hyperfy v2 has been released as an open-source platform for building 3D virtual worlds
- The code is available on GitHub, with developers already testing and building with it
- V2 represents a major shift from NFT-gated worlds to a self-hostable metaverse platform
- The platform can run on minimal server specs ("will basically run on a potato")
- Persistence functionality was recently added to the platform
- App development is the next priority for the team
- V1 will remain hosted with no timeline for deprecation

### Technical Infrastructure
- Developers are discussing setup issues with VPS services like DigitalOcean
- Proper WebSocket configuration is critical for deployment
- HTTPS setup with Nginx is recommended for file uploads to work correctly
- Admin permissions can be configured via environment variables
- The platform can support up to 100 users per instance
- Multi-instance hosting automatically creates new instances when limits are reached

### $HYPER Token
- Airdrop claim period ends January 12th, with ~11% of total supply still unclaimed
- Unclaimed tokens will be permanently locked/burned
- The token is trading on BingX with significant price volatility ($0.29 to $0.08)
- $HYPER will be used as a native token for value exchange between creators, users, and community
- Team members have hinted at potential staking functionality in the future

### 3D Assets & Design
- Community discussing optimization techniques for 3D models
- AI tools like TRELLIS and Stable Point Aware 3D recommended for generating models
- Blender's decimate modifier suggested for quick polygon reduction
- Issues identified with certain GLB models causing screen flickering in worlds
- VRM support is in v2 core but needs to be exposed via apps

### AI Integration
- Discussion about AI agent integration through ElizaOS
- Interactive NPCs that respond to natural language are being developed
- Third-party AI agent frameworks may be supported in the future
- AI integration in gaming is generating excitement in the community

## Key Questions & Answers

### Platform & Development
- **Q: How do I access player position?**  
  **A:** `world.entities.player` is the local player, can check in console

- **Q: Can we send and receive Solana tokens inside Hyperfy world?**  
  **A:** Yes, but probably not how you're thinking yet

- **Q: How do I set up admin permissions?**  
  **A:** If your .env has `ADMIN_CODE=` and it's empty, anyone can drag and drop. If you give it a value like `ADMIN_CODE=hyper`, nobody can build, but admins can type `/admin hyper` to get the role

- **Q: What are the specs needed for a server to run Hyperfy?**  
  **A:** The barebones version will run on minimal hardware ("a potato")

- **Q: What are the limits for a world to still be loadable in under 5 minutes?**  
  **A:** Events with close to 100 people in the same instance have been run successfully. World optimization is important, but with many users, avatar optimization becomes the larger concern

- **Q: If I put a limit for each instance, does it create automatically a new instance when the limit is reached?**  
  **A:** Yes, the 101st user will go to a new instance when trying to join

- **Q: Is v1 going to still be online or going to disappear?**  
  **A:** V1 will stay hosted for now with no timeline of when worlds will be deprecated

- **Q: If I make a world, is it possible to NFT gate it?**  
  **A:** Yes, gating could be done using world portals where access is only given to people with a certain flag set, which could reference a blockchain

### Token & Economics
- **Q: What will happen to the airdrops that are not claimed after the 12th?**  
  **A:** They will be left unclaimed, essentially burned

- **Q: How much hasn't been claimed?**  
  **A:** About 11% of total supply

- **Q: Will apps have any sort of relationship with $HYPER?**  
  **A:** Tokens will come in as a native supported token to exchange values between creators/users/community

- **Q: Is there any staking coming for token?**  
  **A:** "I kinda hope so, i think there is room in the ecosystem for people to place an amount in a vault and that can be used to fuel something else."

- **Q: Does the "wallet not eligible" message mean there's a problem with my claim?**  
  **A:** No, it just means your address hasn't been added to a batch yet

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Support
- **HPrivakos** helped **vincentskele** with WebSocket connection issues on VPS deployment by providing .env configuration examples and suggesting HTTPS setup via Nginx
- **Ashxn** assisted **MetaMike** with accessing player position in the game, explaining that `world.entities.player` is the local player
- **Valiant** helped **maximus** troubleshoot a VRM file with loading errors, identifying MToon-related issues and creating a working version
- **Ashxn** diagnosed screen flickering issues with certain GLB models for **vincentskele**, identifying it as a post-processing bug

### Asset Creation & Optimization
- **hiroP** shared quick optimization techniques using Blender's decimate modifier to reduce polygon count
- **hiroP** provided links to TRELLIS and Stable Point Aware 3D for AI-generated models
- **Valiant** analyzed problematic GLB models for **vincentskele**, noting they weren't optimized for game-ready mesh standards

### Token & Airdrop Support
- **maximus** helped multiple users verify their SOL address was saved correctly for the airdrop by advising them to disconnect and reconnect to the site
- **ash** verified ETH addresses were properly linked to SOL addresses for **luckyotis1992**
- **Saori** provided the correct link and explained the claim process to **lulú**
- **devilsadvocate.sol** advised **jar0d** on token price swing strategies

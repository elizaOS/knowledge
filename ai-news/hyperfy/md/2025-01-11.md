# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy v2 Release & Development
- The recent release of Hyperfy v2 as an open-source platform for building 3D virtual worlds is generating significant community activity
- Developers are actively setting up their own instances on VPS services like DigitalOcean
- The platform is transitioning from NFT-gated worlds (v1) to an open-source, self-hostable metaverse platform (v2)
- V1 will remain hosted with no immediate timeline for deprecation while v2 is in alpha
- The team is working on making v2 more accessible with a one-click solution similar to website builders
- Performance optimization allows for up to 100 users per instance before automatically creating new instances

### Technical Infrastructure
- Common deployment issues include WebSocket connections, HTTPS configuration, and asset handling
- Developers need to set PUBLIC_WS_URL in .env file for proper WebSocket connectivity
- HTTPS configuration is necessary for drag-and-drop functionality to work properly
- The platform can run on minimal server specs ("will basically run on a potato")
- World assets are stored in the /world/assets folder with a db.sqlite file for persistence
- Backing up these files allows for world restoration or transfer

### AI Integration & Future Features
- AI agent integration through ElizaOS enables interactive NPCs that respond to natural language
- Some developers are exploring integration with other AI agent frameworks
- The team is working on apps integration with optional server authority features
- VRM avatar support exists in v2 core but needs to be exposed via apps
- Speech-to-text capabilities for AI agents are being considered for voice interaction
- AI-generated 3D models using tools like TRELLIS and Stable Point Aware 3D are being explored

### $HYPER Token
- The airdrop claim period ends January 12th with approximately 11% of total supply remaining unclaimed
- Unclaimed tokens will remain unclaimed permanently (effectively burned)
- The token is trading on BingX exchange with significant price volatility ($0.29 to $0.08)
- World NFT holders received 151,200 HYPER tokens each as an airdrop
- Token utility will include native currency within the ecosystem for value exchange between creators, users, and community
- Potential staking functionality is being considered

### 3D Design & Assets
- Discussions about control bones in 3D models and their limitations when exported outside Blender
- Issues with VRM files showing as valid in Blender but producing errors when loaded as avatars
- Problems with certain GLB models causing screen flickering in worlds, identified as a material or post-processing bug
- Need for optimized outdoor assets and environment elements
- Importance of proper mesh optimization for game-ready models

## Key Questions & Answers

**Platform & Development**
- **Q:** How do I access player position?  
  **A:** world.entities.player is the local player, can check in console (Ashxn)

- **Q:** Can we send and receive solana tokens inside hyperfy world?  
  **A:** You can, but probably not how you're thinking (yet) (vincentskele)

- **Q:** Why can't I drag and drop GLBs on my server like I can locally?  
  **A:** Your browser might not be happy because it's HTTP or it might be directory permissions issues (HPrivakos)

- **Q:** Are models placed in memory?  
  **A:** They're uploaded to your servers /world/assets folder. There's also a db.sqlite file in there. If you back this up you can restore or transfer your worlds (Ashxn)

- **Q:** Is VRM support live on v2?  
  **A:** VRMs in v2 core, just need to expose it via apps (Ashxn)

- **Q:** How can I see the latest version of hyperfy on github?  
  **A:** It's not an npm package (yet). You can just git clone or fork and run it as-is, with easy access to core if you need it (Ashxn)

- **Q:** Can someone explain the worlds? Is it possible to start a new world today?  
  **A:** No need to buy V1 worlds anymore, you can self-host the code and spin up a world on your own using instructions in the community documentation (maximus)

- **Q:** What are the specs needed for a server to run Hyperfy?  
  **A:** At least with the barebones version that's out now, it'll basically run on a potato (merk)

**World Performance & Features**
- **Q:** What are the limits for a world to still be loadable in under 5 minutes?  
  **A:** You can set a limit of around 50-100 people before a new instance is created. Performance depends on world optimization and avatar complexity (Cynnx)

- **Q:** If I put a limit for each instance, like 100 for example, does it create automatically a new instance when the limit is reached?  
  **A:** Yes, the 101st user will go to a new instance when trying to join (Cynnx)

- **Q:** Will the website index all V2 worlds? Is there a metaverse registry where we can make our world discoverable?  
  **A:** Yes, potentially through a portal. Since it's all web-based, worlds can be scanned using meta tags (Ashxn)

- **Q:** Is it possible to NFT gate a world in V2?  
  **A:** Yes, through multi-instance hosting and using world portals where access is controlled by blockchain verification (maximus)

- **Q:** Will V1 worlds stop working?  
  **A:** There will be a long wind-down period, and the team will work on solutions for the most visited/impressive V1 worlds (maximus)

**$HYPER Token**
- **Q:** What will happen to the airdrops that are not claimed after the 12th?  
  **A:** Left unclaimed, essentially burned (Ashxn)

- **Q:** How much hasn't been claimed?  
  **A:** About 11% of total supply (Ashxn)

- **Q:** Will apps have any sort of relationship with $HYPER?  
  **A:** Tokens will come in as a native supported token to exchange values between creators/users/community (maximus)

- **Q:** Is there any staking coming for token?  
  **A:** I kinda hope so, there is room in the ecosystem for people to place an amount in a vault that can be used to fuel something else (maximus)

- **Q:** How much HYPER did World owners get as airdrop?  
  **A:** 151,200 tokens per world (merk)

**3D Design**
- **Q:** Are control bones supposed to be exported?  
  **A:** It depends on the workflow - they can be useful for game engines or team sharing, but many prefer VRM rigs for simplicity (JUAN)

## Community Help & Collaboration

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Team Structure & Project Status
- **Leadership Changes**: Saori, one of the co-founders, has left the server and removed Hyperfy from social media profiles due to burnout
- **Development Continuity**: Ash confirmed he remains the main developer and is committed to the project with "runway for years"
- **Team Expansion Plans**: The team is considering adding a product/marketing manager rather than more developers
- **Community Feedback**: A survey is being conducted to gather community input on project direction

### Technical Development
- **Mob System Development**: Discussions about creating a general-purpose mob app that accepts VRMs with configurable aggro radius and damage settings
- **UI Update**: Ash released a new experimental UI that changes the entire interface, though some features like nodes/hierarchy viewer are missing
- **Collision Systems**: Several developers working on collision detection, particularly for mob hit detection similar to PVP sword functionality
- **Race Features**: Development of waypoints, gates with proximity triggers, and leaderboards for racing functionality
- **Animation Issues**: Users troubleshooting animation import problems where models appear as giant iconospheres
- **Butterfly Feature**: Implementation of Butterfly V5 with toggle for original and prevention of flying under ground plane

### Platform Capabilities
- **Texture Support**: Hyperfy doesn't yet support KTX textures or Draco compression due to server-side loading challenges
- **Collision Implementation**: Discussion about manually adding colliders in Blender versus using Hyperfy tools
- **Educational Series**: Ongoing Git/GitHub tutorial series with upcoming sessions on Architectural 3D design and Optimization

### Token & Business Concerns
- **Token Price**: Community expressed concerns about Hyper token's price decline, with a significant dip attributed to one wallet dumping $10k worth
- **Development Focus**: Team working on multiple fronts: attracting content creators, building games internally, developing a Roblox-like platform, and continuing core engine work
- **Roadmap Requests**: Community members expressed interest in seeing a more detailed roadmap and fully-formed games with competitive features

## Key Questions & Answers

### Project Status & Leadership
- **Q**: Who is behind this project and is there a roadmap? (Jayzen)
  **A**: Ash and Saori were the founders, with a handful of regulars working along (smickelbeard)

- **Q**: Is Saori no longer co-founder or just taking a break? (Lemur)
  **A**: "burnt out. it happens to the best of us" (ash)

- **Q**: Is hyperfy over? (cloudAI)
  **A**: Implied no by ash's continued commitment

- **Q**: Are you the only core developer of the current platform? (cloudAI)
  **A**: "I'm the main dev yes." (ash)

- **Q**: Any plans to hire more devs to help you out? (jingo)
  **A**: "it's less about raw development power... there's lots of developers that know hyperfy and are actively doing mods." (maximus)

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: How can I detect that an entity is inside a hitbox for mob combat? (peezy)
  **A**: Add a rigidbody and collider to the mob with a specific tag, then use overlap detection (ash)

- **Q**: How do I make a toggle button in the UI? (Gert-Jan Akerboom)
  **A**: Use the switch component (self-answered)

- **Q**: Where do I look to understand functions available to world, app, control, etc? (mattimus)
  **A**: Look at the ref section and the core/extras directory, particularly buttons.js for input controls (general hyper)

- **Q**: Why is my collider not working properly with my mesh? (general hyper)
  **A**: For concave meshes, you need to set convex=false to get proper collision (ash)

- **Q**: How to import collisions or a 3D model with collisions in a world? (MiaHigashikata)
  **A**: Use an app that auto-enables collisions for models, but note this feature was recently added to dev branch and might not be in main branch yet (ash)

- **Q**: Is KTX texture support available? (MiaHigashikata)
  **A**: No KTX/Draco support yet because server-side loading hasn't been solved; webp is recommended instead (ash)

- **Q**: Why do animations import to Blender as a giant iconosphere? (general hyper)
  **A**: They need to be downloaded from hyperfy-animations.vercel.app and imported as VRMs to Blender, then delete transforms on the hips for x,y,z (general hyper)

### Token & Business
- **Q**: Why's the mc so low now? What happened to it? (chckyo)
  **A**: Someone gave us a big sale on hyper! (0mka)

- **Q**: What I'm curious about is the actual release and commercialization of real games? (eigb)
  **A**: Engines and games take time to finish. Check more channels than hyper to see what's happening. Roadmap updates are underway. (0mka)

# Hyperfy Development Updates & Technical Discussions (2025-03-24)

## Mob System Development
- **[0xpeezy]** working on mobs with weapons, animations, and damage tied to weapon scripts.  
- **[ashxn.eth]** suggests a modular mob app (melee vs. ranged).  
- Client crashes with **10+ mob clones**, likely due to raycasting issues.  
- **Solution:** Use **rigidbody + collider** system with `mob:1` tag for hit detection.

## Animation Import to Blender
- **[.somethingmoreprofessional]** encountered an issue where animations imported as a **"giant iconosphere."**  
- Issue caused by downloading **GLBs that were actually VRMs**.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Procedural Generation & 3D Environments
- **Procedural Terrain Generation**: Shiffty showcased a system with collision detection that generated significant interest. The implementation used Perlin noise in an app with modified core access to vertices.
- **Primitive Shape Creation**: Developers discussed easier ways to generate shapes, with Ashxn suggesting an `app.create('prim')` function.
- **Image Processing Technology**: Valiant demonstrated a technique for recoloring/repainting images without upscaling, useful for creating 3D facades that match skybox moods/colors.

### Avatar Systems & Rigging
- **Non-humanoid Rigging**: Mugenomics attempted to implement a fish avatar despite lack of native non-humanoid rig support by splitting the model into separate objects and using scripting based on raptor scripts.
- **Avatar Resources**: Users shared marketplaces for VRM/VRChat avatars including Vket, BOOTH, Jinxxy, and Vroid Hub.
- **VRM Tools**: ToxSam shared updates to opensourceavatars.com including a VRM viewer for metadata inspection, though some avatars have compatibility issues between v1 and v2.

### Integration & Communication Tools
- **Discord Integration**: peezy created an app that broadcasts chat messages and player join/leave notifications from play.hyperfy.xyz to a Discord webhook.
- **Voice Technology**: Discussions about LiveKit's Kitt service and "crossing the uncanny valley of voice" from Sesame.com as potential voice solutions.

### Interactive Applications
- **Game Development**: Discussions about inventory systems, PVP mechanics for Hyperball, and the Risk game.
- **Interactive Objects**: Developers shared works-in-progress including a helicopter, projector screen with on/off functionality, and raptor AI.
- **UI Design**: Considerations for 3D environments and UI-triggered teleportation.

### Technical Implementations
- **UV Scrolling Effects**: Implementation using seamless alpha textures and roughness map optimization.
- **Multiple Browser Instances**: Developers discussed using incognito mode for testing after a recent change prevented opening multiple instances in the same browser.
- **LOD (Level of Detail)**: Explanation of why some objects remain visible at distance while others don't.

### HYPER Token
- Clarification that the team conducted a token launch rather than a fundraising round.
- Users checking token price and sharing tweets.
- Brief mention of Hyperdash as a Hyperliquid data platform.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How are you generating those random terrain meshes?**  
A: "Perlin in an app, modified core to get access to vertices and update them. Never got node.linked=false to work so I have a bunch of terrain cells (planes in blender) that I pool and move around as needed." (Shiffty)

**Q: Depending on the objects being placed, some objects are visible even if they are far away and others are not visible unless you get closer. What is the difference?**  
A: "LOD (Level of Detail)." (Omka)

**Q: Is there support for non-humanoid rigs?**  
A: "No non-humanoid rigs, as far as i'm aware...yet" (Valiant)

**Q: How can I implement a fish model without humanoid rig support?**  
A: "Start with fish body all above hips, ditch all optional vrm bones" (Valiant)

**Q: Can I repaint images based on my skybox mood/colors to blend in?**  
A: "Yeah, it's basically no brainer colour grading" (Valiant)

**Q: Correct me if I'm wrong but the team did a raise at some point right?**  
A: "No raise, just token launch" (devilsadvocate.sol)

**Q: Is that uv scrolling on the bottom thing?**  
A: "Yup! It's uv scrolling a mesh with a transparent emissive texture so you can actually still see underneath the glass." (cru)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Non-humanoid Rigging Solutions**:
   - Valiant helped Mugenomics implement a fish avatar by suggesting using VRM with the fish body above hips and ditching optional bones.
   - ~/HowiEDuhzit suggested using the base VRM armature but only utilizing needed bones while ignoring the rest.

2. **Multiple Browser Testing**:
   - Shiffty helped fractilians with opening multiple instances of a world by explaining a recent change and suggesting using different browsers or incognito mode.

3. **UI-Triggered Teleport Implementation**:
   - Ashxn helped Omka by explaining that world.playerId isn't a thing, and Saori provided information about teleporter hyps.

4. **Image Processing for 3D Environments**:
   - Valiant demonstrated to ùöüùöòùö°ùöüùöíùöéùöóùöóùöé a technique for repainting images without upscaling that maintains quality while adapting colors.

5. **Avatar Compatibility Issues**:
   - peezy provided fractilians with a working version of the Avatar Swap Hyp compatible with the current version.

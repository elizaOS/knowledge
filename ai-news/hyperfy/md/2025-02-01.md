# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-01

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Updates
- **Audio Node Implementation**: Ashxn introduced the Audio node, allowing developers to add audio elements with play/pause/stop functionality. There's ongoing work to add support for audio streaming (MP3 streams) and potentially FLV and WebRTC streaming for lower latency.
- **API Improvements**: A significant improvement to the API was implemented, enabling cleaner code through `app.create(node, props)` syntax instead of setting properties individually after creation.
- **Networking & Synchronization**: Saori provided code examples for client-server communication to synchronize object movements across clients, demonstrating patterns using LerpVector3 for smooth movement.
- **Environment Apps**: Discussions about environment apps that can replace the default scene, with potential for day/night cycles.
- **Docker & Infrastructure**: HPrivakos implemented Docker image building for the Hyperfy repository, configured to automatically build images for x86 and ARM64 architectures when pushing to dev/main branches or creating release tags.
- **Deployment Options**: Various hosting options were explored including fly.io, with smickelbeard sharing a configuration file for successful deployment. The team is working toward Kubernetes implementation to replace the current PM2 setup.
- **Transform Hierarchy System**: A discussion about potential usability issues in the transform hierarchy system, particularly regarding object positioning and unlinking, with some debate about whether the current system is intuitive for beginners.

### AI & Agents
- **Eliza Framework Integration**: Significant discussion about implementing AI agents in Hyperfy worlds using the Eliza branch, with OpenRouter as the LLM provider. HPrivakos mentioned that Eliza-starter with OpenRouter in Docker uses less than 1.5GB RAM.
- **Latency Challenges**: Participants debated the balance between scripted behaviors and LLM-driven intelligence for agents, with some arguing for a hybrid approach where simple behaviors could be handled by a low-latency system while more complex interactions use LLMs.
- **Agent Creation Tools**: "eliza-starter" was recommended as a starting point, with discussions about the technical requirements for hosting agents. Several users expressed interest in easier ways to create and deploy agents without extensive development knowledge.
- **AI Code Generation**: Cru demonstrated AI code generation within the script window, showing potential for integrated development assistance.

### 3D Design & Modeling
- **Material Transparency Issues**: A user's model appeared transparent in Hyperfy despite looking normal in Blender, identified as material settings with Alpha Blend mode causing transparency issues. The discussion revealed differences between Blender 3.6 and 4.0 in handling materials.
- **Model Colliders**: Recommendations to use a specific Blender add-on (Hyperfy-Tools) for creating functional collisions in Hyperfy v2.
- **Community Assets**: Lighthearted conversation about "hyperduck," a duck.glb model that became a testing asset for colliders and has developed its own community lore.

### HYPER Token & Business
- **Token Price Concerns**: Community members expressed concerns about the significant drop in HYPER token price from around $0.15 to below $0.02. Team members reassured the community that development continues despite market conditions.
- **Future Utility**: The team hinted at upcoming utility for the token focused on creator experiences and marketplace dynamics, emphasizing that the project is about building a 3D spatial frontend layer rather than being strictly an AI token.
- **Token Distribution**: Clarification that large wallet holdings represent DAO funds and vested team allocations, with references to the tokenomics page at token.hyperfy.xyz.
- **Hyperworld.host Development**: HPrivakos mentioned working on Stripe integration for Hyperworld.host and offered to help users with hosting Eliza servers.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: How do you make objects networked? (MetaMike)  
  **A**: Send actions to server, have server update position and broadcast to clients (Saori)

- **Q**: Why is app.id `$root` for each app? (MetaMike)  
  **A**: Every app has a $root (empty) as the basis for every app (᲼)

- **Q**: How easy was it to tweak eliza to hyperfy? (᲼)  
  **A**: Very easy, you should use eliza-starter with the same changes (Saori)

- **Q**: Does open router route the requests to the cheapest model? (devilsadvocate.sol)  
  **A**: It routes to the cheapest provider for your chosen model (HPrivakos)

- **Q**: What is the purpose of the `unlink` function? (general hyper)  
  **A**: It's used to prevent objects from duplicating and stacking when manipulating their position (.hyp shaman)

### 3D Design
- **Q**: Why does my model look transparent in the world when my material is normal? (mahmoudghorbani)  
  **A**: It's because the material is plugged into alpha and the blendmode is "Alpha Blend" (𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)

- **Q**: What should I do for other worlds? (mahmoudghorbani)  
  **A**: There are some tools made by another user, a Blender add-on for functional collisions for v2 (𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)

### HYPER Token
- **Q**: Why did this token fall so much? (chckyo)  
  **A**: The decline is attributed to overall market conditions affecting AI tokens broadly (multiple users including MichaelV)

- **Q**: Any tokenomics page? (jay)  
  **A**: https://token.hyperfy.xyz/ (devilsadvocate.sol)

- **Q**: Is HYPER an AI token? (implied by discussions)  
  **A**: No, it's more an investment into a 3D spatial frontend layer (𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)

- **Q**: We use metamask to connect to hyperfy? (frabra239)  
  **A**: Hyperfy.io is the old v1 worlds using ETH NFT, V2 will use HYPER token (maximus)

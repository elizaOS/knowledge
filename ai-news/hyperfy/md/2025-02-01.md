# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-01

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Updates
- **Audio Node Introduction**: Ashxn introduced the Audio node, allowing developers to add audio elements with play/pause/stop functionality.
- **API Improvements**: A significant improvement to the node creation API enables cleaner code through `app.create(node, props)` syntax instead of setting properties individually.
- **Networking Advancements**: Saori provided code examples for client-server communication to synchronize object movements across clients.
- **Environment Apps**: Discussion about apps that can replace the default scene environment, potentially including day/night cycles.
- **AI Code Generation**: Cru demonstrated an OpenAI integration for generating code within the script window, receiving enthusiastic responses.

### AI Agents & Eliza Framework
- **Eliza Integration**: Technical discussions about implementing AI agents using the Eliza branch with OpenRouter as the LLM provider.
- **Latency Challenges**: Debate about solutions for agent responsiveness, including a dual-system approach with a fast simple system for immediate responses and a more sophisticated LLM for deeper interactions.
- **Resource Requirements**: HPrivakos shared that Eliza-starter with OpenRouter in Docker uses less than 1.5GB RAM.
- **Accessibility**: Significant interest in making agent creation and hosting more accessible to non-developers, with mentions of "one-click" agent platforms.

### HYPER Token & Ecosystem
- **Market Conditions**: Discussion about HYPER token's price decline from ~$0.15 to ~$0.014, with team members reassuring continued development.
- **Token Utility**: Team hinted at upcoming utility implementations focusing on creator-friendly tools and marketplace dynamics.
- **Project Positioning**: The project is described as a "3D spatial frontend layer" rather than strictly an AI token.
- **Wallet Distribution**: Some community concerns about three wallets holding ~50% of supply, clarified as including DAO funds and vested team allocations.

### 3D Design & Modeling
- **Transparency Issues**: Solutions for models appearing transparent in Hyperfy despite normal appearance in Blender.
- **Collision Detection**: Recommendations for Hyperfy-Tools, a Blender add-on for implementing functional collisions.
- **Testing Tools**: Discussion about "hyperduck," a duck.glb file used for testing colliders that has become a community meme.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
- **Q**: How do you make objects networked in Hyperfy? (MetaMike)  
  **A**: Use client-server communication with app.send() to synchronize state (Saori)

- **Q**: Why is app.id `$root` for each app even if they're separate glbs? (MetaMike)  
  **A**: Every app has a $root (empty) as the basis for every app; every glb is an app (᲼)

- **Q**: Can r3f (React Three Fiber) be used within Hyperfy? (Ricky)  
  **A**: You can't really combine the two; r3f is just a React wrapper for three.js (Saori)

### AI Agents
- **Q**: Is there an agent to generate agents? (HPrivakos)  
  **A**: Give an LLM the JSON format and description of the show (Saori and Omka)

- **Q**: How easy was it to tweak eliza to hyperfy? (᲼)  
  **A**: Very easy, use eliza-starter with the same changes (Saori)

- **Q**: Is adding agents on the dev branch pretty straight forward? (merk)  
  **A**: You need the custom Eliza branch running (can use ollama as eliza backend) then it's just a script in-world (HPrivakos)

### HYPER Token
- **Q**: Is there a tokenomics page? (jay)  
  **A**: Yes, https://token.hyperfy.xyz/ (devilsadvocate.sol)

- **Q**: Why did this token fall so much? (chckyo)  
  **A**: The entire AI sector is down, not just HYPER (MichaelV)

- **Q**: Is HYPER an AI token? (implied)  
  **A**: No, it's more a "3D spatial frontend layer" (𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)

- **Q**: Do I need to be a serious developer to build on Hyperfy? (frabra239)  
  **A**: Hyperfy.io is friendly for non-devs, just need 3D models (Saori)

### 3D Design
- **Q**: Why does my model look transparent in the world when my material is normal? (mahmoudghorbani)  
  **A**: It's because the material is plugged into alpha and the blendmode is "Alpha Blend" (𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)

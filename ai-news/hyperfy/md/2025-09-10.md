# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development & Technical Capabilities
- **Scene Apps Architecture**: Ash clarified that only one scene app can exist per world, and shared sample scenes for testing purposes.
- **Local Development**: Valiant completed local development branch setup and AI prompting implementation.
- **Real-time Rendering**: Advanced discussions about "decart" technology that maintains consistent geometry while allowing dynamic texture and lighting changes in real-time.
- **Style Transfer**: Conversation about applying different graphical styles to virtual worlds in real-time, with potential for users to see personalized visual styles while interacting in the same networked space.

### Metaverse Building & Plot Systems
- **Plot System Implementation**: Extensive discussion about creating a "metaverse within metaverse" using Hyperfy, with focus on implementing plot systems where different users could build in designated areas.
- **Technical Challenges**: Community identified key challenges including permissions systems, preventing script/model overflow between plots, and asset optimization.
- **Templates Development**: Numinia was mentioned as working on templates for metaverse-within-metaverse functionality.
- **UI Customization**: Consensus that Hyperfy's UI is relatively easy to customize for specialized metaverse implementations.

### Asset Management & UI Improvements
- **Folder Organization**: TheMattEmpire requested improved asset management with folder organization and multi-select capabilities.
- **Bulk Deletion**: Need identified for selecting and deleting multiple assets at once to improve workflow efficiency.
- **Ground Mesh Customization**: TheMattEmpire found the ground mesh customization option in "The Meadow" asset properties.

### Market Analysis
- Brief mention that HYPER token might be approaching a price breakout.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Platform Architecture
- **Q**: Does every world have one scene app?  
  **A**: Yes, just one. If you try to drop another one down it asks if you want to replace it. (answered by ash)

- **Q**: Where can I change the ground mesh?  
  **A**: Found on 'The Meadow' asset at the top of the properties panel. (answered by TheMattEmpire)

### Metaverse Building
- **Q**: Can a Hyperfy world be used to build and host another metaverse with token-gated areas?  
  **A**: Yes, but would require customization as admin access currently gives access to everything. (answered by smickelbeard)

- **Q**: Does Hyperfy currently have plots built in?  
  **A**: No, but the platform is flexible enough to build a plot system. (answered by smickelbeard)

- **Q**: How could a plot system be implemented?  
  **A**: An admin could allot volumes in a space that can be assigned to builders. (answered by TheMattEmpire)

- **Q**: What would be the hard part of implementing a plot system?  
  **A**: Limiting scripts to specific plots and preventing models from overflowing to other plots. (answered by HypPrivakos)

### 3D Rendering Technology
- **Q**: What is decart?  
  **A**: A tool that maintains consistent geometry while allowing textures and lighting to change dynamically in real-time. (answered by b34k3r)

- **Q**: How long can you use decart?  
  **A**: You can only get 3 minutes. (answered by b34k3r)

- **Q**: What should I search for to learn more about this technology?  
  **A**: Search for "realtime style transfer". (answered by hiroP)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Scene App Understanding**:  
   ash helped smickelbeard understand scene app functionality, explaining that only one scene app can exist per world and sharing three sample scenes to try out.

2. **Plot System Implementation**:  
   Multiple community members (smickelbeard, TheMattEmpire, HypPrivakos) collaborated to help miguel_amargo understand how to implement a plot system in Hyperfy, each contributing different aspects of the solution.

3. **3D Rendering Technologies**:  
   hiroP provided context and search terms for participants interested in real-time style transfer technology, suggesting "world models" and "genie 3" as future directions to explore.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI-Generated 3D Environments
- b34k3r demonstrated a spooky Victorian house created through AI prompting that can maintain consistent geometry while changing textures and lighting in real-time
- hiroP described this as "realtime style transfer" technology and mentioned "world models" or "genie 3" as future developments
- Dhin showcased generating objects like a cyberpunk jukebox with simple prompts
- Community members emphasized the speed, cost-efficiency, and potential of these tools for creating furniture, buildings, and other assets
- The vision of a "true metaverse" was discussed where users share the same space but can have different visual perspectives

### Platform Development & Capabilities
- TheMattEmpire discussed UI challenges with asset management, specifically the need for better outliner functionality with folders and multi-select capabilities
- Ash provided clarification about "scene apps" in the platform, explaining that only one can exist per world
- Valiant mentioned completing local dev branch setup and AI prompting implementation
- Discussion about implementing a "plot system" where different users could build within designated areas of a shared world
- Technical considerations included permission systems, asset optimization to prevent performance issues, and UI customization
- Debate about whether the current codebase could support plot functionality without modifications
- WebGPU adoption was briefly discussed as a potential performance improvement

### Technical Issues
- "Vibe world" experienced server availability issues, which was later resolved though edit mode remained unavailable
- Kz reported being unable to upload assets to their server, with ash suggesting the problem might be related to SSL configuration

### AI Agents & Autonomous Characters
- User 太阳 expressed interest in implementing AI agents and virtual characters with autonomous movement capabilities (posted in multiple channels)

### Market Analysis
- User "general hyper" briefly mentioned "we're getting close to a breakout again" in the hyper channel

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I delete multiple assets efficiently?**  
A: Unanswered, but identified as a needed feature

**Q: Where can I change the ground mesh (the green one with hills)?**  
A: It's on 'The Meadow' asset at the top of the properties panel. (TheMattEmpire)

**Q: Does every world have one scene app?**  
A: Yes, just one. If you try to drop another one down it asks if you want to replace it. (ash)

**Q: Can a hyperfy world be used to build and host another metaverse with token-gated areas and customized UI?**  
A: Yes, though it would likely require forking and editing the code as admin access currently gives access to everything. (smickelbeard)

**Q: Does Hyperfy currently have a plot system built in?**  
A: Not currently, but Hyperfy is likely flexible enough to build such a system. (smickelbeard)

**Q: How could a plot system be implemented?**  
A: An admin could allot volumes in a space that can be assigned to builders who can build within that volume. (TheMattEmpire)

**Q: Would implementing a plot system be possible with the current codebase?**  
A: Not sure, but implementing permissions shouldn't be too hard; the challenge would be limiting scripts to specific plots and preventing models from overflowing. (HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)

**Q: How can I fix issues with uploading assets to my server?**  
A: Check if your server is using SSL. Live websites need SSL with proper protocol prefixes (wss:// and https://) and proper SSL certificate configuration. (ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Scene Apps Explanation**
   - Helper: ash
   - Helpee: smickelbeard

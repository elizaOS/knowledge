# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-22

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### New Feature Developments
- **Emote Wheel System**: Ashxn introduced a dynamic customizable emote wheel with hotkeys and head tracking capabilities, accessible with the "G" key (later customized to "B" by a user). The system supports gaze tracking during emotes.
- **Voice Chat Zones**: Ashxn implemented voice chat zones functionality with different modes (disabled, spatial, global) that can be modified by apps using player.setVoiceLevel(), enabling special areas like stages with different voice behaviors.
- **AI Assistant Integration**: HiroP demonstrated an AI assistant implementation using Google's Gemini model with voice interaction, allowing real-time voice commands to manipulate objects in the virtual world.
- **UI Developments**: Gert-Jan Akerboom shared a UI element called "who there.hyp" that displays users currently in a virtual world.

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Deployment Solutions**: Users reported successful deployment of Hyperfy V2 on a VPS using Coolify as the OS, noting it was significantly easier than attempts with Cloudron.
- **Dynamic World Scaling**: Reneil mentioned building a world manager for "moca rooms" that uses the Coolify API to dynamically scale worlds based on demand.
- **Procedural Generation**: Discussions about implementing procedural terrain generation using ThreeJS in custom systems rather than apps.

### Platform Capabilities
- **Animation Support**: Clarification that skinned mesh animations work in Hyperfy, but importing GLB files with animations still requires scripting. Ashxn modified the model app to add an animation field.
- **Cross-Platform Experience**: Community members discussed Hyperfy's unified multiplayer experience across mobile, PC, and VR platforms, with some suggesting it has potential as a "VRChat killer" due to its cross-platform consistency.
- **Movement System**: Users expressed excitement about recent improvements to the movement system on the dev version.

### Upcoming Features
- **Player Management**: Discussion about implementing player roles/permissions system and management features (kick, ban, mute/unmute).
- **Screenshot Feature**: Plans for a screenshot feature that can send images to Discord with customizable camera options.

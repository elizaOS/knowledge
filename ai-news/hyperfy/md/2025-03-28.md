# Hyperfy Development Report – 2025-03-28

## 1. Technical Enhancements

### Object Snapping
- Currently a guide-only system; lacks parent-child relationships
- Workarounds involve triggers and collider tags (may impact performance)

### Material Linking
- Set `mesh.linked = false` to ensure unique materials per instance
- Texture updates must be placed inside `app.on('update')` for proper rendering

### Inter-App Communication
- Inconsistencies between `world.get/set`, `app.send`, and `app.emit`
- `app.children` now supports full node traversal
- Documentation improvements requested for integration clarity

### Agentic Workflows
- Proposed for script validation and self-improving systems
- Seen as a future direction for Hyperfy tooling

## 2. Platform Expansion

### Arena Combat System
- Implemented features: mob respawning, lock-on targeting, AI avoidance
- Suggested enhancements: sword range indicators, dodge mechanics, fireball casting

### Mobile Editor Support
- Monaco editor functional on Android
- iOS support limited (missing autocomplete and clipboard functionality)

### Voice and Communication Infrastructure
- LiveKit recommended as a Twilio alternative for voice/SIP
- FlowiseAI suggested for SMS handling
- Voice, screen share, and video features not yet available in Hyperfy v2

### No-Code Interface and Onboarding
- Community requests for drag-and-drop tools for non-coders
- Improved onboarding needed for tools like Gemini 2.5 and Cursor
- Feature suggestions: emote animation speed control, reflect mechanics

## 3. Asset Optimization

### Marketplace Bundling
- Scripts and parent objects used to combine multiple GLBs into a single `.hyp` file
- Voxvienne’s workflow:
  - Uses Kenney base textures and emission-controlled edges
  - Achieves 2 draw calls and ~500KB file size
- Plans to add snappoints for modular building

### 2D Game Support
- Interest in sprite-based games and camera effects
- Request for native collections feature to group assets for marketplace listings

## 4. AI Integration

### Modular Context Protocol (MCP)
- Standardized API layer for AI agent interoperability
- Simplifies integration with OpenAI, Anthropic, and non-API resources
- Reduces token usage and improves context handling
- Compared to OpenRouter:
  - OpenRouter selects optimal APIs
  - MCP unifies services under one interface
- Feature requests:
  - Agent feedback cycles
  - Lightweight modes
  - Clearer documentation

### AI Voice Assistant Infrastructure
- bitpixi explored phone receptionist using ElevenLabs and non-Twilio backend
- LiveKit and FlowiseAI considered for integration into Hyperfy v2

## 5. Community Feedback and Security

### Documentation and Usability
- Requests for clearer documentation on:
  - Platform beta status
  - Asset bundling
  - Blender optimization
  - Emission techniques

### Security Concerns
- Suggested blocking links from non-$HYPER users to prevent phishing

## 6. Market Update

- Current SOL (Solana) price: **$138.35**

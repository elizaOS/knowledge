# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-20

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Device Detection Improvements**: Ashxn implemented a fix for touch detection on iOS devices when running as fullscreen apps, addressing issues reported by MetaRick.
- **The Forge Quest System**: Lastraum demonstrated a cross-platform quest system connecting Decentraland, Hyperfy, and Roblox, featuring wallet authentication and both on-chain and off-chain rewards.
- **LOD Mechanics Repurposing**: Discussions about using Level of Detail mechanics for device-specific content delivery, with different meshes for desktop, mobile, and VR.
- **UI Animation Techniques**: Lastraum shared code for smooth notification panel animations and toast notifications ported from Decentraland to Hyperfy.
- **3D Optimization**: Vox demonstrated efficient 3D helicopter implementation using UV scrolling for rotor animation and blinking lights with a single texture plus emission map.

### Platform Strategy
- **Cross-Platform Integration**: The Forge service uses Colyseus for multiplayer functionality and connects various metaverse environments.
- **Blockchain Integration**: The Forge is designed to be chain-agnostic, currently supporting EVM chains with Solana integration planned.
- **Performance Considerations**: Discussions about implementing a rating system for assets and device-specific loading to improve mobile performance.
- **Web-First Approach**: Criticism of Decentraland's decision to remove browser support in favor of download-only, with participants praising Hyperfy's web-first approach for better user onboarding.

### Community Updates
- **Microsoft AI Tools**: Maximus shared news about Microsoft announcing over 50 AI tools for building the "agentic web" at Build 2025.
- **Token Discussion**: Brief mentions of Hyperfy token price action and team token unlocks, with Ashxn confirming the team hasn't touched unlocked tokens.
- **Events**: References to Hyperfy being showcased at a Solana event in NYC.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Device & Platform Support
- **Q**: How can we handle different device types in apps? (hiroP)  
  **A**: Ashxn suggested "injecting device type or similar into apps" as a good starting point.

- **Q**: Why doesn't my iPad/iPhone show touch controls when running as a fullscreen app? (MetaRick)  
  **A**: Ashxn implemented a fix that better detects touch capabilities.

### The Forge Quest System
- **Q**: What's happening on-chain in the Forge system? (0mka)  
  **A**: Some rewards are on-chain (NFTs, tokens, DCL items), some like physical rewards are not; the system has fulfillment types (auto, manual) defaulting to auto. (Lastraum)

- **Q**: Is it ready that I can have an item collected in world trigger an NFT? (0mka)  
  **A**: Yes (Lastraum)

- **Q**: What chain is it on? (0mka)  
  **A**: It's chain agnostic, currently EVM-based with Solana testing coming soon (Lastraum)

### 3D Design & Optimization
- **Q**: What does gltf.report compress? (vox)  
  **A**: It reduces VRAM usage but can increase overall filesize when reprocessing WebP files (Valiant)

- **Q**: Does it keep up with the quality after the redo? (vox)  
  **A**: No noticeable degradation despite the re-compression (Valiant)

### UI & Development
- **Q**: How can we make objects always face the camera? (Ashxn)  
  **A**: Ashxn proposed a billboard node that would allow any child objects to always face the camera.

- **Q**: Why isn't my UI image's onPointerDown event triggering? (Lastraum)  
  **A**: Lastraum discovered the issue was adding the onPointerDown handler after the view was added to the app.

- **Q**: How is the toast animation working with UI? (0mka)  
  **A**: It's a system built for DCL and ported over, which modifies the offset of a view over a period of time (Lastraum)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Touch Controls on iOS**  
   Helper: Ashxn | Helpee: MetaRick  
   Context: Touch controls not showing on iOS devices when running as fullscreen app  
   Resolution: Ashxn implemented a fix to better detect touch capabilities and confirmed it worked.

2. **UI Animation Techniques**  
   Helper: Lastraum | Helpee: 0mka  
   Context: Smooth UI animations for notifications  
   Resolution: Lastraum shared code demonstrating how to animate UI elements with offset changes.

3. **Pointer Event Handling**  
   Helper: Ashxn | Helpee: Lastraum  
   Context: UI pointer event issues with nested elements  
   Resolution: Lastraum fixed it by ensuring onPointerDown was added before the view was added to the app.

4. **The Forge Quest System**  
   Helper: Lastraum | Helpee: 0mka  
   Context: Understanding how The Forge quest system works with blockchain  
   Resolution: Lastraum explained that the system supports both on-chain and off-chain rewards with automatic and manual fulfillment options.

5. **3D Helicopter Implementation**  
   Helper: vox | Helpee: Channel members  
   Context: Implementing efficient 3D helicopter rotor animation  
   Resolution: Created UV scrolling for rotors and blinking lights using a single texture plus emission map, shared demo link.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-20

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Tools & Infrastructure
- **IDE Scripting Tool**: Peezy released a new IDE scripting tool allowing direct scripting in the Hyperfy IDE, available via hypkg or GitHub.
- **The Forge Quest System**: Lastraum demonstrated a cross-platform quest system that integrates with Hyperfy, Decentraland, and Roblox, featuring wallet connection without requiring special technical integration.
- **AI Integration**: A proof-of-concept MCP (Master Control Program) for AI-assisted scripting exists as a Hyperfy mod at hypkg.sh/hypkg/ai/, potentially streamlining development workflows.
- **Asset Catalog Integration**: Lastraum announced integration of .hyp files into a UGC catalog with 6,300+ downloadable assets for Hyperfy worlds.

### Technical Implementations
- **Curve/Spline Functionality**: Gert-Jan Akerboom shared progress on implementing a "followcurve" app that allows placing meshes along a curve path, useful for procedural plants and roads.
- **UI Animation System**: Lastraum shared code for smooth UI notifications with offset animations and resolved issues with pointer events in nested UI elements.
- **Device-Specific Optimizations**: Developers discussed implementing device detection to optimize content for mobile, desktop, and VR platforms.
- **3D Techniques**: Vox demonstrated a helicopter model with UV scrolling for rotors and blinking lights using a single texture plus emission map, showing efficient texture animation.

### Platform Economics & Integration
- **HYPER Token Integration**: Ashxn clarified that wallet and HYPER integrations are automatically injected into all worlds without requiring additional work from world creators.
- **Team Token Status**: Ashxn addressed concerns about potential sell pressure, confirming that unlocked team tokens haven't been touched.
- **Open-Source Ecosystem**: Discussions about how developers can create their own ecosystems while potentially incorporating HYPER into their economies.

### Performance Improvements
- **Asset Optimization**: Discussions about using LODs (Levels of Detail) for different device types, with suggestions to repurpose Blender's LOD authoring for mobile-specific versions.
- **Compression Techniques**: Technical discussion about gltf.report tool's compression behavior, which reduces VRAM usage significantly but may increase file size when processing WebP textures.
- **Best Practices**: Community recommendation to avoid transparency in models to achieve better performance.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: Is there a way to add NPCs in Hyperfy v1?  
  **A**: Yes, a VRM can be an app that moves around, and you can even prompt AIs and put the response in chat (peezy)

- **Q**: Can I create a parent object in Hyperfy v1?  
  **A**: Not directly within apps yet, but you could export them all as one in the 3D program or put the model as a prop of the app and position it with code (peezy)

- **Q**: How do I solve the problem of feet not staying planted on the ground when using Mixamo animations for emotes?  
  **A**: Root bone (0mka)

- **Q**: What does gltf.report compress?  
  **A**: It reduces VRAM usage but can increase overall filesize when reprocessing WebP files (Valiant)

### The Forge Platform
- **Q**: What's happening on-chain in the Forge system?  
  **A**: Authentication happens on-chain, and some rewards are on-chain (NFTs, tokens, DCL items) while others like physical items are not (Lastraum)

- **Q**: Is the Forge ready for Solana integration?  
  **A**: Solana testing is coming soon, as the system is being built to be chain-agnostic (Lastraum)

- **Q**: Can I have an item collected in world trigger an NFT reward?  
  **A**: Yes, this functionality is available (Lastraum)

### HYPER Token
- **Q**: What happens with the unlocked team tokens?  
  **A**: Nobody has touched them (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Are there plans to make the coin a native part of the open source platform?  
  **A**: The platform will inject wallet and hyper integrations directly into all worlds without needing to do anything on the world side (Ashxn)

- **Q**: What if New Agents built & connected to hyper world but they only promote & accept their own tokens?  
  **A**: It is an open source project, people can create their own ecosystem, but over time there may be incentives to incorporate HYPER into their economies (jar0d)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Device Compatibility
- **Helper**: Ashxn | **Helpee**: MetaRick  
  **Context**: Touch controls not showing on iPad/iPhone when running as fullscreen app from desktop  
  **Resolution**: Ashxn made a change to better detect touch devices and confirmed it worked after testing

### UI Development
- **Helper**: Lastraum | **Helpee**: peezy  
  **Context**: Questions about how the forge service works with .hyp files  
  **Resolution**: Lastraum explained it uses Colyseus multiplayer under the hood with a modified core version using Colyseus ws sockets

- **Helper**: Ashxn | **Helpee**: Lastraum  
  **Context**: Pointer lock issue when clicking on an image in a complex UI  
  **Resolution**: Lastraum fixed it by ensuring onPointerDown was added before the view was added to the app

### Blockchain Integration
- **Helper**: Lastraum | **Helpee**: 0mka  
  **Context**: Questions about how The Forge works with blockchain and rewards  
  **Resolution**: Lastraum explained that some rewards are on-chain (NFTs, tokens) while others require manual fulfillment, and that the system abstracts blockchain complexity

### 3D Design
- **Helper**: vox | **Helpee**: Channel members  
  **Context**: Sharing a helicopter model with UV scrolling technique for rotors and blinking lights  
  **Resolution**: Demonstrated working implementation with texture + emission map at vox.hyperworld.host

- **Helper**: Valiant | **Helpee**: vox  
  **Context**: Explaining gltf.report compression behavior with WebP textures  
  **Resolution**: Clarified that VRAM reduction is achieved despite increased file size

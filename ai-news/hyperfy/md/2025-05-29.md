# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-29

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Mobile Device Sensitivity Issues
- User carlosmu reported excessive sensitivity for camera and movement controls on mobile devices in Hyperfy v1 and v2
- v1 has limited customization options for sensitivity adjustment
- v2 offers more flexibility but requires source code modifications
- Developers suggested examining ClientControls.js for sensitivity adjustments

### 3D Model Rendering Limitations
- Mugenomics encountered issues with a 1600m-long spaceship model being clipped
- Community identified that the skybox in Hyperfy is a sphere with a 1km radius that moves with the player
- Objects beyond approximately 1000m distance are clipped by the skybox
- Temporary workaround suggested: using fog effects to mask the clipping

### Platform Updates
- Jup swap integration was mentioned as coming soon
- Discussion about using HyperWorld.Host as a deployment platform
- HyperWorld.Host allows updating worlds to the latest version through dashboard settings
- Currently lacks direct world upload functionality

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Version 0.13.0 Release
A significant update was announced with numerous technical improvements and new features:
- New loading screen with world image settings
- Open Graph tag support for better social media sharing
- VR controller interaction improvements
- Experimental terrain support using splatmaps
- Performance optimizations for mobile/VR devices
- UI improvements including Z key toggle for all UI elements

### Mobile Device Controls
Extensive discussion about sensitivity issues on mobile devices:
- Users reported camera and movement sensitivity being too high on mobile
- Different approaches between v1 and v2 were clarified
- V1 has limitations as core code cannot be modified
- V2 offers more flexibility for customization

### 3D Rendering Limitations
Technical discussion about rendering distance limitations:
- Large models (e.g., 1600m spaceship) experience clipping at ~1000m distance
- Identified as a skybox limitation rather than LOD issue
- Skybox has a 1km radius and moves with the player
- Fog effects suggested as a temporary workaround

### Development Infrastructure
- Mentions of hyperworld.host as a hosting platform
- Instructions for updating worlds through the dashboard
- Docker image size reduction through multi-stage builds
- Differences between v1 and v2 regarding asset implementation

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a way to reduce camera and steps sensitivity on mobile devices in Hyperfy v1?**  
A: Not in v1, but it's possible in v2 though it requires modifying the code (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How can I use the Hyperfy editor in hyperworld.host?**  
A: You need to enter /admin XXXX with the password (answered by maximus)

**Q: Can I build on the latest version in localhost and then upload that to hyperworld.host?**  
A: You can update your world through the dashboard by selecting your branch (answered by szjanko)

**Q: Is there any way to increase the draw distance?**  
A: The skybox has a 1km radius and moves with the player, causing clipping beyond that distance. Future plans include making the sky an app for customization. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Could it be a LOD (level of detail) issue with the model?**  
A: No, the LOD is set to 10,000 in Blender, and only portions of the model disappear rather than the whole model. (answered by Mugenomics)

**Q: How can I reproduce the issue?**  
A: Hit plus. Drag model cube into world. (answered by 0mka)

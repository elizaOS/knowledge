# Hyperfy Discord - 2026-01-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Implementations
- **Grass Shader Development**: Ozymandias shared details about a grass shader implementation that creates 1 million grass blades using 8 rectangles each, with custom tweaks to improve visual curves.
- **OSRS Map in Hyperfy**: Users discussed an impressive "Edgeville" Old School RuneScape map implementation featuring 115 draw calls and 2.7 million triangles. The creator explained they used a map scraper and Blender to split terrain from grass and generate collision.
- **Basic MP3 Player**: Valiant shared a functional but visually simple MP3 player implementation that allows users to upload MP3 files directly or load them via URL.

### Technical Issues
- **VR Rendering Problems**: A user reported issues with Pico V2 headset where objects appeared duplicated in Hyperfy worlds. This was noted as potentially device-specific since most testing is done on Quest headsets.
- **World Persistence**: A user encountered issues with world persistence on a fly.io server, which was resolved with help from Antigravity.

### Configuration & Setup
- **File Size Limits**: Discussion about the 100MB file size limit for custom models in Hyperfy, with clarification that this limit can be modified in the `.env` file.
- **AI Prompting Setup**: Users discussed how to enable AI prompting functionality by configuring AI variables in the `.env` file.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Custom models must be within 100MB?**  
A: You can change the filesize limit in `.env` file. If you're running Hyperfy, you can set environment variables to increase the upload limit.

**Q: How to upload Audio file to an object?**  
A: You need to create an audio node. Documentation is available at https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy/blob/main/docs/scripting/nodes/types/Audio.md

**Q: When I use VR headset to enter Hyperfy worlds, I see everything overlapping and duplicating with head movements. How can I fix this?**  
A: This might be device-specific to Pico headsets as most testing is done on Quest devices.

**Q: How do I get prompting to work in my world?**  
A: Open your `.env` file and fill out the AI section with your API key.

**Q: How do you create a .hyp file?**  
A: .hyp files are created by dropping a GLB file into the Hyperfy world, after which code can be added before downloading the file.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **.hyp shaman helped NOlove** with modifying file size limits by explaining how to change the limit in the `.env` file and providing a link to the example file.

- **Valiant and Dhin helped Coinexpert** with audio implementation by providing documentation links for Audio nodes and offering examples, including a boombox implementation and a basic example for uploading or using URL for mp3 files.

- **Antigravity helped untitled, xyz** resolve world persistence issues with their fly.io server, though specific details of the solution weren't shared.

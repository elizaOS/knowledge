# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-12

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### App Development & Deployment
- **In-world App Bundler GUI**: 3rdEyeVisuals has developed a tool that allows users to upload and bundle JavaScript files into .hyp format without manually editing system files
- The tool provides drag-and-drop functionality for files that are then bundled into apps
- Custom UI components have been added to core system files to enhance functionality, though this creates cross-compatibility issues
- Current limitation: browser refreshes are still required after app creation
- Apps can only be added to the sidebar by placing .hyp bundles in the world assets folder, requiring file system access rather than in-world actions

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there an easy way to upload apps to the sidebar while in-world?**  
A: No, you need to place files in the folder on the server (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals, answered by mrtzhckr)

**Q: Is there a tool that bundles the .hyp files for you or is it a manual process?**  
A: [Unanswered] (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals)

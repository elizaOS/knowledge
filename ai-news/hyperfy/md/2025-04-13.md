# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-13

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Mobile & Cross-Platform Development
- **Mobile Experience in v2**: Discussion about prioritizing mobile functionality, with Akuma advocating for mobile features based on global gaming statistics showing mobile users outnumber desktop users
- **Platform Analytics**: Ash shared that v1 analytics showed mobile/VR users were the minority but confirmed plans to roll out missing mobile and VR controls soon
- **Technical Limitations**: Saori explained that mobile browsers (especially Safari) throttle data loading causing crashes, and WebGL doesn't perform as well as native apps
- **Electron Prototyping**: Maximus mentioned ongoing work with Electron that could lead to "baked experiences" as standalone apps with better performance than web versions

### Version 2 Features & Development
- **File Handling**: Ash explained that v2 will allow users to customize file type to app mappings, similar to how operating systems let users change default applications for file extensions
- **Screensharing**: Successfully implemented and tested in the development environment, with 0mka confirming it was working
- **Compatibility Issues**: Discussion about compatibility between v1 and v2 builds, with maximus noting that some work in Blender may be needed to prepare v1 assets for v2 worlds
- **VRM Workshop**: Announcement of an upcoming VRM for Blender Workshop to help creators prepare assets for v2

### Game Development
- **Combat Mechanics**: Peezy mentioned working on game mechanics like combat target lock
- **Asset Creation**: Several discussions about the importance of Blender skills for overcoming asset creation bottlenecks

### Development Tools & Workflows
- **Cursor AI**: Saori shared insights about using Cursor AI for development workflows, including how to organize app folders and add documentation to context for better results

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: If I have a build in v1 can I use that in v2?**  
A: There are some compatibility issues. You may need to do some work in Blender to prepare the assets in a v2 world. (answered by maximus)

**Q: Why isn't mobile experience prioritized when there are more mobile users than desktop users?**  
A: Analytics from v1 show mobile/VR users are the minority, but missing mobile and VR controls will be rolled out soon. (answered by ash)

**Q: How will file handling work in v2?**  
A: In v2, when you drag and drop files, they'll auto-create built-in apps for that type (like v1), but users will also be able to customize those mappings from file type to app. (answered by ash)

**Q: How can I use Cursor effectively for Hyperfy development?**  
A: Create an app folder with current/saved folders containing example apps, then make new ones and add docs/ref to context as needed. (answered by Saori)

**Q: Why aren't numpad inputs being recognized when entering amounts?**  
A: The text input needs work. As a workaround, use the top row numbers instead of the numpad. (answered by ash)

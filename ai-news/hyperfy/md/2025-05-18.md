# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-18

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Updates
- **IDE Scripting Enhancement**: Peezy demonstrated a significant development with IDE scripting and auto script reloading functionality, sharing a GitHub branch for testing. This feature allows developers to write and name scripts (like "gun.js") and switch between them.
- **VR Performance Optimization**: Ashxn shared insights about performance bottlenecks in VR development, noting that draw calls (limit ~20) are the primary limiting factor for Quest 3 applications, while triangle counts and materials are less problematic.
- **Build Configuration Fix**: A GitHub pull request (#94) was merged to address a build issue where the missing scripts folder caused the "world:clean" command to stop working.
- **Documentation Site Migration**: The Hyperfy documentation has moved from hyperfy.how to docs.hyperfy.xyz.

### Community Projects & Initiatives
- **Hyperfy Hub World**: Discussion about creating a central "hub" or "overworld" that could serve as a gateway to other experiences with specialized portals for different audiences.
- **Phettaverse.games**: A user sought assistance with connecting a custom domain to their Hyperfy world and requested development help.
- **Project89**: Community members mentioned this project which appears to be building a world in Hyperfy with assistance from user b0gie.
- **Business Card Integration**: MUDBONE discussed creating business cards with QR codes linking to Hyperfy worlds, with recommendations to point to hub.hyperfy.xyz for better mobile/VR compatibility.
- **Hyperfy News Aggregator**: Jin discussed improving a news aggregator by tracking Twitter accounts that post Hyperfy content.

### Platform & Infrastructure
- **Hyperfy Studio**: Discussion about creating a more comprehensive development environment called "Hyperfy Studio" that would combine various tools and work alongside the browser platform.
- **Tutorial Session**: 0mka announced a training session covering "from clone to local to basic world hyps/ui" which would be recorded for those unable to attend live.

### HYPER Token
- **Token Distribution**: Ashxn clarified the token allocation: 30% allocated to DAO in an untouched multi-sig, 35% to v1 world holders and ai16z partners (with ~10% unclaimed), 15% to founders under linear vesting (untouched), and the remainder in liquidity pools.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
- **Q**: How can I customize player behavior in a Hyp app?  
  **A**: You can use applyEffect and app.control() functions that already exist within an app (Ashxn)

- **Q**: What is the main performance bottleneck for VR applications on Quest 3?  
  **A**: Draw calls on the CPU are the primary limitation, with around 20 draw calls being the threshold before performance issues occur (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Do triangle counts and materials matter for Quest 3 performance?  
  **A**: Not as much as draw calls; Quest 3 has sufficient memory and GPU capacity for these aspects (Ashxn)

### Infrastructure
- **Q**: Could I possibly connect dev.phettaverse.games to world_fa8723c3-4eb8-439d-b83d-00c3eed39301?  
  **A**: "Please point that subdomain to 163.5.159.11" (HypPrivakos)

- **Q**: Is hyperfy.how down?  
  **A**: It moved to docs.hyperfy.xyz (vox)

### HYPER Token
- **Q**: Is circulating supply still 50%?  
  **A**: 30% DAO is in a multi-sig, untouched. 35% to v1 world holders and ai16z partners, ~10% went unclaimed. 15% to Founders is linear vested, also untouched. Rest is LP (Ashxn)

- **Q**: If Streamflow says that only 13.17% is still locked, is Dexscreener market cap not correct?  
  **A**: Dexscreener takes circulating into account, which is essentially all tokens minus DAO, Unclaimed, and Founders. It doesn't look at the portion that is vested or not (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Domain Configuration Assistance**
   - **Helper**: HypPrivakos
   - **Helpee**: emotionull
   - **Issue**: Connecting custom domain to Hyperfy world and avatar not loading due to environment variable typos
   - **Resolution**: Provided IP address (163.5.159.11) to point the subdomain to and identified typos in PUBLIC_ASSETS_URL and PUBLIC_API_URL in .env file

2. **Player Customization Guidance**
   - **Helper**: Ashxn
   - **Helpee**: Cybernetic-O-Cult
   - **Issue**: Customizing player behavior in Hyperfy apps
   - **Resolution**: Suggested using existing applyEffect and app.control() functions

3. **VR Optimization Knowledge Sharing**
   - **Helper**: Ashxn
   - **Helpee**: Channel members
   - **Issue**: Understanding VR optimization constraints for user-generated content
   - **Resolution**: Explained that draw calls are the main bottleneck, while triangle counts and materials are less problematic on Quest 3, and recommended atlassing and mesh merging techniques

4. **Documentation Access**
   - **Helper**: vox
   - **Helpee**: DefiniteOptimist
   - **Issue**: User couldn't access Hyperfy documentation at the old URL
   - **Resolution**: Provided the new documentation URL (docs.hyperfy.xyz)

5. **Build Configuration Fix**
   - **Helper**: ash
   - **Helpee**: HypPrivakos
   - **Issue**: Missing scripts folder in build configuration that broke "world:clean" functionality
   - **Resolution**: Created and merged PR #94 to fix the issue

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-18

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Deployment & Configuration
- **emotionull** successfully built their project but encountered domain connection and avatar loading problems
- **HypPrivakos** identified typos in the `.env` file configuration:
  - `PUBLIC_ASSETS_URL` incorrectly used "?" instead of "/"
  - `PUBLIC_API_URL` incorrectly used "http::/" instead of "http://"
- **emotionull** requested to connect `dev.phettaverse.games` to a specific world ID, and **HypPrivakos** provided an IP address (163.5.159.11) for DNS configuration

### VR Development & Optimization
- **Ashxn** shared insights about VR performance bottlenecks:
  - Draw calls are the primary limiting factor for Quest 3 (around 20 max before performance degrades)
  - Triangle counts and materials are less problematic as Quest 3 has sufficient memory and GPU capacity
  - CPU-intensive operations remain a critical constraint
- **b0gie** suggested approaching VR content creation with optimization standards similar to PS1 or Sega Saturn era games
- **Ashxn** recommended texture atlasing and mesh merging to optimize VR content

### Player Controller Customization
- **Cybernetic-O-Cult** inquired about customizing player controllers, specifically regarding physics, animation playback, and camera functionality
- They questioned whether forking the repository was the best approach for implementing app-specific logic changes

### Other Projects
- **Jin** mentioned improving a Hyperfy news aggregator and suggested downloading data from X (Twitter) to solve the issue of retrieving historical retweets
- **MUDBONE** discussed business cards for a Solana conference and shared designs
- QR code compatibility issues were discussed, with **Ashxn** suggesting pointing to hub.hyperfy.xyz for better mobile and VR compatibility

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: How can I connect a subdomain to a specific world ID?  
   **A**: "Please point that subdomain to 163.5.159.11" (answered by HypPrivakos)

2. **Q**: How many draw calls can a VR application handle before performance issues?  
   **A**: "Around 20 draw calls before performance degrades significantly" (answered by Ashxn)

3. **Q**: What matters more for Quest 3 performance - triangle count, materials, or draw calls?  
   **A**: "Draw calls are most critical; triangle counts and materials don't matter as much as the Quest 3 has sufficient memory and GPU" (answered by Ashxn)

4. **Q**: How can I get historical retweets for the Hyperfy news aggregator?  
   **A**: "Download your data from X (Twitter) settings/account" (answered by jin)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Performance
- **Multiplayer Performance Issues**: Discussion about lag and avatar movement twitchiness in Hyperfy. Ashxn identified the issue might be related to the avatar smoothing algorithm and mentioned they have a better implementation that could be deployed. (💻│developers)
- **Rendering Concerns**: Valiant reported a "jittery render" issue with the high-speed "hyperspeed elevator" movement in a project. (🎨│showcase)
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Ashxn suggested using iPhone 12 Pro as a baseline for testing world performance - "if it runs there, it's probably good." (🧊│3d-design)
- **Geometry Issues**: Valiant clarified an observation about misaligned geometry, specifically mentioning a "ridge/step/edge" encountered while driving in a virtual environment. (🐞│issues)

### Market & Community
- **Market Recovery**: Users discussed a "V shape recovery" in the market, with general hyper predicting a break of the local top and noting room for growth. (🪙│hyper)
- **Privacy Concerns**: Conversation about the UK Online Safety Act requiring ID verification on social media platforms, with users expressing concerns about identity leakage through Web2 companies. (⚡│general)
- **Gaming Activity**: References to users playing "hypercloud" together. (💻│developers)

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: "Is multiplayer lag in Hyperfy just a limitation of websockets? Or are there settings to improve performance?"  
   **A**: "Is it just the avatar movement? I think it's the smoothing algorithm, we have a better one I'll switch it over" (Ashxn)

2. **Q**: "What is the definition for a content maker's potato Mac book now / anyone? Will start learning v2 so plan to buy a basic $1K Macbook from refurbed.fi... plan to start with the local installation and follow the tutorial"  
   **A**: "I just test my worlds on my iPhone 12 Pro now. If it runs there, it's probably good." (Ashxn)

3. **Q**: "What can be used as an alternative to platforms requiring ID verification?"  
   **A**: "Use lens chain" (.hyp shaman)

4. **Q**: "Was the V shape recovery expected?"  
   **A**: "It was described as slightly expected" (Z aka MetaDJ)

## Action Items

### Technical
1. **Implement improved avatar smoothing algorithm** to fix movement jitter (Mentioned by Ashxn)
   - Replace current avatar movement smoothing with better algorithm
   
2. **Investigate multiplayer performance issues** (Mentioned by cru)
   - Research causes of lag and avatar twitchiness in multiplayer
   
3. **Address jittery rendering** while maintaining high-speed movement capabilities (Mentioned by Valiant)

4. **Consider iPhone 12 Pro as minimum performance benchmark** for world optimization (Mentioned by Ashxn)
   - If a world runs well on iPhone 12 Pro, it should perform adequately on most devices

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-05

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Features
- **PartyGrid System**: Shiffty showcased a configurable dance floor system, though it has high CPU usage due to texture handling for individual tiles.
- **Lighting Techniques**: Detailed discussion on making sunlight pass through glass in 3D scenes by manipulating `castShadow` and `receiveShadow` properties, particularly useful for indoor scenes and creating god ray effects.
- **Performance Warnings**: Ashxn warned against using transmission effects on transparent materials due to severe performance impacts on mobile/VR.
- **Voice Chat Capabilities**: Hyperfy currently supports LiveKit for spatial voice chat, though advanced features like push-to-talk and admin mute controls aren't implemented yet.

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Docker & Self-hosting**: Ashxn provided detailed Docker Compose setup guide for deploying Hyperfy worlds on Coolify.
- **World Management Update**: Major functionality added for world management, including the ability to export worlds and select between multiple world folders on the same server.

### Integration & Communication
- **Discord Notifications**: 0mka helped Gert-Jan implement Discord notifications for rocket launches by using chat as an intermediary communication channel.
- **Marketplace Enhancements**: App links from marketplace now show name, description and thumbnail image when shared.

### VR & Performance
- **VR Issues**: Several users reported VR performance problems, including being kicked out immediately and height-setting problems.
- **Regional Performance**: Poor performance noted in Europe, particularly with audio and loading/streaming speed.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a reason the Teleport location may not Persist or Save between Sessions?**  
A: It should persist as it uses world.get/world.set storage (Ashxn)

**Q: What causes all that CPU usage in PartyGrid?**  
A: Changing UV offsets individually likely requires each tile to have its own texture in memory (Shiffty)

**Q: Is there an easy way to get a quick pvp shooter game up and running?**  
A: There aren't ready-to-go shooter packs yet, but a few people have experimented with the idea (Ashxn)

**Q: Do you know any audio solution that allows only host and admin to voice, or gives admin access to unmute/mute someone in the world?**  
A: We support LiveKit for spatial voice chat currently. Push to talk, recording etc isn't currently implemented. (Ashxn)

**Q: I think there was a way to get the sun to shine through the glass but I forgot, anyone?**  
A: Set castShadow and receiveShadow to false on the glass. In some cases you might want receiveShadow to still be true though (Ashxn)

**Q: Is there a way to make the skybox follow the character vertically without modifying core?**  
A: Not currently, but Ashxn offered to add this functionality

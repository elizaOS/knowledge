# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-05

**Date: June 5, 2025**

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **PartyGrid Project**: Shiffty's configurable dance floor system generated significant community interest. The implementation uses material instance manipulation with UV offset changes, though this causes high CPU usage possibly due to texture memory handling.
- **Discord Integration**: Discussion about connecting Hyperfy worlds with Discord notifications, specifically for rocket launch events. 0mka demonstrated a solution using chat messages as an intermediary.
- **Persistence Issues**: Brief mention of teleport location persistence between sessions, with confirmation that it should work as it uses world.get/world.set storage.

### Content Creation
- **Voice Management**: Cayden0207 inquired about audio solutions for host/admin-only voice capabilities and user mute/unmute functionality, sharing detailed specifications for a "FARM2 Voice Component."
- **PVP Game Development**: A new user asked about creating shooter games in Hyperfy, with community members noting there aren't comprehensive systems available yet but some gun assets exist as starting points.
- **3D Design Tools**: Brief discussion about Meshy AI's capabilities for 3D building generation, with Valiant mentioning previous limitations but noting a potential update to this functionality.

### Platform Updates
- **RP1.com Launch**: Vox mentioned rp1.com's unofficial launch and that they had built an asset for the "Lounge" area.
- **VR Performance Issues**: Reports of users being kicked out of VR immediately and unable to set height, with suggestions to restart devices as a potential fix.
- **European Server Performance**: Mention of poor performance in Europe with audio and loading/streaming speed issues.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a reason the Teleport location may not Persist or Save between Sessions?**  
A: It should persist, it uses world.get/world.set storage (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What causes all that CPU usage in PartyGrid?**  
A: Changing UV offsets individually likely requires each tile to have its own texture in memory (answered by Shiffty)

**Q: Is there an easy way to get a quick pvp shooter game up and running?**  
A: There aren't any ready-to-go shooter packs yet, but a few people have experimented with the idea (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: I get kicked out of VR immediately and cant set my height?**  
A: Metarick had this issue as well but restarting device helped (answered by vox)

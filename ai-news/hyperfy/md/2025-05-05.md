# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-05

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### 3D Rendering & Lighting Techniques
- **Emission and Lighting:** Users discussed workarounds for color emission issues using texture atlases and proper material setup. Vox shared an innovative lighting technique using transparent stencil meshes with cutouts above scene lights to create focused lighting effects without performance overhead.
- **Vertex Painting:** B0gie discussed vertex painting applications for "filler objects" in worlds, noting that higher vertex counts enable better color blending, and mentioned UCUPaint for emissive painting.
- **Scale-aware LOD:** Ashxn introduced a new scale-aware LOD option that automatically adjusts LOD transition distances proportionally when objects are scaled, maintaining appropriate visual quality regardless of object size.

### World Building & Performance Optimization
- **Skybox Implementation:** Future plans involve starting worlds with a removable sky app rather than a default skysphere.
- **Combined Functionality:** Vox and Ashxn discussed combining multiple functionalities (skybox, atmosphere, etc.) into a single app/hyp file for more efficient world building.
- **Performance Techniques:** Texture reuse and draw call reduction were emphasized. Vox highlighted using Blender for world building to reuse textures across different meshes, reducing bandwidth usage and improving performance.

### Development & Modding
- **Mod Management:** Peezy revealed development of a UI for managing hypkg mods with a system that loads components from separate folders to prevent conflicts between mods.
- **Mod Categories:** The system will distinguish between standard mods and "overhauls" that modify core functionality.
- **Teleport Feature:** Discussion about implementing a "teleport" feature for builders to navigate to apps within the platform, with concerns about collision detection and possible solutions like disabling player colliders or implementing a "god mode."

### Community & Events
- Brief mention of upcoming events showcasing Hyperfy for onboarding users to Web3 and metaverse experiences.
- A community member (Agent12) expressed interest in creating a metaverse space for Pizza DAO but mentioned challenges regarding server hosting costs and ease of use for non-developers.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a way to change the color of the emission?** (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom)  
A: Add a texture in the emission slot and use texture atlas; in Blender use the same color for diffuse and emissive to maintain color consistency in bloom effects. (answered by B0gie and Ashxn)

**Q: How can I get rid of any default skybox image that is built in core?** (asked by Vox)  
A: The plan is to have no default skysphere and worlds start with a sky app that you can delete, but still recommended to use solarpanel or other sky app since the skysphere follows the player. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: If I instance many different items across the scene, each with 3 LODs that I see at different stages simultaneously, do I get 3 times the drawcalls compared to using just 1 LOD?** (asked by Vox)  
A: Yes, but in most cases you're still far better off performance-wise. (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Would it be cool to let builders 'teleport' to an app or is that overkill?** (asked by B0gie)  
A: It would be nice but there are concerns about players teleporting into colliders. DevStarlight suggested adding a config option to show/hide the teleport feature, similar to how app sound is handled. (answered by Ashxn and DevStarlight)

**Q: Do you guys get random disconnects in your servers? (with the voice chat staying live)** (asked by Vincentskele)  
A: Yes quite often. (answered by Vox)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Emission Color Control**
   - B0gie helped Gert-Jan Akerboom with changing emission color by suggesting using texture atlas in the emission slot
   - Ashxn further explained using the same color for diffuse and emissive to maintain color consistency

2. **Lighting Effects Creation**
   - Vox shared with B0gie a technique using transparent mesh with cutouts above scene lights to create focused lighting without additional light sources

3. **Blender Baking Workflow**
   - Vox recommended simplebake addon, zenUV and UVpackmaster to Shiffty for efficient texture baking workflow

4. **LOD Implementation**
   - Ashxn helped Vox understand the drawcall implications of using multiple LODs, confirming it increases drawcalls but improves overall performance

5. **Vertex Painting Techniques**
   - B0gie offered to help Vox learn vertex painting and shared information about applications and drawbacks

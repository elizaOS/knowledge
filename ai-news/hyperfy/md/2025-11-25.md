# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Projects & Frameworks
- **Consciousness Framework**: 3rdEyeVisuals shared details about their offline AI framework with semantic/temporal memory and emotion systems. Initially built with Ollama, it was upgraded to use llama.cpp with unified memory approach for larger models (up to 7B parameters) and dynamic model swapping for multi-modal deliberation.
- **Project Development Cycles**: 3rdEyeVisuals discussed how the first 50% of development often feels slow due to complex backend groundwork, database setup, and persistence mechanisms.
- **Interactive Canvas Technology**: Discussion about using an interactive canvas as a texture with potential VR applications, possibly for shooting games similar to Time Crisis and House of the Dead.

### Infrastructure & Technical Challenges
- **Heroku Limitations**: Ozymandias highlighted that while Heroku Dynos provide convenient deployment, they only support PostgreSQL for persistent storage, causing data loss when Dynos spin down or servers crash.
- **Firefox Cache/GPU Issue**: Ozymandias mentioned a Firefox-specific cache problem that appeared when using power-GPU but disappeared in later sessions. They implemented a fix in their fork.
- **Token Burning**: A brief mention that "ailes" had sent 30 million Hyper tokens to an "incinerator," effectively burning them from circulation.

### Full-Stack Engineering
- 3rdEyeVisuals provided a comprehensive definition of full-stack engineering in the Hyperfy context, including:
  - Backend services and database management
  - Frontend UI development using the Hyperfy framework
  - 3D modeling, rigging, and animation
  - 2D and UV texture work

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: "Doesn't this mean it would work in VR?" (asked by ash)  
   **A**: *Unanswered*

2. **Q**: "What constitutes a true full-stack engineer?" (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals)  
   **A**: "Someone who can develop backend services, BE database, frontend UI and management using the Hyperfy framework, INCLUDING 3D modeling, rigging, animation, 2D and UV texture work" (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)

3. **Q**: "Should I create a GitHub issue for a fix I implemented in my fork?" (asked by Ozymandias)  
   **A**: "That issue was for v1, private codebase" (answered by ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Full-Stack Development Explanation**: 3rdEyeVisuals helped ash understand the comprehensive nature of full-stack development in the Hyperfy ecosystem, explaining how it encompasses both traditional software development and 3D asset creation.

- **Version Control Clarification**: ash helped Ozymandias understand that the Firefox cache/GPU issue they fixed relates to v1 with a private codebase, implying GitHub might not be the appropriate place to report it.

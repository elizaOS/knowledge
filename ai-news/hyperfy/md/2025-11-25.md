- Currently in early stages (first 20%) of development, focusing on backend groundwork, database setup, persistence, and frontend management
- Noted that development typically feels slow in the first 50%, with rapid progress in the latter half
- Expressed excitement about controlling elements within virtual world environments

### Technical Infrastructure
- Discussion about using an interactive canvas as a texture in 3D environments, with potential VR applications
- **Ozymandias** reported improved system stability, noting that functional codebases are becoming more streamlined

  - Frontend UI development
  - 3D modeling
  - Rigging
  - Animation
  - Texture work

### Token Economics
- **ailes** sent 30 million HYPER tokens to an "incinerator" (burn address), permanently removing them from circulation

## Key Questions & Answers

- **Q (ash)**: "Doesn't this mean it would work in VR?" (regarding interactive canvas as texture)
  - **A**: This question remained unanswered in the discussion

## Community Help & Collaboration

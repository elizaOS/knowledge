# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-17

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Implementation
- **3D Applications & GLB Files**: Clarification that even UI-only applications require a .glb file as the physical entity in the 3D world, while scripts handle behavior and logic.
- **Video Implementation**: Discussion about handling large video files in Hyperfy environments, with recommendations to use external streaming services, m3u8 format, or compression tools like Handbrake rather than direct uploads of large MP4 files.
- **Token Gating**: Community members discussed that token gating functionality was available in V1 but not yet implemented in V2. Agent12 mentioned it would require reverting to an earlier development fork.

### Community & Worlds
- **Hyperworld Hosting**: Dhin mentioned having a world set up at hyperworld.host, noting it was easy to implement.
- **Onboarding**: Jay B 🚀 expressed interest in onboarding their community and sought guidance on exploring the game environment.
- **Traffic Sources**: Agent12 reported steady traffic coming from their Twitter page to their world.

### HYPER Token
- **Community Sentiment**: Members expressed continued faith in the Hyperfy project despite price decline.
- **Custom Utility**: MetaDJ proposed community-driven utility through custom smart contracts on Solana, suggesting HYPER tokens could be integrated into user-created experiences without requiring permission from the Hyperfy team.
- **"Pump.World" Concept**: Discussion about creating a concept where users could establish initial liquidity positions and gate access to worlds using custom tokens.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Do I need a .glb file even if my "app" is just a JavaScript script with no visible 3D elements?  
   **A**: Yes, every application needs a physical entity in the 3D world.

2. **Q**: Is there a max size for mp4 files?  
   **A**: You should avoid uploading large files (2GB/800MB); videos can be streamed from external sources instead.

3. **Q**: What's the best suggestion for getting an experience setup/tour of the game environment?  
   **A**: Check out existing worlds at hyperworld.host and in the worlds channel. A YouTube tutorial is available for setting up a free environment to explore.

4. **Q**: Is token gating possible right now?  
   **A**: It's "plenty possible" but would require going backwards on the current development fork.

5. **Q**: Couldn't we create utility with Hyper using our own smart contracts on Solana?  
   **A**: Yes, HYPER is a standard SPL token that can be integrated into custom smart contracts for transactions.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Video File Solutions**:
   - MetaRick helped 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰 with large video file issues by suggesting streaming from direct links like Vimeo pro and providing a reference for m3u8 format.
   - HypPrivakos offered additional support by suggesting Handbrake for compression, reducing resolution to 720p, and offering to help reduce file size or host on a separate server.

2. **Onboarding Assistance**:
   - Dhin and 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 helped Jay B 🚀 with onboarding by sharing personal hyperworld.host setup, directing to example worlds, and providing a YouTube tutorial link for free setup.

3. **Token Utility Explanations**:
   - MetaDJ shared detailed technical explanations from Grok about implementing HYPER token in Solana contracts.
   - Fibelius provided examples of token gating from V1 by sharing Discord links showing Moe's bar implementation that supported multiple tokens/chains for access.

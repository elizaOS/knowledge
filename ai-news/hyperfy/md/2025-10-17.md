# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-17

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **3D Development Environment**: Discussion about the relationship between .glb files and script files, where .glb files represent physical entities in a 3D world while script files contain behavior and logic. Even UI-only applications require a .glb file, even if empty or invisible. (ðŸ’»â”‚developers)

### HYPER Token Utility & Development
- **Community-Driven Utility**: Significant discussion about creating custom utility for the HYPER token through community-developed smart contracts on Solana. (ðŸª™â”‚hyper)
- **Token Gating**: Conversation about the possibility of gating access to worlds using tokens, though this would require reverting to an earlier development fork. (ðŸª™â”‚hyper)
- **"Pump.World" Concept**: Proposal for a system where users could establish initial liquidity positions and gate access to worlds using custom tokens, allowing the community to create its own utility. (ðŸª™â”‚hyper)

### Community Sentiment
- Despite some negative comments about the HYPER token's performance, several members expressed continued optimism about Hyperfy's technology and potential. (ðŸª™â”‚hyper)
- Brief social interactions with greetings and sharing of media content. (âš¡â”‚general)

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Do .glb files represent physical entities in a 3D world, while script files contain the behavior and logic?  
   **A**: [Pending confirmation from community] (ðŸ’»â”‚developers)

2. **Q**: Is it possible to gate a world with tokens?  
   **A**: It's possible but would require going backwards on the current development fork. (ðŸª™â”‚hyper)

3. **Q**: Could we create utility with HYPER using our own smart contracts on Solana?  
   **A**: Yes, as HYPER is a standard SPL token on Solana, it can be integrated into custom smart contracts for transactions without permission from Hyperfy's team. (ðŸª™â”‚hyper)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **MetaDJ** shared information from Grok with **Agent12** about implementing custom smart contracts with the HYPER token on Solana, helping explore possibilities for token gating worlds. (ðŸª™â”‚hyper)

- **Dhin** responded to negative sentiment expressed by **ai16zgm** about the project, offering perspective on positivity vs. negativity and extending support. (ðŸª™â”‚hyper)

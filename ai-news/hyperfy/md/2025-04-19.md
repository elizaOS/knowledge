# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-19

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### UI & Interface Development
- Discussion about UI hiding functionality using the Z key on PC
- Proposal to make the Z key configurable by admins to control which UI components remain visible
- Custom UIs don't properly implement the hide functionality yet
- MetaRick shared a utility app that displays location coordinates to help with teleporting objects

### Technical Features & Development
- ~/drdoge.eth mentioned adding a full weather system to the auto day/night feature
- HDR lighting implementation was discussed, with significant impact on world appearance
- Blender can create equirectangular shots for export as HDR files for coherent lighting
- Voice chat functionality in HyperWorld.Host requires clicking "Update Building Key" in settings
- Particles now support spritesheet/flipbook functionality
- Improved video fitting options ("cover" and "contain" modes) provide better control

### Video Atlas Application
- Vox encountered "invalid glb" errors when swapping models in the video atlas app
- The app looks for a mesh named "Screen" for functionality
- Technique for creating tiled video atlases (16x) using CapCut allows multiple billboards from a single video
- Plans to develop a more user-friendly version with proper controls for non-developers

### Performance Issues
- MetaRick reported significant FPS drops (from ~50fps to 21fps) on iOS devices after extended use
- Issue occurs across different worlds with higher asset counts despite smooth initial performance
- Potential causes include memory leaks, inefficient LODs, and particles not being properly destroyed

### HYPER Token Discussion
- Community members discussed trading activity and someone selling HYPER tokens
- "general hyper" encouraged increasing trading volume to attract new liquidity

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can we get a hide UI option in the UI settings?**  
A: You can push `Z` on PC, but custom UIs need their own implementation of this feature.

**Q: How do you clear chat?**  
A: Use `/chat clear` command.

**Q: How did you get voicechat on your hyperworld.host working?**  
A: Click "Update Building Key" on the settings page to redeploy your world and enable voice chat.

**Q: When I want to swap the model in this app I get invalid glb, any ideas?**  
A: The app looks for a mesh named "Screen".

**Q: How do I toggle off the original mesh to prevent z-fighting?**  
A: Uncomment "mesh.active = false" by removing the // at the beginning and hit ctrl+s.

**Q: What could be causing FPS to suddenly drop after initially running smoothly?**  
A: Possible memory leak, inefficient LODs for distant objects, or particles not dying quickly enough.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **.hyp shaman helped Akuma** with UI hiding functionality, explaining that Z key works on PC but custom UIs need their own implementation
- **vox helped MetaRick** with chat clearing commands, suggesting "./chat clear" or "/clear chat"
- **HypPrivakos helped vox** with enabling voice chat on hyperworld.host by instructing to click "Update Building Key"
- **ash helped vox** troubleshoot the video atlas application, explaining how to fix mesh issues and prevent z-fighting
- **.hyp shaman helped MetaRick** with performance issues by suggesting checks for LODs, particle management, and testing with lower resolution

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-30

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **V2 Progress**: Developers can already access V2, while a more user-friendly version for non-developers is in development
- **Server Architecture**: Knar described plans for a "single shard MMO" with dynamic server mesh topology that spins up zone servers as needed
- **EVM Integration**: Peezy identified and fixed a buffer conflict in the PhysX JavaScript WebIDL file that caused crashes with EVM wallet integration
- **Builder UI Improvements**: A PR was shared adding sliding value editors, reset transform buttons, and copy/paste functionality to the InspectPane
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Testing confirmed Hyperfy works on iPhones, though performance varies by world complexity

### Technical Innovations
- **Match Node System**: Discussions about implementing a match node to simplify game logic by handling networking and client/server authentication
- **Docker Optimization**: HPrivakos highlighted how they reduced Docker image size from 5GB (Eliza) to 400MB (Hyperfy) by switching from Debian/Ubuntu to Alpine Linux
- **Agent Architecture**: Eliza's architecture allows agents to subscribe to multiple "rooms" rather than depending on a single data stream
- **360¬∞ Video Integration**: MetaRick shared a 360 video sphere implementation created using VRChat with render textures and cameras

### HYPER Token & Economics
- **Price Discussion**: Community discussed the token's significant price decline (90-95% from ATH)
- **Team Commitment**: Development team emphasized they're actively building and haven't sold their tokens
- **Token Utility**: HYPER will function as a DAO token, used to purchase in-world items and add-ons not included in the open source GitHub

### Community & Roadmap
- **No-Code Solutions**: Significant interest in tools for builders without programming knowledge
- **Roadmap Development**: Team is working on a formal roadmap once V2 is builder-ready
- **Community Calls**: Being recorded and summarized to accommodate different time zones
- **Metaverse Architecture**: Discussions about transitioning from real architecture to metaverse design, with focus on optimization requirements

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What is causing the client to crash when using EVM wallets?**  
A: The `missingGlobal('buffer')` call in physx-js-webidl.js is conflicting with wallet packages that use Buffer polyfills. Removing this call fixes the issue. (Ashxn)

**Q: How can I connect EVM chains to Hyperfy?**  
A: Use peezy's EVM fork (https://github.com/peezy/hyperfy/tree/evm_dev) which provides wagmi integration through `const {actions, utils} = world.getEvm()`. (peezy)

**Q: Is Hyperfy possible on mobile?**  
A: Yes, but performance depends on the world's complexity and optimization. (bitpixi)

**Q: What is the purpose of the HYPER token?**  
A: It will be a DAO token once DAO is setup, used to purchase in-world items for team/community made games, and to buy addons not included in the open source GitHub. (jar0d)

**Q: Has the project team sold their tokens?**  
A: The team hasn't sold anything yet. (jar0d and devilsadvocate.sol)

**Q: How can we handle LLM response latency in real-time environments?**  
A: Use client prediction, pre-compute responses, and implement Goal-Oriented Action Planning. (peezy and Saori)

**Q: When will there be #nocode options?**  
A: Working on a firm plan/short-term roadmap, app store functionality will help. (Saori)

**Q: Is V2 already deployed?**  
A: Yes, developers can use V2 now, but non-developers will need to wait. (jar0d)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### EVM Wallet Integration
Peezy identified a client crash when using EVM wallets, and Ashxn helped diagnose that the `missingGlobal('buffer')` call in physx-js-webidl.js was causing conflicts with wallet packages that use Buffer polyfills.

### 360¬∞ Video Implementation
MetaRick shared a sphere asset for 360¬∞ video in Hyperfy and explained how it was created using VRChat with render textures and cameras, providing the asset for others to use.

### Metaverse Architecture Guidance
When vlad introduced himself as an architect looking to transition from real architecture to metaverse design, maximus shared a comprehensive optimization guide explaining the importance of optimization for cross-device compatibility.

### Docker Optimization Knowledge Sharing
HPrivakos explained Docker layers and how switching to Alpine Linux reduces image size, providing context on why Eliza (5GB) is much larger than Hyperfy (400MB).

### Hosting Solutions
When PascalCase asked about V2 deployment status, jar0d explained that V2 is available for developers and directed them to HPrivakos, who shared the hyperworld.host service that allows setting up a world in under 2 minutes.

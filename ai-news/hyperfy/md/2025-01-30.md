# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-30

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Progress
- The team is actively working on V2 of the platform, with GitHub commits as evidence of ongoing development
- V2 is currently available for developers, with hosting options through hyperworld.host
- HPrivakos submitted PR #21 that reduces Docker image size by approximately 70% and implements automated builds
- Several UI improvements are in progress, including transform controls, copy/paste functionality, and lock buttons for the builder interface

### Technical Architecture
- Discussions about server architecture revealed plans for a "single shard MMO" with dynamic server mesh topology
- The system will spin up zone servers as needed and split them into smaller zones when full
- A match node is being considered to simplify game logic by handling networking and client/server authentication
- Docker optimization has reduced the Hyperfy image to 400MB compared to Eliza's 5GB image

### Agent Implementation
- Debate on approaches to creating responsive embodied agents with minimal latency
- Suggestions include pre-computing responses and using Goal Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) from game AI
- Client-side prediction techniques similar to networked games proposed to handle LLM response delays
- Consensus that combining traditional game AI with LLMs would yield better results than pure LLM approaches

### Platform Accessibility
- Tension exists between developers focused on V2's technical capabilities and users who appreciate V1's accessibility
- Team acknowledges the need for a better onboarding experience for non-coders
- Plans for pre-fabs, seamless agents, and a marketplace for avatars, objects, apps, and scripts
- Mobile compatibility confirmed, with Hyperfy working on iPhone but performance varying by world complexity

### HYPER Token
- Community discussions about the token's price decline (approximately 93.5% from ATH)
- Development team emphasizes they're actively building and haven't sold their tokens
- The token is intended to function as a DAO governance token and for purchasing in-world items and add-ons

### 3D Design & Implementation
- MetaRick shared a 360 video sphere implementation in Hyperfy using VRChat with render textures and cameras
- Discussions about optimization requirements for Hyperfy worlds, with maximus sharing a community-created guide
- Professional architect "vlad" joined, expressing interest in metaverse architecture
- Conversations about the differences between real and virtual architecture design principles

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Issues
- **Q: What is causing the client to crash with a Buffer-related error?**  
  **A:** The `missingGlobal('buffer')` call in physx-js-webidl.js is causing the issue, and removing it fixes the problem.

- **Q: How can I connect EVM chains to Hyperfy?**  
  **A:** Use peezy's EVM fork which provides wagmi integration: https://github.com/peezy/hyperfy/tree/evm_dev

- **Q: How do you access wagmi actions in the EVM fork?**  
  **A:** Use `const {actions, utils} = world.getEvm()` to get all actions from wagmi.

- **Q: What increases the size of a Docker image?**  
  **A:** A Docker image is built in layers, each installation or file embedding increases size. Switching from Debian/Ubuntu to Alpine Linux reduces size significantly.

### Platform & Features
- **Q: Does Hyperfy work on iPhone?**  
  **A:** Yes, but performance depends on the world's complexity and configuration.

- **Q: Will there be a no-code solution for v2?**  
  **A:** Working on app store and proprietary options to make it more accessible.

- **Q: Will community calls always be at the same time?**  
  **A:** Currently yes, but may evolve to support different timezones as development becomes less heavy.

- **Q: What software is used for 3D modeling for Hyperfy?**  
  **A:** Blender is recommended, with models exported to GLB format.

### Token & Business
- **Q: What is the purpose of the HYPER token?**  
  **A:** Will be a DAO token once DAO is setup, used to purchase in-world items for team/community made games, and to buy addons not included in the open source GitHub.

- **Q: Is $HYPER an SPL token?**  
  **A:** Yes, it is a Solana token.

- **Q: Has the team sold any tokens?**  
  **A:** The team hasn't sold anything yet.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Problem Solving
- **peezy & Ashxn:** Identified and fixed a client crash issue by removing the `missingGlobal('buffer')` call in physx-js-webidl.js, which was only for warnings and had no functional purpose.

- **peezy & Omka:** Shared an EVM fork (https://github.com/peezy/hyperfy/tree/evm_dev) that provides wagmi integration for connecting EVM chains to Hyperfy.

- **HPrivakos & devilsadvocate.sol:** Explained Docker image optimization techniques, including how switching to Alpine Linux significantly reduces size.

### Design & Implementation
- **MetaRick & maximus:** Shared implementation details of 360 video spheres in Hyperfy using VRChat with render textures and cameras.

- **Ashxn & vlad:** Provided guidance on 3D modeling workflow, recommending Blender and the donut tutorial, exporting to GLB format, and using gltf.report for optimization.

- **maximus & vlad:** Shared a community-created optimization guide for architects looking to understand requirements for metaverse architecture.

### Platform Support
- **bitpixi & jay:** Explained that Hyperfy works on mobile but some worlds may be too heavy or improperly configured.

- **HPrivakos & PascalCase:** Shared hyperworld.host where users can get a Hyperfy world in less than 2 minutes.

- **jar0d & PascalCase:** Confirmed V2 is available for developers and directed them to hosting options.

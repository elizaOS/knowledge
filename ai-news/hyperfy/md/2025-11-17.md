# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-17

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Updates
- **3rdEyeVisuals** shared a brief update about completing a project, though no specific details were provided: "I did a thing 😄"

### Technical Implementations
- Discussion around **collision-based notification systems** in Hyperfy V2, with users seeking alternatives to V1 functionality
- Exploration of **physics workarounds for vehicles** in Hyperfy V2 using a "rolling ball" approach

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q: Does anyone have simple V2 .hyps that might do something similar to "Collider with Notifications" from V1?**  
   **A:** Valiant suggested checking a previous Discord message that might contain a solution.

2. **Q: Could a "Rolling Ball as the Actual Car" physics approach work as a workaround for usable vehicles in Hyperfy V2?**  
   **A:** 3rdEyeVisuals confirmed this approach could work.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Valiant** helped **Agent12** by sharing a reference to a previous Discord message that might contain a solution for collision-based notification systems in Hyperfy V2.

## Action Items

### Technical
- Create a "set collidable zone that causes a Chat Event" for Hyperfy V2 (Mentioned by Agent12)
- Implement Discord integration for Hyperfy V2 collision notifications (Mentioned by Agent12)

### Feature
- Develop vehicle physics using rolling ball mechanics as a workaround for implementing usable vehicles in Hyperfy V2 (Mentioned by Agent12)

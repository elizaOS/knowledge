# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-17

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy v2 Development Progress
- **UI Components**: Ashxn implemented a new in-world UI library using yoga, adding UI, UIView, and UIText components with documentation
- **Agent Systems**: Developers are working on agent systems to bring NPCs to life with conversation capabilities, with Ashxn implementing chat bubbles for agents and players
- **Blockchain Integration**: Saori demonstrated Solana integration for in-world scripting that took only 30 minutes to implement and would work with any blockchain, highlighting the platform's chain-agnostic design
- **MIDI and OSC**: MetaMike successfully implemented MIDI message handling in apps for interactive experiences
- **Hosting Solutions**: Lastraum and HPrivakos are offering hosted v2 worlds for testing, with HPrivakos mentioning hourly backups and auto-updates

### Technical Challenges
- **Model Compatibility**: Some GLB files that worked in v1 don't display properly in v2, particularly those with complex materials
- **Draco Compression**: Users experiencing "Error#7: THREE.GLTFLoader: No DRACOLoader instance provided" when uploading assets with Draco compression
- **Browser Compatibility**: Known issues with Mozilla browsers on iPad/iPhone in v1, with dev team focused on v2 improvements

### Tokenomics & Market
- **Token Distribution**: Approximately 8% of $HYPER tokens are unclaimed and effectively burned, with no DAO control over them
- **Market Volatility**: $HYPER experienced significant price drop (over 50%) during a market-wide liquidity drain caused by the launch of Trump's token ($TRUMP)
- **Exchange Issues**: Jupiter Exchange verification problems identified (missing logo and verification), which Ashxn attempted to resolve

### Future Concepts
- **Agentic Societies**: Bacchus outlined a vision for AI agents with independent objectives creating dynamic environments with lasting consequences from user interactions
- **Stake-to-Play Gaming**: Several developers discussed implementing stake-to-play mechanics for racing games and competitive environments where players could stake tokens to participate and win rewards
- **World Tokens**: Discussion about a staking mechanism where world creators launching their own tokens could allocate a percentage to HYPER stakers

### 3D Design & Optimization
- **Recommended Tools**: ZenUV, UVPackMaster, and Quad Remesher highlighted as valuable Blender plugins for UV unwrapping and retopology
- **Texture Generation**: Meshy tool recommended for generating textures on existing meshes with UV layouts
- **Baking Workflows**: Substance Painter and SimpleBake plugin for Blender suggested as alternatives to Simplygon for baking high-poly models to low-poly versions

## Key Questions & Answers

### Platform & Development
- **Q**: How do I add collision to objects in v2? (jar0d)
  **A**: You can add collision via script or Blender right now. No-code comes later. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do apps communicate with each other? (peezy)
  **A**: world.emit() lets you send events across apps on whatever client/server you are on. app.send() sends events from client to server or server to all clients just for the app. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: When v2 launch? (locoblock)
  **A**: It's already out, available via git clone. (maximus)

- **Q**: Can I use import statements in scripts? (3rdEyeVisuals)
  **A**: No imports in scripts. If you want custom imports, you have to run it through world & app.js. (Saori)

- **Q**: Are v1 worlds being turned off soon? (hiroP)
  **A**: No set timeline established for v1. Team will give ample time to move/recreate. (maximus)

### Tokenomics & Utility
- **Q**: Does hyper token have a planned utility? (zombiekid12)
  **A**: It's being worked on, with current utility as the DAO token for treasury decisions. (MUDBONE)

- **Q**: How much hyper did world holders get for being a world holder? (terranosaurusrx)
  **A**: 151,200 per each hyperfy world NFT. (QMA)

- **Q**: What is the actual circulating marketcap? (logan)
  **A**: Roughly half of what's shown on DEX screener, approximately 23m. (Uuuuuuuuu)

- **Q**: How much makes you a hyperflyer? (Bacchus)
  **A**: The threshold is 100k hyper tokens. (jar0d)

### 3D Design & Technical
- **Q**: How can I fix the "Error#7: THREE.GLTFLoader: No DRACOLoader instance provided" when uploading assets? (Unchained Ninja | Art Unchained)
  **A**: Set compression to "uncompressed" in gltf.report as Draco compression isn't implemented yet. (Saori)

- **Q**: What alternatives exist for Simplygon to bake high-poly models to low-poly versions? (emotionull)
  **A**: Substance Painter or Marmoset for good baking; Blender can do it but is clunky. SimpleBake plugin for Blender is also recommended. (TheMattEmpire and hiroP)

- **Q**: Do you think a 3D gen in-world app would be useful? (MetaMike)
  **A**: It would be brilliant for broad world building like adding structures and fences similar to SimCity in a birds-eye view, but AI would be too bloated for detailed models. (scoe)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Hosted Testing Environments**
   - Lastraum created a hosted v2 world at jarod.hyperfyworlds.xyz for jar0d to test
   - HPrivakos set up a hosted world at ckbubbles.hyperfy.host with hourly backup and auto update for ckbubbles

2. **Development Environment Setup**
   - Ashxn provided .env file examples and clarified that localhost:3000 works with default settings for bitpixi
   - Ashxn helped Spizzy resolve a black screen with "process is not defined" error by explaining the need for .env file

3. **Blockchain Integration**
   - Saori demonstrated Solana integration into Hyperfy worlds, implementing it in just 30 minutes and sharing the process with the community

4. **3D Optimization Guidance**

   - hiroP recommended SimpleBake plugin for Blender as an alternative to Simplygon for emotionull

5. **World Discovery**

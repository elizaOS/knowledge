## Key Questions & Answers

### Hyperfy v2
**Q: How can I get started with Hyperfy v2?**  
A: Check the pinned post in general chat and the git repo in #resources-and-links. Install node.js then run the 4 commands on GitHub; on Windows, rename the .env file by removing ".example".

**Q: Is there an online builder or only via cloning git?**  
A: V2 online builder will be available to public when ready; currently you can clone git and build now.

**Q: Will v1 worlds be turned off soon?**  
A: No set timeline established, team will give ample time to move/recreate.

**Q: How do I set my username in a local Hyperfy world?**  
A: Type "/name <your name>" in the chat box.

**Q: Can I use import statements in scripts?**  
A: No imports in scripts, take all out. For custom imports, run through world & app.js.

### 3D Design
**Q: Would a 3D generation in-world app be useful?**  
A: It would be brilliant for broad world building like adding structures and fences, but too bloated for detailed models like wrenches or shipping containers.

**Q: Can ZenUV be active on two computers at same time?**  
A: Yes, ZenUV works on multiple machines without issues, though QuadRemesher may be limited to 2 machines.

**Q: Are there any Blender baking plugins for making high poly models into low poly versions?**  
A: Substance Painter or Marmoset are recommended for good baking, with SimpleBake as a Blender plugin option.

### HYPER Token
**Q: What caused the significant drop in Hyperfy token price?**  
A: The launch of Trump's token absorbed substantial liquidity from the Solana ecosystem, causing many tokens including Hyperfy to drop.

**Q: What is the actual circulating market cap of Hyperfy?**  
A: Roughly half of what's shown on DEX screener, around 23M.

**Q: Does the Hyperfy token have a planned utility?**  
A: It's being worked on, currently serves as the DAO token for treasury decisions.

**Q: How much Hyper makes you a hyperflyer?**  
A: 100k Hyper tokens.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Assistance
- **Merk** helped **eclipsingbinary** set up a Hyperfy development environment with step-by-step instructions
- **Saori** assisted **Unchained Ninja** with GLB loading errors by suggesting using gltf.report with "uncompressed" setting
- **Ashxn** helped **Spizzy** resolve a black screen with "process is not defined" error by explaining the need for .env file configuration
- **MetaMike** shared code snippets with **mattimus** for implementing MIDI functionality
- **TheMattEmpire** provided **maximus** with comprehensive documentation from Mona ecosystem for optimization guide

### World Building
- **Lastraum** created a hosted v2 world at jarod.hyperfyworlds.xyz for **jar0d** to test
- **𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓** provided **0xdavila** with a list of notable Hyperfy worlds including /urban, /voxmas, /majesty
- **hiroP** recommended Quad Remesher to **TheMattEmpire** for retopology, explaining it uses the same algorithm as ZBrush's remesher

### Troubleshooting
- **maximus** helped **bitpixi** resolve Phantom wallet connection issues with collab.land by suggesting disconnecting ETH wallet or using a new browser profile
- **Jona** warned **brendanAbradley** about a suspicious link for claim, directing them to the proper support channel
- **Saori** manually granted the world owner role to **Jay_kaying** after verification system issues

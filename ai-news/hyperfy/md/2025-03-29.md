# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-29

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Features
- **Mob System Development**: Ash demonstrated a comprehensive mob system with multiple phases (spawn, aggro, chase, attack, death, despawn), which will enable more complex game mechanics.
- **Material Handling Improvements**: Significant discussions around material modifications, with Cru submitting PR #81 to enable changing base color of materials through scripting.
- **Combat & Game Mechanics**: Several developers are working on combat systems, respawn mechanics, and arena gameplay elements.
- **Camera Management**: Drdoge built a camera switcher, and discussions occurred about implementing camera paths for cinematic experiences.
- **Performance Optimization**: Vox shared techniques for creating efficient building blocks for game maps with minimal drawcalls (only 2) and file size (500kb).

### UI/UX Discussions
- **Component Changes**: The "dropdown" component has been deprecated in favor of "switch," sparking debate about UX implications as users must now cycle through options sequentially.
- **Alternative UI Patterns**: Discussions about accordion-style dropdowns, tab-based navigation, and GTA-style menu replacement as potential improvements.
- **3D UI Performance**: Large 3D UI elements were reported to cause lag spikes, highlighting performance concerns.

### Community & Platform Vision
- **Connected Worlds Concept**: PurpleSack advocated for connected virtual worlds where users can see neighboring creations and travel between them, with jar0d mentioning "Hyperfy City" as a potential implementation.
- **Marketplace Presentation**: Vox proposed an isometric layout for asset collections in the marketplace, where each item would be available as a drag-and-drop .hyp file.
- **Community Moderation**: Discussion about handling potential scammers in the Discord, with peezy taking action to remove suspicious users.

### Technical Limitations & Needs
- **LiveKit Features**: 0mka noted that Hyperfy currently lacks certain LiveKit features needed for events, such as voice chat, screen sharing, and video capabilities.
- **Mobile Support**: Several mentions of the need for better mobile support, including coding capabilities and jump functionality.
- **VRM Model Issues**: Users reported that VRM models appear backward in-game, which appears to be unique to Hyperfy.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development Features
- **Q**: Do we have a reflect feature in Hyperfy? (MUDBONE)  
  **A**: "Yeah we have everything to make this" - features similar to "genji ball" or "blade ball" games are possible. (ash)

- **Q**: Does material color modification require placing code inside app.on('update')? (general hyper)  
  **A**: Yes, because nodes don't "mount" until the end of the tick when material is also mounted. (ash)

- **Q**: Why do we need to unlink meshes to modify materials? (general hyper)  
  **A**: If you want to modify materials you probably want to make the mesh linked=false, otherwise changes will be visible in other apps' models too. (ash)

- **Q**: Is there a way to change the material color on a mesh through scripting? (cru)  
  **A**: Not in current docs, only emissive intensity and UV offset are available. (Shiffty)

### UI Components
- **Q**: What's the difference between "switch" and "toggle" components? (implied)  
  **A**: Switch = many options you switch between; toggle = true/false, yes/no, on/off. (ash)

### Platform Status
- **Q**: Is Hyperfy v2 public yet? (VTATV)  
  **A**: It is public 😛 (HypPrivakos)

- **Q**: How can I check the version of Hyperfy I'm running? (implied)  
  **A**: Use the "/version" command which shows the commit version. (0mka)

### Design & Presentation
- **Q**: Could we present asset collections in an isometric layout in the marketplace where each item is a .hyp to drag and drop? (vox)  
  **A**: I'm sure it's doable. (HypPrivakos)

- **Q**: Could any of the cameras have a path in it to go from static, to panning, to orbit etc? (TheMattEmpire)  
  **A**: Yes, camera points can be set with drone mode or wherever the player sets it, or use set points as the path route. (~/drdoge.eth)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Code Contributions
- **Cru** created and submitted PR #81 to add functionality for changing material base color through scripting, addressing a gap in the current feature set.
- **Ash** fixed an issue where worlds get stuck loading when stats are enabled, resolving a critical bug.

### Knowledge Sharing
- **Vox** shared techniques for creating gradient emissions by unwrapping assigned parts from top view and applying specific textures, helping others optimize their 3D designs.
- **Ash** explained how node mounting works at end of tick and why unlinking is necessary for unique material modifications, clarifying a confusing aspect of the engine.

### Asset Sharing
- **TheMattEmpire** offered road assets to **.hyp shaman** in exchange for feedback, fostering community collaboration.
- **Vox** demonstrated building blocks with controllable emission edges for efficient game map creation, sharing performance optimization techniques.

### Community Moderation
- **Peezy** identified and removed a potential scammer in the Discord, with messages deleted to protect the community.

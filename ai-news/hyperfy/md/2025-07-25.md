# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development & Performance
- **Performance Optimization**: Extensive discussion about UI rendering optimization in Valiant applications, particularly how UI elements are redrawn and batched, with focus on performance issues when implementing constantly changing visual elements like RGB effects.
- **V2 Platform Adoption**: Users like SWISS are migrating from v1 to v2, encountering some challenges with file size limits for models (30MB) and avatars (13.5MB).
- **App Ecosystem**: The community is actively developing and sharing apps, with Gert-Jan Akerboom sharing a GitHub repository of .hyp apps and fixing a Rocket app to be networked with collision.
- **WebSocket Support**: Confirmation that only fetch is currently supported in apps, not WebSockets.
- **Development Philosophy**: Developers shared a progression approach of "make it work, make it good, make it optimized" for building features.

### Technical Implementations
- **Networked Rocket**: Gert-Jan Akerboom successfully implemented networking and collision detection for a rocket feature, with Valiant suggesting adding a lift platform ability.
- **Hyperspeed Elevator**: Valiant mentioned implementing an elevator that moves at similar or greater speed than the rocket, though with some rendering jitter.
- **Custom Avatars**: A developer mentioned implementing a world menu setting allowing visitors to equip custom avatars.
- **Chess Interface**: Discussion about a chess interface implementation with plans for a 3D connection interface.

### UI/UX Enhancements
- **CSS Capabilities**: 0mka suggested adding CSS rotation and transform/translate capabilities to UI views, which would enable creating diamond shapes, triangles, pies, and trapezoids.
- **Emote Wheel**: Ashxn promised to add the emote wheel to the "+" menu as a core feature.

### Token & Market
- **Price Movement**: A significant price drop occurred when a large holder ("whale") sold their entire position, causing a drop to around 800k, though the market showed a quick "V shape recovery."
- **Market Context**: The seller reportedly plans to repurchase when Hyperfy reaches a 200m valuation, and the sell-off was part of a broader liquidation of all tokens in their wallet.

## Key Questions & Answers

**WebSocket Support**
- Q: Does someone have an example working with a ws in-world?
- A: "iirc we don't have WebSocket support in apps, just fetch" (Ashxn)

**Performance Monitoring**
- Q: Are stats in world showing other things outside world?
- A: "Might be wrong but I think external usage does affect it. Sometimes I wonder why my CPU/GPU time is so high and realize I have Unity or a few other worlds open in other tabs and closing them helps" (Ashxn)

**V2 Apps Availability**
- Q: What's the current status of apps from v1 in v2?
- A: MetaRick pointed to marketplace channel and mentioned video player, screensharing and skybox apps are available

**Networked Functionality**
- Q: What is "networked"?
- A: "means everyone in world sees the change, local mean only you would see the change happen" (MetaRick)

**Visual Issues**
- Q: What breaks in the meadow scene?
- A: Likely misaligned geometry, "a ridge/step/edge somewhere" encountered when driving around (Valiant)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Performance Optimization Guidance**
   - Helper: Ashxn
   - Context: Performance issues with UI rendering, particularly with RGB effects causing FPS drops
   - Resolution: Offered to review apps privately to spot performance issues and explained how UI drawing is optimized with batching

2. **V2 Platform Navigation**
   - Helper: MetaRick
   - Context: Finding apps for v2
   - Resolution: Directed SWISS to marketplace channel and playworld where apps can be discovered and downloaded

3. **App Resources Sharing**
   - Helper: Gert-Jan Akerboom
   - Context: Sharing additional apps
   - Resolution: Provided GitHub repository with .hyp apps

4. **Market Movement Explanation**
   - Helper: Xukonth
   - Context: Explaining the reason for the token price drop
   - Resolution: Explained that a whale sold all tokens in their wallet, not just Hyperfy

5. **Visual Issue Clarification**
   - Helper: Valiant
   - Context: Clarifying what 0mka meant by "broken seam" in the meadow scene
   - Resolution: Explained it was likely misaligned geometry creating a visible ridge or step in the terrain

## Action Items

### Technical
1. **Fix file size limit issue for models and avatars** - 30MB models and 13.5MB avatars don't work despite increasing environment variables to 50MB (Mentioned by SWISS)
2. **Implement 3D connection interface** as follow-up to 2D chess interface (Mentioned by Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘)
3. **Optimize UI rendering for elements with constantly changing colors** to prevent performance degradation (Mentioned by Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘)
4. **Fix broken seam in meadow scene** - Repair misaligned geometry creating a visible ridge/step in the terrain (Mentioned by 0mka)
5. **Address jittery rendering in hyperspeed elevator implementation** (Mentioned by Valiant)
6. **Evaluate and potentially adjust rocket speed** (Mentioned by Gert-Jan Akerboom)

### Documentation
1. **Create better documentation for app installation** - SWISS noted lack of documentation on installing apps (though drag-and-drop functionality was intuitive) (Mentioned by SWISS)

### Feature
1. **Add emote wheel to the "+" menu as a core feature** - Currently available in playworld but should be more accessible (Mentioned by Ashxn)
2. **Allow visitors to equip custom avatars via world menu setting** (already implemented on dev) (Mentioned by Ashxn)
3. **Improve app marketplace submission process** - "We rely on people adding their apps there, but not much people do" (Mentioned by HypPrivakos)
4. **Add CSS rotation capabilities to UI views** for creating diamond shapes (Mentioned by 0mka)
5. **Add transform/translate capabilities to UI** - Help with fine-tuning positioning beyond flex (Mentioned by 0mka)
6. **Add per-corner border radius control** - Would enable creation of more complex shapes like triangles, pies, and trapezoids (Mentioned by 0mka)
7. **Add lift platform ability to ride the rocket** (Mentioned by Valiant)

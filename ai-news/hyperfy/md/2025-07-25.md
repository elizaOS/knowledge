# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development & Performance
- Developers discussed performance optimization in Valiant applications, particularly focusing on UI rendering issues
- A chess application was experiencing performance problems, with debate about whether external browser tabs affect in-world metrics
- Gh0sTt shared a keyboard application with RGB effects that caused FPS to drop to 40 when activated
- Developers endorsed a "make it work, make it good, make it optimized" philosophy for application development
- WebSocket support is currently limited, with only fetch being supported in apps

### V2 Platform Transition
- Users are actively exploring Hyperfy's v2 platform, with focus on app discovery and implementation
- SWISS (a v1 user) reported issues transitioning to v2, encountering file size limitations (30MB model, 13.5MB avatar)
- The community highlighted drag-and-drop functionality for app installation and the networked vs. local distinction
- Gert-Jan Akerboom shared a GitHub repository of .hyp apps and mentioned fixing a Rocket app
- Ashxn noted they're adding basic apps to the "+" menu and will add an emote wheel as a core feature

### Token Economics
- A significant price movement occurred when a major holder ("whale") sold their entire position
- The price dropped to around 800k (likely market cap or value reference)
- The seller reportedly plans to repurchase when Hyperfy reaches a 200m valuation
- Community members observed a relatively quick "V shape recovery" after the drop
- Some members expressed regret at missing the buying opportunity during the dip

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does someone have an example working with a WebSocket in-world?**  
A: Currently WebSocket support is not available in apps, only fetch is supported.

**Q: Are stats in world showing other things outside world?**  
A: External usage likely affects in-world performance metrics. Having Unity or other worlds open in other tabs can increase CPU/GPU time.

**Q: What's the current status of apps that made it easy to build worlds without coding in v1? Are they available in v2?**  
A: Several apps are available including video player, screensharing and skybox/environment ones.

**Q: What is "networked"?**  
A: "Networked" means everyone in the world sees the change, while "local" means only you would see the change happen.

**Q: What happened to cause the token price drop?**  
A: A whale sold all the tokens in their wallet, not just Hyperfy, and plans to buy back at 200m valuation.

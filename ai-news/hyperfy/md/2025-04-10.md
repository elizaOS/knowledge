# Hyperfy Development Report – April 10, 2025

## 1. App Development and UI/UX Enhancements

### Object Manipulation and Interface Improvements
- Toggleable crosshair mesh for improved app grabbing
- Fading ring effects using scrolling textures
- Editable bounding boxes and loc/rot input fields suggested for precise positioning
- App pinning confirmed to lock objects in place

### Texture and Audio Fixes
- UV cropping issues resolved using grid-based seamless textures
- Android-specific audio behavior discussed; need for better platform documentation

## 2. Physics and Raycasting

### Key Fixes and Best Practices
- Dynamic rigidbodies must be convex
- Use `collider.radius` for spheres
- `world.attach(body)` required for proper physics and raycasting
- Emphasis on minimal reproducible examples for debugging

## 3. Hyperfy V2 Enhancements

### Geometry-Based Video Projection
- Supports 360° video spheres, curved screens, and animated skyboxes
- Enables VRChat streaming and screen sharing

### Blender Add-on and Asset Integration
- Simplifies collision setup and asset import for V2
- Modular sci-fi assets with snap points and VRM avatars added to public library

### Platform Comparison: V1 vs V2
- V1: Easier to use, but lacks performance and future support
- V2: Better performance and mobile compatibility, but requires technical setup
  - Hosting options: self-hosting or services like hyperworld.host
  - VR support still in development

## 4. Community Feature Requests and Action Items

### Requested Features
- Android audio routing improvements
- App/model locking
- Expanded texture scrolling support
- Twitch integration
- Anonymous access for events
- Avatar customization stands
- Horizontal scaling for large events

### Documentation Needs
- Clarify physics setup and tag behavior
- Explain differences between V1 and V2
- Improve guidance on raycasting and asset setup

## 5. Community Highlights

- Voxvienne humorously referred to FBX as "boomerformat"
- SOL (Solana) price update: $119.05

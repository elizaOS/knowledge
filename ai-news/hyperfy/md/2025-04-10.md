# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy v2 Development
- **Video Projection Feature**: Ash announced the implementation of geometry video projection that enables curved or paneled screens, allowing videos to be projected onto various 3D surfaces beyond flat planes.
- **Technical Applications**: Community members discussed how videos could be applied to GLB models to create animated elements or 360° experiences.
- **Advanced Use Cases**: Vox highlighted powerful applications like animated skyboxes using equirectangular videos on spheres and the potential to stream VRChat events directly into Hyperfy.
- **V1 vs V2 Comparison**: Several users inquired about differences between versions, with discussions about hosting capabilities, mobile compatibility, and VR support status.

### App Development
- **Rain Effect App**: Gert-Jan Akerboom is developing a rain app that creates circles on the ground, working on improvements like fade-out effects and better positioning controls.
- **Physics Implementation**: Developers discussed rigidbody physics implementation, with smickelbeard working through issues with colliders and raycasts.
- **Key Technical Discovery**: `world.attach(body)` is required for raycasts and rigidbodies to function properly.
- **Texture Effects**: Developers shared techniques for texture scrolling, with cru providing a blend file as reference.

### 3D Design & Assets
- **Model Conversion**: Cluny_the_Scourge shared plans to convert modular Galactic Geckos city models to work with Hyperfy v2, praising the ease of conversion using the Hyperfy Blender add-on.
- **File Format Discussion**: Brief humorous exchange about FBX format, with vox commenting that "fbx = boomerformat" and .hyp shaman jokingly expanding the acronym.

### Announcements & Documentation
- **Modding Documentation**: Maximus announced that Hyperfy modding documentation for Hypkg is now available.
- **Community Resources**: Links were shared to GitHub, community book, and documentation for Hyperfy v2.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does that mean the screen would be a glb?**  
A: The way it worked in v1, it was a GLB with a "live" video stretched across the surface. Works with complex objects, not just simple shapes. (answered by maximus)

**Q: Can someone send link to V2?**  
A: Hyperfy V2 Github https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy, Community Book: https://hackmd.io/@RealmWeaver/SkLMyAIvye, Docs https://hyperfy.how/ (v2) (answered by Agent12)

**Q: What are perks of owning the V1, should I just sell it and use the browser base V2?**  
A: V1 is still good enough for events. You can set max 20 people and scale horizontally instead of having 100 people. (answered by Saori)

**Q: Is V2 already available for me to host people on phones, VR and more or is that still being worked on?**  
A: V2 can host people on phones, but you need dev skills to spin up your own server or use hosting services. VR support isn't ready yet. (answered by Agent12 and maximus)

**Q: How do I grab and position an app accurately?**  
A: You can 'aim' at the circles on the ground and press 'r' until you catch it, and then you can move it. Also added a cube for grabbing that can be turned on/off in UI. (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)

**Q: Why doesn't my rigidbody code add physics to my app?**  
A: You need to use dynamic instead of kinematic, use radius instead of size for sphere colliders, and call world.attach(body). (answered by ash/.hyp shaman/peezy)

**Q: Should two dynamic rigidbodies collide with one another?**  
A: Only if they are 'convex'. (answered by .hyp shaman)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **V2 Resources Guidance**:
   Agent12 helped uuilliam.k by providing links to GitHub, community book, and documentation for Hyperfy V2, along with explaining hosting options and providing a link to hyperworld.host for paid hosting services.

2. **Physics Implementation Support**:
   Multiple community members (.hyp shaman, peezy, and ash) collaborated to help smickelbeard troubleshoot rigidbody physics issues, explaining the need to use dynamic instead of kinematic bodies, proper collider configuration, and the critical step of calling world.attach(body).

3. **Texture Effects Sharing**:
   Cru shared a blend file with seamless grid texture to help Gert-Jan Akerboom implement texture scrolling for the rain effect app.

4. **App Positioning Improvements**:
   Gert-Jan Akerboom responded to vox's difficulty with app positioning by adding a cube for grabbing that can be toggled on/off in the UI.

5. **Version Clarification**:
   Cluny_the_Scourge helped uuilliam.k understand the differences between Hyperfy versions and explained that the Blender add-on is specifically for v2.

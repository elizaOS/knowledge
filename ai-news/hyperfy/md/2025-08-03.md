# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Implementation
- **Player Spawning Issues**: Discussion about players falling through island models when they spawn before the ground loads completely
- **Loading Sequence Control**: Community members suggested implementing "scenes" for better control over loading sequence
- **Platform Versions**: Clarification that Hyperfy v1 is outdated (no feature updates for over a year) while v2 is open source and designed to be self-hosted

### 3D Design
- Brief mention of "smart LODs" (Levels of Detail) via a shared Twitter/X link

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there anywhere to delay the player spawn until world spawns? Or better way?**  
A: Check out "scenes", you probably want to implement one for your island. Also, try to ensure your island preloads before the world, or change your spawn point to higher in the air. (answered by Shiffty and 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)

**Q: Where do I use v2?**

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-23

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Voice Chat & Player Management
- **Voice Zones System**: Ashxn shared progress on a new voice chat system with three modes (disabled, spatial, global) that apps can modify with custom rules using `player.setVoiceLevel()`.
- **Player Rank System**: A simplified rank hierarchy (admin > builder > visitor) is being implemented with corresponding permissions for muting, kicking, and teleporting players.
- **Voice Channels**: Plans for team-based voice channels were discussed for gaming applications.

### Development Infrastructure
- **Deployment Solutions**: SWISS successfully installed Hyperfy V2 on their VPS after switching from Cloudron to Coolify, which proved more compatible.
- **Dynamic World Management**: Reneil is developing a world manager connected to their backend that dynamically manages worlds based on demand using the Coolify API.
- **Security Considerations**: Discussions about implementing secrets for secure API key storage, with Ashxn proposing a theoretical implementation using app.configure with a 'secret' type.

### Audio-Reactive Features
- Multiple developers shared progress on audio-reactive elements, including particle effects and fireworks.
- Implementation approaches were discussed using livekit, audio analyzer, and data transfer to Hyperfy.

### UI/UX Improvements
- Gert-Jan Akerboom suggested displaying .hyp filenames next to "SCRIPT" in the interface to prevent accidental code pasting, only to discover it was already implemented in the dev version.
- A UI element for displaying users currently in a virtual world was shared in the showcase channel.

### 3D Design & Assets
- Brief discussions about adding sliding doors and ramps to modular buildings.
- Questions about avatar springbone support were redirected to the appropriate channel.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How does the new voice chat system work?** (asked by 0mka)  
**A:** It has a world setting for voice (disabled, spatial or global) and apps can modify using their own rules by calling `player.setVoiceLevel('null|disabled|spatial|global')` (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How will the new player management system work?** (asked by 0mka)  
**A:** Everyone has a "rank" (admin > builder > visitor) with corresponding permissions; admins can grant/revoke builder rank, teleport to players, mute/unmute, and kick players of lower rank (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Can visitors drag in their own VRMs?** (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)  
**A:** Ashxn will add an option to the world settings menu (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How do you access URL parameters in Hyperfy?** (asked by Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘)  
**A:** Use `world.getQueryParam(key)` as documented in the GitHub repository (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How would secrets work for API keys in Hyperfy?** (asked by 0mka)  
**A:** Ashxn proposed a theoretical implementation using app.configure with a 'secret' type that would only be available on the server, not clients (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What OS works well for installing Hyperfy V2 on a VPS?** (asked by SWISS)  
**A:** Coolify works well, while Cloudron "hijacks your VPS and makes things extra impossible" (answered by SWISS)

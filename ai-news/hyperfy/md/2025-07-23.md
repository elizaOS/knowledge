  - Reneil confirmed using Coolify for Moca Rooms, highlighting its ease for version updates
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Reneil mentioned developing a world manager using Coolify API to scale worlds based on demand

### App Development
- Several developers shared progress on creative applications:
  - Audio-reactive particles and visualizations
  - Fireworks effects
  - Chess implementation
- Discussion about implementing screenshots with Discord integration

### Security & Configuration
- Debate about handling API keys securely
- Proposed "secrets" system that would keep sensitive information server-side only
- Discussion of URL parameter access in Hyperfy applications

### Metaverse Concepts

- Debate about NFT integration and blockchain for digital assets
- Balance between centralization and decentralization in the platform

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How does the new voice chat system work?** (asked by 0mka)  
**A:** It has a world setting for voice (disabled, spatial or global) and apps can modify using their own rules by calling `player.setVoiceLevel('null|disabled|spatial|global')` (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How will the new player rank system work?** (asked by 0mka)  
**A:** Instead of roles everyone has a "rank" - admin > builder > visitor, with permissions based on rank hierarchy (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How can we implement API key security in apps?** (asked by 0mka)  
**A:** A proposed "secrets" system would allow config values to be sent to server only once and never to clients (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Can it become default that visitors can drag in their own VRMs?** (asked by ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì)  
**A:** "I'll add an option to the world settings menu, forgot about this" (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How did SWISS manage to install V2 on their VPS?** (implied from SWISS's message)

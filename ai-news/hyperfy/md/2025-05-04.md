# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### UI/UX Development
- Discussions around implementing an "editor mode" as an alternative to build mode
- Debate on balancing clean UI with intuitive building experiences
- Proposals for docking/pinning systems for custom IDE layouts for specific building/game modes
- Parallels noted between Hyperfy's approach and UE6's direction of blending offline editors with final games

### Technical Implementations
- **Skinned Mesh Improvements**: Ashxn demonstrated work giving apps access to skinnedmesh bones
  - Enables dynamic manipulation of 3D models with better performance
  - Single draw call for complex objects with multiple moving parts
  - Being used for vehicle implementation (single skinned mesh with bones for wheels/doors)
- **LOD Group Handling**: Discussion about properly hiding meshes that are part of LOD groups
- **Solana Integration**: Updates on the official solana-v2 branch being used for the Fallen project

### Documentation Issues
- The hyperfy.how documentation site is currently down after Saori "ragequit" and dropped the domain
- Temporary solution implemented using gitingest on the GitHub repository to make docs available for LLMs
- Ashxn mentioned they would have the documentation back up soon

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do you handle raycasting with skinned meshes?**  
A: Currently skinned meshes don't support raycasting, but Ashxn is considering reinstating the mesh.visible property to mean "not rendered but still raycastable"

**Q: How should car models be implemented for optimal performance?**  
A: Use a single skinned mesh with bones for moving parts like wheels to reduce draw calls to maximum 2 (solid + transparent meshes)

**Q: How do you properly hide meshes that are part of LOD groups?**  
A: You need to disable the entire LOD group as it takes over control of its children's .active boolean

**Q: What's the best way to get caught up with everything that's been happening here?**  
A: There are community calls on YouTube focused on progress, and you can read through specific Discord channels to see features and highlights. YouTube also has Hyperfy.How tutorials.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **LOD Group Mesh Handling**
   - Helper: Ashxn
   - Helpee: b0gie
   - Context: Hiding meshes that are part of LOD groups when using player.teleport
   - Resolution: Explained that LOD groups take over control of children's .active boolean, so the entire LOD group must be disabled

2. **Solana Integration Support**
   - Helper: Ashxn & peezy
   - Helpee: dean.land
   - Context: Updating Solana adapter
   - Resolution: Shared the official solana-v2 branch being used for Fallen project; peezy explained plans to make a solana-v2-extended mod

3. **Documentation Access**
   - Helper: maximus & dean.land
   - Helpee: CheddarQueso ðŸ§€ & Community
   - Context: hyperfy.how documentation site being down
   - Resolution: Provided alternative ways to access documentation through GitHub repository and implemented gitingest as temporary solution

4. **Onboarding New Users**
   - Helper: maximus
   - Helpee: Edmnd
   - Context: New user seeking information about project status and recent events
   - Resolution: Directed to YouTube resources and specific Discord channels for updates

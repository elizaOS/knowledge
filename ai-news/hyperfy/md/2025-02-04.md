# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy V2 Development
- **App Sharing System**: A significant new feature allows developers to share apps with a `.hyp` extension, enabling downloading, remixing, and viewing app details.
- **App Inspection Window**: The UI has been redesigned to support the new app sharing functionality with improved user experience.
- **Control Schemes**: Developers are debating control schemes, with many preferring V1's pointer lock and reticle for gaming experiences.
- **Open Source Model**: V2 is the open-source version of Hyperfy, designed with an ecosystem model where developers create "cores" that artists can use to make collectibles.
- **Self-hosting Options**: Discussions about the ability to transfer worlds between hosts by simply copying world folders, with no lock-in to specific hosting services.

### AI Agents & NPCs
- **Behavior Trees**: MetaMike shared progress on a behavior tree implementation controlling NPC behaviors based on player proximity, including rotation, emotes, and API calls.
- **LLM Integration**: The system uses distance-based triggers with an Eliza-based LLM that selects appropriate emotes based on its responses.
- **Memotar Project**: SoloSolipsist introduced their project for creating agent personas, showing interest in potential Hyperfy integration.

### Cross-App Communication
- **API Methods**: Developers discussed using `world.emit()` for server-to-server and `app.send()` for server-to-client communication.
- **Data Sharing**: Methods for sharing data between apps were explored, with emphasis on event-based communication patterns.

### 3D Design & Assets
- **Rigging Challenges**: Discussion about Mixamo rigging issues where models "lurch" forward in edit mode but return to normal in object mode.
- **Alternative Approaches**: Community members suggested AutoRigPro, resetting the rest pose, and using Accurig as alternatives to Mixamo.
- **VRM Creation**: TheMattEmpire mentioned preferring to rig manually in Blender and build VRMs using UniVRM in Unity rather than using the VRM for Blender addon.

### HYPER Token & Economics
- **Price Movements**: HYPER showed volatility with a significant dip (-36% at one point) followed by stabilization.
- **Cross-chain Liquidity**: Detailed conversation about the technical challenges of creating an ETH bridge for HYPER via Wormhole.
- **Liquidity Pool Requirements**: Calculations showed approximately 10% of supply and 160 SOL would be needed for an equivalent ETH LP.
- **Tokenomics Plan**: Confirmation that a tokenomics plan is coming, with discussions about the DAO wallet holding 30% of supply.

### Interoperability Challenges
- **VRM Avatar Issues**: Nifty Island "cock blocks" their VRM avatars from use in Hyperfy by token-gating the files rather than using decentralized storage.
- **Open Standards**: Discussions emphasized the importance of open standards and decentralized storage for true metaverse interoperability.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I share data between apps in Hyperfy?**  
A: Use `world.emit()` and `world.on()` for server-to-server communication, and `app.send()` and `app.on()` for server-to-client communication.

**Q: How can you access the player position in V2?**  
A: On the client you can call `world.getPlayer()` to get the current player or `world.getPlayer(id)` for a specific player.

**Q: Can I access the main camera and can I raycast through the API?**  
A: You can access the camera using `app.control({})` and get direction with Vector3 calculations; raycasting will be possible but hooks aren't added yet.

**Q: What's the best way to share apps in Hyperfy V2?**  
A: The new app download feature with .hyp files is the solution, with options for public sharing and remixing.

**Q: How can we trigger expressions within the Eliza Hyperfy branch?**  
A: The app has that hooked up already. Each time a request is sent to Eliza it has all emotes and asks it to pick one or none.

**Q: What is the correct URL to use for the agents?**  
A: Use https://agents.dcl.guru/eliza/hyperfy as the model URL.

**Q: How easy would it be to transfer a pre-built V2 world to our own hosted option later?**  
A: It will be as simple as copy/paste your world folder to another host.

**Q: What's with the address holding 30% of HYPER token supply?**  
A: It's explained in the token information page at token.hyperfy.xyz - this is the DAO wallet.

**Q: What's a better workflow than Mixamo for rigging?**  
A: Try Blender VRM addon + AutoRigPro or Accurig. Some prefer to rig manually in Blender and build VRMs using UniVRM in Unity.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Cross-App Communication**: Saori helped MetaMike understand how to share data between apps, explaining the use of world.emit/on for server-to-server and app.send/on for server-to-client communication.

- **Camera Access**: Ashxn provided Shiffty with code examples using app.control({}) to access camera position and quaternion for implementing custom camera controls.

- **Agent Endpoints**: HPrivakos helped MetaMike access the correct agent endpoints by providing the proper URL (https://agents.dcl.guru/eliza/hyperfy) and explaining that the issue was with the URL in the hyp file.

- **Docker Deployment**: Ashxn helped multiple users with Docker build failures due to npm dependency conflicts, fixing the root cause so the --force flag is no longer needed.

- **Rigging Workflow**: TheMattEmpire and maximus helped FortyMcNiner with Mixamo rigging issues, suggesting alternative approaches and sharing links to previous discussions about optimization.

- **Liquidity Pool Mechanics**: Saori provided devilsadvocate.sol with a detailed explanation of how initial token/SOL ratio determines valuation and arbitrage dynamics for cross-chain bridging.

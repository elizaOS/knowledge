# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy V2 Development
- **App Sharing System**: A significant breakthrough allows developers to share apps with each other. Ashxn developed an app inspection window enabling downloading, remixing, and viewing app details.
- **Control Systems**: Many developers prefer V1's pointer lock and reticle for gaming experiences over V2's current implementation. Discussions centered on potentially implementing separate build and play modes with configurable controllers.
- **Ecosystem Vision**: Ashxn outlined Hyperfy's ecosystem vision where developers make cores, artists create collectables from cores, and consumers use these to build worlds without coding skills.
- **No-Code Version**: Mentioned as "right around the corner" by community members, with users encouraged to watch for announcements.
- **Solana Integration**: An in-development branch will allow connecting Solana wallets to Hyperfy V2.

### AI Agents & NPCs
- **Behavior Tree Implementation**: MetaMike shared progress on a behavior tree implementation integrating animations with LLM responses, allowing NPCs to react to player proximity with different behaviors (rotation, emotes, conversation).
- **Distance-Based Triggers**: The system uses distance triggers: rotating toward players at <10m, running emotes between 5-0m, and executing Eliza API calls between 0-2m.
- **Memotar Integration**: SoloSolipsist introduced their Memotar project for creating agent personas, showing interest in potential integration with Hyperfy.

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Hyperfy-Deployer Tool**: Raymond is developing a tool to simplify deployment on Linux servers with automatic setup of SSL, nginx, and other requirements.
- **Scaling Solutions**: Discussion explored "scale to zero" approaches using MicroVMs/Firecracker that can spin up instances in under 200ms when needed and shut down when inactive.
- **Community Documentation**: A community-maintained document for world hosting was shared, containing tips and knowledge gathered from the community.

### Interoperability & Asset Management
- **VRM NFT Compatibility**: Discussion about Nifty Island's VRM NFT format compatibility issues with Hyperfy, highlighting interoperability challenges when platforms use centralized servers rather than decentralized storage.
- **3D Modeling Challenges**: Community members discussed issues with Mixamo rigging workflows in Blender, particularly models "lurching" forward on the y-axis when switching between edit and object modes.
- **Beacon Tool**: Development of a "beacon" tool by m₂ that allows worlds to be listed on relay.zesty.xyz alongside other Hyperfy worlds and spatial apps.

### HYPER Token
- **Cross-Chain Expansion**: Technical discussions about creating a wormhole bridge to bring HYPER to Ethereum, with analysis of liquidity requirements.
- **Price Movements**: Community members tracked HYPER's price movements, which showed volatility with a 31-36% drop during the period, while noting that support levels appeared to be moving upward despite the decline.
- **Tokenomics**: Brief mentions of an upcoming tokenomics plan, with references to the existing documentation at token.hyperfy.xyz.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What would be the best way for sharing apps?**  
A: Add an option for world owners to make apps right-click downloadable by anyone (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How can you access the player position in V2?**  
A: On the client you can call world.getPlayer() to get the current player or world.getPlayer(id) for a specific player (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Is there a security risk where an app could get access to another app's secrets?**  
A: Don't think so, apps can't communicate with each other by default (answered by Saori)

**Q: How can we trigger the expressions within the eliza hyperfy branch?**  
A: The app has that hooked up already. Each time a request is sent to eliza it has all emotes and asks it to pick one or none. (answered by Saori)

**Q: Is this the correct vrm nft format to use in hyperfy?**  
A: The issue is that Nifty locks the NFT behind a paywall/gateway, blocking metaverse platforms like hyperfy from accessing the file from the public chain (answered by maximus)

**Q: What is the V2 actually?**  
A: V2 is the opensource version of hyperfy (answered by ToxSam)

**Q: Anyone have the problem of rigging an avatar on mixamo where the model "lurches" forward in edit mode but jumps back in object mode?**  
A: Look into resetting the 'rest pose' or try alternative rigging methods like AutoRigPro or Accurig (answered by TheMattEmpire and Ashxn)

**Q: What's the spin up time like for MicroVM/Firecracker?**  
A: They can start the app in less than 200ms rather than a couple seconds with docker containers (answered by HypPrivakos)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Data Sharing Between Apps**: Saori helped MetaMike understand how to share data between apps by explaining the use of world.emit/world.on for server-to-server and app.send/app.on for client communication.

- **Camera Access**: Ashxn provided Shiffty with code examples for accessing camera and forward direction using app.control({}) and vector calculations.

- **Docker Build Issues**: Ashxn helped a user fix Docker build failures caused by npm dependency conflicts by reverting version checking and resolving npm package conflicts.

- **Agent Endpoints**: HPrivakos provided MetaMike with correct URLs for testing agents without local setup: https://agents.dcl.guru/hprivakos/hyperfy and https://agents.dcl.guru/eliza/hyperfy.

- **VRM NFT Compatibility**: Maximus explained to N1Kingz/HCK1 that Nifty Island's token-gating of VRM files was preventing them from loading in Hyperfy.

- **Rigging Workflow**: TheMattEmpire suggested solutions to FortyMcNiner for model positioning issues after Mixamo rigging in Blender, including resetting the rest pose and using alternative rigging tools.

- **Hyperfy Deployment**: Ash helped Raymond troubleshoot a black screen issue with Hyperfy deployment, suggesting it might be SSL or Nginx related.

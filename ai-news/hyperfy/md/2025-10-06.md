# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Real-Time Style Transfer Integration
Several users demonstrated using external tools like decart.ai and Krea to apply artistic filters to Hyperfy worlds in real-time. This represents a significant technical advancement allowing visual transformation of 3D environments without modifying underlying geometry. Users shared examples via Twitter/X links, generating excitement in the community.

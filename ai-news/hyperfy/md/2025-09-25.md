# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-09-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Updates
- **Disconnection Issue Fixed**: Ash reported fixing a critical issue in the latest dev branch where users would disconnect immediately when entering certain worlds. The root cause was identified as a ping-pong timer set to 1 second, which was insufficient for processing large world snapshots, causing missed pong responses and server kicks.
- **AI Features Release**: Ash announced plans to release AI features from the dev branch to the main branch early next week.
- **LiveKit Server Hosting**: HypPrivakos shared that they're running a single LiveKit instance for multiple worlds on an inexpensive VPS ($6/month), demonstrating that LiveKit can operate efficiently on modest hardware.

### Development Techniques
- **Vegetation Generation**: Several approaches to creating forests were discussed, including mass placement of trees that conform to terrain via raycasting and "painting" forests similar to weight painting in Blender.
- **Performance Concerns**: Users noted frame rate drops to 30-40 FPS when adding vegetation despite using prims or tiny GLBs.
- **Blender Integration**: Ash clarified that object names with special characters like "$Object" have no effect on behavior in-world, as behavior is controlled through custom properties.
- **LOD Implementation**: Confirmation that skinned meshes can have LOD0 by adding them as children to an LOD group.

### New Features
- **Discord App Enhancements**: Gert-Jan Akerboom shared updates including player time tracking, optional UI ping notifications for world entry, customizable Discord notifications with name exclusion, and logo visibility toggle.
- **Proximity-Based UI**: Discussion about UI elements that appear based on player proximity (within 10 meters), which Dhin found useful for a coin-related project.

### Community Organization
- **New Worlds Channel**: A new "#worlds" channel was created specifically for sharing links to worlds, with a preference for V2 worlds only.
- **Hyps Organization**: Ash acknowledged the need for better organization of hyps (pre-built components) with updates and spinoffs.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does naming things in Blender like $Object have an effect in world?**  
A: "It shouldn't have any effect at all. Behavior is all through custom properties, names are just used to get references." (answered by Ash)

**Q: Can skinned meshes have LOD0, if so how?**  
A: "Yeah they should work the same way. Add your skinned mesh as children to a LOD group." (answered by Ash)

**Q: How do I drop the grabbable once I get it?**  
A: Initially suggested as "Q" but later corrected to "C" (discovered by Fractilians)

**Q: Are those trees auto raycasting down?**  
A: "Yeah they are" (answered by Dhin)

**Q: How much does it cost to run a LiveKit server?**  
A: As little as $6/month for a VPS hosting multiple worlds (answered by HypPrivakos)

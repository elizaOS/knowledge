# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI Integration & Rendering
- **AI Rendering Layer**: Clarified that AI styling in Hyperfy works as a rendering layer on top rather than generating 3D worlds in real-time within the engine itself
- **Decart Integration**: Users can share their Hyperfy screen through Decart to apply AI styling filters in real-time without needing OBS
- **Vibe Prompting**: Hyperfy supports AI-powered asset creation through text commands in the chat window
- **Hypercity.app Development**: Built using AI-generated ThreeJS primitives (cubes, cylinders, spheres) by typing "../create" commands with an API key

### Developer Tools & Utilities
- **Player Transforms Utility**: Gert-Jan Akerboom shared a tool providing real-time access to player location, body rotation, and camera rotation data
- **Modified Video Player**: Valiant released a video player with HLS (.m3u8) stream support, extending the built-in video app
- **Camera Direction Access**: Discussions on implementing shooter game mechanics by accessing player camera direction
- **Multiplayer Projectiles**: Code examples shared from a launch party app with multiplayer projectile functionality

### Content Creation
- **V2 Animated Banners**: Agent12 announced upcoming V2 animated banners (no technical details provided)
- **Dataset Fix**: Solution provided for Adobe Humoto dataset issues by correcting file extension problems

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is the AI layer happening in real time inside hyperfy or as a rendering layer from camera/screen output?**  
A: It's a rendering layer from camera/virtual camera. Users can share their Hyperfy screen through Decart without needing OBS, though OBS virtual camera also works.

**Q: How does AI asset creation work in Hyperfy?**  
A: With an API key, you can use the chat window to type "../create whatever" and the LLM creates 3D assets built with ThreeJS primitives. Assets can be edited with "../edit" commands.

**Q: Is there a way to get access to where the player is looking for a shooter game?**  
A: You can get the camera quaternion and turn it into a directional vector to determine the direction the player is looking. You can also raycast from that to find if it hits anything.

**Q: Anyone heard about this dataset? https://adobe-research.github.io/humoto/ Cannot get it to work (unzip not possible)?**  
A: They used the wrong file extension. Just change .zip to .fbx and you're good for Blender etc.

**Q: How can I enable fly again?**  
A: Use the fly app.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Shooter Game Implementation**
   - Helper: ash & Shiffty
   - Helpee: Gert-Jan Akerboom
   - Context: Needed to access player's camera direction for a shooter game
   - Resolution: Explained how to get camera quaternion and convert to directional vector; shared code examples from launch party app

2. **Dataset Troubleshooting**
   - Helper: Valiant
   - Helpee: mrtzhckr
   - Context: Unable to unzip Adobe Humoto dataset
   - Resolution: Fixed file extension issue (.zip to .fbx) and created a working zipped package

3. **AI Integration Understanding**
   - Helper: vox & Valiant
   - Helpee: Sceth iii
   - Context: Understanding how AI integration works with Hyperfy
   - Resolution: Explained Decart usage without OBS and detailed how to use "../create" and "../edit" commands for generating 3D assets

4. **Player Transform Utility**
   - Helper: Gert-Jan Akerboom
   - Helpee: Dhin
   - Context: Dhin was using a self-made solution for player transforms
   - Resolution: Gert-Jan's "Player Transforms" tool provided a better alternative that Dhin adopted

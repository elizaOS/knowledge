# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI Integration & Development
- **AI Rendering Approaches**: Two main methods discussed:
  1. External rendering layer using tools like Decart to process Hyperfy output via screen sharing or virtual cameras
  2. Built-in AI prompting capabilities to generate 3D assets directly within Hyperfy
- **AI-Generated Worlds**: Vox explained how Hypercity.app was built entirely using AI-prompted primitives (cubes, cylinders, spheres) through chat commands like "../create" and "../edit"
- **Current Limitations**: Clarified that AI isn't currently generating 3D worlds in real-time as users move through them, but rather uses post-processing filters or pre-generated assets

### 3D Development & Technical Discussions
- **Camera Direction Implementation**: Discussion on accessing player camera rotation for implementing shooting mechanics in games
- **File Format Issues**: Troubleshooting of Adobe Humoto dataset files with incorrect extensions
- **Upcoming Animations**: Agent12 mentioned "V2 is coming" with "Fully animated Versions of these Banners"

### Resource Sharing
- A Hyperfy-to-Blender resource was shared by .hyp shaman
- Valiant created a fixed package for the Adobe Humoto dataset after identifying file extension issues

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is the AI layer happening in real time inside Hyperfy or as a rendering layer from camera/screen output?**  
A: It's a rendering layer from camera/virtual camera (OBS) - *Valiant*

**Q: How does AI asset generation work in Hyperfy?**  
A: Using the chat window with an API key, you can type "../create whatever" and the LLM creates 3D assets built with ThreeJS primitives (cubes, cylinders, spheres) - *vox*

**Q: Is there a way to get access to where the player is looking for making a shooter game?**  
A: Yeah if you get the camera quaternion you can turn that into a directional vector and that's the direction the player is looking. You could also raycast from that to find if it hits anything. - *ash*

**Q: Anyone heard about this dataset? Cannot get it to work (unzip not possible), but it looks like a really good idea. They say it is mixamo compatible then it should work for us as well, right?**  
A: Think they barfed file extension. Just change .zip to .fbx and your good for Blender etc. - *Valiant*

**Q: Is Meshy trashed for anyone else?**  
A: Yes - *Dhin*

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Adobe Humoto Dataset Fix**
   - **Helper**: Valiant
   - **Helpee**: mrtzhckr
   - **Problem**: Unable to unzip Adobe Humoto dataset files
   - **Solution**: Identified incorrect file extensions, suggested changing .zip to .fbx for Blender compatibility, and created a fixed package

2. **Camera Direction for Shooting Mechanics**
   - **Helper**: ash
   - **Helpee**: Gert-Jan Akerboom
   - **Problem**: Needed to access player camera direction for shooting mechanics
   - **Solution**: Explained how to convert camera quaternion to directional vector and suggested raycasting for hit detection

3. **AI Asset Generation Explanation**
   - **Helper**: vox
   - **Helpee**: Sceth iii
   - **Problem**: Confusion about how AI-generated assets work in Hyperfy
   - **Solution**: Detailed explanation of using "../create" and "../edit" commands to generate ThreeJS primitives for building worlds like Hypercity

4. **AI Rendering Clarification**
   - **Helper**: Valiant & vox
   - **Helpee**: Sceth iii
   - **Problem**: Confusion about AI rendering methods
   - **Solution**: Explained it's a rendering layer from camera/virtual camera using OBS or screen sharing in Decart app directly with a Hyperfy browser window

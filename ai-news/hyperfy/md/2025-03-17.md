# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-17

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Architecture
- **Plugin System Architecture**: Ashxn provided guidance on using the `inject` method to extend functionality while avoiding conflicts, explaining how to add systems in `createClientWorld`/`createServerWorld`.
- **Three.js Integration**: Discussions clarified that Hyperfy is built on Three.js but doesn't yet fully expose all Three.js objects. The "unlocked" branch provides more direct access to Three.js capabilities.
- **Physics Capabilities**: PhysX rigidbodies support `addForce()` and `addTorque()` methods, with plans for `addForceAtPos()` in future vehicle implementations.
- **Authentication Implementation**: Detailed discussions about stateful sessions vs. stateless tokens for user authentication, with code examples shared for PostgreSQL session management.

### Creative Projects & Techniques
- **Interactive Objects**: Cru shared updates on a projector with on/off functionality and sound effects, and a drum pad with potential for improved colliders and visual feedback.
- **City Building Project**: 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 discussed plans to build 500 building blocks using atlasing, instancing, and light baking techniques for performance optimization.
- **AI-Assisted Design**: Several mentions of using AI tools (Claude/Cursor, Krea) to assist with code generation and texture creation for 3D environments.

### Tools & Integrations
- **MCP Integration**: Peezy developed a Model-Code-Prompt integration with Cursor IDE that allows real-time code updates to Hyperfy entities without manual copy-pasting.
- **Avatar Systems**: Discussion about random avatar assignment functionality that persists between sessions and potential integration with opensourceavatars.com.

### Platform Updates
- **Documentation Improvements**: Jin and Omka submitted PRs to enhance GitHub repository documentation with better links to docs, website, and playable demos.
- **VR Compatibility**: Issues with VR mode on a specific website (vox.b34k3r.com) were identified and fixed in the latest dev branch.
- **UI Improvements**: Updates to padding margin on UI elements and proximity trigger functionality were mentioned.

### Cryptocurrency
- Brief discussion about HYPER token price (approximately 0.00696699) with some users expressing concern about lack of price increase.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I add systems in the plugin architecture?**  
A: Add systems in createClientWorld/createServerWorld and use the inject method in the system's init() to extend functionality. (Ashxn)

**Q: Why use stateful sessions with a session ID instead of stateless tokens?**  
A: Stateful sessions are useful when you need to attach additional information within a session, while stateless is simpler for basic user auth validation. (mattimus)

**Q: How many lights can be used in a world?**  
A: Ideally one light (including the world sun) is best for performance, but two lights won't make a huge difference. (Ashxn)

**Q: Can we add forces to rigidbodies?**  
A: Yes, rigidbody.addForce(force: Vector3) and rigidbody.addTorque(force: Vector3) are available, with plans to add rigidbody.addForceAtPos(force, pos) for vehicles. (Ashxn)

**Q: Is it possible to access Hyperfy from Apple Vision Pro?**  
A: People have tried on v1 and it worked, v2 is untested but should be possible with tweaks if developers have access. (Ashxn)

**Q: Can I use Three.js inside Hyperfy?**  
A: You can do some things with Three.js but not everything is exposed yet; Hyperfy is working on achieving maximum performance and flexibility. (peezy)

**Q: Are there any plans to integrate AI in Hyperfy?**  
A: Yes, there are several AI integrations available. (Omka)

**Q: What makes the building technique impressive?**  
A: It's powerful and allows baking light spills on windowframes; atlasing and instancing make it big but fast and good looking. (𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Development
- **Voice Chat Coming Soon**: Ash announced that voice chat will be added to the platform in the coming days, with LiveKit potentially being used as the underlying technology.
- **Default Apps System**: Plans were discussed to implement a default apps system similar to v1, where all worlds would come with standard apps while allowing creators to add custom ones.
- **URL Handling**: The `world.open(url: String, newTab: Boolean)` function was highlighted as the current method for opening URLs from objects, with webviews planned for future implementation.

### Building & World Creation
- **HyperWorld Host Exploration**: New users were exploring the HyperWorld Host platform for creating Hyperfy worlds, with community members providing guidance on basic building functionality.
- **UI Navigation**: Several users discussed the Z key toggle for UI visibility, which was causing confusion for new builders when accidentally pressed.
- **Model Collisions**: Discussions about implementing collisions for 3D models, with references to a Blender extension that helps with this process.

### 3D Design & Tools
- **AI Model Generation**: User "vox" compared three AI tools (Tripo, Hunyuan3D-2, and Trellis) for architectural modeling, finding Trellis performed best but still required too much cleanup for production use.
- **Alternative Workflow**: Instead of AI-generated meshes, creating smart materials based on reference images and applying them to simple geometry was proposed as a more efficient workflow.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Building & Navigation
- **Q**: How do I build in the world I have in hyperworld host?  
  **A**: Check hyperfy.how for documentation and give yourself admin permissions.

- **Q**: Why did my UI options disappear when selecting a model?  
  **A**: You likely hit Z which toggles UI off.

- **Q**: How do you add collision to a model?  
  **A**: There is a Blender extension to add collisions.

### Development
- **Q**: Is it possible to code an object to open a URL when interacted with?  
  **A**: Use `world.open(url: String, newTab: Boolean)`, with webviews coming in a future update.

- **Q**: Is the camera zoom limited to 8m only for the drone or the whole camera system?  
  **A**: It's a limitation for the player camera.

- **Q**: Would it be possible to create an app with speech to text using Google Cloud API for real-time captions?  
  **A**: It's "absolutely possible" though may need some core changes to the platform.

- **Q**: Did you try Tripo "SG" for 3D generation?  
  **A**: Yes, but Trellis performed better for architectural modeling.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### New User Onboarding
- **Gert-Jan Akerboom** helped **Cluny_the_Scourge** who couldn't figure out how to build in their HyperWorld Host world by providing documentation links and explaining admin permissions.

- **ash** assisted **Cluny_the_Scourge** when they lost UI options, explaining that the Z key toggles UI visibility.

- **maximus** provided tutorial links to **Cluny_the_Scourge** and explained differences between Hyperfy v1 and v2.

### Technical Assistance
- **0mka** shared a link to Blender extension documentation for adding collisions to models when **Cluny_the_Scourge** was struggling with this feature.

- **0mka** shared code snippets with **MiaHigashikata** to demonstrate implementation of object collision teleportation.

- **HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host** offered to provide a free LiveKit server for the platform's voice chat implementation.

- **peezy** suggested using WASM to run small models client-side for real-time transcription when **cru** inquired about speech-to-text implementation.

## Action Items

### Technical
- Implement voice chat in the next few days (mentioned by ash)
- Develop default apps system similar to v1 with app palettes (mentioned by ash)
- Expose audio capture permissions to apps for speech processing (mentioned by general hyper)
- Create smart materials based on reference images for mapping to simple geometry models as an alternative to AI mesh generation (mentioned by vox)
- Consider changing the Z key UI toggle to a combo like shift+something to prevent accidental toggling (mentioned by general hyper)

### Documentation
- Improve documentation for adding collision to models as current section is confusing (mentioned by Cluny_the_Scourge)
- Clarify camera zoom limitations and intended usage (mentioned by ~/drdoge.eth)

### Feature Requests
- Add gun recoil effects for more dynamic experience (mentioned by eigb)
- Consider adding FOV slider as alternative to fixed camera zoom (mentioned by ~/drdoge.eth)
- Implement speech-to-text functionality for real-time captions (mentioned by cru)

## Technical Enhancements

### Object Interaction & Camera Controls
- URLs can be triggered via `world.open(url, newTab)`
- Teleportation on collision supported using `onTriggerEvent` with collider triggers
- Camera zoom currently capped at 8m (originally for debugging)
- Community requests for a FOV slider to enhance camera flexibility

### Voice & Speech Integration
- Voice chat integration in progress using LiveKit
- Community members offering server support
- Proposed speech-to-text feature to display captions above avatars
  - Feasible with minor core changes
  - Potential use of client-side WASM models for privacy and performance
- App-level audio access will require user permissions

## Feature Development

### App System Transition
- Moving from static app palette (v1) to customizable app system
- Default in-world apps will be available
- Creators can add custom apps
- Proposed architecture:
  - Separation of core and tertiary apps
  - API access control
- Users encouraged to explore:
  - App repository
  - Community tutorials

## Community Support

### Onboarding Challenges
- Issues reported in HyperWorld Host environment:
  - Admin permissions
  - UI toggles
  - Unclear documentation
- Community provided:
  - Official documentation links
  - Sandbox tools
  - Blender extension for collision setup
- Suggestions made to improve:
  - UI keybindings
  - Documentation clarity

## 3D Modeling Workflows

### AI-Assisted Modeling
- Tools evaluated: Tripo, Hunyuan3D-2, Trellis
  - Trellis performed best but required cleanup
- Proposed workflow:
  - Use AI-generated models as reference
  - Apply smart materials to simplified geometry
  - Avoid complex retopology
- Goal: Streamline asset creation process

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-17

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy v1 and v2 Transition
- **Version Compatibility**: Ashxn clarified that v1 is in maintenance mode while v2 is a complete rewrite with better performance and capabilities. The two versions are not compatible.
- **Migration Path**: Users cannot build in v2 editor and move content to v1 worlds due to fundamental differences.
- **Future Plans**: V1 will be kept alive with no set date for removal, but with minimal support for updates.
- **Documentation**: Links were shared to both v1 and v2 documentation resources.

### Technical Development
- **Performance Testing**: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 mentioned switching to a dedicated single GPU with 2GB RAM on fly.io for testing user capacity and pricing.
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Ashxn identified draw calls (maximum ~20) as the primary limiting factor for VR performance, rather than triangle counts or materials.
- **VRM Avatar Positioning**: TheMattEmpire discovered that VRM positioning is based on the hip bone's position relative to the root bone, with Ashxn confirming they scale based on a hip-to-height ratio.
- **Animation Implementation**: Discussions about GLB animation implementation in both versions, with code examples provided for v2.

### Platform Features
- **Custom Domains**: HypPrivakos confirmed that custom domain integration is already available for some users, with specific instructions provided for implementation.
- **File Access**: File access functionality is nearly complete, pending UI completion for import/export of whole world folders.
- **Solana Integration**: Available via the solana-v2 branch, with documentation links provided for Solana APIs.

### Community Projects
- **Game Development**: A non-developer user (Alexa) inquired about building a game similar to "fallen" using Hyperfy v2, with community members encouraging her to start despite the learning curve.
- **Business Applications**: Discussion about creating business cards with QR codes for a Solana conference, with suggestions to point to hub.hyperfy.xyz.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I save my scene persistently in Hyperfy v1?**  
A: v1 is in maintenance mode; v2 is recommended where you can build locally and save to the world folder.

**Q: Can I build in v2 editor and move my build to v1 world?**  
A: No, v2 is a complete rewrite and they aren't compatible.

**Q: Can I enable animations on GLBs I import?**  
A: Engine currently supports animations on armatures/bones only, controlled via script.

**Q: When v2 is released, will we be able to access v1 and v2? Or will v1 be disabled?**  
A: V1 is kept alive with no set date for removal, but little support for updates.

**Q: Is it possible to build a world/game like fallen using hyperfy v2 as a non-developer?**  
A: Yes, it's possible with patience.

**Q: Any plans for domain and file access?**  
A: Domain is already possible with some users having custom domains. File access is nearly ready, pending UI completion for import/export of whole world folders.

**Q: How is height position of the VRM actually set in Hyperfy?**  
A: We scale based on a hip to height ratio so that it looks correct even on very short avatars.

**Q: What's the main performance bottleneck for VR?**  
A: Draw calls are the primary limitation - around 20 draw calls maximum before performance degrades significantly.

**Q: Is https://hyperfy.how/ down?**  
A: It moved to https://docs.hyperfy.xyz/

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **GLB Animation Implementation**  
   Helper: Ashxn | Helpee: carlosmu  
   Ashxn provided code examples showing how to control animations via script using app.get() and play() methods in Hyperfy v2.

2. **Server Deployment Troubleshooting**  
   Helper: HypPrivakos | Helpee: emotionull  
   HypPrivakos identified typos in .env file with incorrect URL formats for PUBLIC_ASSETS_URL and PUBLIC_API_URL that were causing avatar loading issues.

3. **Custom Domain Setup**  
   Helper: HypPrivakos | Helpee: emotionull  
   Provided specific IP address (163.5.159.11) to point a custom subdomain to for connecting to a Hyperfy world.

4. **VRM Avatar Positioning**  
   Helper: Ashxn | Helpee: TheMattEmpire  
   Confirmed that positioning is based on hip-to-height ratio and explained their animation system uses the Mixamo red character as reference.

5. **Documentation Access**  
   Helper: vox | Helpee: DefiniteOptimist  
   Provided the new documentation URL (docs.hyperfy.xyz) when user couldn't access the old documentation site.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-17

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy v1 vs v2 Development
- **Version Status**: v1 is in maintenance mode while v2 is actively developed as a complete rewrite
- **Compatibility**: v1 and v2 are not compatible; code cannot be shared between versions
- **Future Plans**: v1 will remain accessible with no set deprecation date out of respect for existing worlds
- **Development Recommendation**: Users are advised to focus on v2 as it offers better performance and features

### Technical Capabilities
- **World Building**: v2 allows building entire worlds locally with persistent saves to world folders
- **Animation Support**: v2 supports animations on armatures/bones controlled via scripts, but not object-based animations yet
- **Performance**: v2 demonstrated excellent performance with 300 unique meshes (600k triangles) even on mobile devices
- **Infrastructure**: Testing of dedicated GPU on fly.io for improved performance and pricing evaluation

### Platform Features
- **Custom Domains**: Already available for users
- **File Management**: Import/export functionality for whole world folders is nearly complete, pending UI finalization
- **VRM Positioning**: Positioning is based on hip bone, with scaling based on hip-to-height ratio

### Community Projects
- Discussion about non-developers successfully building games in Hyperfy v2
- "fallen" referenced as an example of what's possible for newcomers

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I save my scene persistently in Hyperfy?**  
A: v1's local SDK is closed source and limited to building apps. v2 saves to world folders where you can publish and host anywhere.

**Q: Can I build in v2 editor and move my build to v1 world?**  
A: No, v2 is a complete rewrite and they aren't compatible.

**Q: How do I enable and control animations on GLBs?**  
A: Engine supports animations on armatures/bones only. Control via script using methods like `smesh.play()`.

**Q: When v2 is released, will v1 be disabled?**  
A: v1 will be kept alive out of respect for builders. No set date to remove v1 hosting but little appetite for v1 support/updates.

**Q: Is it possible to build a world/game like "fallen" using hyperfy v2 as a non-developer?**  
A: Yes, it's possible with patience. "fallen" proves it's possible, and community members have shared success stories.

**Q: How is height position of the VRM actually set in Hyperfy?**  
A: Hyperfy scales based on a hip to height ratio, using a root bone for reference, and only applying rotations to ensure correct appearance even on short avatars.

**Q: What causes performance issues in Hyperfy worlds?**  
A: Often unoptimized Sketchfab models with separated meshes sharing materials, high polycount, extensive use of large textures, non-indexed geometry with collision, and VRMs with full ARKit blendshape sets.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **VRM Positioning Solution**: TheMattEmpire discovered that adjusting the root bone position lower while maintaining correct hip bone position fixes ground alignment issues, sharing this knowledge with the community.

- **Game Development Encouragement**: vox and vincentskele encouraged Alexa (a non-developer) to start building in Hyperfy v2, with vincentskele sharing their personal success story despite being a self-described "goofball."

- **Performance Optimization Insights**: vox shared detailed insights on common performance bottlenecks from v1 experience, helping others understand what to avoid when building worlds.

- **Animation Implementation**: Ashxn provided code examples showing how to control animations via script using `smesh.play()` to help users implement animations in their worlds.

- **Solana Integration Guidance**: Ashxn directed Agent12 to the solana-v2 branch and documentation for wallet generation and RPC functionality.

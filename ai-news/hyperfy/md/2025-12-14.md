# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-12-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Web3 Integration
- **Phantom Wallet Integration**: 3rdEyeVisuals successfully implemented Phantom wallet integration with Hyperfy V2, describing the process as "extremely easy"
- **Design Philosophy**: Maximus explained that Hyperfy intentionally avoided direct crypto integration in the base code to maintain accessibility for non-crypto users, with blockchain functionality intended as separate extensions
- **Open Source Plans**: Due to GPL license requirements, 3rdEyeVisuals plans to open-source their custom implementation before any official release

### Platform Updates
- **Upstreet Changes**: Discussion revealed that the Upstreet Discord is no longer active, though the world still exists at a specific URL

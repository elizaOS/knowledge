# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-12-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Web3 Integration
- **3rdEyeVisuals** successfully implemented Phantom wallet integration with Hyperfy V2, describing it as "extremely easy"
- **Maximus** provided historical context on V1 design decisions:
  - Crypto integration was intentionally kept separate to avoid alienating non-crypto users
  - The marketplace was intended as the distribution method for blockchain extensions
- Discussion about potentially packaging web3 functionality as a .hyp file, though this would require additional work
- **3rdEyeVisuals** plans to open-source their custom implementation due to GPL license requirements

### Community Activity
- Minimal activity in the developers and general channels
- Brief greetings exchanged between community members
- Questions about token plans and Upstreet status raised but not addressed

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is the Phantom wallet integration available as a .hyp that can be added to Current Core? Or is this "Devs Only"?**  
A: "No, it's not a .hyp. That would be pretty cool. Would take a bit to figure that out." - 3rdEyeVisuals

**Q: What was the reasoning behind web3 integration decisions in V1?**  
A: "In V1 we intentionally kept crypto separate to not alienate non-crypto users. The marketplace was intended to be the distribution method for blockchain extensions." - Maximus

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **3rdEyeVisuals** offered to share their custom source code for Phantom wallet integration with **Agent12**
- **3rdEyeVisuals** committed to open-sourcing their implementation before release due to GPL license requirements, though users would still need to implement certain core components themselves

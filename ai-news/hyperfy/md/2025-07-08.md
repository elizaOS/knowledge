# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Features
- **Dynamic 3D Model Loading**: Ashxn shared an experimental method to dynamically load GLB models from URLs using `world.load('model', URL)` followed by `world.add(model)`. This feature was enthusiastically received, with HypPrivakos noting they had requested similar functionality in Decentraland for years.
- **Seat Functionality**: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 successfully implemented seat v2 with Actions by copying scripts from v2 to replace v1 scripts, then re-adding emotes. This approach saved significant time compared to copying 40 individual positions across three instances.
- **Mobile & VR Compatibility**: 0mka inquired about plans for mobile and VR compatibility while sharing progress on DMs and chat channels.
- **Query Parameters**: Currently not implemented in Hyperfy according to Ashxn.
- **Upcoming Features**: Gh0sTt mentioned an upcoming bot and API repository.

### 3D Design & Asset Creation
- **Text-to-3D Avatar Generation**: Community members are exploring a tool that generates clean 3D meshes but requires manual rigging and texture improvements. The generated meshes are described as 75% usable with needed tweaks.
- **Optimization Workflows**: Discussion about using Sparc 3D for image-to-3D conversion, followed by Quadremeshing to reduce polygon count from 1 million to 10k triangles.
- **Texturing Approaches**: Vertex painting and UCUPaint in Blender were mentioned as alternatives to auto-generated textures that were described as looking "drawn by a child."
- **File Size Optimization**: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 noted that one particular GLB file for sitting animations was unusually large (500KB+) compared to others (typically 100-200KB).

### Platform Vision & Strategy
- **Visual Capabilities**: Discussion about the technical feasibility of creating No Man's Sky-like aesthetics in web environments, with mentions of hardware limitations and the potential impact of WebGPU integration.
- **Branding Strategy**: Brief reflection on Hyperfy's early positioning as a "brand coin" due to its focus on various technologies (AI, VR, virtual worlds, avatars, digital collectibles).

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a way to dynamically replace or load a 3D model into the world on load?**  
A: You can dynamically load any GLB from a URL using `world.load('model', 'https://somewhere.com/something.glb')` followed by `world.add(model)` (Ashxn)

**Q: Does this become attached to that script? How would you be able to toggle its visibility?**  
A: It's spawned in the context of the app that loads it, it's the same as any other node hierarchy you can deconstruct meshes independently (Ashxn)

**Q: Are query parameters implemented right now?**  
A: Nope (Ashxn)

**Q: Can animated skinned meshes have collision?**  
A: Have you tried adding collisions manually? Sometimes the plugin messes things up, but when manually setting/making the collisions it is fine (Valiant)

**Q: Is it possible to make worlds as aesthetically pleasing as No Man's Sky or is the web too limiting?**  
A: It's possible but would require significant development resources similar to what went into No Man's Sky (Agent12)

**Q: Does the text-to-avatar tool have rigging + animations?**  
A: Yes, it does have rigging + anims (Valiant)

**Q: What was wrong with the texture?**  
A: It looks drawn on by a child (hyp shaman)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Dynamic Model Loading**  
   - Helper: Ashxn | Helpee: creazy.eth
   - Context: Shared experimental code to load GLB models from URLs
   - Resolution: Provided working code example that was well-received

2. **Animated Mesh Collision Issues**  
   - Helper: Valiant | Helpee: Gert-Jan Akerboom
   - Context: Issues with animated skinned meshes and collision using Blender addon
   - Resolution: Suggested trying manual collision setup instead of using the plugin

3. **Seat Implementation**  
   - Helper: Unknown Discord user | Helpee: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓
   - Context: Implementing seat v2 with Actions
   - Resolution: Copy-paste tip saved 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 about an hour of work

4. **GLB File Optimization**  
   - Helper: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 | Helpee: 0mka
   - Context: Identifying and optimizing an unusually large sitting animation GLB file
   - Resolution: Found a way to reduce the file size and shared a lighter alternative

5. **3D Model Generation Assessment**  
   - Helper: Valiant | Helpee: hyp shaman
   - Context: Discussing quality of auto-generated meshes
   - Resolution: Confirmed meshes are clean but have too much geometry in places, good for re-texturing

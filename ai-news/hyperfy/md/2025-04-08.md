# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-08

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Voice Chat Implementation**: Successfully tested voice chat functionality in the "Fallen" game, with emotes working while speaking.
- **Animation Systems**: Extensive discussion about handling player movement animations and the challenges of overriding the character controller. Developers debated proper animation rigging, particularly how root bones should be disconnected from hips for proper animation retargeting.
- **Asset Preloading**: Techniques for preloading assets like animations to prevent hitching when first played were shared, with recommendations to add `preload:true` to file properties in app configuration.
- **Decentralization**: Ash highlighted that their project "Fallen" is completely decentralized with no external dependencies, contrasting with many Web3 applications that rely on centralized services.
- **EVM Compatibility**: Discussion confirmed that Hyperfy worlds can run on ENS websites, with peezy having already created an EVM mod in hypkg.

### AI Integration & Development Approaches
- **"Vibe Coding"**: Debate about using AI to generate code, with some advocating for making AI a first-class citizen in the platform to attract new creators.
- **Development Priorities**: Ash clarified that while AI integration is valuable, it shouldn't require a full engine pivot, suggesting a balance between innovation and core engine development.

### HYPER Token & Crypto
- **Price Volatility**: Significant price fluctuations observed (dropping to 4.2M market cap with -34.7% and later pumping to 8.2M with +42.3%), with mixed community sentiment.
- **Accumulation**: Several members mentioned continuing to buy during the dip, with one wallet observed purchasing significant amounts (reaching approximately 2% of supply).
- **Crypto Tax Software**: User "general hyper" announced development of free crypto tax reporting software as an alternative to paid services like Koinly, with technical discussions about API integration with exchanges and blockchain explorers.

### Game Development
- **Loot Pool System**: Discussions about improving the loot pool in Fallen, with suggestions for time-based unlocks or kill-based requirements to encourage player engagement.
- **Custom Animations**: Developers shared techniques for creating custom animations like tackling, dashing, and other player interactions.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How does the experimental wind shader work in Hyperfy?** (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom)  
A: It's a boolean custom property on the material (not the mesh). Select the mesh, go to material tab, and add a custom property called "wind" at the bottom. It works best for grass, with vertices nearest the root having zero movement and those above having progressively more movement. (answered by ash)

**Q: How do I change the spawnpoint in a world?** (asked by vox)  
A: Use the button in world menu (Escape -> world -> set spawn) or type "/spawn set" in chat. (answered by ash)

**Q: How can I speed up animations in Hyperfy?** (asked by general hyper)  
A: Add "?s=2" to the animation URL to change speed to 2x, e.g., const src = props.myEmote?.url + `?s=2` (answered by ash)

**Q: How do I implement custom movement animations that override the default character controller?** (asked by peezy)  
A: Create a state machine that listens to key inputs and applies the appropriate animation effect based on movement direction and state. (answered by Saori)

**Q: How can I preload assets like animations to prevent hitching when first played?** (asked by Saori)  
A: Add preload:true to file props in app configuration. (answered by ash)

**Q: Could we run a hyperfy world on an ENS Name/Website?** (asked by Agent12)  
A: "absofrickenlutely you can" (answered by ash)

**Q: How are you saying the price means nothing?** (asked by eigb)  
A: The asset you're investing in hasn't stopped shipping and building. The upside on something like this is extremely high. (answered by MUDBONE)

**Q: What will drive Hyperfy's value?** (asked by eigb)  
A: The real game changer is connectivity, that's where the real unmet demand is. (answered by PurpleSack)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Animation Implementation**
   - Helper: Saori | Helpee: general hyper
   - Context: Implementing custom movement animations
   - Resolution: Shared code for a state machine that handles different movement states and applies appropriate animations.

2. **Character Animation Techniques**
   - Helper: .hyp shaman | Helpee: peezy
   - Context: Creating custom animations for Hyperfy
   - Resolution: Demonstrated how to create animations like tackling by working with the root bone structure.

3. **Crypto Tax Software Development**
   - Helper: peezy | Helpee: general hyper
   - Context: Needed standardized interface for exchange APIs for tax software
   - Resolution: Shared CCXT library (https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) that provides standardized interfaces for multiple exchanges.

4. **Wind Shader Implementation**
   - Helper: ash | Helpee: Gert-Jan Akerboom
   - Context: Implementing experimental wind shader for meshes
   - Resolution: Explained that it's a boolean custom material property called "wind" that works best for grass, with vertices near the root having zero movement.

5. **Troubleshooting World Loading**
   - Helper: ash | Helpee: Pearl Hyacinth
   - Context: User couldn't see V1 worlds on Hyperfy homepage, only black boxes
   - Resolution: Suggested testing on mobile with different connections; user eventually found it worked on their new computer, suggesting a cache issue on other devices.

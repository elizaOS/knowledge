# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-16

**Date: November 16, 2025**

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### UI Development
- 3rdEyeVisuals updated UIVideo to respect UI RenderOrder and added an option to remove transparency from UI element containers
- This improvement keeps videos behind the root UI to prevent visual distraction

### Development Environment
- .hyp shaman mentioned using bun locally and reminded users to set their .env.local file
- Discussion about npm audit fixes, with caution against using --force as it could break dependencies

### Feature Exploration
- Discussion about implementing notification zones in Hyperfy V2 similar to "Collider with Notifications" from V1
- Exploration of rolling ball physics as a workaround for implementing vehicles in Hyperfy V2
- 3rdEyeVisuals expressed interest in experimenting with splatting technology
- Suggestion for adding a toggle for right analog stick camera movement

### Security & Moderation
- A user was banned from the server for suspected scam activities
- Warning about Discord account security

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it really important to do npm audit fix (without --force)? Any security risk for later in world?**  
A: If you --force updates to your packages you could actually break things. Need to be careful there. Some dependencies only play nice with certain versions of other dependencies. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)

**Q: Where and how should I import an app like Eliza into the code so I can use it in my 3D world?**  
A: If the Eliza framework is not already integrated into the backend of Hyperfy framework then it will be a lot more complex than just plug and play with the repo. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)

**Q: Could "Rolling Ball as the Actual Car" Physics be a super-quick workaround for Usable Vehicles in Hyperfy V2?**  
A: Yup! (confirmed by 3rdEyeVisuals)

**Q: Does anyone have simple V2 .hyps that might function like "Collider with Notifications" from V1?**  
A: Valiant suggested checking a previously shared Discord message that might help.

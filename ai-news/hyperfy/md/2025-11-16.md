# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Updates
- **UI Component Improvements**: 3rdEyeVisuals is working on updating the UIVideo component to respect UI RenderOrder and adding transparency control options for UI element containers.
- **Package Management Discussions**: Conversation about the proper use of npm package updates, with warnings about using the `--force` flag as it could break dependency relationships.
- **Environment Setup**: Reminders about setting up `.env.local` files for local development environments.
- **Alternative Technologies**: Brief mentions of alternative package managers like bun and experimentation with splatting technology for 3D rendering.

### Integration Questions
- Discussion about integrating Eliza (likely an AI chatbot) into a 3D world, with notes that this would be complex if not already part of the Hyperfy backend framework.

### User Experience
- Suggestion for adding a toggle option for right analog stick camera movement as an alternative to screen controls.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Where and how should I import an app like Eliza into the code so I can use it in my 3D world?** (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰)  
**A:** "If the Eliza framework is not already integrated into the backend of Hyperfy framework then it will be a lot more complex than just plug and play with the repo." (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)

**Q: Is it really important to do npm audit fix (without --force)? Any security risk for later in world?** (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰)  
**A:** "If you --force updates to your packages you could actually break things. Need to be careful there. Some dependencies only play nice with certain versions of other dependencies." (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)

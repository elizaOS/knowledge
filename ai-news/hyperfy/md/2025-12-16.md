# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-12-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Challenges & Proposals
- **Trait-based NFT Access Control**: Fibelius proposed a technical challenge to build an access control system for Hyperfy v2 worlds that would allow VOID ImmaDegen NFT avatars with specific traits to access designated areas within virtual spaces.
- The proposal emphasizes implementing trait-based token gating rather than simple token gating, which would provide more granular access control based on NFT characteristics.
- The VOID NFT traits would be sourced from the "Visitors of Imma Degen" collection available on OpenSea.

### Community Initiatives
- A bounty of approximately 300,000 Hyper tokens was offered by Fibelius for successfully completing the trait-based access control implementation.
- The proposal appears to be addressing an ongoing community dispute that might be resolved through this technical solution.

## Key Questions & Answers

- **Q: How can NFT traits be used for access control in Hyperfy worlds?** (asked by Fibelius)
  - *Status: Unanswered*

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Fibelius → Strong Star**: Proposed a technical challenge with compensation to build a trait-based NFT access control system for Hyperfy v2.
  - *Status: Pending (proposal made with compensation offered)*
  - The collaboration would include a public demonstration in the Discord server with an explanation of the build process and functionality.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-12-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Challenges & Development
- **NFT-Based Access Control:** Fibelius proposed a technical challenge to build an access control system for Hyperfy v2 worlds that would allow VOID avatars with specific NFT traits from the "Visitors of Imma Degen" collection to access designated areas. This would extend beyond simple token-gating to trait-specific permissions.
- **Video Playback Issues:** Multiple users reported problems with video playback in Hyperworld environments, with videos playing slowly and stalling despite fast internet connections. The issue affects both standard and "cool video hype" players.

### Community Initiatives
- Fibelius offered approximately 300,000 Hyper tokens as compensation for successfully implementing the NFT trait-based access control system, with a requirement for public demonstration and documentation.
- The proposed technical challenge appears aimed at resolving community disputes while creating marketing opportunities.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there a reason why videos play so slowly and keep stalling out?**  
A: Gert-Jan Akerboom tested a 200MB video that played smoothly in his hosted world, suggesting the issue might be related to specific configurations rather than a general platform problem.

**Q: What browser are you using for Hyperworld?**  
A: Gert-Jan Akerboom confirmed using Chrome with successful video playback.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Video Playback Troubleshooting:** Gert-Jan Akerboom responded to fractilians' and Agent12's reports of video playback issues by testing a large 200MB video in his own hosted world. After confirming smooth playback on his end, he offered to investigate the issue directly in fractilians' world to identify the specific cause.

- **Technical Challenge Proposal:** Fibelius reached out to Strong Star with a detailed technical challenge proposal, offering both compensation and a platform for demonstrating technical expertise to the community.

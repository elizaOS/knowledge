## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I get screen width/height in a Hyperfy app for screen space UI?** (asked by shmoji)  
A: You can use screen.width, screen.height or access them via app.control() (answered by 0mka and Ashxn)

**Q: Can we load an app using world.load()?** (asked by .hyp shaman)  
A: Not apps, but you can use this to load GLBs from remote sources (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Is there a way to make a UI "fill the entire screen"?** (asked by shmoji)  
A: Yes, by using app.control() to get screen dimensions and setting appropriate UI parameters (answered by 0mka)

**Q: Is this a public server or just on the local computer?** (asked by TheMattEmpire)  
A: It's a public server. It's worth setting up and exploring. Costs you nothing. (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)

**Q: Any good/cheap servers to use for Hyperfy?** (asked by TheMattEmpire)  
A: The hosting section runs down a good selection of providers, should be less than 6 bucks to run a basic hyperfy server https://docs.hyperfy.xyz/hosting/self/ (answered by maximus)

**Q: Is it worth buying the Kitbash Neo Tokyo 3D building Kit for Hyperfy?** (asked by Fibelius)  
A: Kitbash models will be difficult to optimize for Hyperfy due to high poly counts and textures, but could work with significant effort. Consider low-poly alternatives or texture projection techniques. (answered by hiroP)

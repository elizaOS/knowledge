# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-19

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **IDE Scripting Improvements**: Peezy shared a file watcher for script files that removes hashing steps and adds a new global event, available at [GitHub](https://github.com/peezy/hyperfy/tree/ide-scripting).
- **Animation Enhancements**: Ashxn mentioned improvements to animations by unlocking local player animations while only throttling remote player animation framerates.
- **Device Detection**: Significant discussion about detecting mobile devices and adapting content accordingly, with Ashxn implementing a fix for touch detection on iOS devices running as fullscreen apps.
- **Procedural Generation**: Gert-Jan Akerboom shared progress on mesh cloning along curves (similar to Blender's curve modifier), enabling procedural plant generation.
- **The Forge Quest System**: Lastraum discussed their cross-platform quest system that connects to multiple metaverse platforms (Hyperfy, Decentraland, Roblox) with wallet authentication and blockchain reward capabilities.
- **3D Design Techniques**: Vox demonstrated UV scrolling for rotors and blinking lights using a single texture with an emission map, showing an efficient technique for animated elements.
- **Asset Optimization**: Valiant shared experiences with gltf.report, noting its effectiveness in reducing VRAM usage but expressing frustration with increased file sizes when processing WebP textures.

### Platform & Community
- **HYPER Token Economics**: Ashxn clarified token distribution: 30% for DAO in multi-sig (untouched), 35% to v1 world holders and ai16z partners (with ~10% unclaimed), 15% to Founders (linear vested, untouched), and the rest in liquidity pools.
- **AI Integration**: Discussion about using Master Control Program (MCP) for AI-assisted scripting in Hyperfy, with peezy mentioning an existing proof of concept mod at hypkg.sh/hypkg/ai/.
- **Upcoming Tutorial**: 0mka announced a tutorial session covering the process from cloning the project to setting up a local environment and implementing basic world hypotheses/UI.
- **Infrastructure Fix**: Ash merged PR #94 to fix an issue where the scripts folder was not included in the build, causing the "world:clean" command to be unavailable.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: Will there be a way for a hyp app to modify player behavior, like injecting camera logic? (asked by Cybernetic-O-Cult)  
  **A**: applyEffect and app.control() might do what you need already within an app (answered by Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is scripting from IDE with auto script reloading possible? (asked by peezy)  
  **A**: Peezy shared his own implementation at https://github.com/peezy/hyperfy/tree/ide-scripting

- **Q**: Did something happen to animations? They look more fluid. (asked by peezy)  
  **A**: Yes, Ashxn unlocked local player animations, now only remote players throttle animation framerate (answered by Ashxn)

- **Q**: What does gltf.report do to compress files? (asked by vox)  
  **A**: It reduces VRAM usage but can increase overall filesize when reprocessing WebP textures (answered by Valiant)

### The Forge Quest System
- **Q**: How can I test this forge.hyp and see more what's happening there? (asked by 0mka)  
  **A**: Will share file shortly when ready! (answered by Lastraum)

- **Q**: What does happen onchain? (asked by 0mka)  
  **A**: Some rewards are on chain (nfts, tokens, dcl items), some like physical are not - we have set up `fulfillment` types (auto, manual) defaulting to auto (answered by Lastraum)

- **Q**: Is it ready that I can have an item collected in world trigger an NFT? (asked by 0mka)  
  **A**: Yes (answered by Lastraum)

- **Q**: What chain is it though? (asked by 0mka)  
  **A**: We are building this to be chain agnostic - users and creators won't have to "know" which chain it is (answered by Lastraum)

### HYPER Token
- **Q**: Is there any updated information on tokenomics (circulating supply and utility)? (asked by GonzaLord)  
  **A**: Provided link to token.hyperfy.xyz with detailed breakdown of token distribution (answered by Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is circulating supply still 50%? (asked by GonzaLord)  
  **A**: Detailed breakdown provided: 30% DAO (multi-sig), 35% to v1 holders/partners (~10% unclaimed), 15% to Founders (vested), rest is LP (answered by Ashxn)

- **Q**: If Streamflow says only 13.17% is still locked, is Dexscreener market cap incorrect? (asked by GonzaLord)  
  **A**: Dexscreener accounts for circulating supply excluding DAO, Unclaimed, and Founders tokens, but doesn't consider vesting status (answered by Ashxn)

- **Q**: What do you do with the unlocked tokens? (asked by GonzaLord)  
  **A**: Nobody has touched them (answered by Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Touch Controls Fix**: Ashxn helped MetaRick resolve an issue where touch controls weren't showing on iPad/iPhone when run as fullscreen app from desktop, implementing a fix that was confirmed working on island.hyperfy.xyz.

- **UI Pointer Lock Issue**: Ashxn assisted Lastraum with a UI pointer lock issue when clicking on an image in a complex UI. Lastraum fixed it by ensuring onPointerDown was added before the view was added to the app.

- **Smooth UI Animation**: Lastraum helped 0mka implement smooth UI animations by sharing code for notification panel animation using offset and direction variables.

- **The Forge Integration**: Lastraum provided detailed explanations to 0mka about how The Forge quest system works with both on-chain and off-chain rewards, confirming it can trigger NFTs from in-world actions, and offered to collaborate.

- **3D Design Techniques**: Vox shared a UV scrolling technique for rotors and blinking lights using a single texture with emission map, demonstrating a working implementation with examples.

- **Asset Optimization**: Valiant explained to vox the tradeoffs of using gltf.report for 3D asset optimization, clarifying how it reduces VRAM while sometimes increasing file size.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-19

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Tools & Features
- **IDE Scripting Tool**: peezy shared a new IDE scripting tool with auto script reloading functionality, available on GitHub (ide-scripting branch)
- **Hyperfy Studio**: 0mka mentioned plans for a "Hyperfy Studio" that would combine existing tools and work alongside the browser/platform as an enhanced builder mode
- **Tutorial Session**: 0mka announced an upcoming tutorial covering the complete world-building process from cloning to creating basic worlds with UI elements

### World Building Projects
- Several members discussed creating an "overworld" with portals to different experiences (sandbox, art, arcade, crypto)
- emotionull shared plans for "phettaverse.games" and is actively seeking builders
- MUDBONE suggested NFT communities should build worlds in Hyperfy
- B0gie mentioned working on traits and suggested waiting for the next "wiggles" event

### HYPER Token Economics
- Ashxn provided a detailed breakdown of token distribution:
  - 30% in DAO multi-sig (untouched)
  - 35% allocated to v1 world holders and ai16z partners (~10% unclaimed)
  - 15% to founders (linear vested, untouched)
  - Remainder in liquidity pools
- Discussion about how Dexscreener calculates market cap based on circulating supply

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
**Q**: Is there a way for a Hyperfy app to modify player behavior, like injecting camera logic?  
**A**: Yes, you can use `applyEffect` and `app.control()` functions that already exist within an app (Ashxn)

**Q**: Is scripting from IDE with auto script reloading available?  
**A**: peezy shared his implementation with a GitHub branch link

**Q**: Is project89 building a world in hyper?  
**A**: Yes, b0gie has helped them on a few things and they've posted some cool previews (maximus)

### Token Economics
**Q**: Is there any updated information on tokenomics (circulating supply and utility)?  
**A**: https://token.hyperfy.xyz (Ashxn)

**Q**: Is circulating supply still 50%?  
**A**: 30% DAO is in a multi-sig, untouched. 35% to v1 world holders and ai16z partners, ~10% went unclaimed. 15% to Founders is linear vested, also untouched. Rest is LP. (Ashxn)

**Q**: If Streamflow says that only 13.17% is still locked, is Dexscreener market cap not correct?  
**A**: Dexscreener takes circulating into account, which is essentially all tokens minus DAO, Unclaimed, and Founders. It doesn't look at the portion that is vested or not. (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Player Behavior Modification**
   - Ashxn helped Cybernetic-O-Cult by pointing to existing functions (`applyEffect` and `app.control()`) for modifying player behavior in Hyperfy apps

2. **IDE Scripting Tool**
   - peezy shared a GitHub branch with the community for testing an IDE scripting tool with auto reload capability, including a warning about backing up world folders before testing

3. **Hiring Builders**
   - maximus advised emotionull on where to post about hiring builders, suggesting a specific channel and recommending direct outreach to active builders

4. **Token Information**
   - Ashxn provided GonzaLord with detailed information about HYPER token distribution and market cap calculation methods

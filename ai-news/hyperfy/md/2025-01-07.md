# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### V2 Platform Development
- **V2 Launch Imminent**: The new version is expected to launch within a week, bringing significant architectural changes
- **Technical Architecture**: V2 will be browser-based, device-agnostic, and won't require powerful GPUs
- **Hosting Requirements**: Extremely lightweight server needs - tests ran successfully with 512MB RAM, though 1-2GB is recommended
- **Open Source Approach**: V2 transitions from NFT-gated model to an open-source, self-hostable framework
- **In-Browser Development**: New capabilities include coding directly in the browser without local development requirements
- **Migration Path**: While V2 uses new technology, all 3D models, avatars and emotes from V1 will still be supported using the same formats

### AI Integration
- **Eliza AI Agents**: Ashxn demonstrated integration with AI agents, showing "Shaw" responding in real-time within a Hyperfy world
- **Codeless Interaction**: The system allows AI to interpret user commands and interact with world objects
- **No-Code Capabilities**: Emphasis on making AI integration accessible without programming knowledge

### $HYPER Token Launch
- **Token Distribution**: Recently launched on Solana with airdrops for legacy NFT world holders and ai16z partners
- **Tokenomics**: 30% allocated to DAO, 15% to team (3-year linear vesting), 20% locked in liquidity
- **Airdrop Claims**: Approximately 151,200 tokens per world, with unclaimed tokens likely to be locked permanently
- **Eligibility**: Required ownership of ETH worlds before December 7th snapshot OR 100k ai16z tokens in a wallet on December 25th

### Documentation Challenges
- **Knowledge Gap**: Significant disparity between experienced developers and newcomers
- **Community Efforts**: Jin shared an unofficial documentation repository that hasn't been merged into official docs
- **Repeated Requests**: Multiple calls for improved documentation, especially for modifying existing apps and UI components

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What is the difference between V1 and V2?**  
A: V2 is a totally new engine with more performance, open source, self-hostable, better in-world editing including coding in-browser (Ashxn)

**Q: Will V1 worlds be transferred to V2?**  
A: New tech, but all 3D models, avatars and emotes will still be supported using the same formats (Ashxn)

**Q: How performant of a server do we need when hosting ourselves?**  
A: Really lightweight - tests ran a world with 512mb RAM, but 1-2GB recommended as the world simulates on the server with all models (Ashxn)

**Q: Do I need to own a V1 world to build in V2?**  
A: No, V2 will be open and buildable by anyone without needing NFTs (maximus)

**Q: How do I access my space using CLI?**  
A: Use npm run connect and npm run upload <id> to publish live (yung_algorithm)

**Q: Is there a way to download an environment that's live, modify it, and then re-upload it?**  
A: For V1 you cannot edit current apps in your "live" world, you can only upload new ones made by you (Lastraum)

**Q: What will happen with unclaimed airdrop tokens?**  
A: Likely the unclaimed tokens will be locked up in the claims program forever with ownership renounced (Saori)

**Q: Is it better to wait for v2 to start building?**  
A: Since we're so close, it may be better to wait if you're completely new to Hyperfy so that it's all fresh. You don't have to worry about v1 nuances (maximus)

**Q: Are there V1 SDK components for 2D UI elements?**  
A: Yes but undocumented right now, like GuiView (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Documentation Initiative**: Jin shared unofficial documentation repository, with several community members including the Numinia team offering to help with documentation efforts
- **Onboarding Assistance**: Maximus added new users to sandbox worlds to experiment with V1 components and granted builder permissions to those wanting to learn
- **Development Guidance**: Yung_algorithm provided CLI commands for connecting and uploading apps to help StrawberrySith access their space
- **Airdrop Support**: TropixMusic helped verify the legitimacy of claim sites when users expressed concerns about potential scams
- **Technical Explanations**: Lastraum explained V1 limitations regarding editing live apps in Hyperfy worlds
- **Feature Demonstrations**: Ashxn shared video showing AI agent integration, demonstrating Shaw responding in real-time within a Hyperfy world

## Action Items

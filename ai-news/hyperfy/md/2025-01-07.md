# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### V2 Platform Development
- **Complete Rebuild**: V2 is a complete rebuild with better performance, open-source architecture, and improved in-world editing capabilities including in-browser coding
- **Technical Architecture**: V2 will be self-hostable with lightweight server requirements (1-2GB RAM recommended)
- **Multi-chain Support**: V2 will support multiple blockchains through plugins, including Solana
- **AI Integration**: Upcoming Eliza AI agent integration will allow codeless interaction between AI agents and world objects
- **Release Timeline**: V2 is expected to launch very soon, likely within a week or two
- **Migration**: No automatic transfer of V1 worlds to V2, but 3D models, avatars, and emotes will still be supported using the same formats

### $HYPER Token Launch
- **Airdrop Process**: Approximately 151,200 tokens per world owned are being distributed to eligible holders
- **Registration Process**: Users must register ETH addresses and connect Solana wallets to claim tokens
- **Deadline Extension**: The deadline for linking ETH and SOL wallets was extended from January 7 to January 12, 2025
- **Tokenomics**: 15% for team (3-year linear vesting), 30% for DAO (eventually controlled by token voting), 20% locked liquidity
- **Unclaimed Tokens**: About 13% of the airdrop allocation remains unclaimed; these will likely be locked in the claims program forever or moved to the DAO
- **DAO Purpose**: The DAO will fund ecosystem development and allow token holders to vote on third-party projects that benefit Hyperfy

### Technical Discussions
- **V1 Limitations**: Users cannot edit current apps in live Hyperfy environments but must create new ones
- **Documentation Gaps**: Several developers expressed frustration about the lack of clear documentation for modifying existing apps
- **UI Components**: Undocumented GuiView elements exist for 2D UI in V1
- **Performance Optimization**: Users can view performance stats using the tilde (~) key

### Security Concerns
- **Scam Attempts**: Multiple warnings about scammers impersonating staff members in DMs and creating fake support threads
- **Wallet Compatibility**: Issues with certain wallet types like Coinbase wallets and Safe wallets for the airdrop claiming process
- **NFT Status**: Critical announcement that Hyperfy World NFTs are no longer mintable from the website and future utility is not guaranteed

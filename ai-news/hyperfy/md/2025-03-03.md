# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Features
- **Persistent Data Storage**: Ashxn introduced a significant new feature allowing persistent data storage between sessions, demonstrated with a treasure chest app. This enables timers, quests, GUIs, and action bars, greatly expanding possibilities compared to v1.
- **Material Properties**: Currently only emission and UV scrolling can be modified at runtime.
- **Camera Access**: Functionality to access camera position and rotation is available, though a bug with initial values was fixed.
- **LOD Implementation**: Questions raised about whether nesting everything in a LOD structure is efficient when only one LOD exists.
- **Bone Animation**: Requests for setBoneTransform() function to enable more natural character movements and animation blending.
- **Scaling in v2**: Scale functionality works in v2, but for an App's Node, developers need to use app.root.

### Tools & Resources
- **Hyperfy Tools**: Now available as an official Blender extension, installable directly through Blender's preferences/extensions system rather than from GitHub.
- **Community Resources**: Efforts to organize and catalog shared .hyp files, with work toward creating searchable repositories of code snippets and examples (referred to as "hyperdex" or "hypdeck").
- **HyperFiles Showcase**: HypPrivakos compiled an extensive list of .hyp files including beacons, portals, NPCs, vehicles, weapons, furniture, UI components, and interactive elements created by community members.

### Community & Platform Updates
- **Feature Request Management**: Discussion about repurposing an existing channel for feature requests, with suggestions to either create a forum channel or use GitHub Projects.
- **Tutorial Series**: Moved to Mondays, covering Hyperfy Tools (Blender Add-on) and asset preparation.
- **Security Alert**: Warning about a potential scammer impersonating community member Ashxn.
- **Wallet Integration**: Solflare being added to Collab Land, enabling wallet-based role gating on Discord.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it possible to build a simple clicker game in Hyperfy?**  
A: Yes, using onPointerDown events for interaction. (MetaMike and Ashxn provided code examples)

**Q: What material properties can be influenced at runtime?**  
A: Only emission and UV scroll can be modified at runtime. (Ashxn)

**Q: Is it possible to get the camera's current position and rotation?**  
A: Yes, but there was a bug where initial values were zeros, which has been fixed. (Ashxn)

**Q: Can I list player IDs in the world?**  
A: Yes, this functionality is now available. (Ashxn)

**Q: Does scale work yet in v2?**  
A: Yes, but for an App's Node you need to use app.root. (Saori and bear)

**Q: Where can I find the Blender tools for Hyperfy?**  
A: You can find it directly in Blender by opening preferences, clicking extensions, and searching for "hyperfy tools". (~/HowiEDuhzit)

**Q: Which channel can we sacrifice for a feature request channel?**  
A: Channel #1059912035732832336 can be archived for this purpose. (maximus)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Clicker Game Implementation**: MetaMike and Ashxn helped ToxSam build a clicker game by providing code examples showing onPointerDown event usage and additional code with pointer enter/leave events for feedback.

- **Camera Position Bug**: Ashxn helped ~/HowiEDuhzit with a bug where camera position/rotation values showed as zeros on first frame, fixing the issue and pushing a change to correctly set initial camera values.

- **App Scaling**: Saori helped bear with setting scale for App objects in v2, suggesting using app.scale.y and app.scale.set() methods. Bear later discovered that app.root is needed to access the Node.

- **UI Issue Resolution**: Ashxn quickly fixed a broken scrolling issue in the inspector pane after Omka reported it following the treasure chest update.

- **Hyperfy Tools Installation**: ~/HowiEDuhzit and maximus helped mrtzhckr find and install Hyperfy Blender tools, explaining how to install directly through Blender's extension system rather than using an outdated GitHub link.

- **Security Awareness**: ApeironCreations warned simk about a scammer impersonating Ashxn, explaining how to verify user identity by checking User ID.

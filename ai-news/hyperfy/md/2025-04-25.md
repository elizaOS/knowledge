# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### UI/UX Development
- Omka shared work on a redesigned interface moving away from floating panels to a more structured layout with tabs and split views
- Ashxn expressed concerns about UI organization, particularly regarding app palettes and component placement
- New UI features added including scale gizmo and mousewheel controls for rotation and scaling
- Discussion about implementing better feedback/loading indicators when importing assets

### 3D Avatar Creation & AI Tools
- Users discussed TripoSG, an AI tool generating 3D models from images in under a minute
- Ashxn demonstrated a complete workflow for creating, optimizing, and rigging 3D avatars
- The process from generation to rigged model now takes approximately 15 minutes
- Conversation about "Retardio" models, a subcultural NFT collection related to but distinct from "Milady"

### Performance Optimization
- App toggling functionality in development to allow users to disable apps and measure performance impact
- Ideas for performance visualization tools including a bar system showing resource usage across device types
- Importance of proper LOD implementation for performance when scattering many objects
- Discussion about the current multi-tool workflow for LOD generation (Hyperfy Tools → Armory → manual renaming)

### Environmental Design & Object Distribution
- Shiffty shared a terrain object distribution system using raycasting to place objects on tagged terrain
- Code examples shared for cloning and distributing objects in world space with wind effects
- Technical implementation of tree generation with world-space wind shader

### HYPER Token Discussion
- Conversation about Raydium's "Burn and Earn" mechanism for the HYPER token
- Clarification that 99% of liquidity is locked ("burnt" in Raydium terminology) while the remaining portion earns fees
- Discussion about how DEX screener records transactions where pool fees are claimed as "removing liquidity"

### Technical Issues
- Problems with GLB models containing bones that cannot be interacted with properly
- User Pearl Hyacinth experiencing persistent loading problems across multiple computers and browsers
- Troubleshooting suggestions including checking wallet authentication, trying incognito mode, and clearing site data

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I capture scroll events in a hyp to prevent them from controlling in-world scroll?**  
A: Use `control.scrollDelta.capture = true` to take over the scroll wheel, but only capture it when needed.

**Q: Can an app load another app from IPFS?**  
A: Currently not supported as it raises security concerns; world.load only handles models and avatars.

**Q: Is it possible to have a custom player/camera controller and first person view?**  
A: Yes, can be implemented similar to the drone example Omka shared.

**Q: What's a good PRNG implementation for Hyperfy?**  
A: Ashxn shared two implementations, with preference for the LFSR-based one.

**Q: Can we punch now in hyperfy?**  
A: In some worlds, yes.

**Q: Is it possible to tell what the FPS would be on all devices, even when using only one of them?**  
A: Not directly, but it might be possible to make an estimate.

**Q: How does Raydium's "Burn and Earn" work for HYPER?**  
A: 99% is locked and the rest earns fees off volume. The locked portion accumulates fees that need to be periodically "harvested."

**Q: Can someone give me troubleshooting ideas for why Hyperfy does not load on 4 different computers and 2 different browsers?**  
A: It could be related to Vipe avatars fetched via URL with servers down, browser extensions, or wallet authentication issues. Try incognito mode and clearing site data.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Avatar Creation**: Ashxn helped peezy create a 3D version of himself, generating, optimizing, and rigging a 3D model in about 15 minutes
- **Performance Optimization**: Ashxn added app toggling functionality in the dev branch after MetaRick requested a way to toggle app visibility to check performance impact
- **Environmental Design**: Shiffty shared a script for distributing objects on terrain using raycasting against tagged terrain objects
- **Technical Troubleshooting**: Multiple users (vox, Saori, 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) offered different approaches to help Pearl Hyacinth resolve persistent loading issues
- **UI Implementation**: Ashxn provided solutions to Omka for implementing scroll capture and keyboard controls for toggling UI elements
- **Token Mechanics**: ash explained to general hyper how Raydium's "Burn and Earn" mechanism works for the HYPER token

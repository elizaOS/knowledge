# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### UI/UX Development
- Omka and Ashxn discussed significant UI/UX improvements for Hyperfy, including a redesigned build interface with split views, tabbed components, and improved menu systems
- New UI controls were implemented, including a scale gizmo and mousewheel controls for rotation and scaling
- Discussions about CSS-like styling in VR environments highlighted the technical approach where each rule is written to a canvas, allowing UI to exist in VR as a transparent screen
- UIScroll and UIInput nodes are being developed to improve interaction with the interface

### 3D Avatar Creation & Implementation
- Extensive discussion about using AI tools (particularly TripoSG) to generate 3D avatars from images
- Ashxn demonstrated a complete workflow for creating, optimizing, and rigging 3D avatars in under 15 minutes
- The process involves AI generation, mesh optimization in Blender, adding armatures with the VRM addon, and rigging with AutoRigPro
- Users expressed excitement about the rapid advancement of 3D creation tools and potential for workflow automation

### Performance Optimization
- Implementation of app toggling functionality to assess performance impact of different elements
- Discussions about a proposed performance visualization bar that would indicate resource usage across different device types
- Emphasis on efficient instancing for elements like trees with wind animation effects
- LOD (Level of Detail) implementation strategies for optimizing 3D assets
- Performance considerations across platforms (mobile, standalone VR, desktop)

### Technical Implementation
- Code sharing for PRNGs (Pseudorandom Number Generators) with optimized implementations
- Discussions about loading assets from IPFS and concerns about apps spawning other apps
- Tree generation techniques using efficient instancing with world-space wind shader
- Scripting for object distribution and terrain generation using raycasting

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I capture scroll events in a Hyp without affecting world scroll?**  
A: Use `control.scrollDelta.capture = true` to take over the scroll wheel, but only capture it when needed (Ashxn)

**Q: Is it possible to use hotkeys to toggle UI elements?**  
A: Yes, using control.keyI.onPress with a toggle flag to add/remove UI elements (Ashxn)

**Q: Why doesn't CSS work in Hyperfy?**  
A: CSS doesn't work in VR; Hyperfy uses a CSS-like system where each rule is written to a canvas, allowing UI to exist in VR as a transparent screen (Ashxn)

**Q: Can an app load another app from IPFS?**  
A: Currently not supported as it raises concerns about control and potential abuse (Ashxn)

**Q: Where are you running TripoSG? The Hugging Face space is dead.**  
A: "Looks like it's up again https://huggingface.co/spaces/VAST-AI/TripoSG" (Ashxn)

**Q: Is it possible to tell what the FPS would be on all devices, even when using only one of them?**  
A: Not directly, but it might be possible to make estimates (Ashxn)

**Q: Can we make hyp files to toggle them?**  
A: Apps can already toggle their own meshes with mesh.active=false, but toggling the whole app would prevent it from turning back on (Ashxn)

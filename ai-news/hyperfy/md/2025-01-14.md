# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy V2 Development Progress
- V2 is technically available and being used by developers, with broader access coming soon
- The platform is transitioning to a dev branch workflow with recent release of v0.2.0
- Mobile/touch controls have been added in the latest update

- Developers can now drag-and-drop 3D models directly into worlds through the browser

### Technical Features & Implementation
- **Physics System**: Detailed discussions on implementing collision meshes with custom properties in Blender
- **Scripting Capabilities**: Work continues on script documentation and API exposure
- **Networked Events**: Introduction of networked app events for multiplayer interactions
- **Interactive Demo**: Creation of flyable drones demonstrating interaction nodes, networking state, and server authority
- **3D Modeling**: Discussions on blendshapes, lip sync functionality, and AI-assisted 3D model generation
- **Deployment Options**: Documentation shared for Digital Ocean deployment, with community members testing on various platforms

### Governance & Token
- DAO discussions focused on balancing decentralization with centralized leadership
- Proposal for a tiered bounty system for funding community-requested features
- Community supports a "benevolent dictator" model for effective decision-making
- Native token ($HYPER) recently launched with discussions about price movements

### Platform Differentiation
- No downloads required, accessible via browser links
- No need to purchase digital land
- Cross-chain integration with EVM-compatible blockchains
- Focus on eliminating barriers to entry for metaverse creation

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: How does one set collision on an asset?  
  **A**: Add custom properties in Blender (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do I make dynamic to dynamic collision work?  
  **A**: They need to be convex colliders - add a boolean custom prop named "convex" set to true on the collider (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Where is the script saved when edited in-world?  
  **A**: Everything gets saved into the /world folder (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do you move objects up and down in the test world?  
  **A**: Hold shift and move the mouse (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Is there a way to control triangle count?  
  **A**: Use the Decimate modifier (Ashxn)

### Platform Capabilities
- **Q**: What is the difference between Hyperfy and other metaverse projects like MANA?  
  **A**: Hyperfy is accessible via browser, doesn't require land purchases, and can integrate with any chain/token (Uuuuuuuuu)

- **Q**: When will V2 be available?  
  **A**: A couple weeks for early V2, maybe sooner (Uuuuuuuuu)

- **Q**: How many concurrent users can Hyperfy support?  
  **A**: Event managers have instanced 100 people in a single world, probably 300+ across multiple instances (maximus)

- **Q**: What are the PC spec requirements?  
  **A**: Most worlds run on phones, and it works on desktop/mobile/VR (Uuuuuuuuu and maximus)

- **Q**: Does Hyperfy have lipsync functionality?  
  **A**: Hyperfy 1.0 had lip sync so 2.0 will likely have it too (Whambammy⚡)

### Governance & Token
- **Q**: Is it possible for people who wear NFTs to have authentication showing they own the NFT?  
  **A**: You can't prevent people from ripping avatars, but you can show a badge that they own it (Ashxn)

- **Q**: What is RWA in this context?  
  **A**: Real World Assets, which has potential for integration with Hyperfy (maximus)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Assistance
- **Ashxn** helped **MetaMike** set up physics for dynamic objects in Blender by explaining custom properties needed for rigidbody and collider nodes
- **Ashxn** assisted **hiroP** in understanding the structure for dynamic collision objects in Blender
- **vincentskele** helped **Unchained Ninja** get started with Hyperfy v2 deployment on Digital Ocean
- **m₂** helped **maximus** troubleshoot Alma Linux deployment issues by suggesting lowering the version of better-sqlite3 to 10.1
- **Ashxn** fixed an issue for **Uuuuuuuuu** who crashed a test world by uploading a dolphin model with morph targets

### Community Knowledge Sharing
- **Whambammy⚡** shared information about "Face it" tool for FACS-based blendshapes in Blender
- **mattimus** provided examples of Stable Point-Aware 3D models and shared GitHub link with setup instructions
- **Valiant** explained Meshy3D's AI texturing capabilities allowing 4 retries for texturing uploaded models
- **maximus** added users to V1 worlds and provided instructions on connecting through the old .io site
- **shiny_shiba** explained wallet transaction patterns related to the airdrop distribution

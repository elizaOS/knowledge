# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy v2 Development Progress
- **Release Timeline**: V2 is technically available for those with technical backgrounds, with broader access coming within weeks
- **Open Source Approach**: V2 is being developed as an open-source metaverse platform allowing users to build without coding knowledge
- **Technical Architecture**: Server-side physics simulation is being implemented for better game development and cheating prevention
- **Platform Accessibility**: Supports desktop, mobile, and VR with minimal hardware requirements
- **Mobile Support**: Mobile/touch controls were added in v0.2.0
- **Development Workflow**: A dev branch was established for ongoing development before releases to main

### Scripting & Interactive Features
- **In-World Scripting**: New capabilities allow in-world app creation without modifying core code
- **Drone Prototype**: Ashxn demonstrated a flyable drone showcasing interaction nodes, networked state/events, and server authority
- **Physics Implementation**: Detailed discussions on implementing dynamic collision objects in Blender with proper rigidbody and collider properties
- **Multiplayer Coding**: V2 enables collaborative development directly within worlds rather than requiring local SDK setup

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- **Digital Ocean Guide**: Ashxn shared a comprehensive deployment guide for Digital Ocean, which several users successfully implemented
- **World Management**: Commands like "rm -rf world" or "mv world world2" can be used to reset or manage worlds
- **File Storage**: All scripts edited in-world are saved to the /world folder

### 3D Design & Asset Creation
- **AI-Assisted Creation**: Tools like Meshy3D for texturing and Stable Point-Aware 3D for generating models from images were discussed
- **Optimization Techniques**: Quad remeshing in Blender and decimation for reducing triangle counts were recommended
- **Animation Support**: Discussion of blendshapes and lip sync functionality, with "Face it" in Blender recommended for FACS-based blendshapes

### DAO Governance Structure
- **Governance Principles**: Maximus shared key guidelines including tying fund distributions to value-adding activities, maintaining dev team control over platform direction, preventing whale dominance in voting, and implementing a tiered bounty system
- **Community Involvement**: Balance between centralized leadership and community participation was emphasized

## Key Questions & Answers

### Platform Capabilities
- **Q**: What is the difference between Hyperfy and other metaverse projects like MANA?  
  **A**: Hyperfy can be accessed with just a link click, allows no-code world building in browser, and can be integrated with any chain/token, unlike competitors requiring downloads, wallet connections, and registration.

- **Q**: How many concurrent users can Hyperfy support?  
  **A**: Event managers have instanced 100 people in a single world, probably 300+ across multiple instances of a world.

- **Q**: What are the PC spec requirements for Hyperfy?  
  **A**: Most worlds run on phones, and the platform works on desktop/mobile/VR.

- **Q**: Does Hyperfy V2 allow real-time voice chat?  
  **A**: Yes, and it includes VR support.

- **Q**: Can I build an AI agent in a Hyperfy metaverse?  
  **A**: Yes, v2 is approaching low-code/no-code functionality, and ElizaOS AI agent framework is available out of the box. Estimated cost around $5/month if you can use terminal commands.

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: How does one set collision on an asset?  
  **A**: You need to set up proper rigidbody and collider nodes in Blender with custom properties.

- **Q**: How do I handle collisions for meshes with multiple materials?  
  **A**: You might need a dedicated collision mesh with no materials because ThreeJS splits meshes by material.

- **Q**: How do I make dynamic to dynamic collision work?  
  **A**: Add a boolean custom property named "convex" set to true on the collider.

- **Q**: Where are scripts saved when edited in-world?  
  **A**: Everything gets saved to the /world folder.

- **Q**: Can I log all meshes of an object?  
  **A**: Use app.traverse(node => { console.log(node.id) })

- **Q**: If I copy a model then apply a script to one, does that script apply to all copies?  
  **A**: Yes, but there is an unlink button that lets you decouple them.

- **Q**: Does hyperfy have lipsync functionality?  
  **A**: Hyperfy 1.0 had lip sync so v2.0 will likely have it too.

- **Q**: Is it possible for people wearing NFTs to get authentication that shows they own the NFT?  
  **A**: You can't prevent people ripping and using avatars, but you can definitely show a badge that they own it.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Assistance
- **Ashxn** helped **MetaMike** set up collision for dynamic objects in Blender, explaining custom properties needed for rigidbody and collider nodes
- **vincentskele** guided **Unchained Ninja** through the Hyperfy server setup process on Digital Ocean
- **Ashxn** quickly identified and fixed an issue when **Uuuuuuuuu**'s test world crashed after uploading a 3D model with morph targets
- **maximus** and **ash** helped **psy-sci** troubleshoot persistent issues with Hyperfy v1, identifying Wallet Guard as blocking connections

### Documentation Efforts
- **hiroP** created comprehensive documentation in a shared HackMD for Blender physics setup
- **MetaMike** updated shared documentation with skybox loading instructions
- **Ashxn** created and shared a detailed wiki page for Digital Ocean deployment
- The community collaboratively documented technical aspects including Blender physics setup, skybox loading, and other features

### Resource Sharing
- **Valiant** shared Meshy3D for AI texturing of uploaded models with tips on using the retry feature
- **mattimus** shared example outputs from Stable Point-Aware 3D and setup instructions for ComfyUI
- **Malloy** provided information about Jupiter Swap airdrop allocation with a link for users to check eligibility

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Issues & Platform Status
- **Vibe World Stability Issues**: The platform is experiencing crashes due to memory leaks in one of approximately 2000 AI-generated apps. The team is working on solutions but hasn't fully resolved the issue yet. (ash)
- **Recent Technical Advancements**: Two significant developments were highlighted:
  - Integration of "prims" with AI functionality
  - Implementation of OpenRouter support, allowing users to run custom LLMs to power generation in the platform (maximus)
- **Azure OpenAI Integration**: Work is underway to implement changes for Azure OpenAI endpoint compatibility, with reference to an existing pull request (#134). (mrtzhckr)

### User Permissions & Experience
- **Builder Rights Management**: Discussion clarified that builder rights are persistent but can only be revoked when both users are simultaneously present in the world. Rights may not persist if local data is cleared. (.hyp shaman, ash)
- **Legacy World Availability**: Confirmation that the legacy world version is still available and functional for building purposes. (𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)
- **Mobile Experience Issues**: Concerns raised about the mobile version's avatar interface not allowing proper viewing of images, with suggestions to add zoom functionality. (Nicola Bertoglio)

### Community Activity
- There appears to be reduced overall activity in the project compared to previous periods, with community members noting less frequent updates and communication.
- Some community content creation continues, with members sharing and appreciating a "diner" world project.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Would it be possible to have the Vibe World back up just for visiting and looking around?**  
A: The team is working on it, but it keeps crashing due to issues with AI-generated apps causing memory leaks. (ash)

**Q: Is there a way to revoke builder rights from players that are not in the world?**

**Q: Is the legacy world version still available for building?**  
A: Yes, the legacy system still works. (𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)

**Q: What's the current state of the project given the reduced activity?**

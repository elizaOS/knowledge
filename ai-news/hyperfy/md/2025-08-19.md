# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-19

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Breakthroughs
- **Rendering Optimization**: Ash shared a major breakthrough allowing billions of differently sized and colored primitives to be rendered in a single draw call, reducing draw calls from ~1000 to ~100 in test scenes.
- **Instancing Technique**: The system automatically reuses shape+color pairs, dramatically improving performance by reducing redundant draw calls.
- **AI-Generated Worlds**: AI can now generate interactive elements through simple prompts, including:
  - Trigger zones
  - Moving objects (planes, orbiting objects)
  - Complete scenes with hundreds of objects but fewer than 100 draw calls
  - Output as editable .hyp files

### Movement Systems
- Shaw is developing a RuneScape-style point-and-click movement controller for Hyperfy
- The system (dubbed "Hyperscape") still has some orientation issues to resolve

### Community
- Anticipation building for an upcoming release (mentioned in general channel)
- Ash clarified a misconception about personal finances, noting they are still renting and haven't purchased a house with project funds

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is there any way we could do this with static GLBs that use the same material?**  
A: "That's more complicated but probably doable one day" (ash)

**Q: Can you prompt a orbiting satellite or plane?**  
A: Yes, ash demonstrated with a working plane example

**Q: Will those creations have frontend scripts and can we download this stuff as .hyps?**  
A: "They create hyp's, yes" (ash)

**Q: How much does it [AI color selection] use currently?**  
A: "Infinite, it writes colors it likes" (ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **AI-Generated Movement Objects**
   - Vox asked if AI can create moving objects like planes
   - Ash shared a working plane example and explained that it can be edited
   - Demonstrated the practical application of the new technology

2. **Material Instancing Explanation**
   - Vox asked about how the material instancing works
   - Ash explained that AI picks shapes/colors freely and the engine automatically reuses matching pairs
   - Helped clarify the technical implementation details

3. **Bug Reporting**
   - Gert-Jan reported the plane example turning into a red warning box after reload
   - Issue acknowledged, though no immediate solution was provided

## Action Items

### Technical
- Implement voice prompting in VR for AI generation (mentioned by ash)
- Fix issues with orientation in the RuneScape-style movement controller (mentioned by shaw)
- Fix plane example to prevent it turning into a red warning box after reload (mentioned by Gert-Jan Akerboom)

### Features
- Support for instancing with static GLBs using the same material (mentioned by TheMattEmpire)
- Create tiled floor where tiles emit when stepped on (mentioned by vox)

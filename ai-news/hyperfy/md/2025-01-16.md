# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### V2 Development Progress
- Hyperfy's V2 is being built in public with rapid iteration, available on GitHub
- The team is focused on porting V1 features to V2 while adding new capabilities
- Significant progress made on editor panes with persistence, drone physics, and scripting documentation
- V2 is currently described as "bare bones" and designed as a blank canvas for developers
- Ashxn (founder) left his job to work full-time on Hyperfy after developing it part-time for years

### Technical Implementations
- Drone application with physics-based controls was a major focus of development
- Saori implemented Solana integration for in-world scripting in just 30 minutes
- UI improvements for the editor are being actively developed
- Agent integration for V2 has begun, with AGI agents positioned as a key differentiator
- WebMIDI support is being implemented for music-related applications
- V2 currently lacks support for compressed GLB files (Draco/Meshopt), requiring uncompressed files

### Hosting & Deployment
- V2 can be self-hosted, unlike V1 which was closed-source
- The team is considering a service model similar to "Minecraft realms" for easy deployment
- A community member is already building a hosting service for V2
- Basic V2 worlds can run with just 1GB RAM according to Ashxn
- Some users are setting up worlds with hourly backups and auto-updates

### 3D Design & Optimization
- Meshy was highlighted as an effective tool for generating 3D models from prompts
- Recommended Blender add-ons: ZenUV, UVPackMaster, and Quad Remesher
- Documentation efforts for optimization techniques are underway
- Discussion about potential MML avatar support to enable importing NFT avatars

### Token Ecosystem
- HYPER token experiencing price volatility since launch
- Community discussing potential token utilities including governance, staking, and world integration
- Approximately 53% of tokens are currently not in circulation (30% DAO treasury, 15% founder tokens vested over 3 years, 8% unclaimed)
- 100,000 HYPER tokens makes a user a "hyperflyer"

### Platform Issues
- Firefox browser compatibility issues reported with Hyperfy.io
- Some iOS users experiencing display problems
- V1 support is being phased out ("v1 support days are numbered")

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I update my Hyperfy V2 installation?**  
A: Run "git pull", "npm run build", then "pm2 restart all" (Ashxn)

**Q: Can we NFT gate a metaverse on Hyperfy?**  
A: Yes, plugins for different chains will be available (Ashxn)

**Q: What is the recommended specs for the V2 world server?**  
A: 1GB RAM is fine for basic stuff (Ashxn)

**Q: Do we support MML link for avatars?**  
A: MML avatars use a different rig to VRM, but MML is open source and V2 is open source (hiroP)

**Q: What is the utility of the Hyperfy token?**  
A: It will be used for DAO governance to decide how treasury funds are spent, and potentially for services related to creating worlds (jar0d and Uuuuuuuuu)

**Q: How much Hyperfy token makes you a "hyperflyer"?**  
A: 100,000 HYPER tokens (jar0d)

**Q: What is the circulating market cap of Hyperfy?**  
A: Around 50%+ of tokens are circulating, with 10.9% unclaimed, 30% in DAO, and 15% team vested over 3 years (Saori)

**Q: How many developers are making stuff in Hyperfy?**  
A: The core development team is 2 people, with at least 2 dozen builders/developers and dozens more artists contributing (maximus)

**Q: Does ZenUV work on multiple computers?**  
A: Yes, ZenUV works on multiple machines without issues (hiroP)

**Q: Is it possible to have a world with just dAPPs and charts?**  
A: It's super possible in V1, and friends started working on a NYSE world with live data (Saori)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Assistance
- **Saori** provided a detailed breakdown of state machine pattern and mode transitions in the drone application
- **HPrivakos** explained how to locate drone position in the entities table JSON data
- **MetaMike** added more intuitive control scheme with additional functionality to the drone
- **Valiant** explained efficient use of Meshy, noting users get 4 retries at model generations and texturing

### Implementation Sharing
- **Saori** created code that remembers pane size and position across refreshes
- **HPrivakos** created a hosted world with hourly backups and auto-updates for a community member
- **TheMattEmpire** shared existing documentation resources from Mona ecosystem that could be repurposed for Hyperfy

### Troubleshooting
- **Ashxn** identified missing environment variables in .env file that needed updating
- **Saori** suggested using gltf.report to export uncompressed version of GLB files when Draco compression wasn't working
- **jar0d** suggested using Raydium instead of JUP for better liquidity when a user was experiencing high price impact

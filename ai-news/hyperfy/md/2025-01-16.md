# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### V2 Platform Development
- **Public Development:** Hyperfy V2 is being built in public with rapid iteration, with the code available on GitHub
- **Technical Progress:** Features that took months in V1 are being implemented in days for V2
- **Permissionless Design:** V2 will be permissionless, allowing anyone to host worlds and create shareable apps
- **Current Focus:** The team is prioritizing agent integration and making the platform accessible to non-technical users
- **Hosting Solutions:** Multiple community members are offering hosting services with automated deployment options
- **Documentation:** Scripting API docs were recently added, with more documentation in progress

### Technical Implementations
- **Drone Application:** A physics-based drone with complex controls was implemented using a state machine pattern
- **UI Improvements:** Resizable panes with state persistence were added
- **MIDI Support:** Successful implementation of WebMIDI support for interactive music experiences
- **Solana Integration:** Saori implemented Solana wallet integration in just 30 minutes
- **Asset Optimization:** Discussions about polygon counts, texture sizes, and performance requirements
- **Server Requirements:** 1GB RAM is sufficient for basic worlds, while more complex worlds need 2GB

### Token Ecosystem
- **Price Volatility:** HYPER token experienced significant price volatility since TGE, with a 70% drop from ATH
- **Token Utility:** Will be used for DAO governance to vote on treasury spending
- **Unclaimed Tokens:** 10.9% of tokens remain unclaimed from the airdrop
- **Allocation Structure:** 30% DAO, 15% team (vested 3-year linear)
- **World Holder Airdrops:** 151,200 HYPER per each Hyperfy world NFT

### 3D Design & Optimization
- **Tool Recommendations:** Meshy for AI-generated models, ZenUV and UVPackMaster for UV unwrapping, Quad Remesher for retopology
- **Technical Limitations:** Current lack of Draco compression, Meshopt compression, and KTX texture support
- **Optimization Resources:** Community members sharing documentation and best practices

## Key Questions & Answers

### Platform & Development
- **Q:** How do I update my Hyperfy V2 installation?  
  **A:** git pull, npm run build, pm2 restart all (Ashxn)

- **Q:** Can we NFT gate a metaverse on hyperfy?  
  **A:** Yes, plugins for different chains will be available (Ashxn)

- **Q:** What's the ceiling height in V2?  
  **A:** None (Ashxn)

- **Q:** To run the V2 world smoothly, what are the recommended specs for the server?  
  **A:** The free-build world has 2GB of RAM but 1GB is fine for basic stuff (Ashxn)

- **Q:** When will V2 be released?  
  **A:** Hyperfy V2 code has been open sourced for technical developers; low-code/no-code builders will need to wait longer (jar0d)

- **Q:** Do we support MML link for avatars?  
  **A:** MML avatars use a different rig to VRM, but MML is open source and V2 is open source, suggesting integration is possible (hiroP)

### Token & Economics
- **Q:** What is the utility of the HYPER token?  
  **A:** It will be used for DAO governance to vote on treasury spending, and potentially for services in the platform (jar0d and Saori)

- **Q:** How much HYPER do you need to get the Hyperflyer role?  
  **A:** 100k HYPER tokens (jar0d)

- **Q:** What percentage of tokens are unclaimed from the airdrop?  
  **A:** 10.9% unclaimed, 30% DAO, 15% team vested 3-year linear (Saori)

- **Q:** What allocation did founders get?  
  **A:** They have a 15% allocation vested over 3 years (maximus)

- **Q:** Will V1 have utility with V2, should I buy V1 worlds?  
  **A:** The ETH NFTs will no longer be valid. The V2 platform and token is the future (maximus)

### Technical & Design
- **Q:** Does ZenUV be active on two computers at the same time?  
  **A:** Yes, it works across multiple machines without issues (hiroP)

- **Q:** Do you think a 3D gen in-world app would be useful?  
  **A:** It would be brilliant for broad world building like adding structures and fences, but AI would be too bloated for detailed models (scoe)

- **Q:** How does the MEV sandwich attack work?  
  **A:** They see transactions in the mempool and front-run them (merk and Xeta)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Assistance
- **Ashxn** helped **vincentskele** troubleshoot world loading issues by identifying missing environment variables from .env.example that needed to be added to .env

- **Saori** provided **Ashxn** with a detailed breakdown of state machine pattern implementation for drone controls

- **HPrivakos** explained to **hiroP** how to locate a lost drone entity in the database's JSON data

- **MetaMike** helped **mattimus** successfully implement MIDI support in Hyperfy and offered to share the script

### Hosting & Deployment
- **Lastraum** created a hosted V2 world instance at ckbubbles.hyperfyworlds.xyz for **ckbubbles**

- **HPrivakos** set up another world instance at ckbubbles.hyperfy.host with hourly backups and auto-updates for **ckbubbles**

- **HPrivakos** created a Docker image for running Hyperfy worlds, which was shared by **maximus**

### Asset Optimization
- **Valiant** advised **scoe** on using Meshy efficiently, suggesting to confirm all good models before using retry to maximize value

- **TheMattEmpire** shared comprehensive documentation from Mona ecosystem and personal Gitbook with **maximus** for world optimization documentation

- **Saori** helped **Unchained Ninja** resolve errors loading GLB files with Draco compression by suggesting using gltf.report to export uncompressed version

# Hyperfy Discord - 2026-01-10

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Platform Migration & Architecture
- **Hyperfy v1 to v2 Transition**: Ash clarified that worlds cannot be migrated between versions as v2 uses a completely different engine
- **Platform Architecture**: v1 was tightly integrated with its platform, while v2 offers more freedom and flexibility

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Fly.io Hosting**: Discussion about temporary file systems on Fly.io that get wiped on shutdown, with recommendation to use persistent volumes for data that needs to survive restarts

### Tools & Resources
- **3D Design Tools**: Valiant shared "Quad Filler" tool from SuperHive Market for automating tasks related to filling quads in 3D modeling
- **Documentation**: Link to quickstart guide was shared for new users trying to access the platform

## Key Questions & Answers

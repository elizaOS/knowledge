- **UI Improvements** in the latest dev build with transparency ordering fixes and a more minimalist design
- **Animation System Enhancements** with work on blending and layers to improve avatar animations, particularly for locomotion
- **URL Parameter Functionality** added to enable reading/writing browser parameters

### Development Discussions
- **Elevator Implementation** was a major topic, with solutions for shaking and collision issues involving kinematic rigidbodies and fixedUpdate
- **UI Design Debate** about placement, toggles, and radial menus for better UX across devices
- **Documentation Access Issues** with Comcast/Xfinity routers blocking Netlify-hosted content
- **Network-synced Meteors** implementation was mentioned

### Community & Platform Concepts
- **"Hyperfy Overworld"** concept discussed as a central hub showcasing aesthetic and technical possibilities
- **Community Resource** proposed for world builders to share real-time data about their worlds
- **Free Hyperfy Server Setup** tutorial shared by Roustan for community feedback
- **Token Value Strategies** including buybacks and memetic branding with mascot discussed

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q: Why is the elevator shaking?**  
  **A:** It's due to sync between update cycles; use fixedUpdate instead of update and make the elevator a kinematic rigidbody (Ashxn, hiroP)

- **Q: Can we set fixedUpdate to a specific value to save resources?**  
  **A:** No, it matches the physics rate at 60fps but uses an accumulator to distribute perfectly regardless of render framerate (Ashxn)

- **Q: Where do the wizards come from if they're not hyps?**  
  **A:** They are hyps, but the VRMs aren't embedded in the app to keep it small (Ashxn)

- **Q: Do NPCs use the same resources as real players?**  
  **A:** They're very close to being representative of real players with VRM, nametag, emote switching, and network updates (Ashxn)

- **Q: Will you be adding bone masks with animation blending?**  
  **A:** Yes, but you can already do that by keying only the bones you want and excluding the rest (Ashxn)

### Platform Vision
- **Q: How do you envision the hyperfy overworld?**  
  **A:** Ideally a showcase of what's possible aesthetically and technically, ground zero for hyperfy with the best builds and portals, heavy on onchain metaverse culture and lore (johan)

- **Q: Is the hyperfy overworld concept similar to the v1 home page?**  
  **A:** Yes, like the front page of onchain metaverse culture, similar to what Origin City was, but more dense and better looking (johan)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Problem Solving
- **Elevator Implementation:** Ashxn and hiroP helped Gert-Jan Akerboom with elevator shaking and collision issues by suggesting fixedUpdate with kinematic rigidbody and providing code examples
- **Documentation Access:** hiroP and 0mka helped CheddarQueso access documentation through alternative means (deepwiki.com) when Comcast/Xfinity routers were blocking Netlify-hosted content
- **Server Setup:** Roustan shared a comprehensive tutorial on setting up a free basic Hyperfy Server and requested feedback to improve it before publishing to YouTube

### Concept Development
- **Hyperfy Overworld:** hiroP expanded on johan's concept by proposing a community resource for real-time world data sharing with flexible schema for developers

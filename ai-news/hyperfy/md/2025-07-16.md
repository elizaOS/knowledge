# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Ashxn** announced UI updates featuring a more transparent, minimalist design
- Discussion about sidebar placement and toggle functionality
- **𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓** suggested changing the dot crosshair to an empty circle for less distraction
- **0mka** identified an issue with sidebar UI overlapping with builder prompts on smaller desktop screens

### Technical Development
- **Elevator mechanics** were a major topic, with **Gert-Jan Akerboom** encountering physics issues
  - Solution involved using kinematic rigidbodies with fixedUpdate and setKinematicTarget
  - **Ashxn** and **hiroP** collaborated on troubleshooting
- Network synchronization implemented for meteors, making them explode on impact and fall at random angles
- **Ashxn** mentioned work on animation blending and layers to allow apps to apply animations over locomotion animations
- Discussion about URL parameter functionality for browser integration

### Hyperfy Overworld Concept
- **Johan** described a vision for a "Hyperfy overworld" - a central hub showcasing aesthetic and technical possibilities
- Conceived as "ground zero" for Hyperfy with quality builds and portals to other content
- **HiroP** expanded this to include a community resource for world builders to share real-time data
- The system would create an open data source with flexible schema for developers to store and retrieve metrics

### Server Setup & Documentation
- **𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓** shared a tutorial on setting up a free basic Hyperfy server
- Requested feedback before publishing to YouTube
- **Maximus** offered to provide "tutorial feedback notes"
- Documentation access issues on Xfinity networks were reported, with alternatives provided through DeepWiki and GitHub

### Token Economics & Marketing
- Community members expressed support for token buybacks to demonstrate project commitment
- **Johan** suggested positioning HYPER as a memetic token with a mascot rather than focusing solely on utility
- Market cap comparisons drawn to established platforms like Unity (12.342B) and Roblox
- **MUDBONE** mentioned waiting for product release before resuming marketing efforts

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why is the elevator shaking?** (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom)  
**A:** It's due to sync between update cycles; use fixedUpdate instead of update and make kinematic rigidbody (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Can we set fixedUpdate to a specific value to save resources?** (asked by hiroP)  
**A:** It matches the physics rate at 60fps but uses an accumulator to distribute perfectly regardless of render framerate (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Where do the wizards come from if they're not hyps?** (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom)  
**A:** It's a hyp, but the VRMs aren't embedded in the app to keep size manageable (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Do NPCs use the same resources as a "real" player?** (asked by hiroP)  
**A:** They're very close to being representative of real players with VRM, nametag, emote switching, and network updates (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How do you envision the hyperfy overworld?** (asked by hiroP)  
**A:** Ideally a showcase of what's possible aesthetically and technically, ground zero for hyperfy with the best builds and portals, heavy on onchain metaverse culture and lore (answered by johan)

**Q: What could be done to show dedication to the token?** (asked by MUDBONE)  
**A:** A buy back of the token shows dedication and can be used for emissions for staking (answered by MUDBONE)

**Q: How should Hyperfy position its token?** (asked by johan)  
**A:** Lean more on the memetic with a mascot coin logo and brand token positioning rather than advertising platform benefits as the reason to hold (answered by johan)

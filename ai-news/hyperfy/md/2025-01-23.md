# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-23

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy V2 Development
- **Networked Physics**: Ashxn announced major progress on implementing networked physics for multiplayer interactions, enabling synchronized physics objects across clients.
- **UI Components**: New UI nodes (ui/uiview/uitext) and pointer event handlers have been added to improve interface development.
- **Door Script**: A community member developed a "door.js" script to animate doors in different styles, with Ashxn providing optimization tips to reduce jitter.
- **V2 Infrastructure**: Saori mentioned they're building infrastructure for hosting V2 within two weeks.
- **Cross-Chain Strategy**: The team discussed their approach, noting that while they have a Solana token, their platform works across multiple chains with potential integration with MUD framework and Arweave's AO.

### Game Development
- **Hyperball Game**: A collaborative effort to create a physics-based multiplayer game with king-of-the-hill mechanics where teams keep a ball within their circle to score points.
- **Arena Design**: Multiple users contributed to designing a cyberpunk-themed arena for the Hyperball game.
- **Game Mechanics**: Discussions included teleportation, forcefield pulses, and dynamic changing fields as potential features.

### 3D Design & Tools
- **Hyperfy-Tools**: Howie developed a Blender add-on that creates simple collision boxes and exports multiple objects efficiently.
- **Auto-Export Script**: Ashxn shared a Python script for exporting individual objects with proper centering and custom properties.
- **VRM Avatar Creation**: Extensive discussions about proper rigging approaches for VRM avatars, emphasizing the importance of using VRM-specific armatures rather than Mixamo.

### AI & Agents
- **Hospitality Agents**: Users proposed concepts like chauffeur/tour-guide agents that could interact with users in immersive scenarios.
- **Multi-Agent Workflows**: Suggestions for dynamic camera positioning based on which agent is speaking, similar to interview-style productions.
- **AI Model Discussions**: Conversations about DeepSeek-R1 running locally for creative workflows.

### $HYPER Token
- **Price Volatility**: The token experienced downward pressure, dropping from around 6 cents to the 3-4 cent range.
- **Whale Exits**: Several large holders sold their positions, including one named "erictao.sol" who sold approximately 200k tokens at a loss.
- **Token Recovery**: A user accidentally burned 25k HYPER tokens when closing token accounts, and the community rallied to help recover the tokens through donations.

### Community Resources
- **Documentation Book**: Maximus shared a Hyperfy Community Documentation Book to collect community knowledge.
- **Community Call**: A call was held and recorded, available on YouTube.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: Is it possible to load an arbitrary image from a URL and apply it as a texture yet?  
  **A** (Ashxn): Not yet but it's easy to add when I get through other priorities.

- **Q**: Are all node packages available to access for apps? Can I use lucide react icons?  
  **A** (Saori): No, there's no imports, everything goes through App.js. If you can't get by with fetch, it needs to go through the core.

- **Q**: How do I teleport a player from an app?  
  **A** (Ashxn): Need to add to the player proxy, likely will be something like player.teleport(position, cameraY).

- **Q**: Where does one find the list of available nodes that can be used?  
  **A** (peezy): docs/ref/scripts.md

- **Q**: Can I build on hyperfy v2 now?  
  **A** (MetaMike): Yes.

- **Q**: How can I make a custom asset a collider rather than using decimated versions?  
  **A** (~/HowiEDuhzit): Use the Hyperfy-Tools add-on that generates simple collision boxes for objects.

### Platform & Hosting
- **Q**: Does the OG hosting plan really support 500 CCUs?  
  **A** (HPrivakos): It's set high as a limit, but hasn't been tested beyond about 20 users in a world so far.

- **Q**: Are updates automatic for hosted worlds?  
  **A** (HPrivakos): Yes, updates are automatic.

- **Q**: What is the real market cap of HYPER?  
  **A** (pawpaw_pirate): Around 36-38M fully diluted value, with about 15.8M circulating supply.

### Avatar & 3D Models
- **Q**: What's the best platform to test VRMs?  
  **A** (MetaMike): Hyperfy.

- **Q**: Can the avatars be only a glb or it has to be a VRM?  
  **A** (·≤º): Avatars are VRM, there are simple and humanoid VRM types.

- **Q**: How do I create VRMs that work with Hyperfy?  
  **A** (TheMattEmpire and ·≤º): Use the VRM Armature from VRM-Addon-for-Blender rather than Mixamo, as VRMs require specific bone structures.

- **Q**: Should I compress GLB files exported from Blender?  
  **A** (maximus): Yes, using gltf.report is recommended to test for problems with models.

## Community Help & Collaboration

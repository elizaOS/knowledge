# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-01-23

**Date: January 23, 2025**

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Progress
- **Hyperfy V2 Development**: Significant progress on multiplayer physics with networked rigidbodies, new UI components (ui/uiview/uitext), and pointer event handlers for nodes.
- **Infrastructure Improvements**: Plans to abstract database access and asset endpoints to make world servers stateless and compatible with containerized orchestration systems like Kubernetes.
- **Optimization**: Docker image optimization using node:22-alpine reduced image size from 1.3GB to 387MB, potentially reducing service costs by 10-15%.
- **Hosting Options**: Hyperfy.host announced as a hosting service for v2 worlds starting at $5 USD, accepting various cryptocurrencies as payment.

### Community Projects
- **Hyperball Game**: Community collaboration on a physics-based multiplayer game with teams keeping a ball within their circle to score points, featuring cyberpunk aesthetics.
- **Door Script**: Developers shared a "door.js" script enabling animated doors with sliding or swinging functionality.
- **Blender Tools**: HowieDuhzit developed a Hyperfy Tools Blender addon for creating simple collision boxes and efficiently exporting multiple objects.
- **Documentation**: Maximus shared a Hyper Community Documentation Book to collect community knowledge.

### Technical Discussions
- **Physics Implementation**: Detailed discussions about networked physics with rigidbodies, including collision detection and animation synchronization.
- **VRM Avatars**: Guidance on creating and optimizing VRM avatars, including proper bone structures and conversion from FBX.
- **Authentication**: Tension between web3 authentication and attracting web2 developers who may be resistant to crypto integration.
- **$HYPER Token**: Discussion about price volatility, with the token dropping from around 6 cents to 3-4 cents, and technical aspects of Solana's token account structure.

### AI Integration
- **Agent Concepts**: Ideas for hospitality-focused agents like chauffeurs/tour guides that could simulate real-world interactions.
- **Multi-agent Workflows**: Suggestions for dynamic camera positioning based on which agent is speaking, similar to interview formats.
- **AI Tools**: Mentions of AI tools including Meshy, Hunyuan, and DeepSeek-r1, with discussions about running models locally.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
- **Q**: Is it possible to load an arbitrary image from a URL and apply it as a texture yet?  
  **A**: Not yet but it's easy to add when I get through other priorities (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Are all node packages available to access for apps? Can I use lucide react icons?  
  **A**: No, there's no imports, everything goes through App.js. If you can't get by with fetch, it needs to go through the core (Saori)

- **Q**: What does low code and no code look like for V2?  
  **A**: Anyone will be able to get a world, find apps to place in the world and configure them without needing code/design skills (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do I teleport a player from an app?  
  **A**: Need to add to the player proxy, likely will be something like player.teleport(position, cameraY) (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Can I build on hyperfy v2 now?  
  **A**: Yes (MetaMike)

### Technical
- **Q**: How can I set collider to a glb?  
  **A**: Manage on blender adding collisions to meshes (DevStarlight)

- **Q**: How can I make a custom asset a collider rather than using decimated versions?  
  **A**: HowieDuhzit created a Hyperfy Tools addon that includes simple collision generation functionality (HowieDuhzit)

- **Q**: How do I auto-export individual objects from Blender?  
  **A**: Ashxn provided a Python script that auto-exports each object centered at its origin (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Does the OG plan on hyperfy.host really support 500 CCUs?  
  **A**: The limit is set high but hasn't been tested beyond about 20 users in a world so far (HPrivakos)

### Platform & Tokens
- **Q**: What caused the recent price drop in HYPER token?  
  **A**: Market-wide correction, liquidity being pulled for other tokens like VINE, and some whales exiting positions (devilsadvocate.sol, Uuuuuuuuu)

- **Q**: What is the real market cap of HYPER?  
  **A**: Around 36-38M fully diluted value, with about 15.8M circulating supply (pawpaw_pirate)

- **Q**: How does Solana's token account system work?  
  **A**: Token accounts are created when first receiving tokens and require rent; closing accounts returns rent but burns any remaining tokens (Saori)

- **Q**: If it's in-browser now, can't the site be accessed in VR?  
  **A**: No VR support currently exists for browser or client versions, though it might be possible through custom development (vox)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Assistance
- **HowieDuhzit** created and shared a Hyperfy Tools Blender addon with simple collision and batch export functionality, addressing the community's need for simplified collision generation and batch export.

- **Ashxn** shared a Python script for auto-exporting individual objects with proper centering, which was later integrated into HowieDuhzit's addon.

- **TheMattEmpire** and **᲼** provided guidance to **SotoAlt** on using VRM-specific armatures instead of Mixamo for creating VRM avatars with custom rigs.

- **HypPrivakos** shared a Docker optimization using node:22-alpine that reduced image size from 1.3GB to 387MB, which **DevStarlight** noted could reduce service costs by 10-15%.

### Community Support
- When **friyde** accidentally burned 25k HYPER tokens when closing a token account, community members **devilsadvocate.sol**, **shiny_shiba**, and **peezy** donated HYPER to help him recover his loss.

- **Saori** offered free access to the V1 platform to anyone who provides their ETH address, helping **MUDBONE** and others try out the platform.

- **maximus** directed **Tejas** to GitHub links and commands to set up a local environment for Hyperfy V2 development.

- **Saori** provided admin access to a v1 world for **treed** to test and build, along with documentation links.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-15

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### 3D Graphics & Rendering
- **Lightmap Baking**: MetaRick demonstrated how using a single lightmap across multiple objects can enhance visual quality while maintaining efficiency. Examples showed significant visual improvement in baked vs. non-baked versions.
- **Geometry Nodes & GLTF**: Discussion about limitations of geometry nodes in GLTF exports, with confirmation that functionality could be implemented through regular scripting.
- **2D to 3D Generation**: MetaRick shared information about Tencent Hunyuan's tool that converts 2D images to 3D models, with specific recommendation for the low poly version (https://3d.hunyuan.tencent.com/lowpoly) for game development assets.

### Tokenomics & Economics
- **Current $HYPER Distribution**: Ashxn outlined that approximately 10% consists of unclaimed airdrops (effectively burned), 15% is linearly vested over 3 years, and 30% is allocated to a currently inactive DAO.
- **Proposed Tokenomics Model**: MUDBONE suggested implementing buybacks where the team would use fee revenue to purchase $HYPER and deposit it into a one-sided liquidity pool, with community members staking SOL on the other side.

### Platform Issues
- Brief mention of persistent issues with model deletion, with one user reporting multiple failed attempts.

## Key Questions & Answers

### 3D Development
- **Q**: Can you export geometry nodes to GLTF?  
  **A**: Yes, but there are limitations (answered by b0gie)

- **Q**: Are you using needle-tool-blender?  
  **A**: No, I'm using the Unity version (answered by MetaRick)

- **Q**: What's the advantage of this lightmap approach?  
  **A**: You can set up a scene with multiple models using different textures, then bake them to use the same lightmap texture file (answered by MetaRick)

### Tokenomics
- **Q**: What percentage of tokens are unclaimed airdrops?  
  **A**: Around 10%, essentially burnt (answered by Ashxn)

- **Q**: How much of the token supply is vested?  
  **A**: 15% is linear vested over 3 years (answered by Ashxn)

- **Q**: What percentage is allocated to the DAO?  
  **A**: 30% is allocated to the DAO, which is currently inactive (answered by Ashxn)

- **Q**: Where do swap fees currently go?  
  **A**: Right now, all fees from swap go to the team (answered by MUDBONE)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Lightmap Implementation**: MetaRick shared examples of lightmap baking implementation, providing visual examples showing the difference between baked and non-baked versions.

- **Tokenomics Proposal**: MUDBONE proposed a comprehensive tokenomics model to better align team and user interests, addressing the lack of alignment between token and users.

- **3D Generation Workflow**: MetaRick shared his workflow for creating game-ready 3D assets using ChatGPT to create low poly T-pose reference images that work well with the Tencent Hunyuan generator.

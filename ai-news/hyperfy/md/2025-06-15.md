# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-15

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Progress
- **Hyp-Summer Excitement**: Community members expressed enthusiasm about "Hyp-Summer," described as a period where "everyone is leveling up" with many developers actively working on new features.
- **Lightmap Baking**: Discussions about efficient lightmap techniques in 3D environments using Needle Tools, with examples of applying single lightmaps across multiple objects.
- **HypScript Implementation**: 0mka shared code snippets for toggling block visibility in UI elements, providing practical implementation examples.
- **Blender Integration**: Conversations about Needle Tools compatibility with different Blender versions, with some users reporting performance issues in version 4.4.3.
- **AI-Powered 3D Modeling**: MetaRick shared experiences with Tencent Hunyuan's 2D-to-3D generation tool that offers both high-poly and low-poly options, noting the low-poly generator works best with low-poly reference images.

### Token Economics & Strategy
- **$HYPER Token Model**: MUDBONE proposed a detailed token model involving buybacks where the team would use a portion of earned fees to swap SOL for $HYPER and deposit into a one-sided liquidity pool.
- **Community-Backed LP**: The proposal suggested community members would stake SOL on the other side of the liquidity pool, creating a community-backed LP to increase liquidity and attract larger buyers.
- **Token Distribution**: Ashxn provided context about token distribution, noting that approximately 10% consists of unclaimed airdrops, 15% is linear vested over 3 years, and 30% is currently inactive DAO allocation.

### Community & Content
- **Podcast Collaboration**: A podcast host for "Virtual Destinations" inquired about Hyperfy worlds to visit for their show, with community members offering suggestions and potential collaboration opportunities.
- **World Sharing**: Several users shared links to Hyperfy worlds, particularly v2 worlds, including tattedalien.club, roustan.xyz, play.hyperfy.xyz, and akerboom.fyi.
- **Event Approvals**: VTATV inquired about approval of events in Hyperfy v1, which ash confirmed they had accepted after fixing notification issues.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development
- **Q**: Can geometry nodes be exported to GLTF?  
  **A**: You can export geonodes but there are limits.

- **Q**: How to fix issues with deleting models?  
  **A**: Try selecting all code with ctrl+a, then ctrl+/ or remove code and try deleting again; if still having trouble, it could be network-related.

- **Q**: What is Hyp-Summer?  
  **A**: "It's everyone leveling up" with many community members "cookin."

- **Q**: Are Hyperfy v1 events still being approved and viewed?  
  **A**: Yes, notification issues were fixed and pending events have been accepted.

### Token Economics
- **Q**: What happens to unclaimed airdrops?  
  **A**: Around 10% is unclaimed airdrops, essentially burnt.

- **Q**: How is the $HYPER token vested?  
  **A**: Another 15% is linear vested over 3 years.

- **Q**: What's the status of the DAO allocation?  
  **A**: DAO 30% is also inactive right now.

- **Q**: What could be done with buyback tokens?  
  **A**: They can be used for incentives and initiatives rather than just being a "black hole" or one-sided LP.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-17

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Server Setup & Hosting
- **Fly.io Tutorial**: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 shared a comprehensive tutorial for setting up a free Hyperfy server using Fly.io, covering both local development and public deployment
- **Hosting Options**: Discussion of various hosting solutions with Fly.io being recommended for basic servers (essentially free) and Hertzner mentioned as being used by Play Sandbox
- **Scalability**: 0mka confirmed that Hyperfy servers on Fly.io can be easily scaled up as needed
- Community members are successfully following similar tutorials for related platforms like Decentraland

### Game Development & Physics
- **Elevator Physics**: Detailed discussion about implementing elevator physics with proper collision detection
- **Animation Blending**: Ashxn is working on animation blending and layers to apply animations over locomotion animations
- **Transition Challenges**: Developers noted issues with jarring transitions between running forward and strafing animations
- **UI Elements**: Brief mentions of a new dot crosshair interface and particle portal effects

### 3D Design & Assets
- **Kitbash Models**: Discussion about using Kitbash 3D building kits in Hyperfy, with warnings about optimization challenges
- **Model Optimization**: HiroP advised that Kitbash's "game ready" kits still require significant optimization for Hyperfy due to high poly counts
- **Alternative Resources**: Suggestions to use low-poly models from Fab or Artstation, or create custom low-poly versions with projected textures
- **Architectural Models**: Recommendation to check Untitled's MOCA builds (CC0-licensed) for quality architectural models

## Key Questions & Answers

### Server & Hosting
- **Q**: How to set up a FREE basic Hyperfy Server?  
  **A**: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓's tutorial covers Visual Studio setup and Fly.io deployment

- **Q**: Is this tutorial for local or public servers?  
  **A**: Both - it allows creating and maintaining worlds locally, then deploying to an online server through Fly.io

- **Q**: What are good/cheap servers to use?  
  **A**: Fly.io is basically free for simple servers, Play Sandbox uses Hertzner, and docs.hyperfy.xyz/hosting/self/ lists additional options

### Development
- **Q**: How do I fix elevator collision issues?  
  **A**: Use setKinematicTarget inside fixedUpdate ticks with the rigidbody in world space for smooth movement

- **Q**: Will you be adding bone masks with animation blending?  
  **A**: Yes, but you can already achieve this by keying only specific bones and excluding others

- **Q**: How do I get screen width/height in a Hyp app for screen space UI?  
  **A**: This feature is planned via world.viewportWidth, but most UI needs can be handled using pivot, offset and position

### 3D Design
- **Q**: Is buying the Kitbash Neo Tokyo 3D building Kit worthwhile for Hyperfy city building as a non-professional designer?  
  **A**: Kitbash models will require significant optimization work due to high poly counts and textures, making them challenging for non-professionals to implement effectively in Hyperfy

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Solutions
- **Elevator Physics**: Ashxn helped Gert-Jan Akerboom solve elevator collision issues by recommending setKinematicTarget inside fixedUpdate ticks
- **Server Setup**: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 created and shared a detailed tutorial for setting up Hyperfy servers with Fly.io, incorporating feedback from maximus
- **3D Model Advice**: HiroP provided detailed guidance to Fibelius about Kitbash models, optimization challenges, and alternative resources

### Resource Sharing
- Maximus shared hosting recommendations and documentation links
- HiroP suggested checking Untitled's MOCA builds for CC0-licensed architectural models
- 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 updated their tutorial with additional tips based on community feedback

## Action Items

### Technical
- Test the Hyperfy server setup tutorial with Visual Studio + Fly.io (mentioned by maximus)
- Implement animation blending and layers for locomotion animations (mentioned by Ashxn)
- Find better base locomotion animations where primarily legs move while body stays relatively idle (mentioned by Ashxn)
- Check out Kitbash's new "game ready" kits with fewer draw calls and optimized meshes/textures (mentioned by hiroP)
- Look for low-poly 3D models on Fab or Artstation as alternatives to high-poly Kitbash models (mentioned by hiroP)
- Project Kitbash textures onto custom low-poly versions for better optimization (mentioned by hiroP)
- Learn about client-side/server-side implementation (mentioned by Gert-Jan Akerboom)
- Update tokenomics structure (mentioned by Xukonth)

### Documentation

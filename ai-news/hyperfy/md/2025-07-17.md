# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-17

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Server Setup & Hosting
- 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 shared a comprehensive tutorial for setting up a free Hyperfy server using Fly.io and Visual Studio, requesting feedback before publishing on YouTube and X
- The tutorial covers both local and public server setup through Fly.io, requiring minimal terminal commands
- Multiple hosting options were discussed, with Fly.io emerging as a popular free option for basic servers
- Hertzner (used by Play Sandbox world) was mentioned as an alternative hosting provider
- Fly.io allows for easy server upgrades as projects scale, making it suitable for personal projects

### Technical Development
- **Elevator Physics Implementation**: Significant discussion about implementing elevator physics with proper collision detection
- **Animation Systems**: Work is progressing on animation blending and layers to allow applications to overlay animations on top of locomotion animations
- **UI Elements**: Brief debate about crosshair design, with some preferring a small dot for accuracy while others suggested an empty circle
- **3D Assets**: Discussion about Kitbash 3D building kits and their compatibility with Hyperfy, noting optimization challenges

### Project Status
- References to tokenomics updates being needed
- Community members expressing continued support while waiting for product development to complete
- Mentions of v1 and v2 worlds, with questions about compatibility and availability

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I fix an elevator with kinematic collision where players can't enter or fall through?**  
A: Make sure the rigidbody is in world space and use setKinematicTarget inside fixedUpdate ticks for smooth movement. (Ashxn)

**Q: Will you be adding bone masks with animation blending?**  
A: Yes, but you can already do that by just keying the bones you want and excluding the rest. (Ashxn)

**Q: How to get screen width/height in hyp app for screen space UI?**  
A: You shouldn't need it - using pivot, offset and position you should be able to do almost everything. (Ashxn)

**Q: How to set up a FREE basic Hyperfy Server?**  
A: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 provided a detailed guide for setting up using Fly.io and Visual Studio

**Q: Is this just a local server or a public one?**  
A: The instructions cover both local and public server setup (maximus, 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)

**Q: What are good/cheap servers to use for Hyperfy?**  
A: Fly.io (free for simplest server), Hertzner, and others listed in Hyperfy docs (maximus)

**Q: Are Kitbash 3D building kits suitable for Hyperfy?**  
A: They're optimized for Unreal Engine with Nanite technology and would require significant optimization work. Consider low-poly alternatives from Fab or Artstation, or manually create low-poly versions with projected textures. (hiroP)

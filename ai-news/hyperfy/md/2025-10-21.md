# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-21

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Hyperfy Platform & Token
- **Current vs. Future State**: Ash clarified that while Hyperfy is currently speculative in nature, the long-term vision is to establish it as a functional virtual currency within digital worlds
- **Planned Functionality**: The token is intended to enable features like unlocks, rewards, events, and avatars while creating financial incentives for a creator ecosystem

### 3D Modeling Tools & Resources
- **Topology Solutions**: Several tools were shared to address topology issues, particularly for AI-generated 3D models
- **Tool Discounts**: RetopoFlow for Blender was highlighted with a significant one-day discount (77% off)
- **New Platforms**: Tencent's Hunyuan 3D model platform was shared as a source for quality low-poly models with good topology
- **Emerging Technology**: Tractive.ai was mentioned as an upcoming tool worth joining the waitlist for

### Miscellaneous
- Brief non-technical conversation in the developers channel mentioned "dragon maze" and "bloomers.tv" with some GIFs from the movie Labyrinth

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Is Hyperfy an alpha of a future virtual world which simply needs tokens to mark the ownership of its assets, or is it a coin for speculation with some virtual world as a side-kick?  
   **A**: "Right now it's basically speculative but the long term goal is a virtual currency in worlds, e.g., unlocks, rewards, events, avatars etc. with financial incentives for a creator ecosystem." (Ash)

2. **Q**: Are AI-generated 3D models good at topology?  
   **A**: No, they're "still really bad at topology" (hiroP)

3. **Q**: Does the Tencent Hunyuan platform produce models with usable topology?  
   **A**: Yes, as demonstrated by screenshots shared by .hyp shaman

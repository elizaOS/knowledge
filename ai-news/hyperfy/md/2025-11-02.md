# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-02

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Particle System Development**: 3rdEyeVisuals is working on an advanced "Miniverse" particle system capable of handling 20,000 particles while maintaining 160fps, even with an 8K EXR skybox loaded. The system is production-ready but still being refined for non 1:1 ratio shapes.
- **UI Modifications**: 3rdEyeVisuals shared their experience modifying source code to enhance sidebar functionality, adding upload capabilities for .js files and .hyp bundles, along with deletion functionality.
- **Media Player Development**: Brief mentions of a framed video player implementation and potential future development of an IP TV system with channel browsing capabilities.

### Community & Project Direction
- **Educational Worlds**: Discussion about creating a list of V2 worlds suitable for educational purposes, with Gert-Jan Akerboom sharing a Discord channel link for reference.
- **Project Continuation Debate**: In the HYPER channel, community members discussed what to do with an allocation after someone named Saori apparently left the project. Opinions were divided between "burning" tokens and continuing to build on the platform.
- **Motivational Concepts**: Dhin introduced the Japanese concept of "kuyashii" - using the energy from wanting to prove critics wrong as motivation to build.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-12

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Game Development
- **Tile Dash Game**: Lastraum successfully ported a game from Decentraland to Hyperfy, featuring 50 levels with increasing difficulty where players collect yellow tiles while avoiding obstacles. The game includes multiplayer functionality.
- **Conway's Game of Life**: MetaMike shared experiments with implementing Conway's Game of Life, noting that color updates were more efficient than height updates for rendering.

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Server Management**: Discussion about using Coolify for hosting multiple Hyperfy worlds on a single server, with warnings about storage usage limits.
- **Local Development**: Detailed procedures for properly updating Hyperfy locally were shared, including a 5-step process to avoid errors.
- **WSL Setup**: Tips for accessing WSL folders when using different usernames were provided.
- **Audio Streams**: Marcel shared a project that generates audio streams from repository updates, including Hyperfy, which was well-received as an innovative way to track development changes.

### Unified Control System
- **Cross-Platform Controls**: Ash outlined Hyperfy's vision for consistent controls across desktop, mobile, and VR:
  - Common wheel menu accessible via right-click (desktop), long press (mobile), or trigger press (VR)
  - Standardized movement controls: WASD/mouse (desktop), joystick/swipe (mobile), and stick/head movement (VR)
- **VR Improvements**: Roustan noted better avatar leg animations in VR, and Vox mentioned the immersive experience of seeing desktop users' head movements in VR.

### Platform Concerns
- **GitHub Changes**: Users expressed concern about GitHub potentially losing independence as it's being integrated into Microsoft's AI Tooling division following the CEO's departure.
- **Mobile/VR Building**: Enryt raised an issue about building in Hyperfy worlds from Android devices and Quest headsets due to missing keyboard tab buttons.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I rotate primitive shapes in Hyperfy?**  
A: Rotation is in radians, but for degrees you would use `rotation: [0, 45 * DEG2RAD, 0]` (degrees to radians) (answered by ash)

**Q: How can I set up multiple worlds like the real Hyperfy site when self-hosting?**  
A: Use one server with Coolify on it! Coolify can manage multiple worlds (answered by ash)

**Q: How do I find my-world folders when using WSL with a different username?**  
A: \\\\wsl$ is typically a shortcut to your WSL folder (answered by Shiffty)

**Q: How do I rename an app?**  
A: In metadata, the little tag icon (answered by ash)

**Q: Is there a better way to update Hyperfy locally to avoid errors?**  
A: Follow a 5-step process: 1) commit/stash changes, 2) git pull --rebase, 3) npm install, 4) check Migrations.md, 5) npm run dev (answered by ash)

**Q: Do you know a way to build inside an HF world from Android/Quest headsets? Since the tab keyboard button is missing...**  
A: This is part of the unified controls being developed, which will standardize interactions across devices (answered by ash)

**Q: How feasible is unified control across different platforms with different inputs?**  
A: Ash outlined specific implementations showing it's 80-90% achievable through consistent menu systems and standardized controls

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-12

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Game Development
- **Tile Dash Game Project**: Ash offered a $500 bounty for creating "Tile Dash" in Hyperfy v2, with additional compensation for multiplayer functionality. Lastraum (original creator) expressed interest in building it for both Hyperfy and Forge platforms.
- **Game Mechanics**: The game will feature 50 levels of increasing difficulty where players collect yellow tiles while avoiding obstacles, with a safe zone in the corner and leaderboard tracking.
- **Conway's Game of Life**: Brief discussion about implementing this cellular automaton simulation in a demo world.

### Technical Development
- **Rotation in Hyperfy**: Discussion clarified that Hyperfy uses radians rather than degrees for rotation, with recommendation to use DEG2RAD for conversion.
- **Self-hosting**: Exchange about using Coolify to manage multiple Hyperfy worlds on a single server, with warnings about storage management.
- **Cross-platform Controls**: Ash described plans for a "unified controls" system to standardize interactions across mobile, desktop, and VR platforms, using long-click actions for object manipulation.

### 3D Design
- Brief mention of UV mapping techniques in Blender, including a reference to a tutorial about flattening UVs without requiring addons.

### Cryptocurrency
- Brief observation that "alt season simmer is turning into a boil," suggesting increased activity in alternative cryptocurrencies.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: How can I rotate prim planes in Hyperfy?  
   **A**: Rotation is in radians, use `rotation: [0, 45 * DEG2RAD, 0]` to convert from degrees.

2. **Q**: How can I set up multiple worlds like the real Hyperfy site when self-hosting?  
   **A**: Use one server with Coolify on it, as Coolify can manage multiple worlds.

3. **Q**: How do I find my-world folders when using WSL with a different username?  
   **A**: Use \\\\wsl$ as a shortcut to access your WSL folder.

4. **Q**: Do you know a way to build inside an HF world from Android (smartphones / Quest headsets)? Since the tab keyboard button is missing...  
   **A**: That's part of the planned unified controls system. The goal is to unify interactions across devices, e.g., long clicking on an object will bring up an action menu with options to move/duplicate/delete.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### 3D Avatar & Asset Creation
- **AI-Generated Avatars**: Ashxn demonstrated a 15-minute workflow using TripoSG to generate 3D models from 2D images, then optimizing in Blender with plugins like VRM addon and AutoRigPro
- **Tree Optimization**: Detailed discussions about using eztree.dev for tree creation and optimizing with WebP textures, reducing file size by up to 80%
- **Performance Management**: Significant focus on balancing visual quality with performance across platforms (mobile to VR)

### Development & Technical Features
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Omka shared progress on a UI overhaul reorganizing the code editor interface with split views and tabbed components
- **Particle Effects**: Gert-Jan Akerboom showcased a rocket launcher with particle effects, receiving feedback on using `rateOverDistance` for better distribution
- **App Scaling**: Discussions about implementing position/rotation/scale inputs with ability to reset to default values
- **App Architecture**: Concerns raised about apps spawning other apps and potential permission systems needed

### Environment Building
- **Forest Generation**: Scripts shared for efficiently distributing hundreds of trees with wind animation effects
- **LOD Implementation**: Detailed discussion about Level of Detail calculations for scattered objects
- **Performance Testing**: New app toggling feature added to assess performance impact of individual elements

### Wallet & Blockchain Integration
- **Avatar Customization**: Plans for wallet integration (ETH/Solana) to customize avatars based on blockchain holdings
- **Cross-World Functionality**: Interest in launching objects between different Hyperfy worlds

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What is the process for creating 3D avatars from 2D images?**  
A: Use TripoSG to generate the 3D model, then optimize in Blender using remesher, add an armature with VRM addon, and rig with AutoRigPro (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How can I make particles distribute evenly when moving?**  
A: Use rateOverDistance=5 which means every meter the emitter moves it will distribute 5 particles evenly over that meter (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How can I capture scroll wheel input in a hyp?**  
A: Use control.scrollDelta.capture = true to take over the scroll wheel, but only capture it when needed (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How can you create optimized trees for Hyperfy?**  
A: Use eztree.dev to create trees and download the GLB, then process through glb.babylonpress.org before using in Hyperfy (answered by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)

**Q: Why doesn't Hyperfy use CSS for UI?**  
A: CSS doesn't work in VR; Hyperfy uses a CSS-like system where each rule is written to a canvas, allowing UI to work in VR as a transparent screen projection (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Can an app load another app from IPFS?**  
A: Currently not supported directly through world.load as it only handles models and avatars; would need a separate world.loadApp implementation with permission controls (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How can you create a forest with many trees efficiently?**  
A: Use cloning and scripting to distribute trees with randomized positions, rotations, and scales (answered by Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Avatar Creation**: Ashxn created, optimized and rigged a 3D model for peezy in 15 minutes, demonstrating the workflow and sharing results
- **Particle Effects**: Ashxn helped Gert-Jan Akerboom improve particle effects for a rocket launcher by suggesting the rateOverDistance parameter
- **Tree Optimization**: 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 explained to devilsadvocate.sol how to use eztree.dev and optimize with WebP textures
- **Object Distribution**: Shiffty shared a script for distributing objects on terrain using raycasting and tags
- **Forest Generation**: Ashxn shared code snippet for cloning and distributing 800 trees with proper wind animation
- **PRNG Implementation**: Ashxn shared optimized pseudorandom number generator implementations with 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎
- **Custom Camera**: Omka pointed 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 to an existing implementation for a custom first-person camera controller

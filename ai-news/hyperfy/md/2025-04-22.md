# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-22

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Performance Optimization**: Vox shared improvements to gold element plane textures by changing them from mesh to non-mesh textures, reducing geometry in their project.
- **UV Scrolling Implementation**: Voxvienne successfully implemented UV scrolling and shared code with the community.
- **Shadow Control**: Ashxn explained two methods for controlling shadows: using Blender custom properties (castShadow=false, receiveShadow=false) or script commands (mesh.castShadow = false, mesh.receiveShadow = false).
- **Mesh Handling**: Ashxn clarified that single meshes with multiple materials are split into separate meshes per material during Blender export, which is standard across game engines.
- **Joint.js Development**: Discussion about using Joint.js for creating dynamic doors, with notes that the base exists but needs updating and joints require networking to maintain synchronization.
- **Troubleshooting**: A freezing issue in "doges world" was resolved by fixing a problematic Spear object.

### Platform Evolution
- **V1 to V2 Transition**: Voxvienne shared detailed reflections on the shift from Hyperfy V1 (described as a non-coder's sandbox) to V2 (more code-focused, requiring new skills including AI integration).
- **Upcoming Release**: Ashxn indicated a release to the production main branch would happen "tonight or tomorrow."
- **Performance Testing**: MetaRick identified a device-specific performance issue on iPhone 16 Pro where frame rates drop from 60fps to around 48fps in a world with optimized GLB files and colliders.

### Community Creations
- **New Worlds & Apps**: Community members shared links to Hyperfy experiences (play.hyperfy.xyz, fallen.hyperfy.xyz, tattedalien.club).
- **Marketplace Integration**: Discussion about sharing apps on the Hyperworld marketplace, with szjanko and mattimus explaining how to create shareable links to storefronts and collections.
- **Recent Highlights**: Maximus announced recent community achievements including Vox's first app with multi-video streaming, Metarick's emission effects, Dr.Doge's particle effects, and previews of Omka's tutorial levels and Valiant's raptor racing apps.

### Token & Governance
- **Team Allocation Transparency**: A discussion about the HYPER token team allocation revealed it's split as 9%, 4%, 1%, 1% among four people, vesting over 3 years.
- **Grant Transfer**: Saori transferred 2 million tokens from his personal vesting allocation to peezy as a retroactive grant for contributions.
- **Market Activity**: Mentions of significant HYPER token volume increases and price movements.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do we control shadows for specific meshes?**  
A: Either add custom properties in Blender (castShadow=false, receiveShadow=false) or do it via script (mesh.castShadow = false, mesh.receiveShadow = false) (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How do I begin using Joint.js to make dynamic doors?**  
A: The base is there but out of date, and joints need to be networked in the app to keep them in sync (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Any estimated date for the next launch in the production main branch?**  
A: Going to make one tonight or tomorrow (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: How can I address specific materials for UV scrolling instead of separated meshes to avoid drawcalls?**  
A: Merging/joining in Blender is only useful for performance if they all use one material (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Can i play hyperfy game online?**  
A: Hyperfy is more an engine/platform that powers experiences. Top of mind there are 3 worlds you can go to "play" with the engine: 1. play.hyperfy.xyz 2. fallen.hyperfy.xyz 3. tattedalien.club (answered by maximus)

**Q: How can I share my apps from Hyperworld marketplace?**  
A: You can share this link https://hyperworld.host/marketplace/store/[your-id] it shows your public apps as a "Storefront" (answered by szjanko)

**Q: What is the team allocation for Hyperlane?**  
A: 15% of tokens vesting over 3 years, split 9%, 4%, 1%, 1% among four people (answered by Saori)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Freezing Issue Resolution**  
   Helper: ~/HowiEDuhzit | Helpee: Ashxn  
   Context: Game freezing on load in "doges world" but unfreezing when changing tabs  
   Resolution: Issue identified and fixed - related to the Spear object

2. **Mesh Optimization Guidance**  
   Helper: Ashxn | Helpee: 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎  
   Context: Questions about mesh optimization and material handling for UV scrolling  
   Resolution: Explained that Blender exports split meshes by material, and joining only helps performance if using one material

3. **Marketplace Sharing Solutions**  
   Helper: szjanko | Helpee: Gert-Jan Akerboom  
   Context: Needed a shareable link to apps on Hyperworld  
   Resolution: Provided specific storefront link and explained options for sharing apps publicly or privately

4. **Platform Explanation**  
   Helper: maximus | Helpee: Saber  
   Context: Asked if they could play Hyperfy game online  
   Resolution: Explained Hyperfy is an engine/platform and provided three specific world links to experience it

5. **Performance Testing Collaboration**  
   Helper: ash | Helpee: MetaRick  
   Context: Performance drops on iPhone 16 Pro with GLB files  
   Resolution: ash tested the world and helped identify it was likely device-specific by not experiencing the same issues

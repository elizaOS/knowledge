# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-22

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Freezing Issue Resolution**: A critical bug in "doges world" was identified and fixed, where the game would freeze upon loading but could be unfrozen by switching tabs. The problem was traced to a "Spear" object. (~/HowiEDuhzit)
- **UV Scrolling Implementation**: Several developers discussed UV scrolling techniques, with voxvienne successfully implementing it and sharing code.
- **Shadow Control Methods**: Two approaches were outlined for controlling shadow casting: via Blender custom properties (castShadow=false, receiveShadow=false) or through script commands (mesh.castShadow = false, mesh.receiveShadow = false). (Ashxn)
- **Mesh Handling Clarification**: Important information was shared about how single meshes with multiple materials in Blender are automatically split into separate meshes per material in game engines. (Ashxn)
- **Joint.js Implementation**: Discussion about using Joint.js for dynamic doors, noting that joints need to be networked in the app to keep them in sync. (Ashxn)
- **Lever Mechanics**: Technical exchange about implementing lever mechanics using node position, rotation, and quaternion manipulation. (DevStarlight | Numinia)

### Platform Evolution
- **V1 to V2 Transition**: Detailed reflections were shared on the shift from Hyperfy V1 to V2. V1 was described as a non-coder's sandbox that was accessible and versatile, while V2 appears to be more code-focused, requiring new skills including AI integration. (voxvienne)
- **Production Branch Update**: Announcement that a new update to the production main branch would be launched "tonight or tomorrow." (Ashxn)
- **Hyperfy Worlds Showcase**: Community members shared links to Hyperfy experiences (play.hyperfy.xyz, fallen.hyperfy.xyz, tattedalien.club) demonstrating the platform's capabilities. (maximus)

### Community & Marketplace
- **App Sharing Solutions**: Discussion about sharing apps on the Hyperworld marketplace, with specific solutions provided for creating shareable links to collections and storefronts. (szjanko, mattimus)
- **Community Builds**: Several members shared their Hyperfy creations, showing enthusiasm for the platform's potential as a "world engine."

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do we make render ignore shadows from specific meshes?**  
A: Either add custom properties in Blender (castShadow=false, receiveShadow=false) or do it via script (mesh.castShadow = false, mesh.receiveShadow = false). (Ashxn)

**Q: How do we begin using Joint.js to make dynamic doors?**  
A: The base functionality exists but is out of date, and joints need to be networked in the app to keep them in sync. (Ashxn)

**Q: Any estimated date for the next launch in the production main branch?**  
A: Going to make one tonight or tomorrow. (Ashxn)

**Q: Can I play hyperfy game online?**  
A: Hyperfy is more an engine/platform that powers experiences. You can visit: 1. play.hyperfy.xyz 2. fallen.hyperfy.xyz 3. tattedalien.club (maximus)

**Q: How can I share a link to my apps page for a tweet?**  
A: You can share this link: https://hyperworld.host/marketplace/store/67e645c9160d09602dd9dab6 - it shows your public apps as a "Storefront". (szjanko)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Mesh Handling Explanation**:  
   Ashxn helped voxvienne understand how Blender exports handle meshes with multiple materials, explaining that merging only helps performance if using one material.

2. **Shadow Control Methods**:  
   Ashxn provided voxvienne with two detailed methods for controlling shadows for specific meshes.

3. **Freezing Issue Diagnosis**:  
   ~/HowiEDuhzit helped Ashxn identify and fix the freezing issue in "doges world" related to the Spear object.

4. **App Sharing Solutions**:  
   szjanko and mattimus helped Gert-Jan Akerboom find ways to share apps from the Hyperworld site, providing specific storefront links and explaining options for customizing public/private apps.

5. **Hyperfy Experience Guidance**:  
   maximus helped Saber understand Hyperfy's nature as an engine/platform rather than a standalone game, providing specific world links to experience it.

## Action Items

### Technical
- Fix the freezing issue in "doges world" related to the Spear object (~/HowiEDuhzit)
- Launch update to production main branch (Ashxn)
- Fix external model loading on server (`world.load('model', 'https://some_external_url.glb')`) (peezy)
- Explore implementation of lever mechanics using node position, rotation & quaternion (DevStarlight | Numinia)
- Develop better integration between 3D visual design and code functionality (voxvienne)

### Feature
- Add a "pin all" button in the apps panel (MetaRick)
- Add in-world connection refresh capability for fullscreen mode on iPad/SteamDeck (MetaRick)
- Add a "live" toggle to the hierarchy tab to show dynamically added elements (peezy)
- Add ability to toggle objects between local and synced states (MetaRick)
- Consider maintaining accessibility for non-coders in V2 while embracing new code-focused approach (voxvienne)

### Documentation
- Create guides for transitioning from V1 to V2 skillsets (voxvienne)

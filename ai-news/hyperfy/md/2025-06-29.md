# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-29

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Issues
- **WebSocket Connection Problems**: Several users reported inability to join a virtual world due to WebSocket connection errors. The root cause appears to be incorrect protocol configuration (using "https://" instead of "wss://") for WebSocket connections.
- **Environment Variable Inconsistencies**: While the .env file showed correct "wss://" protocol for PUBLIC_WS_URL, the application was somehow using incorrect values from elsewhere.
- **Browser Compatibility**: The issue manifests inconsistently across devices/browsers, with some allowing the incorrect protocol while others strictly follow WebSocket specifications.
- **Resource Loading Failures**: Users reported persistent resource loading failures even after preloading.

### Upcoming Releases
- A new release is expected "in the next couple of days" according to Ashxn.
- 0mka suggested that the release documentation should mention dependency on elizaOS.

### LiveKit Implementation
- 0mka mentioned potential changes needed to how LiveKit works in the core rather than via HYP.

### Tools & Utilities
- ShareX software was recommended (with link to getsharex.com) for screen capture/sharing.

   - **Helper**: ash
   - **Helpee**: Coinexpert
   - **Context**: WebSocket connection errors with incorrect protocol

2. **Server Configuration Review**:
   - **Helper**: maximus
   - **Helpee**: Coinexpert

## Action Items

### Technical
- **Identify env variable override source**: Determine where environment variables are being overridden with incorrect WebSocket URL protocol (mentioned by ash)
- **Test with standard server**: Test with unmodified standard server to isolate issue source (mentioned by ash)
- **Investigate resource loading failures**: Look into resource loading failures that persist after preloading (mentioned by Coinexpert)
- **Modify LiveKit implementation**: Make changes to how LiveKit works in core rather than via HYP (mentioned by 0mka)

### Documentation
- **Update release notes**: Ensure upcoming release documentation notes elizaOS dependency (mentioned by 0mka)

### Feature Requests
- **MIC.hyp functionality**: A user asked about potential "MIC.hyp" feature that would allow voice to be heard by everyone on a map (requested by Coinexpert, no response yet)

- **Authentication Systems**: Discussion about potential integration with MCP
- **UI Improvements**: Proposals for a unified menu system similar to GTA's interaction menu

### 3D Design & Assets
- Discussion about texture memory usage and optimization techniques
- Conversation about AI-generated building facades with color matching to skyboxes
- Sharing of animation libraries like Quaternius' Universal Animation Library
- Various examples of 3D work including water effects and building facades

### Community & Events
- Announcements about Culture Chain TV Episode 4 event (March 21, 2025)
- Music Talent Trail event in Decentraland Metaverse being broadcast live on VTATV
- Discussion about web3 gaming guilds and potential collaborations
- Mention of other projects like NeoTokyo and Dungeons Game (which raised 130 million in a day)

### Reported Issues
- Potential freezing issue with "itemsUI" component reported by a user
- Agent12 reported being unable to move after spawning in "Play.World" environment

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does anybody have a good example of a hyp script that directly transforms VRM bones or armatures?**  
A: Apps are for building objects for worlds, without modifying the core you can only do things like apply animations to players etc (answered by ash)

**Q: Is there a way to find up-to-date code examples for Hyperfy development?**  
A: Search specific Discord channels for apps that do things close to what you want and feed those scripts into your RAG agent (answered by peezy)

**Q: Should I be using .active = false or .visible = false to hide templates I want to clone?**  
A: .visible is deprecated because it only worked on some things. active works on everything, it essentially unmounts and disables (answered by ash)

**Q: Is first person mode in v2 not working right now?**  
A: It absolutely does work. It can be set up for the player or on an app. (answered by ~/drdoge.eth)

**Q: Is Hyperfy an engine or a platform that hosts worlds and handles multiplayer features?**  
A: From what I'm understanding; time will tell (answered by bear)

**Q: How do I create a world so I can create my own stuff?**  
A: Resources available at hyperfy.how and installation quick link on main page with Episode 1 of videos. (answered by smickelbeard and 0mka)

**Q: Does 24Mb sound like a lot for texture memory? It only has 3 textures on the asset.**  
A: That sounds about right. It doesn't matter if you png crush your texture etc they all get decompressed and uploaded to the GPU in a raw format. (answered by ash)

**Q: What's a web3 gaming guild?**  
A: It's both a group of web3 game developers and players, as well as investors in crypto gaming. (answered by peezy and rando1337)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Template Management in Hyperfy Apps**  
   Helper: ash | Helpee: Cybernetic-O-Cult  
   Context: ash provided code example showing how to remove templates from the app and clone them when needed instead of using .active property

2. **Finding Code Examples for Development**  
   Helper: peezy | Helpee: Mugenomics  
   Context: peezy suggested searching specific Discord channel for similar apps and feeding those scripts into RAG agents

3. **First Person Mode Functionality**  
   Helper: ~/drdoge.eth | Helpee: Gooey  
   Context: Confirmed first person mode works in V2 and can be set up for player or on an app

4. **Hyperfy Discoverability**  
   Helper: ash | Helpee: ToxSam - IBIH  
   Context: ash acknowledged the issue and updated X profile to point to hyperfy.how instead of hyperfy.io

5. **UI Organization for World Settings**  
   Helper: TheMattEmpire | Helpee: ash  
   Context: Provided mockup of icon-based outliner similar to Blender's properties panel

6. **Onboarding New Users**  
   Helper: smickelbeard & 0mka | Helpee: Terry  
   Context: Provided links to hyperfy.how documentation and installation videos for getting started

7. **Texture Memory Usage**  
   Helper: ash | Helpee: TheMattEmpire  
   Context: Explained that 24MB texture memory usage is normal because textures get decompressed to raw format on GPU

8. **Building Facade Technique**  
   Helper: Valiant | Helpee: general hyper  
   Context: Explained that facades were AI-generated and color-matched to skyboxes for immersion

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-21

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### AI-Powered Content Creation
- **Vibe World Feature**: A new AI-powered 3D creation tool allows users to generate objects through text prompts using commands like `/create` and `/edit`
- **AI Models**: Implementation of various models including Sonnet 4, Grok 4, and Qwen 3 Coder through OpenAI, Anthropic, and OpenRouter APIs
- **Performance**: The vibe world reached impressive stats (21 materials, 39 geometries, 84 draw calls, 1M triangles) with 300 AI-generated objects while maintaining performance across devices
- **Technical Challenges**: Occasional crashes when generating complex objects; memory leaks in material cache on primitives were identified and fixed by Ash

### Gaussian Splat Rendering
- **Progress**: mrtzhckr demonstrated significant progress on Gaussian Splat rendering in Hyperfy
- **Performance**: Impressive results with SPZ compression - 50MB files run well on desktop, 5-8MB on Quest
- **Self-Organizing Gaussians**: Discussions about SOGS (Self-Organizing Gaussians) implementation

### Infrastructure & Performance
- **LiveKit Limitations**: Users reported hitting the 1GB monthly bandwidth limit on the free tier
- **Self-Hosting Solutions**: HypPrivakos suggested self-hosting LiveKit on a VPS for $4/month as an alternative
- **Cloud Storage**: DevStarlight from Numinia shared detailed configuration for S3 asset storage and PostgreSQL database setup
- **Performance Testing**: TheMattEmpire is testing instancing limits, noting good performance in localized areas despite time-consuming workflow without multiselect

### Community Concerns
- **Project Roadmap**: Some users expressed frustration about unfulfilled promises, specifically regarding an economic flywheel, interoperable in-game asset marketplace, and agent-ran worlds
- **Development Communication**: Debate about whether these are broken promises or simply delayed developments, with some users suggesting more happens behind the scenes than is visible

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What model does the AI in vibe world use?**  
A: Initially Sonnet 4, later switched to Grok which Ash prefers

**Q: What's performance like on Gaussian splats?**  
A: Performance depends on file size - under 50MB is fine on desktop, 5-8MB limit on Quest

**Q: Does Hyperfy have streaming into spaces yet, or just MP4 support?**  
A: Hyperfy likely supports .m3u8 streams similar to v1, so live streaming from OBS or platforms providing m3u8 should work

**Q: What's a good service to get an m3u8 link?**  
A: bloomers.tv is easy to use and works well for getting m3u8 links

**Q: How much is the current LiveKit plan?**  
A: 1GB a month for free

**Q: Do I just plug a public s3 bucket in there?**  
A: DevStarlight provided complete configuration examples for S3 and PostgreSQL setup with environment variables

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Elevator Creation**: Shiffty helped 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰 with creating an elevator with collider by sharing an example and suggesting checking browser console for errors
- **Vibe World Tutorial**: Ash guided 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰 on using the vibe world feature by providing a link and explaining basic commands
- **OpenRouter Integration**: HowieDuhzit implemented OpenRouter API for AI generation and created a PR for integration
- **LiveKit Self-Hosting**: HypPrivakos helped .hyp shaman overcome LiveKit bandwidth limits by suggesting self-hosting on a VPS with documentation
- **Cloud Storage Setup**: DevStarlight provided cru with detailed configuration examples for S3 storage and PostgreSQL database setup

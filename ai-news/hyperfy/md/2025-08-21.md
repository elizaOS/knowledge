# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-08-21

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Developments
- **Memory Leak Fix**: Ash identified and fixed a memory leak in the "vibe world" related to material cache on prims that was causing browser tab crashes. The fix was deployed and confirmed to work well in VR.
- **Gaussian Splat Rendering**: Mrtzhckr shared progress on implementing Gaussian Splat Rendering in Hyperfy. Performance depends on splat file size with SPZ compression - under 50MB works well on desktop, with a 5-8MB limit for Quest.
- **Vibe World Performance**: Ash provided stats on the vibe world (50 draw calls, 700k triangles, 148 apps, 29 geometries, 21 materials) and mentioned it runs well on mobile and VR.
- **Pointer Lock Improvement**: Ash implemented support for the blockquote/tilde (`) key to toggle pointer lock in dev, addressing issues with fullscreen mode exiting when escaping pointer lock.
- **AI Improvements**: Ash merged AI improvements to the dev branch. The AI in vibe world uses the "sonnet 4" model.

### Vibe Platform (AI-Powered Creation)
- Ash shared a link to vibe.hyperfy.xyz and provided basic instructions for using AI commands like `/create` and `/edit` to build objects in the virtual space.
- The feature was described as being in "super alpha" stage.
- There was a temporary outage with Anthropic's API being overloaded, causing AI functionality to be down briefly.
- MetaMike suggested changing the gen model to "grok" to improve performance.

### 3D Design & Optimization
- TheMattEmpire is testing the limits of instancing (reusing 3D objects) in their project and reports good performance in localized areas.
- Creating instances was reported as time-consuming without multiselect functionality.
- TheMattEmpire is using emission to simulate lighting while maintaining shadows for objects inside buildings by disabling shadows on the roof.
- Their approach involves gradually adding content to determine performance thresholds.

### Streaming Capabilities
- Ash suggested that .m3u8 streams might work in Hyperfy (as they did in v1).
- .hyp shaman confirmed they use bloomers.tv to generate m3u8 links that work well in the platform.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What model does the AI in vibe world use?**  
A: Sonnet 4 (answered by ash)

**Q: What's performance like on the Gaussian splats?**  
A: Performance depends on splat file size - under 50MB works well on desktop, 5-8MB limit for Quest with SPZ compression (answered by mrtzhckr)

**Q: What am I doing wrong with my basic collider with up and down movement?**  
A: Check out the elevator example and check browser console for red block errors (answered by Shiffty)

**Q: Is there a way to fix the fullscreen toggle dilemma when switching mouselock/free mouse?**  
A: Added support for blockquote (`) key to toggle pointer lock in dev (answered by ash)

**Q: Is there a way to force fpv or detect when in fpv/3pv?**  
A: Neither yet (answered by ash)

**Q: Does Hyperfy have streaming into spaces yet, or just MP4 support?**  
A: Hyperfy likely supports .m3u8 streams as it did in v1, so live streaming from OBS or platforms providing m3u8 should work (answered by ash)

**Q: How can I get an m3u8 link for streaming?**  
A: bloomers.tv provides m3u8 links easily and works well (answered by .hyp shaman)

**Q: Want hyper to fly?**  
A: Change the gen model to grok and tag it in every post (answered by MetaMike)

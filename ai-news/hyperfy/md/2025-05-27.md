# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-27

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Updates
- **Hyperfy v2 Release Status**: Ashxn acknowledged the need for a new release, planned for after an upcoming meetup. Some users are running older versions of v2, causing compatibility issues.
- **Fly.io Deployment Issues**: The quick start guide no longer works seamlessly due to changes in the fly.io platform. Community members shared workarounds involving volume creation commands.
- **Agent Implementation Progress**: Screenshots were shared of an agent named Eliza guiding users through portals within a Hyperfy world, developed by users "tcm" and "moon".
- **HypTools Concept**: Ashxn discussed a tool that can pack and unpack .hyp files into editor-friendly formats, allowing developers to leverage git benefits while maintaining build capabilities.
- **Vehicle Mechanics**: Dr.Doge's vehicle summoning prototype and emotionull's work with Phetta vehicles were highlighted. Maximus suggested implementing ghost racing mechanics using world storage and non-colliding vehicles.

### Community Projects & Showcases
- **Alias Platform Testing**: Rick invited users to participate in Alias platform's first closed test, where users can build interactive 3D agents with customizable personas, VRMs, animations, and voice profiles.
- **Integration Projects**: untitled.xyz's integration of compute3ai with Trellis was mentioned as a notable technical achievement.
- **World Builds**: Several community-built worlds were highlighted, including Project89's interactive lore world, Farm2's interactive platform, and a Shopify racing experience.
- **V1 World Sharing**: User "vox" shared previously private V1 worlds as inspiration for worldbuilding, including a contemporary art piece hosted on hyperfy.io/himars.

### Technical Discussions
- **VR Access Solutions**: Discussion about accessing locally-hosted Hyperfy worlds on VR headsets through port forwarding or alternative deployment methods.
- **Backup Options**: Conversation about whether it's possible to back up scenes/worlds from Hyperfy v1, with the consensus being that rebuilding from source is more efficient than salvaging.
- **Mobile Device Optimization**: Questions raised about reducing camera and step sensitivity on mobile devices in v1.

## Key Questions & Answers

1. **Q**: Would it be possible to do a backup of a scene/world in hyperfy v1?  
   **A**: It would be quicker to build instead of salvage especially if you have the source already.

2. **Q**: How can I access my Hyperfy world on my standalone VR-headset via WiFi?  
   **A**: You need port forwarding so that localhost:3000 on your headset goes to your Debian box. Alternatively, you can wire to your Quest and use Meta Quest developer hub for port forwarding, or deploy to a live site.

3. **Q**: Are agents traversing worlds?  
   **A**: Same world, but they can use teleporters.

4. **Q**: Is this using Eliza Hyperfy or an app?  
   **A**: This is what tcm and moon have been developing.

5. **Q**: How do you stop auto-running after exiting chat?  
   **A**: Press shift again after getting out of chat.

6. **Q**: When is GLB animation support coming?  
   **A**: It will come "soon™️".

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Fly.io Deployment Troubleshooting**:
   - Mugenomics shared a workaround using "fly volumes create data --region iad --size 1" and removing/recreating volumes before redeploying
   - 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 shared their experience that initial deployment was seamless but mentioned using ChatGPT to simplify steps when troubleshooting

2. **VR Access Solutions**:
   - Ashxn provided detailed guidance to Enryt about accessing Hyperfy worlds on VR headsets, explaining port forwarding options and alternatives
   - ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/ helped identify that Enryt might be running an older version of v2 and recommended using "latest dev"

3. **UI Development Resources**:
   - drDoge shared ASCII templates for UI messages that can be fed to AI coding assistants to generate UI elements

4. **Bug Workarounds**:
   - ash provided a workaround to Agent12 for the auto-run bug, suggesting to press shift again after exiting chat to stop running

5. **Community Moderation**:
   - fractilians and HypPrivakos collaborated to identify and remove a scammer from the community

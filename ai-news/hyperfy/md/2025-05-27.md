# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-05-27

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Agent Technology Development
- **Agent Navigation Progress**: Developers tcm and moon have created functionality allowing AI agents (like "Eliza") to guide users through teleporters within virtual worlds
- **Deployment Challenges**: Issues with WebSocket URL configuration in Coolify were reported during deployment of agent systems
- **Avatar Requirements**: Discussion about creating 3D models for agent representation in the virtual world

### Hyperfy v1 & v2 Technical Discussions
- **Backup Options**: Conversation about preserving Hyperfy v1 scenes/worlds, with clarification that source files can be saved but implementations are harder to back up
- **Deployment Issues**: Users noted that fly.io deployment processes have changed, requiring manual volume creation steps not reflected in current documentation
- **Mobile Experience**: Questions raised about adjusting camera sensitivity settings on mobile devices in v1
- **External Tools**: Brief exploration of alias.cm and its potential integration with Hyperfy v2

### Community Organization
- **Community Call Planning**: maximus announced he would miss the next community call and sought a guest host to interview Ash
- **Low Activity Channels**: Some channels (like ü™ô‚îÇhyper) appear to have minimal activity

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Would it be possible to do a backup of a scene/world in hyperfy v1?**  
A: It would be quicker to build instead of salvage, especially if you have source files already. (answered by ·≤º~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)

**Q: Is this using Eliza Hyperfy or an app?**  
A: Yeah this is what tcm and moon have been developing. (answered by ·≤º~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)

**Q: How did you get on with this? Saw the repo the other day and bookmarked it for exploration later. Did you get it working?**  
A: Nah I had some other things come up so I didn't get far, was gonna look today or tomorrow and possibly live stream. (answered by Lastraum)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Hyperfy v1 Backup Guidance
- **Helper**: ·≤º~/^b0gie-(.*)$/
- **Helpee**: carlosmu
- **Context**: When asked about backing up Hyperfy v1 scenes/worlds, advised that rebuilding from source files would be more efficient than trying to salvage implementations

### Deployment Troubleshooting
- **Helper**: ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì
- **Helpee**: Mugenomics
- **Context**: Shared experience with fly.io deployment changes and mentioned using ChatGPT to simplify steps from fly.io documentation

### Agent Technology Clarification
- **Helper**: ·≤º~/^b0gie-(.*)$/
- **Helpee**: Ashxn
- **Context**: Clarified that agents were teleporting within the same world rather than traversing between different worlds

## Action Items

### Technical
- **Update fly.io deployment guide**: Current wiki guide doesn't work as fly.io now requires manual volume creation with CLI (Mentioned by Mugenomics)
- **Fix WebSocket URL configuration issue**: The system is not accepting the WebSocket URL in Coolify deployment for unknown reasons (Mentioned by ·≤º~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)
- **Create avatar for agent**: Need to develop 3D model for agent representation in the virtual world (Mentioned by ·≤º~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)

### Documentation
- **Document mobile sensitivity settings**: Create guide for reducing camera and step sensitivity on mobile devices for v1 (Mentioned by carlosmu)

### Feature
- **Consider alias.cm integration**: Explore if alias.cm could be integrated with Hyperfy v2 (Mentioned by fŒûllŒûnz)

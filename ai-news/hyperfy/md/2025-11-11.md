# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### UI Development Progress
- **3rdEyeVisuals** demonstrated significant progress with UI image placement in Hyperfy
- Implemented native z-indexing support for better layering control in UI elements
- Developed UIVideo functionality using THREE.VideoTexture to sync video frames directly from GPU
- The new implementation enables 60FPS video playback in UI panels without performance degradation
- Solution includes Yoga layout for flexbox positioning and custom shaders for rounded corners
- Fixed color issues by converting from sRGB to linear color space for video content

### Engine Capabilities
- **Ash** noted that while UI nodes were designed to be basic, users have created complex implementations
- The engine handles larger UIs well despite their complexity
- Discussion about wall-hanging mechanics for a Total Wipeout style course is ongoing

### Other Activities
- Brief activity in the agents channel with **.hyp shaman** noting they were "getting somewhere"
- Minimal activity in general channel with a question about a potential spammer
- **CheddarQueso 🧀** shared an Andrew Price Twitter/X post in the 3d-design channel

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How does the engine handle complex UI implementations?**  
**A:** Ash confirmed that while UI nodes were designed to be basic, the engine handles larger UIs well even when users create complex implementations.

**Q: What's the status of wall-hanging mechanics for a Total Wipeout style course?**  
**A:** Dhin explained it's a work in progress that needs animations for wall interactions including hitting the wall, jumping up, and hanging.

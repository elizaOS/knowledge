# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### UI Development Advancements
- **Z-indexing Support**: 3rdEyeVisuals implemented native z-indexing for UI elements, enabling better layering control with negative values for background elements and positive values for foreground elements.
- **UIVideo Component**: A new component using THREE.VideoTexture was created to sync video frames directly from GPU, avoiding manual canvas operations and enabling 60FPS video playback without performance degradation.
- **Custom Shaders**: Implementation includes shaders for rounded corners and proper color space conversion from sRGB to linear to prevent washed-out colors.

### Blockchain & Cryptocurrency
- Discussions around HYPER token on the Solana blockchain sparked debate about the role of cryptocurrency in metaverse development.
- Some community members expressed concern about potential shift toward crypto focus rather than metaverse development.
- Arguments were made for using less energy-intensive cryptocurrency solutions for marking ownership of in-world objects in a distributed metaverse.
- Technical merits of Solana as a high-performance blockchain with fast transaction speeds and low costs were highlighted.

### VR Development Issues
- Discrepancy identified between VR and non-VR environments regarding trigger functionality and hyperlinks.
- Modified rocket triggers and "Text (link option).hyp" appear to work in standard environments but not in VR on the dev branch.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does the modified rocket trigger work on the dev branch?**  
A: It doesn't work in VR according to Enryt, but works fine in non-VR environments according to Gert-Jan Akerboom.

**Q: Is there code I can just add to an existing GLB model script that will tell it not to cast shadows?**  
A: Partial answer - 3rdEyeVisuals mentioned there should be a way to tell models to ignore HDR and sun lighting but didn't provide specific code.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **VR Functionality Troubleshooting**  
   Gert-Jan Akerboom and Enryt collaborated to identify that trigger functionality issues were specific to VR environments, helping narrow down the scope of the problem.

2. **Scam Alert**  
   Community member brandonmanus warned others about a potential scam link, helping protect the community from security threats.

3. **Blockchain Education**  
   Mareta provided clarification about Solana's technical capabilities and corrected misconceptions about its relationship with political figures, helping to ground the discussion in technical facts.

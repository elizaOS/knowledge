# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Strategy & Platform Architecture
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Discussions centered on implementing interactions that work consistently across desktop, VR, and mobile platforms, with the "Action" node system recommended over pointer events for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Development Philosophy**: Ashxn defended Hyperfy's "frontloading" approach (investing significant effort early to avoid technical debt) versus "backloading" (building quickly but accumulating technical debt).
- **Server Infrastructure**: Confirmation that multiple worlds (dozens) can be deployed on a single cloud server using Coolify to manage containers, with setup taking 30-60 minutes on a Hetzner server.

### 3D Design & Asset Creation
- **Character Modeling Challenges**: Limitations of AI-based 3D model generation tools (Meshy, Tripo) for character design when high-quality topology is required, with merged fingers being a common issue.
- **Professional vs. Automated Approaches**: Discussion about whether manual retopology would be more efficient than trying to fix automated results from AI tools.

### Tokenomics & Blockchain Integration
- **Token Utility**: Ashxn mentioned they're working on a detailed deck explaining tokenomics and marketplace plans, emphasizing that blockchain is essential for their vision of portable, Turing-complete digital collectibles.
- **Community Concerns**: Users expressed concerns about token value and lack of clear communication about tokenomics, while still expressing belief in the project's potential.

### Technical Updates
- **Portal Functionality Fix**: Update to world portal functionality to fix an issue where portals would transport all players instead of just the local player.
- **Networking Components**: Modifications to Fastify WebSockets and client network components were mentioned.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I implement interactions that work across desktop, VR, and mobile?**  
A: Use the "Action" node which works on all devices including mobile and VR, while pointer/reticle events currently only work on desktop. (Ashxn)

**Q: How does the Action system work on different platforms?**  
A: On desktop you press E, on mobile a hand button appears when near an action, and on VR you use the triggers. (Ashxn)

**Q: Does v2 have reconnection logic for users who disconnect?**  
A: No, both v1 and v2 don't have reconnection logic. If users get disconnected, they reload and start from spawn again. Developers need to track progression on their own if it's meaningful to remember. (Ashxn)

**Q: Is it possible to take a screenshot programmatically and save it locally?**  
A: There's no snapshot function in the engine yet, but something like world.snapshot(width, height) would be good to add. (Ashxn)

**Q: What causes frequent disconnections?**  
A: Either your server doesn't have enough resources, an app has gone rogue, or the user has an unstable connection. (Ashxn and HypPrivakos)

**Q: Can we deploy 10 worlds on a single cloud server?**  
A: Yes, in a few ways. We currently have a single Hetzner server (affordable) that runs dozens. We use Coolify to manage the containers. Takes around 30-60 mins to set up. (ash)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Cross-Platform Interaction Implementation**
   - Helper: Ashxn | Helpee: hiroP
   - Context: Implementing cross-platform interactions
   - Resolution: Advised using the Action node system which works on all platforms instead of pointer events which are desktop-only

2. **3D Character Model Improvement**
   - Helper: Valiant | Helpee: Ashxn
   - Context: Improving the 3D model's topology from Meshy
   - Resolution: Valiant respun the image in Meshy with quad remeshing and symmetry, but still had issues with merged fingers

3. **Professional Character Designer Recommendation**
   - Helper: MetaRick | Helpee: Ashxn
   - Context: Ashxn needed a professional character designer for VRM creation
   - Resolution: MetaRick recommended akimbot who then offered their professional services

4. **Multiple World Deployment Guidance**
   - Helper: ash | Helpee: Coinexpert
   - Context: Deploying multiple worlds on a single server
   - Resolution: Confirmed it's possible using Coolify for container management on a Hetzner server, with setup taking 30-60 minutes

## Action Items

### Technical
- Implement Action nodes for cross-platform interactions instead of pointer events (use action.onTrigger instead of onPointerDown for buttons) (Mentioned by Ashxn)
- Track player progression on the server side by storing player state using playerIds to restore progress when they reconnect (Mentioned by Ashxn)
- Be aware of playerIds limitations as they reset with cache clears and are different across devices (Mentioned by 0mka)
- Consider implementing proper authentication using services like Supabase instead of relying solely on playerIds for persistence (Mentioned by hiroP)
- Improve version control and developer experience for building on Hyperfy as current process requires manual copy/paste between IDE and scripts (Mentioned by philbert)
- Manual retopology of character models to fix merged fingers and improve overall quality (Mentioned by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)
- Updated world portal hyperlink to only portal local player instead of everyone (Mentioned by 0mka)
- Modifications to Fastify WebSockets and client network components (Mentioned by 0mka)

### Documentation
- Create and publish detailed tokenomics documentation explaining token utility and marketplace plans (Mentioned by Ashxn)

### Feature
- Add screenshot functionality to the engine by implementing world.snapshot(width, height) to capture images programmatically (Mentioned by Ashxn)
- Implement cross-world identity and world discovery features which are seen as critical for adoption (Mentioned by philbert)
- Develop networking handling for developers to make it easier to implement multiplayer functionality (Mentioned by philbert)
- Create easy deployment system for Hyperfy projects similar to how Cursor handles deployment to fly.io (Mentioned by philbert)
- Update website to showcase available worlds and examples of what can be built with Hyperfy (Mentioned by MUDBONE)
- Create a clean VRM version of the character with professional topology as current automated tools (Meshy/Tripo) don't provide sufficient quality (Mentioned by Ashxn)
- Consider the limitations of platform-specific crypto SDKs when developing tools (Mentioned by peezy)

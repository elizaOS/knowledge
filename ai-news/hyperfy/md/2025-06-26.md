# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-06-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Cross-Platform Development
- hiroP successfully implemented cross-platform interactions in a VR application using the "action" node system recommended by Ashxn
- The action system provides consistent interaction across desktop (press and hold with circle indicator), mobile (hand button), and VR (trigger controls)
- This approach was deemed superior to pointer/reticle events which only work on desktop

### Platform Direction & Developer Experience
- philbert provided extensive feedback on Hyperfy's development direction, advocating for:
  - Focus on developer experience with local IDE integration rather than in-world editors
  - Prioritizing automated networking, easy deployment, and AI-assisted development
  - Concern about lack of progress on cross-world identity and discovery features
  - Noting the platform repository hasn't been updated in three months
- Tension was evident between Hyperfy's long-term vision and the need for short-term adoption

### 3D Character Creation
- Ashxn sought help finding a professional character designer to create a clean VRM model
- Automated solutions (Meshy/Tripo) were producing unsatisfactory topology
- Valiant shared an attempt at improving a model by reprocessing through Meshy with quad remeshing and symmetry, followed by AI retexturing
- A specific issue with merged fingers in the mesh was identified as needing manual fixing

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What's the best approach for handling interactions (clicks) within VR and on mobile?**  
A: Use the "action" node system which works across all platforms. Pointer/reticle events currently only work on desktop. (Ashxn)

**Q: How does the action system appear to users on different platforms?**  
A: On desktop, it shows a "press and hold" UI with a circle indicator. On mobile, users get a hand button that appears when near an action. On VR, users use the triggers. (Ashxn)

**Q: Does Hyperfy handle networking for end users?**  
A: (Question remained unanswered in the discussion)

# Hyperfy Discord - 2026-02-06

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Architecture & World Hosting
- **Decoupled Architecture Proposal**: Jin proposed a significant architectural change to make Hyperfy worlds function more like static websites with decoupled networking
- **Static World Hosting**: Discussion about hosting worlds on GitHub Pages, IPFS, or Arweave while maintaining optional multiplayer functionality
- **Offline Functionality**: Proposed system would allow worlds to function offline or switch between different server "shards" without losing the world itself
- **Multiverse Concept**: Ash and Jin discussed the possibility of having the same world accessible through different servers, similar to Minecraft's "one client, many hosted worlds" model

### Technical Issues
- **JWT Token Length Change**: A recent change caused issues for HypPrivakos' servers, which Ash resolved by removing the minimum length requirement
- **World 404 Errors**: Some users experienced 404 errors after updates

### User Experience
- **Building Challenges**: Enryt expressed frustration with the complexity of managing moving parts in larger building projects

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can Hyperfy worlds be static websites in view-only mode?**  
A: Yes (answered by Ash)

**Q: Can I build something that can just chill on GitHub pages?**  
A: Yes, but it's a bit annoying to set up (answered by Ash)

**Q: Is it possible for that client to have networking if I host a world as a static GitHub page and point to a live server URL?**  
A: You can already do this with regular client, it doesn't need a server (answered by Ash)

**Q: How do we get a clone of the same world in some other server?**  
A: The world would be cached on each system or server, allowing for multiverse exploration (answered by Jin)

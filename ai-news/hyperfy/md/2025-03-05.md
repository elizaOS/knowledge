# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-05

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Health & Combat System
- **Major Update**: Ashxn introduced significant changes to the health system, including health bars, damage numbers, and critical hit functionality
- Breaking change announced regarding player effects, moving from `control.setEffect` to a new system requiring `world.getPlayer(playerId)`
- Player-to-player collision was implemented, though noted it might need to be optional to prevent abuse
- Discussions about adding death ragdolls and survival mechanics like hunger/thirst

### UI Development & Design
- Discussions centered around screen vs. world space interactions
- Omka explored issues related to pointer events and UI layering
- ApeironCreations shared a display board for JPEGs and PNGs, with Ashxn suggesting using `image.objectFit = 'cover'` to maintain aspect ratio
- Blurriness in GLB files was fixed by changing texture settings from "closest" to "linear"

### 3D Modeling & VRM Implementation
- Bear encountered issues with VRM format uploads, receiving help with bone structure problems
- Detailed workflow provided for properly rigging and optimizing VRM models
- Discussion about spring bones in VRM V2 implementation
- Conversations about weapon attachment points (hand bones) for models

### AI & Agent Development
- SoulGraph (referred to as "grph soul") discussion about AI personalities with built-in voice capabilities
- Whambammy⚡ mentioned having done branding work for SoulGraph and potential integration with 3D avatars
- CheddarQueso shared a hackathon project related to an AI agent for plant growing advice
- Bitpixi's work on an AI Agents contest entry featuring "HyperParenting" with 10 agents

### Creative Projects & Tools
- Building 3D NFT collections and discussions about batch minting
- Potential for sports games in Hyperfy with basic mechanics like ball handling and goal triggers
- Howie shared a top-down camera viewer tool for building in Hyperfy
- smickelbeard's tabletop game prototype featuring session cookie authentication, backend integration, and card dragging mechanics

### Technical Issues & Solutions
- PhysX warning about triangles being too large in a simulation, likely caused by grass/floor having large triangles
- ToxSam fixed avatar download functionality on the website
- Breaking change in the `world.getPlayers` function affecting IdleCamera implementation
- Discussion about hiding 3D models in v2 using `cube.active = false` rather than `cube.visible = false`

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I migrate from the old effects system to the new one?**  
A: Change from using `control.setEffect` to using `world.getPlayer(playerId)` to get the player handle, then apply effects (Ashxn)

**Q: Is player-to-player collision optional?**  
A: It should probably be optional to prevent abuse like blocking people from accessing areas (Ashxn)

**Q: Which bone is anchor for weapons?**  
A: The sword is set to right hand, but you can change it in the hyp file (Omka)

**Q: Why was there blurriness in the GLB file?**  
A: The texture settings were set to "closest" instead of "linear" (Ashxn)

**Q: How can we fix image stretching in the display board?**  
A: Use "image.objectFit = 'cover'" instead of "fill" to maintain aspect ratio (Ashxn)

**Q: Why is my VRM upload throwing an error?**  
A: The model has bones not hooked up to meshes and separate mesh parts causing issues (Valiant)

**Q: Is this the correct way to hide the original model/glb in v2? `cube.visible = false`**  
A: Use `cube.active = false` instead (ash)

**Q: Any idea what's causing this PhysX warning about triangles being too big?**  
A: It's likely the grass/floor with huge triangles (ash)

**Q: Have you guys ever talked to the people at grph soul?**  
A: Yes, we did some of their original branding and I've been talking to cwm (their lead dev) about incorporating their tech into 3D avatars (Whambammy⚡)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Health System Migration**: Ashxn provided a detailed migration guide for the new effects system and offered to personally fix broken apps if sent the hyp files

- **VRM Troubleshooting**: MisfitPIXELS and Valiant helped Bear with VRM model upload errors by providing a detailed workflow for properly rigging the model, including deleting original armature, adding new VRM armature, proper weighting, and joining meshes

- **UI Design Assistance**: Ashxn helped ApeironCreations fix image stretching in a display board by suggesting changing image.objectFit from 'fill' to 'cover' to maintain aspect ratio

- **Technical Cataloging**: HypPrivakos and 0mka compiled comprehensive lists of .hyp files organized by user and channel, creating a reference library for the community

- **Texture Optimization**: Ashxn fixed blurry floor textures by changing settings from "closest" to "linear" and shared the solution with multiple users

- **Screen Recording Help**: Gooey/TheMattEmpire suggested OBS, Medal, Nvidia, and Snag it as options for screen recording to maximus

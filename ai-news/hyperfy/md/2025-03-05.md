# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-03-05

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Health & Damage System Implementation
- Ashxn introduced significant changes to the core health system, including health bars, damage numbers, and critical hit functionality
- Breaking changes to the effects system, moving from `control.setEffect` to a new approach using player IDs
- The change enables server-side application of effects and better cross-app integration
- Player-to-player collision was implemented and tested, with acknowledgment that it should be optional to prevent abuse

### UI Development & Optimization
- Discussions centered around health bar styling, with references to WoW addons for inspiration
- Omka worked through UI challenges related to screen vs. world space interactions and pointer events
- Howie shared a top-down camera viewer tool for easier building in Hyperfy
- Ashxn resolved image stretching issues in display boards by changing `image.objectFit` from 'fill' to 'cover'

### 3D Model & Asset Optimization
- Texture blurriness in GLB files was fixed by changing texture settings from "closest" to "linear"
- Detailed workflow provided for properly rigging and optimizing VRM models, including combining meshes and textures
- Discussion about Kenney's free asset packs and their licensing restrictions for crypto projects

### AI Integration & Agents
- SoulGraph (referred to as "grph soul") was discussed as a potential integration for AI personalities with built-in voice capabilities
- Whambammy‚ö° mentioned having done branding work for SoulGraph and discussed potential integration with 3D avatars
- CheddarQueso shared a hackathon project related to an AI agent for plant growing advice
- Bitpixi is working on an AI Agents contest entry featuring "HyperParenting" with 10 agents

### Game Development & Features
- Discussion about implementing sports games in Hyperfy with basic mechanics like ball handling and goal triggers
- Potential integration with Beeple's studio setup featuring large display walls
- Brief exchange about whether Hyperfy could support 2D game development, with suggestions that a 2D game engine will eventually be added

## Community Help & Collaboration

### 3D Model Optimization
- **Helper:** MisfitPIXELS | **Helpee:** bear  
  Provided detailed steps for re-rigging VRM models, including deleting the original armature, arranging objects in T-pose, adding VRM armature, proper weighting, and joining meshes

- **Helper:** Valiant | **Helpee:** bear  
  Identified issues with the rig having bones not connected to meshes and suggested joining mesh parts to reduce draw calls

### UI & Visual Improvements
- **Helper:** Ashxn | **Helpee:** ApeironCreations  
  Suggested changing image.objectFit from 'fill' to 'cover' to maintain aspect ratio in display boards

- **Helper:** Saori | **Helpee:** Ashxn  
  Suggested using WoW addons like Plater Nameplates as reference for better health bar styling

- **Helper:** Omka | **Helpee:** maximus  
  Used Discord search to find Howie's top-down camera viewer reference and shared it in another channel

### Technical Support
- **Helper:** Ashxn | **Helpee:** Omka  
  Fixed a core issue with UI trigger recognition in the dev branch

- **Helper:** Ashxn | **Helpee:** Community  
  Offered to personally fix any broken apps affected by the effects system changes if developers send their hyp files

- **Helper:** Omka | **Helpee:** Valiant  
  Added a switch in the inspector pane to choose left or right hand for weapon attachment

- Discussions centered on creating full-screen UI elements in Hyperfy
- Methods for accessing viewport dimensions through `app.control()`
- Positioning UI elements relative to the viewport
- Issues with UI elements extending beyond screen boundaries (particularly in Safari)
- 0mka shared code for creating full-screen UI using `control.screen.width/height`

### Technical Features
- Ashxn working on PR #109 to add viewport dimensions to the world object
- Discussion about animation layers to support held objects (guns, bows, staffs)
- Loading models with rigidbodies and colliders
- .hyp shaman working on implementing emissiveMap functionality
- Brief mention of "stormwind" as related to performance testing
- Exploration of raycast projectiles for projectile weapons

### Community

- Brief inquiry about building a "squid games world" with a reference to "`hypgames`"

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I create a UI that fills the entire screen?**  
A: Use app.control() to access screen dimensions and create a UI with those dimensions (0mka)

**Q: Is there a way to make a UI "fill the entire screen"?**  
A: Use top-left pivot with position 0,0 and set width/height to viewport dimensions (Ashxn)

**Q: Can we load an app using world.load()?**  
A: Not apps, but you can use it to load GLBs from remote sources (Ashxn)

**Q: What is stormwind?**  
A: Performance testing ðŸ˜‰ (Ashxn)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **0mka helped shmoji** with creating full-screen UI elements by sharing code snippets that use app.control() to access screen dimensions
- **Ashxn assisted .hyp shaman** with clarification on loading models with rigidbodies and colliders, explaining that world.load() works for GLBs from remote sources but not for apps
- **Ashxn responded to MUDBONE's** question about "stormwind" from a previously shared video

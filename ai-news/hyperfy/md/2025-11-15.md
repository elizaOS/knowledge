## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What does a solar panel do in Hyperfy?**  
A: It controls the skybox, sunlight, fog, etc. (answered by ash)

**Q: Is it really important to do npm audit fix (without --force)? Any security risk for later in world?**  
A: If you --force updates to your packages you could actually break things. Need to be careful there. Some dependencies only play nice with certain versions of other dependencies. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)

**Q: Where and how should I import an app like Eliza into the code so I can use it in my 3D world?**  
A: If the Eliza framework is not already integrated into the backend of Hyperfy framework then it will be a lot more complex than just plug and play with the repo. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)

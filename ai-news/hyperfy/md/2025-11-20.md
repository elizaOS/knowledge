# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-20

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Status & Web3 Integration
- Wallet connect functionality has been available for months through hypkg.sh, though not in the core branch
- Tension exists between users wanting features added to core versus community-driven development
- 3rdEyeVisuals mentioned taking a backend session-based approach to gaming rather than on-chain implementation to avoid transaction fees
- Some speculation that the lead developer's quiet period indicates work on "something big"

### Technical Limitations & Implementations
- **UV Scrolling**: Currently only supported on regular meshes, not on skinned meshes
- **IFC Integration**: Developers are working on integrating Industry Foundation Classes files using ThatOpen's engine components, though performance concerns exist
- **Canvas-texture with dirty flags**: Highlighted as an optimization technique for implementing games like Space Invaders within Hyperfy
- **Mesh Grouping**: Discussion about grouping meshes to reduce CPU/GPU load while maintaining individual access

### Feature Status
- Cars and pets features have been implemented but need community review and iteration
- Web3 gating functionality remains a requested feature
- HYPER token briefly discussed with mixed sentiment about future value

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Do we have UV scrolling on skinned meshes?**  
A: "Only regular mesh currently. Skinned mesh support is a bit harder." (answered by ash)

**Q: Is there a way to group individual meshes and still access each nested mesh separately?**  
A: "Yes, the group node or use empties in blender." (answered by .hyp shaman)

**Q: Anything New on the Horizon for the Github?**  
A: "ngl it's pretty stable. on hyp." (answered by .hyp shaman)

**Q: We got Cars, Pets, Or Web3 Gating yet in Stable Dev?**  
A: "cars and pets have been done for a minute now. afaik no one has looked at the code to iterate" (answered by .hyp shaman)

**Q: Where is @[179546010303856640]?**  
A: "Usually when he goes quiet, it means he's working on something big." (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)

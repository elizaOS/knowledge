# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-27

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Network & Performance Optimization
- **Avatar Movement Improvements**: Ashxn implemented changes to the smoothing algorithm to address avatar jitter issues reported by cru. This update has been deployed to dev and play environments.
- **Network Tick Rate Testing**: Cru experimented with a 1/24 tick rate which improved responsiveness but increased network data transfer threefold, highlighting the tradeoff between performance and bandwidth usage.
- **WebSocket Limitations**: Discussions about current limitations in establishing secondary WebSocket connections from Hyperfy apps, which impacts AI integration and game development capabilities.

### Platform Updates
- **New Version Release**: Ashxn mentioned a significant update featuring improved movement mechanics, first-person view, voice zones, and mod tools.
- **Cross-Platform Availability**: Confirmation that Drifters is available on mobile and VR platforms.
- **Gaming Ecosystem**: Brief discussions about various games in the ecosystem, including clarification that Bathroom Blitz was developed by independent developers rather than Yuga Labs.

### 3D Design & Hardware
- **Mac Requirements**: Discussion about minimum specifications for learning 3D design tools, with Ashxn suggesting performance testing using iPhone 12 Pro as a benchmark device.

### HYPER Token
- Brief community discussion about purchasing more of the HYPER token despite apparent price decline, with users expressing commitment to holding through the downturn.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is multiplayer lag in Hyperfy a limitation of websockets or are there settings to improve performance?**  
A: It's related to the smoothing algorithm, which was updated to improve performance (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Can I set up a secondary websocket connection from an app?**  
A: Not without a forked engine, it's not supported yet and would break interoperability (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: One day will we play games like Hyperfy's FPS, Open World, Battle Royale?**  
A: "You'll do more than spend on games" (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: Who made Bathroom Blitz?**  
A: It was made by an independent team, not Yuga Labs, though Yuga later adopted it (answered by Ashxn)

**Q: What are the minimum Mac specifications for learning v2?**  
A: Ashxn suggested using iPhone 12 Pro as a benchmark - if content runs well there, it should be acceptable on most devices.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-07-27

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Multiplayer Performance
- **Avatar Movement Issues**: Discussion about twitchy avatar movement in Hyperfy multiplayer environments
- **Performance Concerns**: Debate about whether multiplayer lag is inherent to websockets or can be improved
- **Development Priority**: Suggestion that improving multiplayer performance could attract serious game developers to build competitive games on the platform

### Platform Testing
- **Hypercloud Testing**: Brief mentions of users testing a game called "hypercloud" together
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Discussion about using iPhone 12 Pro as a benchmark device for content optimization

### Hardware Requirements
- **Mac Specifications**: Question about minimum Mac specifications for learning design software (v2)
- **Budget Considerations**: User considering a $1K refurbished MacBook for 3D design work

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is multiplayer lag in Hyperfy just a limitation of websockets? Or are there any settings to improve performance?**  
A: Ashxn suggested it might be related to the smoothing algorithm for avatar movement and mentioned having a better algorithm that could be implemented.

**Q: What's a good approach for testing if my hardware can handle 3D design work?**  
A: Ashxn recommended using iPhone 12 Pro as a benchmark - if content runs well there, it should be acceptable on most platforms. They also shared a link to a well-optimized Hyperfy world as an example.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Avatar Movement Troubleshooting**: Ashxn helped cru identify that twitchy avatar movement might be due to the current smoothing algorithm and mentioned having a better solution
- **Performance Testing Guidance**: Ashxn provided Fibelius with practical advice on testing performance across platforms and shared an optimized world example

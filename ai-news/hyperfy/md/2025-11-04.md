# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Persistent Data & Leaderboards
- Gert-Jan Akerboom successfully implemented a persistent leaderboard for a dragon game using `world.get` and `world.set` methods
- Community members pointed to existing examples including Ash's "elementals" implementation and a quest item system
- This implementation allows game data to persist after page reload

### Animation & 3D Model Issues
- Current limitation identified: only skinned mesh (armature/bone) animations can be exported from Blender to Hyperfy V2
- Mobile display flickering issues were traced to specific GLB models with transparent alpha textures (particularly plant/tree leaves)
- Systematic testing approach shared: activating/deactivating GLB models one by one to identify problematic ones

### Object Interactions
- Discussion on implementing click behavior for objects, specifically making objects invisible when clicked
- Community members shared example scripts and directed users to documentation

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How to make a leaderboard for the dragon game that persists after reload?**  
A: Use `world.get` & `world.set` for persistence, with examples available in Ash's elementals implementation and feeding quest items (answered by .hyp shaman and Valiant)

**Q: How can I add an object that has a looping animation from Blender?**  
A: Currently only skinned mesh (armature/bone) animations can be exported from Blender to Hyperfy V2 (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)

**Q: How to give objects click behavior to make another object invisible when clicked?**  
A: Check example scripts and AI prompts documentation (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host and Gert-Jan Akerboom)

**Q: What causes flickering issues on mobile devices?**  
A: Certain plant and tree GLB models, particularly those with transparent alpha textures for elements like leaves (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)

**Q: Anything amazing been built with hyperfy yet?**  
A: "Only just started myself. But, every day I integrate something crazier. The possibilities are vast!" (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)

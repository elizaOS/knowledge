# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-11-04

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Persistent Data Implementation
- Gert-Jan Akerboom successfully implemented a persistent leaderboard for a dragon game using `world.get` and `world.set` methods
- The leaderboard now maintains records after page reload, with a new record time of 23 seconds (replacing previous 59 seconds)
- Community members referenced existing examples including "elementals" by Ash and a quest item implementation as helpful references

### Animation Support
- Discussion clarified that Hyperfy V2 currently only supports skinned mesh animations with armature/bones from Blender
- Other animation types (like keyframe-based object animations) are not currently supported
- Progress with animations was briefly mentioned by .hyp shaman

### Community Building
- Brief discussion about the growing capabilities of Hyperfy, with 3rdEyeVisuals noting "every day I integrate something crazier. The possibilities are vast!"
- Some community management discussion regarding scammers impersonating users

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How to make a leaderboard for a dragon game that persists after reload?**  
A: Use `world.get` & `world.set` methods, and reference examples like elementals by Ash or the quest item implementation.

**Q: How can I add an object that has a looping animation from Blender?**  
A: Currently, Hyperfy V2 only supports skinned mesh (armature/bone) animations from Blender. Other animation types are not supported.

**Q: Anything amazing been built with hyperfy yet?**  
A: "Only just started myself. But, every day I integrate something crazier. The possibilities are vast!" (3rdEyeVisuals)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Persistent Leaderboard Implementation**
   - Valiant shared a reference to a quest item implementation that helped Gert-Jan Akerboom achieve a breakthrough
   - .hyp shaman offered to find the "elementals" example by Ash that demonstrates world persistence
   - The collaboration resulted in Gert-Jan successfully implementing the feature

2. **Animation Support Clarification**
   - Gert-Jan Akerboom helped Sphynxcolt understand the current limitations of animation imports
   - Valiant provided a resource link with relevant information about animations

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-04-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Game Development
- **Fallen Game Testing**: Ash led multiple test sessions for this new PvP/PvE game where players collect ore while fighting mobs and other players. The game features a death mechanic that funds a reward pool and is set to handle 100 players per server.
- **Game Concepts**: Several new game ideas were discussed including:
  - A parkour game with $HYPER token rewards distributed in chests throughout the course
  - A 1v1 staking arena where players can stake tokens
  - A shooter game being developed by Saori
- **Technical Showcase**: Gert-Jan Akerboom shared a grass particle system with wind animation that maintains 60 FPS even with 10,000 particles.

### Technical Development
- **Inventory System**: ~/drdoge.eth showcased a backpack/inventory system with persistent storage using Hyperfy's permanent storage feature.
- **Model Loading**: Developers discussed loading models from external URLs using `world.load('model', url)` which converts them to nodes that can be manipulated.
- **Wind Shader**: An experimental wind shader feature was discussed, which works by adding a boolean custom property to materials in Blender.
- **Web3 Integration**: Saori explained that Hyperfy uses hypkg mods to provide boilerplate Solana/Ethereum API functionality, with current implementation using the Solana branch with server wallets rather than contracts.

### Platform Evolution & Philosophy
- **Decentralization**: Ash highlighted "Fallen" as an example of true decentralization - a complete game with built-in economics, self-hosted with open-source code, and zero dependencies on external services.
- **AI Integration Debate**: A significant debate emerged about AI's role in development ("vibe coding"), with Ash clarifying that while AI tools are useful, they won't replace proper development. Hyperfy's approach is to add minimal but high-impact features rather than pivoting entirely to AI-driven development.
- **Platform Growth**: Ash noted Hyperfy's evolution from a basic engine launched in January to a platform capable of supporting complex multiplayer games with economic systems.

### Market & Token
- **HYPER Token Volatility**: The community tracked significant price movements (down to -34.7% followed by a +42.3% pump), with some members identifying a large buyer accumulating approximately 2% of the supply.
- **Long-term Outlook**: Despite market volatility, several community members expressed confidence in Hyperfy's long-term potential, emphasizing the importance of the platform's connectivity features rather than just individual games.

### Community Resources
- **Tutorial Series**: 0mka shared information about the Hyperfy.how Tutorial Series, with an upcoming Session #4 focused on teaching basics of working in a fresh Hyperfy v2 world.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is Hyperfy dead?** (asked by vking1337)  
**A:** "We've barely begun, we launched an engine from zero in January. It's already more powerful than 99% of everything else out there." (answered by ash)

**Q: How many people can be in one server?** (asked by MUDBONE)  
**A:** "Fallen is set to 100 but can probably do more" (answered by ash)

**Q: Are there any lore plans?** (asked by johan)  
**A:** "The lore is what people build, an interconnected multiverse of digital worlds that all have their own stories" (answered by ash)

**Q: How does the inventory system save data when users reload or disconnect?** (asked by TheMattEmpire)  
**A:** It uses worlds' permanent storage feature, which has no file size limits but is intended for stats and small data, not large files (answered by ash)

**Q: Is it possible to set up multiple tenant worlds for Hyperfy?** (asked by smickelbeard)  
**A:** Multiple worlds on one server should be possible with world folders, though it requires some work (answered by ash)

**Q: How can we load external models into Hyperfy?** (asked by 0mka)  
**A:** Use `world.load('model', url)` which converts models to nodes that can be manipulated (answered by ash)

**Q: How can we handle CORS issues when fetching external data?** (asked by peezy)  
**A:** The engine server could have a built-in proxy, e.g., `myhyperfyworld.com/proxy?url=https://www.google.com` (answered by ash)

**Q: How do I implement the experimental wind shader?** (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom)  
**A:** Add a boolean custom property called "wind" to the material in Blender, and ensure custom properties are enabled on export (answered by ash)

**Q: How does depositing to the server work here? Is it a smart contract associated with the server?** (asked by shandy)  
**A:** It's using the Solana branch with a server wallet rather than a contract. Ash's game uses the branch on the Hyperfy repo, while hypkg mods provide boilerplate Solana/Ethereum API functionality. (answered by Saori)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Grass Particle System**
   - **Helper:** Gert-Jan Akerboom
   - **Helpee:** vox
   - **Context:** Created a grass particle system with wind animation
   - **Resolution:** Shared the system which vox tested and praised as "truly amazing"

2. **Wallet Integration**
   - **Helper:** ash
   - **Helpee:** Wilson
   - **Context:** Wilson expressed concern about implementing payment/wallet connect for games
   - **Resolution:** ash assured they're "making it easy mode" and can "abstract it away with apps and you can use events to trigger what you need"

3. **Wind Shader Implementation**
   - **Helper:** ash
   - **Helpee:** Gert-Jan Akerboom
   - **Context:** Implementing experimental wind shader
   - **Resolution:** Explained that it requires adding a boolean custom property to the material in Blender, works best for grass, and vertices nearest the root have zero movement

4. **External Model Loading**
   - **Helper:** ash
   - **Helpee:** 0mka
   - **Context:** Loading external models
   - **Resolution:** Provided code example showing how to load models from URLs using `world.load('model', url)` and manipulate the resulting nodes

5. **Portal Implementation**
   - **Helper:** MiaHigashikata
   - **Helpee:** Community
   - **Context:** Portal implementation
   - **Resolution:** Fixed by adding `collider.trigger=true` and reversing the model

6. **Web3 Integration Guidance**
   - **Helper:** Saori
   - **Helpee:** shandy
   - **Context:** Understanding how Hyperfy's web3 integration works
   - **Resolution:** Saori explained that Hyperfy uses the Solana branch with server wallets rather than contracts, and offered to help shandy get started with Hyperfy development

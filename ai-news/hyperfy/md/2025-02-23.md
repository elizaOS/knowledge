# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-23

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Features
- **NPC/Agent Controllers**: Ashxn and MetaRick shared demos of controllers for NPCs/agents/pets with directional movement capabilities, gravity, and ability to traverse colliders.
- **Projectile Mechanics**: Shiffty implemented water balloons with particle effects and collision detection, showcasing a working projectile system.
- **In-World Documentation**: Omka is developing a documentation pane for in-world reference while coding, with discussions about UI placement and data loading.
- **Node Visibility Control**: The `active` property has replaced the deprecated `visible` property for meshes, with Ashxn explaining that it works for every node type.
- **Hidden Form Fields**: Password-type fields with dots for sensitive input have been implemented by Ashxn.

### AI & Agents
- **Hugging Face Integration**: drdoge.eth successfully implemented a Hugging Face integration with a Mistral model.
- **Voice AI Challenges**: devilsadvocate.sol shared technical insights on voice AI implementation, including streaming techniques, chunking responses, and using prerecorded greetings.
- **Agent Frameworks**: Saori mentioned a team integrating the Hyperfy agent protocol into a lightweight TypeScript framework that may be easier to set up than Eliza v1.

### Platform & Community
- **V1 to V2 Migration**: Saori is planning to add V1 apps to a GitHub board for potential porting to V2, with some migration being community-driven.
- **Volume Permissions**: TheMattEmpire proposed a system where hosts can set volumes with specific build permissions for shared worlds.
- **Asset Sharing**: Akuma shared shop shelf assets with snap points for community use.
- **3D Asset Minting**: Discussion about `animation_url` and `glb_url` parameters for NFT minting, with untitled, xyz clarifying implementation details.
- **HYPER Token**: Users noted a significant price decline (25-30%), with some attributing it to broader market conditions.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How would the caller connection work? Is it something like Privy/Phanthom?**  
A: Blockchain is in the works, only available when self-hosting at the moment. (Saori)

**Q: Is there any avatar scaling in world being worked on?**  
A: Ashxn doesn't want to add per-user setting for avatar scale to the core as it feels like bloat, but it could be implemented through other means. (Ashxn)

**Q: What's different about active vs visible for meshes?**  
A: Visible is deprecated, active works for every node type but for meshes they both unmount the mesh from the scene. (Ashxn)

**Q: Will the apps from V1 be ported over to V2 at some stage and available on marketplaces?**  
A: Yes, partly community-driven. (Saori)

**Q: In v2 are we able to livestream yet/play videos?**  
A: Not yet. (MetaRick)

**Q: What do you mean by hugging face to work? Are you using openRouter or local ollama to manage responses?**  
A: I'm using hugging face with an API key to handle the responses and guidance. Not sure if it's locally or not. (drdoge.eth)

**Q: Why hasn't anyone built AI voice yet?**  
A: It's slow and expensive. Good luck getting that 0.3m/s latency. (devilsadvocate.sol)

**Q: I change/edit animation_url to glb_url after I mint the 3D asset, right?**  
A: You can add `glb_url` during the Manifold mint process under "hidden" metadata. (untitled, xyz)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Draggable Panes Implementation**:
   - Ashxn helped Omka implement draggable panes, explaining that usePane sets up listeners on the pane header and moves it around.

2. **Avatar Mesh Visibility**:
   - Ashxn assisted devilsadvocate.sol with hiding avatar mesh, providing code example using avatar.active = false instead of the visible property.

3. **Projectiles App Bug Fix**:
   - Ashxn helped Shiffty fix a bug where effects still run when left clicking after deleting the app by modifying the code to use a single control.

4. **VRM File Downloads**:
   - Saori shared code examples with devilsadvocate.sol showing how to get the model URL in a script for downloading VRM files.

5. **Hugging Face API Implementation**:
   - maximus helped drdoge.eth understand Hugging Face API implementation by sharing a link explaining how to use the API for hosted models.

6. **3D Asset Minting Guidance**:
   - untitled, xyz explained to treed how to handle glb_url when minting 3D assets through Manifold.

7. **Market Analysis**:
   - Malloy provided context to users concerned about HYPER token price drops, explaining it's related to broader market conditions affecting all crypto.

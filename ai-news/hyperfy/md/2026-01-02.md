# Hyperfy Discord - 2026-01-02

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development Tools & Utilities
- **Mesh Export Tool**: mrtzhckr developed a tool for exporting individual meshes from Hyperfy for Blender editing, preserving mesh separation rather than joining them
- **HTML-based Editor**: A new editor with preview capabilities for primitives, transform adjustments, and scene editing is being developed, with animation support included
- **Memory Optimization**: Ozymandias implemented a workaround for server memory issues on Heroku by adding a conditional return in the Stage's insert method

### Technical Challenges
- **Camera Controls**: Discussion about hidden camera triggers affecting movement in worlds and how to exit camera modes (press Q)
- **Server Memory Usage**: Heroku servers running v0.16 experiencing termination due to excessive memory consumption, primarily from GLB files

### Object Creation
- Brief exchange about methods for creating objects in V2 worlds, including dragging optimized .glb files or using the plus button to add models

## Key Questions & Answers

- **Q: How to create objects in V2 worlds?**  
  A: Two methods: drag an optimized .glb into your world, or hit the plus button, click model, then place it somewhere

- **Q: How do you exit camera triggers?**  
  A: Press Q to exit camera modes

- **Q: What's the biggest memory consumer on the server?**  
  A: The server generates colliders like a client, with GLB files in the world being the main memory consumers

- **Q: Does anyone know the recommended way to get an app list?**  
  A: Partially answered as "probably not possible yet"

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **.hyp shaman helped Coinexpert** with basic instructions for creating objects in V2 worlds, providing two different methods for a new user

2. **~/drdoge.eth assisted Enryt** with camera control issues, explaining how to exit camera modes and identifying hidden triggers that need removal

3. **ash helped Ozymandias** diagnose server memory issues by explaining how the server functions similarly to a client in generating colliders and identifying GLB files as the primary memory consumers

4. **mrtzhckr shared a custom tool** with the community that exports meshes individually for easier Blender editing, addressing a common workflow challenge

## Action Items

### Technical
- **Remove hidden camera triggers** in beginning areas (Mentioned by ~/drdoge.eth)
- **Implement proper memory optimization** for server vs client code beyond the current conditional return workaround (Mentioned by Ozymandias)
- **Add memory profiling tools** to identify memory usage issues more systematically (Mentioned by Ozymandias)
- **Implement correct .hyp export functionality** in the HTML-based editor tool (Mentioned by mrtzhckr)
- **Develop method to retrieve global app list** in Hyperfy (Mentioned by mrtzhckr)

### Documentation
- **Create beginner guide for object creation** in V2 worlds, including file optimization requirements (Mentioned by Coinexpert)

### Feature
- **Add split screen code/viewport** to the HTML-based editor (Mentioned by Gert-Jan Akerboom)

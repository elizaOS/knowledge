# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-13

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Implementation
- **Performance Optimization Tools**: Ashxn introduced a new inspection panel that tracks asset metrics like geometries, triangles, and texture memory to help optimize worlds.
- **LOD Implementation**: Significant performance improvements demonstrated by adding LOD levels to models. HowiEDuhzit announced LOD support in Blender Hyperfy Tools, allowing meshes named in specific formats (objectLOD0, objLOD1, etc.) to be recognized as LODs.
- **Animation Handling**: Developers shared code for animation imports from Mixamo, discussing optimization techniques like setting sampling rate to 2-3 and using the "optimize animations" button in the exporter.
- **Vehicle/Mount Implementation**: Several developers attempted to implement rideable vehicles (bikes/hoverboards), discovering limitations in the current API regarding player anchoring and control.
- **Development Process**: Ashxn explained that features are built on the dev branch and pushed to main when stable, addressing questions about Hyperfy's development workflow.

### 3D Design & Asset Creation
- **Shadow Casting**: Users discovered that flipping normals in Blender (making red face up, blue face down) enables proper shadow casting for flat GLB files.
- **Avatar Formats**: The community explored avatar formats, debating the merits of VRM versus custom formats for wearables, with considerations about standardization, compatibility, and implementation challenges.
- **Building System**: Users discussed challenges with the current building system, particularly around snap points and positioning objects, with suggestions to visualize snap points to improve usability.

### AI & Agents
- **Agent Implementation**: Drdoge.eth reported successfully implementing an agent in a "rover/collectron" system, using preset phrases for command tasks while leveraging AI for other interactions.
- **LLM Providers**: Discussion about using Venice as an LLM provider instead of Eliza, with MetaMike confirming this could be done by changing the chat endpoint.
- **Fleek Integration**: Brief discussion about Fleek.xyz/eliza as a potential platform, with Saori indicating they've been in talks with Fleek about agent deployment.

### Marketplace & Tokens
- **Hyper Token Utility**: Discussion about implementing Hyper token utility for the marketplace with tipping functionality.
- **Cryptocurrency Tracking**: Users shared and discussed various tokens like STUDIA, HYPER, GENIE, often using the "$" command to check prices via the Rick bot.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Development & Technical Implementation**
- **Q**: How can I set up triggers for player detection? (Shiffty)  
  **A**: Use the rigidbody parent with onTriggerEnter/onTriggerLeave events, not on the collider itself. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do I fix the code editor window when it disappears or becomes tiny? (MetaMike)  
  **A**: Look in dev tools local storage for "pane" and delete it, then refresh. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do animations work with character movement in Hyperfy? (peezy)  
  **A**: You can set animations to "in-place" in Mixamo to handle movement separately in code. (Saori)

- **Q**: How do I teleport a player to a specific position? (ToxSam)  
  **A**: Use world.getPlayer().teleport(position) on the client side. (peezy)

- **Q**: How do I control player input in Hyperfy? (ToxSam)  
  **A**: Use app.control() to access key events and camera controls. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Are multi-script apps possible in Hyperfy? (MetaMike)  
  **A**: Currently not supported, but components could theoretically be implemented. (multiple users)

**3D Design & Asset Creation**
- **Q**: How do I set up LODs manually in Hyperfy? (TheMattEmpire)  
  **A**: Create an empty with `node=lod` custom property, add meshes as children with `maxDistance=number` properties to control visibility distance. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Does Hyperfy support custom avatar formats for wearables? (Ashxn)  
  **A**: Multiple users suggested staying with VRM but extending it, with ToxSam suggesting using VRM with GLBs on top as wearables. (ToxSam, TheMattEmpire)

- **Q**: Do meshes cast shadows in Hyperfy? (Ashxn)  
  **A**: Yes, but it might depend on whether material is double-sided or casting on the normals side. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do flat GLB files handle shadows in Hyperfy? (Gert-Jan Akerboom)  
  **A**: Try flipping the normals in Blender so the red is facing up and the blue is facing down. (TheMattEmpire)

**General & Community**
- **Q**: How is Hyperfy evolving? (MetaDoge)  
  **A**: Features are built on dev branch and as long as nobody raises any major issues with them we can push them to the main branch as they're considered stable. (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Can Venice be used instead of Eliza/other LLM providers? (MetaMike)  
  **A**: Yes, in theory, by pointing the chat endpoint to Venice. (MetaMike)

- **Q**: How do we prevent editing of creations in shared metaverse? (treed)  
  **A**: Role-based + model-based security is needed where you can define people and what models they can interact with. (maximus)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Shadow Casting for Flat Objects**  
   TheMattEmpire helped Gert-Jan Akerboom solve the issue of flat GLB files not casting shadows by suggesting to flip normals in Blender. Gert-Jan later shared a file demonstrating the solution for others.

2. **Performance Optimization Tool**  
   Ashxn created and shared a new performance inspection tool to help users identify problematic assets, benefiting the entire community's optimization efforts.

3. **LOD Implementation in Blender**  
   HowiEDuhzit released an update to Hyperfy Tools with LOD support using specific naming conventions, responding to community needs for better optimization workflows.

4. **Player Teleportation for Vehicle Mounting**  
   Peezy shared code snippets with ToxSam for teleporting players to specific positions, helping with vehicle implementation challenges.

5. **VRM Avatar Creation Resources**  
   TheMattEmpire shared Twitch stream recordings and documentation for rigging avatars, while maximus provided links to relevant tools based on Ash's recommendations.

6. **Documentation Navigation**  
   Saori directed treed to hyperfy.how which combines community docs with API reference, helping organize the learning experience.

7. **Blender Environment Setup**  
   HowiEDuhzit created and shared a Hyperfy theme and default startup file for Blender to help standardize workflows.

# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-10-30

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Miniverse Development
- 3rdEyeVisuals is developing a "Miniverse" application that creates worlds-within-worlds functionality
- The app allows separate environments within a main Hyperfy world with custom HDR/EXR settings
- Weather effects system is being developed as a plugin for the Miniverse app
- Implementation includes player position and camera control for proximity-based triggers

### Technical Infrastructure
- Discussion about WebGPU as a potential upgrade from WebGL to enable DX12 in browser and real ray-tracing
- Direct access to THREE.js engine for in-world development was highlighted
- Snap points in Blender using the Hyperfy tools addon were discussed
- Roustan demonstrated cross-platform compatibility by converting Avatar GLB files to VRM format

### Platform Issues
- A significant incident occurred when Rizzle placed a large pumpkin model in the "wip" parcel, causing it to break
- Multiple v1 worlds were reported as inaccessible, suggesting a potential server-wide issue
- 3rdEyeVisuals offered a Python script solution to remove problematic apps and entities from the database
- Discussion about migrating "WIP" to v2, indicating an ongoing platform upgrade process

### Development Tools
- A utility script for listing app blueprints and entities in a Hyperfy repository was shared
- Image frame implementation similar to Hyperfy V1 is being worked on by Valiant
- Holographic effect image frames are being developed

### Industry News
- Nuggets launching a Verified Identity Plugin for ElizaOS, bringing zero-trust verification to AI agents

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Has anyone tried upgrading from WebGL to WebGPU?**  
A: Has been discussed previously. Search for "webgpu" in the channel history. (Valiant)

**Q: Is there an app/hyp file out there just for the v1 image uploader that comes with a frame?**  
A: Valiant indicated he was working on a solution, and .hyp shaman provided code examples from the collections.

**Q: When you have more than 1 wallet in your browser they tend to fight to connect. How to fix?**  
A: Normally disable the wallet (temple) and try and connect again. (.hyp shaman)

**Q: Can anyone else see if they can get into the wip parcel?**  
A: Not loading for me baus. (untitled, xyz)

**Q: How can we fix a broken parcel?**  
A: I think ash needs to reset it for you, you need god mode. (untitled, xyz)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **.hyp shaman helped untitled, xyz** with image uploader implementation by providing code examples from collections and documentation references.

2. **Valiant assisted untitled, xyz** with image frames by developing a basic working version with glowing frames similar to V1 functionality.

3. **.hyp shaman helped Gert-Jan Akerboom** resolve wallet connection issues by suggesting disabling competing wallets to resolve connection conflicts.

4. **3rdEyeVisuals offered to help Rizzle** fix a broken parcel by sharing a Python script that removes problematic apps and entities from the database while creating backups.

5. **3rdEyeVisuals shared a utility script** with channel members for listing app blueprints and entities in a Hyperfy repository, providing code and instructions for running from the hyperfy-repo folder.

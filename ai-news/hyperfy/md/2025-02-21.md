# Hyperfy Discord - 2025-02-21

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **iPhone Compatibility**: Ashxn announced that iPhone worlds now run without external dependencies.
- **Effects System Update**: The system moved from `player.setEffect()` to `control.setEffect()` to better track app lifecycles and prevent players from getting stuck with effects.
- **Solana Integration**: Peezy improved the Solana branch with networked wallets, allowing for player-to-player token transfers.
- **UI Development**: Significant discussions about implementing UIImage for displaying images in UI windows, with code examples and implementation details shared.
- **Physics Engine**: Ashxn clarified that Hyperfy runs physics on CPU with WASM that supports SIMD, addressing questions about PhysX support.

### 3D Asset Optimization
- Detailed discussions about optimizing 3D architectural assets, balancing visual quality with performance.
- Sceth demonstrated polygon reduction techniques using Zbrush, reducing a 105k poly building to 60k while maintaining visual fidelity.
- Ashxn explained that duplicated objects in Hyperfy are automatically instanced, significantly improving performance.
- TheMattEmpire shared a solution for converting A-Pose to T-Pose for VRMs in Blender, fixing avatar rigging issues.

### AI and Agents
- Discussion on the differences between fine-tuning AI models versus providing context, with cost versus accuracy being a key consideration.
- Debate on when each approach (fine-tuning vs. context) is more appropriate, with analogies to human learning.
- Challenges in explaining AI concepts to newcomers who view AI capabilities as "black magic" rather than understanding the underlying mechanisms.

### Platform Updates
- Hyperfy V2 was released approximately two months ago and no longer requires an NFT to create worlds.
- Documentation efforts are ongoing, with multiple members working on consolidating documentation from various sources into hyperfy.how using Starlight Astro.

### Market Discussion
- HYPER token price tracking showed fluctuations between approximately $9.6M and $10.9M market cap.
- Users described current conditions as a "mini bear market inside a bull market" with some seeing potential signs of recovery.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Development & Technical
- **Q**: How do we add an image into a UI window?  
  **A**: Use UIImage component (MetaMike and Omka provided code examples)

- **Q**: How can I make an action ontrigger activate by player proximity and not E?  
  **A**: Don't use an action; instead create a trigger zone using rigidbody with a collider (Ashxn)

- **Q**: Are there docs somewhere for packaging things up into .hyp apps?  
  **A**: After you write a script with a model, click the download button (Saori)

- **Q**: Would a server hosting hyperfy benefit from having a GPU that supports PhysX?  
  **A**: "We're running it on the CPU. The WASM we have DOES support SIMD though so it could theoretically use the GPU, but it's already extremely fast." (Ashxn)

- **Q**: How do materials and meshes relate to draw calls?  
  **A**: Each material creates a separate draw call; if you have multiple materials on one mesh in Blender, they become separate meshes in game engines (Ashxn)

### 3D Design & Optimization
- **Q**: How do you set current position as rest pose in Blender for VRMs?  
  **A**: Use the method described at https://egneva.com/how-to-set-current-position-as-rest-pose-in-blender/ to convert A-Pose to T-Pose (TheMattEmpire)

- **Q**: How does instancing work in Hyperfy?  
  **A**: Duplicated objects are automatically instanced; you can place hundreds of objects with minimal performance impact (Ashxn)

- **Q**: What are the recommended polygon counts for VRMs?  
  **A**: Around 15k is medium, but it depends on the end experience and must consider material count and texture resolution too (TheMattEmpire)

### Platform & General
- **Q**: Do we still need an NFT to create a world?  
  **A**: For v2, no. https://hyperfy.how/setup/quickstart/ to set up locally then self-host or go to https://hyperworld.host/ to have them host and spin up world. (Omka)

- **Q**: When was Hyper v2 released?  
  **A**: Over a month ago / about 2 months ago (HPrivakos, devilsadvocate.sol)

- **Q**: Can someone link the public V2 play space?  
  **A**: Play.hyperfy.xyz (devilsadvocate.sol)

### AI & Agents
- **Q**: What's the difference between fine-tuning a model and feeding it context?  
  **A**: It's a balance between efficiency and accuracy; fine-tuning changes the model weights while context provides information without changing the model (maximus)

- **Q**: When would you want to tune a model versus feed it context?  
  **A**: Fine-tuning is better for large/specific project scopes and can be more cost-effective at scale, while context works better for dynamic information (maximus)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### UI Development Assistance
- **Omka** helped **devilsadvocate.sol** with displaying images in UI by providing code examples for UIImage implementation with detailed property explanations.
- **Ashxn** assisted **Omka** with creating proximity triggers by suggesting using rigidbody with collider instead of action triggers.

### 3D Asset Optimization
- **ùöüùöòùö°ùöüùöíùöéùöóùöóùöé** provided **treed** with feedback on triangle count and file size optimization for architectural assets, sharing examples of well-optimized architecture.

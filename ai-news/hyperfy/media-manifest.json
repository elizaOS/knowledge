      "message_content": "Hello Strong Star. Here is a proposal: use hyperfy v2 stack +  these VOID ImmaDegen NFT traits https://opensea.io/collection/visitors-of-imma-degen   and build a simple but generic access control system for a hyperfy v2 world. It should allow a VOID avatar who has one specific trait of VOIDs to enter one specific space in a hyperfy space (you can use eg my hosted hyperworld at https://hyperworld.host/. So build a kind of token gated access but now based on a specific NFT trait which enables the access.  to a bar, marketplace, whatever, within that world. Please do a public demo here on this discord server and explain how you build that and how it works.  With that demo You'd make many people here happy and end some annoying disputes. For you that would work as a marketing message and increase the probability to find customers here. For compensation I'd donate you all my 300k something hyper tokens as charity for common good.",

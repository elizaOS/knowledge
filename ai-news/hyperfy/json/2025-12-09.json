      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on finding and converting VRM avatar models, particularly of specific characters like Santa, Link, and Mario. Community members shared resources for obtaining these models, including toxsam's open source collection (opensourceavatars.com) and Vroid Hub. The discussion also touched on technical aspects of converting GLB format models to VRM, with suggestions about renaming rigging or using intermediate conversions through FBX and Mixamo. A specific Mario model was identified and shared. Additionally, there was a brief mention of \"Drifters\" models being optimized for VRM format soon.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Has anyone seen a VRM avatar of Santa, Link (Zelda), or Mario (Brothers)? (asked by CarTarL) A: There's a Santa VRM in toxsam's open source collection, and a Mario model on Vroid Hub (answered by Shiffty and hiroP)\nQ: I found a few that are in glb format.

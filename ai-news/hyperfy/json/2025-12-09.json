      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on finding and converting VRM avatar models, particularly for characters like Santa, Link, and Mario. Users shared resources for obtaining these models, including toxsam's open source collection and the Vroid Hub platform. The discussion also touched on technical approaches for converting GLB format models to VRM, with suggestions about renaming rigging or using intermediate conversions through FBX format and Mixamo. One user mentioned that for already rigged models, the Blender VRM plugin can be used to assign bones properly. Additionally, there was a brief mention of \"Drifters\" models being optimized and soon to be released.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Has anyone seen a VRM avatar of Santa, Link (Zelda), or Mario (Brothers)? (asked by CarTarL) A: There's a Santa VRM in toxsam's open source collection, and a Mario model on Vroid Hub (answered by Shiffty and hiroP)\nQ: I found a few that are in glb format. Would have to rename all the rigging to get into vrm? (asked by CarTarL) A: If it's already rigged, you just need to assign the bones with the blender VRM plugin (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\n\n## 3.

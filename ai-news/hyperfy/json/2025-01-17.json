Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy v2 development, with developers sharing progress, troubleshooting issues, and exploring new features. Key technical discussions include:\n\nDevelopers are actively working on porting functionality from v1 to v2, with significant progress on UI components, agent systems, and world interaction. Ashxn implemented a new in-world UI library using yoga, adding UI, UIView, and UIText components with documentation. MetaMike worked on MIDI and OSC integration for interactive experiences, successfully implementing MIDI message handling in apps.\n\nThe community is exploring hosting solutions, with Lastraum and HPrivakos offering hosted v2 worlds for testing. Several developers discussed implementing stake-to-play gaming mechanics, with proposals for racing games and competitive environments where players could stake tokens to participate and win rewards.\n\nDevelopers are working on agent systems to bring NPCs to life with conversation capabilities, with Ashxn implementing chat bubbles for agents and players. The transition from v1 to v2 includes challenges with model compatibility, as some GLB files that worked in v1 don't display properly in v2, particularly those with complex materials.\n\nThe community is actively documenting the new API and sharing code examples, with Saori and Ashxn providing guidance on script implementation and world interaction mechanics.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I add collision to objects in v2? (asked by jar0d) A: You can add collision via script or Blender right now. No-code comes later. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do apps communicate with each other? (asked by peezy) A: world.emit() lets you send events across apps on whatever client/server you are on. app.send() sends events from client to server or server to all clients just for the app. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to save models from another world? (asked by vincentskele) A: You can use the network tab, and they'll have a download button soon. (answered by MetaMike and Ashxn)\nQ: When v2 launch? (asked by locoblock) A: It's already out, available via git clone. (answered by maximus)\nQ: What's the best way to get started with v2? (asked by locoblock) A: Check the pinned post in general chat and the git repo in the channel. (answered by maximus)\nQ: How would one go about removing items in v2? (asked by ckbubbles) A: Hover and get the wheel, then there's a destroy option. (answered by Lastraum)\nQ: Why do some GLBs not display in Hyperfy when dragged in? (asked by Unchained Ninja | Art Unchained) A: Materials seem to be a trigger for issues. Some assets don't show up at all, some as a red box, and some do work. (answered by MetaMike)\nQ: Do I need to port over all my models and interactions from v1 to v2? (asked by ckbubbles) A: Yes, manual work is needed to recreate your v1 world in v2. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Are v1 worlds being turned off soon? (asked by hiroP) A: No set timeline established for v1. Team will give ample time to move/recreate. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Can I use import statements in scripts? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: No imports in scripts. If you want custom imports, you have to run it through world & app.js.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Hyperfy Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe chat primarily revolves around the Hyperfy token ($HYPER) experiencing significant price volatility, dropping over 50% during a market-wide liquidity drain caused by the launch of Trump's token ($TRUMP). Community members discussed several technical aspects of the Hyperfy platform, including:\n\nThe development team is working on importing functionality from v1 to v2 of the platform, with a focus on implementing AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) capabilities. Saori demonstrated a Solana integration for in-world scripting that took only 30 minutes to implement and would work with any blockchain. The platform is designed to be chain-agnostic, allowing for different forks per chain.\n\nBacchus outlined a vision for agentic societies within Hyperfy worlds, where AI agents would have independent objectives and incentives, creating dynamic environments with lasting consequences from user interactions. This could enable revenue-generating worlds through mechanisms like racing games where users stake tokens to participate.\n\nTechnical issues with the token were identified, including Jupiter Exchange verification problems (missing logo and verification), which Ashxn attempted to resolve by submitting verification requests. The community also discussed potential tokenomics models, including a staking mechanism where world creators launching their own tokens could allocate a percentage to HYPER stakers.\n\nDespite the price decline, developers continued active work on the platform, with visible GitHub activity and progress on in-world UI for agents and game mechanics.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Does hyper token have a planned utility? (asked by zombiekid12) A: It's being worked on according to MUDBONE, with current utility as the DAO token for treasury decisions.\nQ: How does a MEV sandwich attack work? (asked by Beats) A: Xeta explained it's when bots see transactions in the mempool and front-run them, sharing a link to mev.wiki explaining the attack.\nQ: How much hyper did world holders get for being a world holder? (asked by terranosaurusrx) A: QMA answered 151,200 per each hyperfy world NFT.\nQ: Are there any competitors to Hyperfy? (asked by PurpleSack) A: Uuuuuuuuu mentioned awe/oncyber as similar web-based metaverse platforms, though Ethereum-based.\nQ: Can we connect our sol wallets to hyperfy now? (asked by MUDBONE) A: Saori demonstrated Solana integration into in-world scripting that would work with any chain.\nQ: How much makes you a hyperflyer? (asked by Bacchus) A: jar0d answered that the threshold is 100k hyper tokens.\nQ: What is the actual circulating marketcap? (asked by logan) A: Uuuuuuuuu explained it's roughly half of what's shown on DEX screener, approximately 23m.\nQ: Why doesn't the token have a logo on Jupiter Exchange? (asked by Beats) A: Saori mentioned they submitted verification but were having issues with Jupiter's process.\n\n## 3.

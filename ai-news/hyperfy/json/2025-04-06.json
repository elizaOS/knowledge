      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around a new game being developed and tested on Hyperfy. Ash shared a link to \"fallen.hyperfy.xyz\" for initial testing of a combat game where \"everyone is a piñata.\" The game was available for a limited test session, with plans to add more content including rewards and cosmetics from kills. Users provided feedback on gameplay elements like rock height and drone mechanics. \n\nAsh also proposed several game concepts including a parkour game with $HYPER token mechanics where players could earn tokens at checkpoints and lose them when falling, with the lost tokens redistributed to chests. Another concept mentioned was a 1v1 staking arena similar to RuneScape. The discussion highlighted the importance of a \"deposit, play, withdraw\" flow for token-based games, with emphasis on making the implementation accessible to developers through abstraction and events.\n\nThe technical conversation touched on implementing payment mechanics, wallet connections, and out-of-bounds volumes. There was enthusiasm about the gaming direction on Hyperfy, with community members expressing interest in testing and providing feedback.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Have devs been working for Hyperfy without pay? (asked by Roone) A: Yes, but dev is full-time on Hyperfy now (answered by Knar)\nQ: Where did the random channel go? (asked by vox) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Wilson | Context: Wilson expressed that payment/wallet connect mechanics were beyond his abilities | Resolution: ash promised to make it \"easy mode\" by abstracting it away with apps and events\nHelper: 0mka | Helpee: Community | Context: Offered help with Hyperfy basics | Resolution: Shared a Discord event link for a session covering basics of working in a fresh world\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Solana integration with Hyperfy, inventory systems, and world storage capabilities. Ash shared a PR that adds world wallets and in-world currency functionality for Solana, emphasizing server-side transaction handling for security. A significant technical development is the implementation of permanent storage for worlds, allowing data persistence without size limits (though intended for stats rather than large files). \n\nThe developers discussed loading external models via URLs using `world.load('model', url)`, which converts models to nodes that can be manipulated in-world. This functionality extends to avatars with `load('avatar', url)`. CORS issues were addressed, with suggestions to implement a proxy through the engine server.\n\nA community member (~/drdoge.eth) showcased a custom backpack/inventory system they built entirely as an app with persistent storage. The implementation demonstrates how complex UI systems can be created within Hyperfy. Other technical discussions included multi-tenant setups for Hyperfy worlds and the possibility of loading content from external sources like Arweave or IPFS.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the Solana integration going to be part of the main codebase? (asked by 0mka) A: No, it's just a PR for reference, not to be merged (answered by ash)\nQ: What has been your best go-to for RPC on Solana for production? (asked by 0mka) A: Helius is beast mode (answered by ash)\nQ: Does world storage have a file size limit? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: No limits, although it's intended for stats and not large files (answered by ash)\nQ: Can we bypass CORS for services like Spotify? (asked by 0mka) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: smickelbeard | Context: Question about multi-tenant setup for Hyperfy | Resolution: Explained it should be possible with world folders and provided technical direction\nHelper: ash | Helpee: MiaHigashikata | Context: Issues with portal implementation | Resolution: Provided code example for loading models via URL and converting to nodes\nHelper: MiaHigashikata | Helpee: MiaHigashikata | Context: Portal functionality not working | Resolution: Fixed by adding collider.trigger=true and reversing the model\nHelper: ash | Helpee: peezy | Context: CORS issues when fetching external data | Resolution: Suggested implementing a proxy through the engine server\n\n## 4.

The only technical content involves general hyper mentioning difficulties with Coinbase's API, requiring multiple endpoints from three different APIs to retrieve transaction and deposit data. There's a brief exchange about how deposits work on the server, with Saori explaining it uses the Solana branch without a contract, just a server wallet. Saori mentions that hypkg mods provide boilerplate Solana/Ethereum API functionality. The conversation indicates that ash is building a game while Saori is developing a shooter game. Most of the chat focuses on market conditions, with members discussing HYPER token price resilience despite broader market downturns in both crypto and traditional stocks.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How does depositing to the server work here? Is it a smart contract associated with the server? (asked by shandy) A: I think it's using the Solana branch. No contract, just a server wallet. Ash can explain more though my shooter game is built slightly differently. (answered by Saori)\n\n## 3.

          "text": "The Hyperfy community has been actively developing and refining its ecosystem with a focus on blockchain integration, in-world mechanics, and immersive gameplay. A major technical milestone is the integration of Solana wallets and in-world currency, contributed by ashxn.eth via PR #87. This implementation handles all transaction logic server-side, ensuring secure and seamless wallet interactions without requiring Buffer polyfills or custom build targets. It supports the @solana/wallet-adapter and uses Helius as the preferred RPC provider.",

This system maintains user data across sessions and is currently monolithic, with plans to modularize it into two separate apps. The storage is optimized for small data like stats, not large files.",

To address CORS issues when fetching external resources, a Node.js proxy endpoint is recommended, and Cloudflare Workers can also be used for CORS control.",

Players are teleported back to the lobby if they leave the safe zone without a connected wallet or minimum token balance. A parkour game concept was introduced where players collect $HYPER tokens at checkpoints, with penalties for falling. A 1v1 staking arena was also proposed, requiring real-time wallet integration.",

Material linking issues were also addressed—developers must set mesh.linked = false to ensure unique materials per instance, and apply textureX/Y updates within app.on('update') for proper rendering.",

MCP simplifies integration with services like OpenAI and Anthropic by abstracting request/response formatting and enabling access to non-API resources such as databases and file systems.

      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the development and deployment of Hyperfy v2, a 3D virtual world platform. Ashxn announced that apps are executing in v2 local environments, potentially ahead of the estimated 2-week timeline. The discussion covers deployment methods on various platforms (Digital Ocean, WSL, Ubuntu), physics implementation, scripting capabilities, and app/blueprint architecture. Ashxn created a deployment guide for Digital Ocean and shared that v0.2.0 was released with mobile/touch controls. The conversation also touched on MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for AI assistance, local LLM support via Ollama, and various technical implementations like collision detection, rigidbodies, and app blueprints. Community members actively shared code snippets, troubleshooting tips, and documentation efforts, with hiroP creating a shared HackMD document for Hyperfy development notes.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the difference between apps and blueprints in v2? (asked by hiroP) A: Blueprints were called app configs but it was too nuanced in code. A blueprint is all the stuff needed to run an app, while an app is a single instance of a blueprint. When you edit an app, you're editing all instances with the same blueprint. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How does one set collision on an asset? (asked by MetaMike) A: In Blender, you need to set up custom properties. For dynamic collision objects, you need a rigidbody node with type=\"dynamic\" and a collider node with convex=true. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can I reset a world? (asked by MetaMike) A: Use \"rm -rf world\" or \"mv world world2\" to generate a new one and switch back if needed. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Has anyone done anything with model context protocol (mcp)? (asked by hiroP) A: Ashxn doesn't know enough about it but is willing to implement it once it's up. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do you pull up the menu shown in the Twitter post? (asked by Ricky) A: Quick right-click release opens menu. Right click and hold and drag locks pointer for camera movement. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Are we able to bring our agents into Hyperfy yet? (asked by CheddarQueso 🧀) A: Ashxn will push that to v1 today. It requires updating the eliza framework to add a new endpoint to the direct client. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can we build an MMO? (asked by SotoAlt) A: That's the default state - when spinning up a local host, users can log in from different browsers and move things live. (answered by maximus and MetaMike)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: MetaMike | Context: Setting up collision for meshes with multiple materials | Resolution: Explained that a dedicated collision mesh with no materials is needed because threejs splits meshes into multiple pieces (one per material), and for dynamic-to-dynamic collision, convex colliders are required.\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: hiroP | Context: Understanding the structure for dynamic collision objects in Blender | Resolution: Confirmed the correct structure and explained that mass should be left out until ratified as it does weird things at high mass.\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: m₂ | Context: Deployment issues on Alma Linux | Resolution: Suggested trying Ubuntu instead, which worked successfully for other users.\nHelper: vincentskele | Helpee: maximus | Context: VPS setup | Resolution: Shared a three-step process: do normal install, set env to domain, set up nginx with upload limits for GLB files.\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: Saori | Context: Traversing mesh objects | Resolution: Provided code snippet for traversing nodes and pushed it to dev branch.\nHelper: HPrivakos | Helpee: MetaMike | Context: Running on Windows | Resolution: Suggested using Docker on Windows and shared a working Dockerfile.\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Hyperfy Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about Hyperfy's DAO governance structure, token utility, and community building. A significant portion focuses on how to structure the DAO to avoid pitfalls experienced by other projects like Decentraland (DCL). Key participants, including team members Saori and Ash, engage with the community about balancing centralized leadership with decentralized governance.\n\nThe community discusses various governance models, with many favoring a \"benevolent dictator\" approach where the core team maintains significant control while allowing community input through a structured DAO. Specific proposals include a tiered bounty system for funding tasks with clear success criteria, retroactive rewards for valuable contributions, and mechanisms to prevent whale manipulation.\n\nTechnical discussions touch on the open-source nature of Hyperfy, the upcoming V2 release, and how token holders might influence development priorities without compromising the project's vision. The team is working on establishing a foundation for the DAO treasury and developing a strategy that balances funding community initiatives while maintaining token value.\n\nThe chat also includes discussions about the metaverse platform's features, including NFT authentication in-world, and the potential for community-built worlds where users can freely experiment with the technology.\n\n## 2.

Users debated the merits of different VRM export tools for Blender versus Unity, with some preferring the Blender-only approach while others noted Unity's UniVRM has better spring bone functionality. A model with problematic normals and excessive materials (19) was discussed as needing optimization. There was also mention of potential AI-to-Hyperfy pipelines, blendshapes for facial animation, and lip sync functionality in Hyperfy. Technical recommendations included specific GitHub repositories for VRM export tools, with TheMattEmpire sharing a newer Blender 4.2+ extension link. The conversation revealed a workflow tension between simplicity (Blender-only) versus functionality (Unity's better spring bone support).\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What's the best VRM exporting tool for Blender? (asked by MetaRick) A: Several options mentioned: VRM-Addon-for-Blender for Blender 3.6.1, newer extension for Blender 4.2+ at extensions.blender.org/add-ons/vrm/, and Mal's Blender VRM0 Utility for wiggle bones (answered by Ashxn, TheMattEmpire, and ᲼)\nQ: Does Hyperfy have lipsync functionality?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"🐞│issues\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThis chat primarily revolves around two main technical issues: (1) users experiencing difficulties claiming HYPER token airdrops on Solana, and (2) problems with the Hyperfy world builder interface. For the airdrop claims, several users reported signing transaction errors, particularly when using hardware wallets and SAFE multisig wallets. The airdrop claim period had ended, causing frustration for users who missed the deadline. Some users received help from moderators to resolve their claim issues. For the world builder, a user experienced problems with saving objects and connecting their wallet, which was eventually traced to Wallet Guard browser extension interference. The chat also included discussions about the airdrop distribution mechanism, with some users suggesting direct airdrops to Ethereum addresses would have been more effective than requiring users to register Solana addresses.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there any way to claim the airdrop after the deadline? (asked by DawnXue) A: No, but moderators started a list for missed claims that might be addressed through DAO voting later (answered by ash)\nQ: Why can't I sign the transaction with my hardware wallet? (asked by localhost) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why can't I sign with a SAFE multisig wallet? (asked by patabrava.eth) A: Unanswered\nQ: Where did the 80 million unclaimed tokens go? (asked by DawnXue) A: Unanswered directly, but implied they would be addressed through DAO governance (answered by ash)\nQ: Why wasn't the airdrop sent directly to Ethereum addresses? (asked by DawnXue) A: Unanswered directly, but Saori mentioned tax implications as one reason for claim-based airdrops\nQ: Why can't I see objects I place in my world? (asked by psy-sci) A: It was eventually determined to be caused by Wallet Guard browser extension (answered by psy-sci)\n\n## 3.

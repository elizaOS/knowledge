      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion centers around troubleshooting npm run dev errors in a Hyperfy development environment. TheMattEmpire encountered build failures related to missing dependencies (\"react-colorful\") and environment configuration issues. The solution involved two steps: running npm install to resolve dependency issues, and properly configuring the .env file based on the .env.example template. Ash clarified that world data is stored in a \"world\" folder created when running npm run dev, and that users can create and switch between multiple worlds using the WORLD environment variable (e.g., WORLD=world-2 npm run dev). The conversation highlights the importance of proper environment configuration and dependency management when working with the Hyperfy development environment.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Where is the data for the space actually saved? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: If you use `npm run dev` it creates/runs the `world` folder. You can have multiple world folders and switch between them by doing `WORLD=world-2 npm run dev` etc. (answered by ash)\nQ: Should I update NPM when getting deprecation notices? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Shiffty | Helpee: TheMattEmpire | Context: Build errors when running npm run dev | Resolution: Suggested running npm install and copying settings from .env.example\nHelper: ash | Helpee: TheMattEmpire | Context: \"Could not resolve react-colorful\" error | Resolution: Explained that a new dependency was added requiring npm install, and clarified how world data is stored and managed\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nTechnical: Copy settings from .env.example to .env file when encountering environment configuration errors | Mentioned By: Shiffty\nTechnical: Run npm install when encountering dependency resolution errors | Mentioned By: Shiffty and ash\nDocumentation: Document how world data is stored and how to switch between multiple worlds using WORLD environment variable | Mentioned By: ash",

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"âš¡â”‚general\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief discussion about a feature suggestion for a creative building tool. Reneil proposes the ability to view text prompts associated with objects when inspecting or moving them in build mode. This would allow users to see what prompts were used to generate specific objects, enabling them to learn from and remix others' creations. Ash acknowledges that prompt information is currently stored in the code but agrees this isn't ideal. The suggestion aims to improve collaboration and inspiration among users by making the creative process more transparent.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Would it be possible to attach the text prompt somewhere while drag and dropping stuff? (asked by Reneil) A: It's in the code for now, not ideal but a good start (answered by ash)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: untitled, xyz | Helpee: ash | Context: Clarifying what Reneil meant about attaching text prompts | Resolution: Explained that Reneil was suggesting the ability to inspect objects to see their generation prompts\n\n## 4. Action Items\nFeature: Attach generation text prompts to objects for viewing during inspection/movement in build mode | Description: Allow users to see what prompts were used to generate objects when inspecting them, enabling remixing and inspiration | Mentioned By: Reneil\nFeature: Make prompt sharing an optional setting that's on by default | Description: Especially useful in collaborative \"vibe together\" scenarios to help users get started | Mentioned By: Reneil",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around technical issues and feature requests in what appears to be a 3D virtual world development platform. A significant problem was identified and resolved regarding a freezing issue in \"doges world\" that was caused by a \"Spear\" object. There was discussion about Joint.js for creating dynamic doors with physics-based interactions. Other topics included a timer \"milkshake\" app, syncing objects between users, and UI improvements for the platform. Saori shared a GitHub repository link (mcp-hyperfy). The developers also discussed networking challenges with joints and rigidbodies, noting that these elements need special handling to maintain synchronization across users.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How do we set an object to be local or synced? Is there a way we could get this on a toggle for glbs? (asked by MetaRick) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there any way we can refresh the connection in world? (asked by MetaRick) A: Unanswered\nQ: Where to begin with Joint.js to make dynamic doors that open when walked into? (asked by ᲼) A: The base is there but out of date, and joints need to be networked in the app to keep them in sync (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: ~/HowiEDuhzit | Helpee: Ashxn | Context: Freezing issue in \"doges world\" where the game freezes on load until tab switching | Resolution: Identified and fixed the issue, which was related to \"the Spear\" object\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: ᲼ | Context: Questions about implementing Joint.js for dynamic doors | Resolution: Explained that joints need to be networked in the app to maintain synchronization, similar to dynamic rigidbodies\n\n## 4.

Ash mentioned that the Hyperfy engine has improved significantly, allowing them to focus on other development aspects. Gert-Jan Akerboom asked about sharing links to apps on the Hyperworld site, specifically wanting to create a tweet with a link to his apps page. Two users (mattimus and szjanko) provided solutions, explaining that Gert-Jan could either link to the marketplace apps page, create a collection, or share his storefront link. The chat also contained a question about cross-chain bridges from BNB to ETH and whether Hyperfy can be played online, but these questions remained unanswered. Most of the conversation consisted of greetings and non-technical exchanges.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: I want to know which is the official cross-chain bridge from bnb to eth? (asked by mike0927) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there a workaround to link to my apps page on the hyperworld site for a tweet? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: You can share your storefront link or create a collection (answered by szjanko)\nQ: Can I play hyperfy game online? (asked by Saber) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat segment shows minimal technical discussion and primarily contains market-related conversations about Hyperfy token trading. A user named \"general hyper\" dominates the conversation, discussing their trading volume (claiming over 7 million in Hyperfy volume) and market position (#2 on the 30-day chart). They suggest that \"value pricing\" will soon end and predict a price increase once liquidity returns to the market. The conversation indicates a relatively small market with limited liquidity where large trades could significantly impact price (\"dropping a nuke\"). No specific technical implementations or problem-solving discussions appear in this segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Hi all do you have if they will make more hyperfy? (asked by Chris Atherton) A: Are you asking if they can mint more Hyperfy? (answered by MUDBONE)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: MUDBONE | Helpee: Chris Atherton | Context: Unclear question about creating more Hyperfy tokens | Resolution: MUDBONE attempted to clarify the question but no further discussion followed\n\n## 4.

Summary\nThe discussion centers around performance issues in a 3D environment, specifically frame rate drops on an iPhone 16 Pro. MetaRick reported experiencing FPS drops in their world, initially suspecting it might be related to having too many assets or missing LODs (Level of Detail). Ash obtained a snapshot to investigate whether the issue stemmed from a third-party app or an engine problem. They noted that desktop performance remained stable while mobile showed degradation. MetaRick created a test case with a fresh world containing only optimized GLB files, which still exhibited frame rate drops from 60fps to around 48fps despite having no scripts. Ash tested the world on their phone and maintained 55fps after running it for about 10 minutes. Further testing by MetaRick revealed the issue appeared isolated to the iPhone 16 Pro, as performance on iPad was consistently at 60fps. The community member hyp shaman noted that a key difference between desktop and mobile is that mobile CPUs handle most processing tasks that GPUs would manage on desktop systems.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Could missing LODs be causing the performance issues? (asked by MetaRick) A: Inconclusive, but the issue appears to be device-specific to iPhone 16 Pro (answered by MetaRick)\nQ: Is the performance issue caused by rogue apps? (asked by ash) A: Likely not, as testing with only GLBs still showed performance drops (answered by MetaRick)\nQ: Could it be related to loading colliders into phone memory? (asked by MetaRick) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Action Items\nTechnical: Continue monitoring performance issues on iPhone 16 Pro | Description: Ash will test additional worlds to verify if the issue is widespread | Mentioned By: ash\nTechnical: Implement LODs for 3D assets | Description: MetaRick needs to add Level of Detail optimization to improve performance | Mentioned By: MetaRick",

Summary\nThe conversation centers around a video atlas/texture offset feature being developed by ash. vox initially proposed the concept of a remote control app that could change UV coordinates with clicks. ash confirmed this was feasible and demonstrated a working implementation that allows controlling multiple 16:9 videos arranged in a grid format within a single 16:9 container. The feature enables switching between different video segments by changing texture offsets. ash mentioned this functionality would be added to the core system and could be controlled via on-screen buttons, remote UI, or in-world remotes. vox expressed interest in creating video atlases for the community. The conversation also touched on whether duplicated instances could be individually controlled while maintaining instancing benefits. maximus reminded users to keep content safe for work and to use appropriate channels for discussions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are these 16:9 each? (asked by ash) A: Yes, 16 x 16:9 in a 16:9 format.. 16:9 maxi (answered by vox)\nQ: When we duplicate those in world can we address/control those individually? But they keep being instanced? (asked by vox) A: I think so (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

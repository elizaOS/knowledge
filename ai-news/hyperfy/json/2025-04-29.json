      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily discusses character controller customization using apps in Gather. A user (cru) inquires about creating an isometric character controller, and Ashxn responds with examples of player behavior modification through apps, specifically mentioning how developers have used player.applyEffect({ emote }) to switch between emotes in projects like pew.bet and coliseum world. Ashxn notes that while world building, interaction emotes, and apps as collectables in third-person worlds are well-supported, first-person, isometric, and top-down perspectives aren't as flexible yet. \n\nThere's also discussion about UI development, with 0mka mentioning they're maintaining their own fork with side tabs based on previous discussions. Later, hypb0gie introduces an idea about \"equipable skinned meshes\" that would allow attaching apps to player character bones (like watches, belts, or backpacks) while keeping hands free, similar to how PVP swords attach to hand bones. The chat concludes with positive feedback about a new UI implementation.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How to create an isometric character controller using apps? (asked by cru) A: While not directly answering the isometric question, Ashxn explained that developers have modified player behavior using player.applyEffect({ emote }) for custom animations, but notes that isometric views aren't as flexible as third-person implementations (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Thoughts on equipable skinned meshes? (asked by hypb0gie) A: Ashxn seemed to agree it should be possible but didn't provide specific implementation details (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: cru | Context: Creating an isometric character controller using apps | Resolution: Provided examples of player behavior modification through emotes in pew.bet and coliseum world, but noted limitations for isometric views\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: hypb0gie | Context: Understanding feasibility of equipable skinned meshes | Resolution: Confirmed the concept should be possible to implement\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nFeature: Improve support for non-standard camera perspectives (isometric, first-person, top-down) | Description: Current implementation focuses on third-person worlds but lacks flexibility for other perspectives | Mentioned By: Ashxn\nFeature: Implement equipable skinned meshes | Description: Allow attaching apps to player character bones (watches, belts, backpacks) while keeping hands free | Mentioned By: hypb0gie",

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"⚡│general\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. The conversation primarily revolves around ideas for games that could be built in Hyperfy, such as a survival game or a \"floating coliseum\" where players avoid being knocked off by a gorilla. There's a brief exchange about mobile-optimized worlds, where a user asks for recommendations of reliably performant sites to demonstrate to newcomers. Another user responds by sharing their website (roustan.xyz) and mentioning they have two v1 mobile worlds (/pool and /roustan). The conversation confirms that v1 is still viable for mobile optimization.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Doesn't anyone have any mobile optimized worlds? Looking to link normies to a reliably performant site so they can see a world in action (asked by maximus) A: I do have two v1 mobile worlds /pool and /roustan (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 | Helpee: maximus | Context: Looking for mobile-optimized worlds to demonstrate to newcomers | Resolution: Shared personal website (roustan.xyz) and mentioned two v1 mobile worlds (/pool and /roustan)\n\n## 4. Action Items\nFeature: Create a demo world with gorilla assets where players try to survive or avoid being knocked off a floating coliseum | Mentioned By: anon\nFeature: Improve mobile optimization for v2 worlds | Mentioned By: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓",

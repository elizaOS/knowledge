      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on building and editing capabilities in Hyperfy, with a significant emphasis on multi-select functionality. TheMattEmpire initiated a detailed conversation about the limitations of single-asset selection when building modular structures in-world, suggesting both short-term improvements (selection shader, shift-multiselect) and long-term solutions (world outliner similar to Blender). This sparked a discussion with Gert-Jan Akerboom about workflow preferences between building in Blender versus directly in Hyperfy, with TheMattEmpire advocating for improved in-world building tools to enable collaborative construction. \n\nThe conversation also covered world hosting options, with mentions of fly.io and hyperworld.host as potential solutions for deploying spaces with user limits. HiroP inquired about crypto wallet integration in v2, to which ash pointed to an existing solana-v2 branch that needs rebasing. Technical workarounds were discussed for creating multiple local development worlds by modifying the .env file. Gert-Jan Akerboom suggested using collection instances in Blender as a potential workaround for the multi-select limitation in Hyperfy.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to select more than one asset at a time in Hyperfy? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Currently not possible, and no definite timeline for implementation (answered by ash)\nQ: What's the status with crypto wallet integration in v2? (asked by hiroP) A: There's a solana-v2 branch that needs a rebase, which is what the Fallen world uses (answered by ash)\nQ: How do I create an experimental world? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Change the WORLD variable in the .env file and run npm run dev (answered by Shiffty)\nQ: If I update a model in a building made with linked duplicates in Blender, will it update assets in both buildings or the entire building? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy's \"vibe world\" (vibe.hyperfy.xyz), a platform where users can create 3D objects and environments using AI prompts. Users discussed various technical aspects of the platform, including how to extract GLB files from .hyp files, how to navigate the vibe world interface, and how to create and modify objects using simple commands like \"/create\" and \"/edit\". Several users shared their creations, including a rideable roller coaster and a drone swarm with shape-changing capabilities. The community expressed amazement at how quickly and easily complex objects could be created compared to other platforms like Decentraland. Users also discussed the importance of saving creations as .hyp files to prevent loss. Toward the end of the chat, users reported that the vibe world stopped generating new objects, possibly due to someone prompting a particle accelerator or black hole.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When you download an asset, like a .hyp file... is there any way to extract the GLB from within it? (asked by web-gnar) A: Hyp is just a glb with a text metadata in it. You should be able to change file format from .hpy to .glb and should work fine. Alternatively, shift+click the model button in the app details to download the current glb. (answered by maximus and ash)\nQ: Why hyperfy twitter link show hyperfy.xyz instead of hyperfy.io? (asked by stealthlee4) A: hyperfy.io is the old (classic) platform, hyperfy.xyz is our next-gen tech. (answered by ash)\nQ: How long does it take to build something like this in Decentraland? (asked by vox) A: It takes a LOOOOT longer to build that in Decentraland, like days sometimes weeks. (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\nQ: What does this mean [referring to an error]? (asked by web-gnar) A: Grok made a boo boo. There's an error somewhere in the script. You can typically check the browser console to see what the error was. (answered by Shiffty)\nQ: Is there a CA address for Hyperfy? (asked by Brdmc3) A: [Link to Discord message provided] (answered by ash)\nQ: What's the vibe world address? (asked by Wilson) A: https://vibe.hyperfy.xyz/ (answered by Valiant)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of 🐞│issues Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment focuses on two main technical issues faced by user Kz. First, Kz was experiencing performance problems due to high graphics requirements in their Hyperfy project and sought ways to reduce graphics settings. Second, Kz needed to implement admin controls to prevent other users from editing their world. The discussion revealed that admin functionality in Hyperfy requires setting an ADMIN_CODE in the .env configuration file, after which admins can be designated using the `/admin <code>` command. By default, all users have admin privileges unless this code is set. The conversation also touched on accessing admin menus through the tab key and optimizing assets for better performance. Kz mentioned their project is intended for VR use, indicating future development needs.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do we have option to reduce graphic? (asked by Kz) A: Best to optimize assets (answered by Valiant)\nQ: How can I set an admin? Because my world is open and every people can edit (asked by Kz) A: Set your .env ADMIN_CODE, then type \"/admin <code>\" in chat to become admin (answered by ash)\nQ: If I turn it off can other user turn it on? (asked by Kz) A: Only admin (answered by Valiant)\nQ: What is minimum requirement to run hyperfy smoothly? (asked by Kz) A: By default it runs on nothing, it all just depends what you put in the world (answered by ash)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Valiant | Helpee: Kz | Context: Needed to access admin controls | Resolution: Suggested using tab key to bring up admin menu\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Kz | Context: Needed to set up admin privileges | Resolution: Explained the need to set ADMIN_CODE in .env file and use \"/admin <code>\" command\nHelper: Valiant | Helpee: Kz | Context: Concerned about users changing build settings | Resolution: Clarified that only admins can change these settings\n\n## 4.

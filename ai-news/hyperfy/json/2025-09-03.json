      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on improving Hyperfy's world-building capabilities. TheMattEmpire initiated a detailed conversation about the limitations of the current asset selection system, specifically the inability to select multiple assets simultaneously. He shared screenshots of a modular building he created in Hyperfy and explained how the current workflow is inefficient for building complex structures. He proposed both short-term improvements (selection shader, multi-select with shift, gizmo editing for multiple assets) and long-term suggestions (implementing a world outliner similar to Blender or Unity). \n\nThe conversation evolved into comparing in-world building versus external tools like Blender, with TheMattEmpire advocating for robust in-world building capabilities that would enable collaborative construction. Gert-Jan Akerboom agreed with the need for improvements but noted that Blender currently offers superior functionality for modular building.\n\nLater, the discussion shifted to world hosting options, with participants sharing information about free hosting through fly.io and paid options through hyperworld.host. Valiant and HypPrivakos provided information about hosting limitations and options.\n\nSeparately, hiroP inquired about crypto wallet integration in v2, and ash mentioned an existing solana-v2 branch that needs rebasing, which hiroP found useful for his implementation plans.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to select more than one asset at the moment? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Unanswered\nQ: What's the status with crypto wallet integration in v2? (asked by hiroP) A: There's a solana-v2 branch but it needs a rebase. That's what the Fallen world uses. (answered by ash)\nQ: Can I visit this world or is it local? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Local for now, I do intend on looking at the tutorial Houston released about the free hosting. (answered by TheMattEmpire)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy's \"vibe world\" functionality, which allows users to create 3D content using AI. Users discussed the ease of creating complex objects through natural language prompts compared to other platforms like Decentraland. Key technical discussions included methods for extracting GLB files from HYP files, navigating the vibe world interface (using Tab and right-click), and the distinction between hyperfy.io (classic platform) and hyperfy.xyz (next-gen tech). Users shared creations including a rideable roller coaster and other AI-generated objects. The community highlighted how Hyperfy enables anyone to become a creator without technical expertise, simply by using natural language prompts and conceptual ideas. There was also discussion about potential collaborative themed worlds and the advantage of Hyperfy's single-tab workflow compared to other platforms that require switching between multiple applications.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When you download an asset, like a .hyp file... is there any way to extract the GLB from within it? (asked by web-gnar) A: Hyp is just a glb with a text metadata in it. You should be able to change file format from .hpy to .glb and should work fine (answered by maximus)\nQ: How do I download the current GLB? (asked by web-gnar) A: Shift+click the model button (cube button) in the app details (answered by ash)\nQ: How do I navigate in vibe.hyperfy? (asked by web-gnar) A: Hit tab, then right click something (answered by ash)\nQ: Why does Hyperfy Twitter link show hyperfy.xyz instead of hyperfy.io? (asked by stealthlee4) A: Hyperfy.io is the old (classic) platform, hyperfy.xyz is our next-gen tech (answered by ash)\nQ: What does the error message mean? (asked by web-gnar) A: There's an error somewhere in the script. You can typically check the browser console to see what the error was. (answered by Shiffty)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: maximus | Helpee: web-gnar | Context: Extracting GLB from HYP file | Resolution: Explained that HYP is just a GLB with text metadata and changing the file extension should work\nHelper: ash | Helpee: web-gnar | Context: Downloading current GLB from an asset | Resolution: Instructed to shift+click the model button in app details\nHelper: ash | Helpee: web-gnar | Context: Navigation in vibe.hyperfy | Resolution: Explained to hit tab then right-click objects\nHelper: Shiffty | Helpee: web-gnar | Context: Understanding script error message | Resolution: Explained it's a script error and suggested checking browser console\nHelper: Dhin | Helpee: self/community | Context: Players slipping out of game cube without reset option | Resolution: Added a switch outside the game to solve the issue\n\n## 4.

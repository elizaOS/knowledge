      "summary": "# Analysis of \"💻│developers\" Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around Hyperfy's plugin system, mod interoperability, and development tools. A significant breakthrough is the integration of MCP (Model-Code-Prompt) with Cursor, allowing live code updates in Hyperfy worlds. This enables developers to modify app scripts on the fly without reloading. The chat also covers physics improvements with the addition of rigidbody force methods, enabling more interactive applications like ball physics for games. There's extensive discussion about Hyperfy's marketing and communication challenges, with users noting difficulties in clearly understanding what Hyperfy is (game engine, platform, etc.) and finding proper documentation. The community debates how to better position Hyperfy for different user personas, from developers to creators. Technical implementations shared include authentication systems, player controllers, and physics-based applications like a ball camera for golf/bowling games.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does the new plugin system differ from directly modifying app and world? (asked by peezy) A: It uses an inject method instead of directly modifying components (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can we add forces to rigidbodies? (asked by Shiffty) A: Yes, rigidbody.addForce(force: Vector3) and rigidbody.addTorque(force: Vector3) are live, with rigidbody.addForceAtPos(force, pos) coming for vehicles (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Does the \"one light is best\" guideline include the world sun? (asked by ᲼) A: Yes, but two lights won't make a huge difference (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How does the MCP on cursor work? (asked by Ashxn) A: It adds MCP to the server with tools for querying the database and changing entity scripts (answered by peezy)\nQ: Does first person mode work in v2? (asked by Gooey) A: Yes, it can be set up for the player or on an app (answered by drdoge.eth)\nQ: Does anybody have a good example of a hyp script that directly transforms VRM bones or armatures? (asked by Mugenomics) A: Apps are for building objects for worlds; without modifying the core you can only apply animations to players (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Has anyone thought about scene management in hyperfy? (asked by bear) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of ⚡│general Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around users seeking help with Hyperfy's development platform, particularly regarding its technical capabilities and limitations. A user named \"treed\" asked several questions about implementing Three.js code in Hyperfy, revealing that while Hyperfy is built on Three.js, not all Three.js functionality is fully exposed yet. Peezy explained that users typically drag and drop GLB models and then add code to them, with some Three.js primitives like Vector3 being available but not all Three.js objects. The conversation highlighted that AI integration is a significant focus for Hyperfy, with multiple resources available. There was also brief discussion about Hytopia (formerly NFT Worlds) as a potential competitor to Hyperfy. The chat showed some tension when treed felt ignored after asking technical questions in the general channel rather than the dedicated help channels.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is this ok that I don't see apps? (asked by treed) A: You have to make apps. Worlds don't come with any preinstalled. (answered by ᲼)\nQ: In v2, seems like there is no option to additionally make a glb a collider? (asked by treed) A: Unanswered\nQ: Are there any plans to integrate AI here? (asked by early) A: Yes, there are several AI initiatives with resources available at hyperfy.how/guides/coding/ai/ and hyperfy.how/guides/ai/agents/ (answered by Omka)\nQ: Is hytopia a competitor to hyperfy? (asked by johan) A: Yes, they're building something like Minecraft without licensing issues with a Roblox spin. They were formerly NFT Worlds. (answered by Ashxn and bear)\nQ: How do I create a world so I can create own stuff? (asked by Terry) A: Check out hyperfy.how (answered by bear)\n\n## 3.

Ash made updates to padding and margin on UI components, allowing for better image fitting on pyramid shapes. Omka shared a design with a proximity trigger that could be enhanced with UI images. Ash also fixed an issue in the latest dev branch and implemented a water effect by scrolling diffuse and normal textures. The water implementation was shared with code that updates the textureX and textureY properties on each frame update. There was also confirmation that the application runs on iPhone 12 and should work on newer hardware like Snapdragon XR2 (Quest 3), though there was a mention of VR button functionality issues.\n\n## 2.

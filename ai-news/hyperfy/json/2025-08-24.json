Mattimus asked about changing animation states for models, and Shiffty responded with a link to a previous discussion. Cru introduced WebTransport, describing it as \"a bit more like UDP but for web browsers\" and suggesting it might be better for realtime applications, though noting it's immature technology. Cru expressed interest in experimenting with WebTransport and potentially creating a refactor.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can someone help point me to the docs or a hyp example about changing the animation state for a model?

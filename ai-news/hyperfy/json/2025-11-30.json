      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"🤖│agents\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief discussion about AI agents in virtual worlds, specifically focusing on examples of live agents in .xyz worlds or .hyp environments. Fibelius inquires about examples like one created by drdoge months ago, expressing interest in agentic AI beyond simple applications like trading, shooting games, or basic emoji reactions. They criticize what they perceive as the community's focus on development details and simplistic NPC behaviors. In response, .hyp shaman clarifies the distinction between basic NPCs in play.hyperfy and more advanced agent implementations like \"Eliza in hyperfy,\" which allows characters to interact with the platform in more sophisticated ways, offering to answer further questions about this technology.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does anyone know some .xyz worlds or .hyp examples with live agents? (asked by Fibelius) A: Agent12 suggested that @297290503181959169 would probably be the best bet for a Running Agent.\nQ: Is the agent example made by drdoge some months ago still live? (asked by Fibelius) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on licensing concerns related to Hyperfy's GPLv3 license and its implications for app development. Ozymandias raised questions about whether apps built on Hyperfy would be subject to GPLv3 requirements, expressing concern about protecting trade secrets while contributing to the platform. HypPrivakos and ash clarified that apps are separate from the codebase and not subject to the license, comparing it to how Windows apps can be proprietary despite running on Windows. 3rdEyeVisuals provided detailed explanations about GPL licensing, noting that while selling GPL software is permitted, source code must be provided. The conversation explored the \"SaaS loophole\" where GPL only triggers when distributing software, not when running services. A key technical solution discussed was keeping proprietary logic on the backend server while only sending minimal UI and rendering code to the browser, thus protecting trade secrets while complying with licensing requirements. Ozymandias mentioned creating a PR and an issue for tracking code changes, acknowledging Hyperfy's issue template.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does the GPLv3 license apply to apps built on Hyperfy? (asked by Ozymandias) A: No, apps are not part of the codebase, so the license doesn't apply to them. (answered by ash and HypPrivakos)\nQ: Can you sell GPL software? (implied by Ozymandias) A: Yes, you can sell GPL software at any price, but you must provide source code, include the GPL license, and allow recipients the same freedoms. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\nQ: Does GPLv3 require sharing code when running it as a service? (implied in discussion) A: No, GPLv3 only triggers when you distribute the software, not when running it as a service. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\nQ: When a scene app interacts with Hyperfy engine, does it create a \"single derivative work\" under GPL? (asked by Ozymandias) A: Unanswered definitively, though ash maintained apps can be proprietary and monetized.\nQ: How can developers protect their proprietary code while using Hyperfy? (implied by Ozymandias) A: Keep logic on the backend server and only send minimal UI and rendering code to the browser. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\n\n## 3.

They encountered a build error related to esbuild service being stopped on Node.js v22.11.0. The user mentioned that the process used to be simpler in the past with NFT integration. During the conversation, CarTarL also had to deal with a spam/scam attempt from another user trying to redirect them to an external server. No resolution to the technical issue was reached within this chat segment, though another user (.hyp shaman) asked if they had tried running it locally or watched Roustan's beginner guide video.\n\n## 2.

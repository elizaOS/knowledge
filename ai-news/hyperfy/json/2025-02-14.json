      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"💻│developers\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around Hyperfy development, focusing on performance optimization, app development, and upcoming features. Ashxn introduced a new performance tracking tool that displays metrics like instances, geometries, triangles, and texture memory, helping developers identify optimization opportunities. Several developers worked on creating mountable objects like bikes, with discussions about player control APIs and teleportation. There were technical conversations about draw calls, materials, and mesh optimization, with Ashxn sharing how they reduced CPU usage from 20ms to 6ms and GPU usage from 50ms to 38ms in the play world. Developers also discussed the possibility of multi-script apps, spawning apps from other apps, and creating a compass/navigation system. Saori and others discussed future development direction, suggesting a focus on combat mechanics to attract more users beyond the current builder community. The chat also touched on VRM implementation, physics for GLBs, and the potential for a Hyperfy mascot.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I set collision on Hyperfy V2?

User drdoge.eth reported successfully implementing an agent in a \"rover/collectron\" system, which appears to be a significant technical achievement. There's mention of a forthcoming \"capsule controller\" by Ashxn. Maximus highlighted the potential of this technology to transform how humans interact with virtual environments, specifically noting how RTS (Real-Time Strategy) games could be revolutionized by allowing users to express intentions that AI agents then execute. The conversation briefly touched on Fleek.xyz/eliza as a potential platform, with Saori mentioning they've been in discussions with Fleek, possibly about agent deployment. Drdoge.eth mentioned a technical breakthrough in their implementation where they configured the AI to use preset phrases for command tasks while leveraging AI capabilities for other interactions.\n\n## 2.

A home building contest recently concluded, with Ashxn mentioning they took a snapshot of the world. There were discussions about organizing documentation, with Omka noting they've been consolidating resources at hyperfy.how. Technical discussions included random disconnects on the play world due to a 60-second idle timeout, internationalization (i18n) being added to hyperfy.how, and development workflow questions about how features move from dev branch to main branch. Ashxn explained that features are built on the dev branch and pushed to main once considered stable. There was also discussion about spatial reasoning in virtual environments, with treed sharing academic research on using metaverse experiences for teaching spatial reasoning. Akuma demonstrated PS5 controller working in Hyperfy on Solana Mobile with a browser extension, though camera angles weren't properly mapped.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on technical discussions around 3D modeling, optimization, and Hyperfy platform capabilities. Key technical highlights include:\n\n~/HowiEDuhzit announced and released an update to Hyperfy Tools with LOD support, allowing meshes named in the format \"objectLOD0\", \"objLOD1\", etc. to function as LODs, and \"objCOL\" as custom colliders. He also created a Hyperfy theme for Blender and a default startup file that includes Hyperfy's default terrain and HDR for better in-world previewing.\n\nTheMattEmpire discussed VRM avatar creation, rigging best practices, and topology considerations. He emphasized the importance of edge loops for proper animation and offered to share his base model as a template. The conversation explored optimization techniques including LODs, with observations about how different LOD configurations affect visual quality at various distances.\n\nSeveral discussions centered around asset organization in Hyperfy, including questions about grouping/parenting objects, standardizing \"sockets\" or attachment points for wearables and weapons, and best practices for rotation and snap points. The potential for creating highly optimized spaces through proper LOD implementation, instancing, and material combination was highlighted, with TheMattEmpire noting that LODs add minimal file size overhead (20-50kb) while significantly improving performance.\n\nSaori mentioned a project related to combining VRMs, seeking collaborators with Character Creator Studio experience. Other topics included GLB animation support (currently unavailable in v2), physical keyrings with NFC tags as \"keys\" to Hyperfy worlds, and automated day/night cycles.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can we group apps together yet, like anchoring objects to each other so they move together? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: TheMattEmpire suggested parenting in the modeling software, but noted \"ATM I think it's one glb, one asset...kind of thing.\"\nQ: Do assets auto disappear if they have no LODs or do they have to have an LOD to do that? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Unanswered\nQ: Do LODs can switch Casting and receiving shadow? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Unanswered\nQ: Should the rotation of an asset such as a road be from the centre, or from the corner? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Ashxn responded \"i would assume the center center.\"\nQ: Why are GLB animations not showing up in world? (asked by fractilians) A: Saori explained \"v2 doesnt support glb animations yet\"\n\n## 3.

Community members share methods for deploying Hyperfy, primarily using fly.io as a hosting solution. The process involves cloning Hyperfy, adding a fly.toml configuration file, creating a fly.io account, and running deployment commands. Users discuss alternative hosting approaches including VPS with Cloud Panel and shared servers with Node.js. The conversation also touches on hardware considerations for self-hosting, with interest in the Turing Pi RK1 compute module that includes NPU capabilities for AI processing.

Users suggest implementing outlines around objects to make them more distinguishable when they align closely with other assets. .hyp shaman proposes that outlines could showcase brand gradients and be customizable in color. They suggest technical implementations including using the lowest LOD (Level of Detail) or collision frame buffer to create outlines without significant performance impact. TheMattEmpire agrees that outlines would improve usability and suggests an alternative approach of tinting or inverting textures on rollover in build mode, though acknowledging this wouldn't work well for pink/black assets. The conversation represents a focused technical discussion on improving user experience through visual feedback mechanisms with consideration for performance implications.\n\n## 2.

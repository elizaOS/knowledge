      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on network performance issues in Hyperfy, particularly regarding avatar movement and multiplayer responsiveness. Ashxn implemented changes to the smoothing algorithm to address avatar jitter issues reported by cru. They discussed network tick rates, with cru experimenting with a rate of 1/24 which improved responsiveness but increased network data transfer threefold. There was also discussion about WebSocket limitations in Hyperfy, with Gh0sTt expressing frustration about not being able to establish secondary WebSocket connections from an app, which would be useful for AI interactions and games. Ashxn explained this would require forking the engine, which would break interoperability. The HyperCloud game/world was briefly mentioned with some users playing it together.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does the one that affects the stats have changing colors at all? (asked by ~/drdoge.eth) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is multiplayer lag in Hyperfy a limitation of websockets or are there settings to improve performance? (asked by cru) A: It's related to the smoothing algorithm, which was updated to improve performance (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can I set up a secondary websocket connection from an app? (asked by Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘) A: Not without a forked engine, it's not supported yet and would break interoperability (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can't play in the play world anymore? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Free build was turned off but it's back on now (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

Fibelius inquired about minimum Mac specifications for learning v2 (likely referring to a 3D design software), considering purchasing a basic $1K refurbished MacBook. Ashxn responded with a performance testing approach, suggesting using an iPhone 12 Pro as a benchmark device - if content runs well there, it should be acceptable on most devices. Ashxn also shared a link to a well-optimized world on Hyperfy as an example. Valiant shared a link to what appears to be a Tencent Hunyuan post, but with minimal context about its relevance to 3D design.",

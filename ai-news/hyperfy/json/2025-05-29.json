      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on mobile device sensitivity issues in Hyperfy v1 and v2. User carlosmu reported that camera and movement controls on mobile are too sensitive, making navigation difficult for average users. While v1 has limited customization options, v2 offers more flexibility but requires modifying source code. The conversation touched on implementation differences between v1 and v2, with suggestions to examine ClientControls.js for sensitivity adjustments. There was also brief mention of Jup swap integration coming soon, and discussion about using HyperWorld.Host as a deployment platform. Users clarified that HyperWorld.Host allows updating worlds to the latest version through the dashboard settings, though it currently lacks direct world upload functionality.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there a way to reduce camera and steps sensitivity on mobile devices in v1? (asked by carlosmu) A: Not in v1, but possible in v2 with modifications (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can I modify mobile sensitivity in v2? (asked by carlosmu) A: Check ClientControls.js in hyperfy/src/core/systems/ClientControls.js (answered by á²¼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\nQ: How to use hyperfy editor in hyperworld.host? (asked by carlosmu) A: Enter /admin XXXX where XXXX is the password (answered by maximus)\nQ: Can I build on the latest version in localhost and then upload to hyperworld.host? (asked by carlosmu) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ§Šâ”‚3d-design\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion centers around a technical limitation in Hyperfy where large 3D models are being clipped by the skybox. Mugenomics encountered this issue while working with a massive 1600m-long spaceship model, where portions beyond approximately 1000m were disappearing. Community members identified that the skybox in Hyperfy is a sphere with a 1km radius that moves with the player, causing anything beyond that distance to be clipped. Temporary workarounds suggested included using fog effects to mask the clipping. Ashxn provided technical clarification about the skybox implementation and mentioned future plans to make the sky customizable as an app.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there any way to increase the draw distance? (asked by Mugenomics) A: The skybox is a sphere with 1km radius that moves with the player, causing clipping beyond that distance. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Could the skybox be clipping large models? (asked by Mugenomics) A: Yes, the sky is a sphere with 1km radius. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to scale up the skybox geometry with a hyp script? (asked by Mugenomics) A: Unanswered, but Ashxn mentioned plans to make the sky an app for customization.\n\n## 3.

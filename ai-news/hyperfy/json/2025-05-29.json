      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on mobile device controls in Hyperfy, specifically sensitivity issues. User carlosmu raised concerns about camera and movement sensitivity being too high on mobile devices in both Hyperfy v1 and v2, making navigation difficult for average users. Several community members provided insights on the limitations of v1 (where core code cannot be modified) versus the greater flexibility in v2. \n\nTechnical discussions included suggestions to examine ClientControls.js in the source code for potential modifications. There was also mention of hyperworld.host as a hosting platform, with information about updating worlds to the latest version through the dashboard. The conversation touched on the differences between v1 and v2 regarding asset implementation, noting that v2 requires more setup for .glb files, potentially using Blender for custom properties.\n\nAdditional topics included brief mentions of in-world swap functionality, hyperportals for teleportation within worlds, and mobile compatibility testing, with user Valiant confirming successful tests on iPhone 12.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to reduce camera and steps sensitivity on mobile devices in Hyperfy v1? (asked by carlosmu) A: Not in v1, but it's possible in v2 though it requires modifying the code (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can I use the Hyperfy editor in hyperworld.host? (asked by carlosmu) A: You need to enter /admin XXXX with the password (answered by maximus)\nQ: Can I build on the latest version in localhost and then upload that to hyperworld.host? (asked by carlosmu) A: You can update your world through the dashboard by selecting your branch (answered by szjanko - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: Is there an updated version of the hyperportal hyp file that lets you teleport around inside your world? (asked by Mugenomics) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on a technical limitation in Hyperfy regarding the rendering distance of large 3D models. Mugenomics encountered an issue where parts of a massive spaceship model (approximately 1600m long) were being clipped at around 1000m distance. After initial troubleshooting, it was determined that this was not a Level of Detail (LOD) issue as Mugenomics had set the LOD to 10,000 in Blender. Instead, the problem was identified as a limitation of the skybox, which has a radius of approximately 1km and moves with the player. This causes any objects beyond that distance to be clipped. Ashxn confirmed this technical limitation and mentioned future plans to make the sky customizable as an app. As a temporary workaround, Shiffty suggested using fog effects to mask the clipping issue, particularly near the horizon.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there any way to increase the draw distance? (asked by Mugenomics) A: The skybox has a 1km radius and moves with the player, causing clipping beyond that distance. Future plans include making the sky an app for customization. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Could it be a LOD (level of detail) issue with the model? (asked by maximus) A: No, the LOD is set to 10,000 in Blender, and only portions of the model disappear rather than the whole model. (answered by Mugenomics)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe announcement shared by user \"ash\" details the release of version 0.13.0 of what appears to be a virtual world or metaverse platform. The update includes significant technical improvements across core functionality and applications. Key technical additions include a new loading screen with world image settings, Open Graph tag support, VR controller interaction improvements, and experimental terrain support using splatmaps. The update also optimizes performance by reducing shadow quality on mobile/VR devices, improving VR billboarding for more natural appearance, and setting VR target framerate to 72Hz. User interface changes include toggling all UI with the Z key and updated action button UI. For developers, the update provides new functionality like control.hideReticle() for vehicles and improved mesh visibility handling where mesh.visible now disables rendering while maintaining raycast capability. The Docker image size was reduced through multi-stage builds, and various fixes were implemented including support for smaller VRM avatars.\n\n## 2.

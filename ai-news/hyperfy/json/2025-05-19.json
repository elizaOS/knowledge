      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe developers discussed several technical topics related to Hyperfy development. Key discussions included player behavior modification through `applyEffect` and `app.control()` methods, IDE scripting with auto-reload functionality shared by peezy, and device-specific optimizations. Peezy demonstrated a file watcher for script files that removes hashing steps and adds a new global event. Ashxn mentioned improvements to animations by unlocking local player animations while only throttling remote player animation framerates. \n\nDevice detection was a significant topic, with discussions about detecting mobile devices and adapting content accordingly. Ashxn implemented a fix for touch detection on iOS devices running as fullscreen apps. There was also discussion about using LOD (Level of Detail) mechanics for device-specific optimizations, including the possibility of billboard nodes that always face the camera.\n\nGert-Jan Akerboom shared progress on mesh cloning along curves (similar to Blender's curve modifier), enabling procedural plant generation. Lastraum discussed the Forge service, which uses Colyseus for multiplayer functionality, and resolved a UI interaction issue where pointer events weren't triggering properly.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Will there be a way for a hyp app to modify player behavior, like injecting camera logic? (asked by Cybernetic-O-Cult) A: applyEffect and app.control() might do what you need already within an app (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there an example template for building a full game like the Fallen crypto game? (asked by Cybernetic-O-Cult) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is scripting from IDE with auto script reloading possible? (asked by peezy) A: Peezy shared his own implementation at https://github.com/peezy/hyperfy/tree/ide-scripting (answered by peezy)\nQ: Did something happen to animations? They look more fluid. (asked by peezy) A: Yes, Ashxn unlocked local player animations, now only remote players throttle animation framerate (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

GonzaLord inquires about circulating supply and token utility, noting that the website documentation lacks token information. Ashxn provides a link to token.hyperfy.xyz and clarifies the token distribution: 30% for DAO in multi-sig (untouched), 35% to v1 world holders and ai16z partners (with ~10% unclaimed), 15% to Founders (linear vested, untouched), and the rest in liquidity pools. Ashxn explains that Dexscreener calculates market cap based on circulating supply, which excludes DAO, unclaimed, and founder tokens, but doesn't account for vesting status. When GonzaLord expresses concern about potential sell pressure from team unlocks, Ashxn confirms that no team members have sold their tokens. The chat also briefly mentions positive price action, with participants noting upward momentum potentially related to a tweet from \"Shaw\" and general market trends of profits moving from memecoins to utility projects.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there any updated information on tokenomics (circulating supply and utility)? (asked by GonzaLord) A: Provided link to token.hyperfy.xyz with detailed breakdown of token distribution (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is circulating supply still 50%? (asked by GonzaLord) A: Detailed breakdown provided: 30% DAO (multi-sig), 35% to v1 holders/partners (~10% unclaimed), 15% to Founders (vested), rest is LP (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: If Streamflow says only 13.17% is still locked, is Dexscreener market cap incorrect? (asked by GonzaLord) A: Dexscreener accounts for circulating supply excluding DAO, Unclaimed, and Founders tokens, but doesn't consider vesting status (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What do you do with the unlocked tokens? (asked by GonzaLord) A: Nobody has touched them (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Are we pumping off of Shaw's tweet? (asked by general hyper) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: GonzaLord | Context: Needed clarification on token distribution and circulating supply | Resolution: Provided detailed breakdown of token allocation percentages and explained how Dexscreener calculates market cap\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: GonzaLord | Context: Concerned about potential sell pressure from team token unlocks | Resolution: Clarified that team members haven't sold any tokens despite unlocks\n\n## 4.

Vox shared a project featuring UV scrolling for rotors and blinking lights using a single texture with an emission map, demonstrating an efficient technique for animated elements. Valiant discussed experiences with gltf.report, noting its effectiveness in reducing VRAM usage but expressing frustration with increased file sizes when processing WebP textures. There was also discussion about Decentraland's controversial decision to remove browser support in favor of a downloadable client, which several users criticized as a step backward for user onboarding. Community members shared links to various projects including Hyperfy, Magicblock, and IQ6900 (an on-chain asset storage solution). Technical considerations around compression, VRAM optimization, and the potential future implementation of Draco compression were also mentioned.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What does gltf.report do to compress files? (asked by vox) A: It reduces VRAM usage but can increase overall filesize when reprocessing WebP textures (answered by Valiant)\nQ: Does gltf.report maintain quality after recompression? (asked by vox) A: Yes, there's no noticeable degradation despite the increased file size (answered by Valiant)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat segment primarily discusses the concept of MCP (Master Control Program) and its potential application in Hyperfy for AI-assisted scripting. A user named brandonmanus introduced the topic by sharing a video and suggesting that MCP could be used to efficiently instruct AI on writing scripts that work within the Hyperfy world environment. This would eliminate the need to repeatedly configure AI for specific tasks. Another user, peezy, mentioned that a proof of concept already exists as a Hyperfy mod (available at hypkg.sh/hypkg/ai/), though they needed to verify if it was compatible with the latest Hyperfy version. Peezy also shared their workflow of attempting to prompt AI solutions before resorting to manual coding. Additionally, there was a brief mention of Hyperfy's potential beyond gaming as an \"agentic sandbox\" for experimenting with consensus around real-world neighborhood and urban projects.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Has anyone heard of the term MCP and could it be used for AI scripting in Hyperfy?

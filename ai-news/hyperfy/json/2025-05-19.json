      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment covers discussions about Hyperfy app development capabilities and tools. Key technical topics include player behavior modification in Hyperfy apps, with Ashxn pointing to existing functions like `applyEffect` and `app.control()` as potential solutions. A significant development shared by peezy is an IDE scripting tool with auto script reloading functionality, which appears to be in development with a GitHub branch available for testing. The tool allows developers to name scripts and switch between them, though it comes with a warning about potential disruption to existing world folders. There's also mention of combining various tools into a \"Hyperfy Studio\" that would work alongside the browser/platform, described as an enhanced builder mode. The chat shows enthusiasm for these development tools, with references to making animations more fluid and enabling more sophisticated development workflows.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way for a Hyperfy app to modify player behavior, like injecting camera logic? (asked by Cybernetic-O-Cult) A: Yes, you can use `applyEffect` and `app.control()` functions that already exist within an app (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Will there be an example template for building a full game like the Fallen crypto game? (asked by Cybernetic-O-Cult) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is scripting from IDE with auto script reloading available?

The conversation revolves around world-building projects, with several members expressing interest in creating or expanding worlds. B0gie mentions working on traits and suggests waiting for the next \"wiggles\" event. There's discussion about creating an \"overworld\" with portals to different experiences (sandbox, art, arcade, crypto). Emotionull shares plans for a \"phettaverse.games\" project and is seeking to hire builders. 0mka announces a tutorial session covering the process from cloning to creating basic worlds with UI elements. MUDBONE suggests NFT communities should build worlds in Hyperfy, and there's mention of someone coding in Hyperfy live on Twitter. The chat includes several GIF exchanges that appear to be teasing upcoming developments with references to \"home made\" projects and neighborhood/community building.\n\n## 2.

GonzaLord inquired about updated information on circulating supply and utility, noting that the main website documentation lacked token information. Ashxn provided a link to the token website (token.hyperfy.xyz) and clarified the token distribution breakdown. The conversation revealed that 30% of tokens are held in a DAO multi-sig (untouched), 35% were allocated to v1 world holders and ai16z partners (with ~10% unclaimed), 15% to founders (linear vested, untouched), and the remainder in liquidity pools. They also discussed how Dexscreener calculates market cap based on circulating supply, which excludes DAO, unclaimed, and founder tokens, but doesn't account for vesting status.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there any updated information on tokenomics (circulating supply and utility)? (asked by GonzaLord) A: https://token.hyperfy.xyz (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is circulating supply still 50%? (asked by GonzaLord) A: 30% DAO is in a multi-sig, untouched. 35% to v1 world holders and ai16z partners, ~10% went unclaimed. 15% to Founders is linear vested, also untouched. Rest is LP. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: If Streamflow says that only 13.17% is still locked, is Dexscreener market cap not correct? (asked by GonzaLord) A: Dexscreener takes circulating into account, which is essentially all tokens minus DAO, Unclaimed, and Founders. It doesn't look at the portion that is vested or not. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: GonzaLord | Context: Needed information about HYPER token distribution and how market cap is calculated | Resolution: Provided token website link and detailed breakdown of token allocation percentages, plus explanation of how Dexscreener calculates market cap\n\n## 4. Action Items\nDocumentation: Update main website to include token information or link to token.hyperfy.xyz | Mentioned By: GonzaLord",

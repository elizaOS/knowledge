User web-gnar reported that using the \"/create a cloud dissapating\" command successfully generated the requested item but subsequently crashed the system. Ash later confirmed that the system appeared to have rebooted itself after the crash. A new user (MaxFlowers) joined and asked how to access the world they saw on Twitter. Gert-Jan Akerboom provided guidance, sharing the URL (https://vibe.hyperfy.xyz/) and explaining basic interaction mechanics: pointing somewhere, pressing enter to open chat, and using the \"/create\" command to generate content.

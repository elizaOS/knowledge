          "text": "The Gizmo tool in Hyperfy has undergone significant development, with a focus on improving user experience and technical capabilities. Key enhancements include rotation snapping, grid snapping for translation, and the ability to toggle between world and local axes using the 'T' key. While snap points were considered, they were ultimately rejected due to poor UX. A toggle key for snapping was requested by users.",

Users like nightshiffty and devbyte_00 praised its intuitive design and ease of use. cheddarqueso highlighted useful features such as keyboard shortcuts, snap-to-rotate, and drag-and-drop functionality. However, they also requested additional features like object scaling and collider setup for VIPE houses.",

A major highlight is the ongoing development of the Gizmo tool, which now includes rotation snapping, grid snapping for translation, and toggling between world and local axes. Users have requested additional features such as object scaling, snapping toggles, and a 'zoom to' function for selected nodes. A first-person drone-based build mode was introduced to enhance solo building UX, allowing users to build while flying and keeping their avatar visible to others.",

Optimization guidance was provided for Blender workflows, including UV unwrapping and texture memory management. However, compressed Draco GLBs are not yet supported in version 2.",

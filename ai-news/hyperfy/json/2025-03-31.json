      "summary": "# Analysis of \"💻│developers\" Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on new Hyperfy features and technical implementations. Key developments included the introduction of gizmo functionality for object manipulation with rotation snap and world/local space toggling. Ash added skinned mesh support for non-humanoid animations, enabling pets, mounts, and bosses. Developers discussed node hierarchy, world/app space relationships, and event communication between apps. Several users worked through deployment issues on Digital Ocean, particularly related to environment configuration. The conversation also covered optimization techniques for 3D models, collision detection for skyboxes, and UI improvements for the build interface. The community actively tested new features, provided feedback, and helped troubleshoot implementation challenges.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How do apps communicate with each other? (asked by smickelbeard) A: Apps can emit and subscribe to events with JSON data (answered by ash)\nQ: What's the benefit of putting nodes in world space vs app space? (asked by general hyper) A: Positioning in world space makes it easier to communicate position between different apps (answered by Shiffty)\nQ: How can we create invisible walls or collision boundaries? (asked by MiaHigashikata) A: You can flip normals on a mesh in Blender to create internal collisions (answered by ash)\nQ: How do I access avatar nodes for animation? (asked by .hyp shaman) A: The avatar node is abstracted; you can only read bone transforms with avatar.getBoneTransform and toggle emotes (answered by ash)\nQ: Why doesn't my Digital Ocean deployment load properly? (asked by mio) A: The .env file needs to have the IP address instead of localhost since those variables are sent to the browser (answered by ash)\nQ: Does clone() duplicate child nodes too? (asked by peezy) A: Use clone(true) to get all the children too (answered by Shiffty)\nQ: Will scale be added to the gizmo eventually? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Yes, but it's a bigger project (answered by ash)\nQ: Is animation blending supported for skinned meshes? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Yes, skinned mesh animations have a fade number for crossfading between animations (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around the introduction and testing of a new tool called \"Gizmo\" in the development environment. Ash announced its availability for feedback before official release. Users like Shiffty and devbyte provided positive initial feedback, noting it feels good and shouldn't take long to get used to. CheddarQueso later shared detailed feedback, praising the keyboard shortcuts, snap feature for rotation, ability to pick up and move items, and the drag-and-drop functionality, comparing it favorably to Nifty and DCL. They also mentioned needing scaling features and collider setup for VIPE houses. Additionally, vox shared a project with lightmaps implemented, seeking feedback on its suitability for shooter arenas. The conversation included mentions of AI texture generation tools and mobile functionality questions.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How do I jump on mobile? (asked by BallisticBanana) A: Unanswered\nQ: Slick!

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"🪙│hyper\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on implementing a plot/parcel system in Hyperfy similar to Decentraland (DCL) or Minecraft servers. General Hyper proposed creating coordinate-based building permissions to allow users to rent plots in a shared world. The technical challenge centers around how to control building permissions by zone without impacting performance. Several approaches were discussed: (1) grouping objects under collections with assigned permissions rather than zone-based permissions, (2) exposing a boolean in the API to toggle builder role when users enter their plots, and (3) creating a custom building system with approved assets. Ash pointed out a security concern that users could potentially bypass zone restrictions by spawning large objects or using scripts. The conversation concluded that while implementing a parcel system is technically possible, it presents significant implementation challenges that would require careful design to prevent exploitation.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can we make a mini DCL with 100 parcels in Hyperfy? (asked by jar0d) A: Theoretically possible by creating \"plots\" in a world with coordinate-based building permissions (answered by general hyper)\nQ: Could we just expose a bool in the API which assigns builder role? (asked by general hyper) A: Unanswered\nQ: How to control building permission by zone? (asked by general hyper) A: Performance concerns exist; some prefer grouping objects under collections with permissions vs. zone-based permissions (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3.

General hyper is experiencing this visual artifact where overlapping surfaces compete for screen space. The discussion touches on potential solutions including adding small gaps between objects or removing faces where labels are placed. There's also a brief tangent about implementing first-person mode for better viewing of small objects, with general hyper noting that text is already at a minimal 4px font size, suggesting that further reduction would require vectorized fonts. The conversation is brief and somewhat fragmented, with ash offering to help diagnose the z-fighting issue if given access to the code.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's causing the z-fighting issue when duplicating objects? (asked by general hyper) A: Unanswered, but ash suggested a small gap should fix it or removing the face where the label is placed (answered by ash)\nQ: Would first person mode help with viewing tiny objects? (asked by peezy) A: General hyper noted text is already at 4px and smaller text might not render properly (answered by general hyper)\nQ: What did ash mean by \"gib apps\"?

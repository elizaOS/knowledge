      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion centers around lightmap baking in 3D models, specifically using geometry nodes. Ashxn initially notes that geometry nodes aren't supported by GLTF, but the functionality could be implemented with regular scripting. MetaRick shares examples of a scene using a single lightmap across multiple objects, demonstrating how this approach allows for quality control by generating one or multiple maps as needed. The examples show the difference between baked and non-baked versions, with the baked version appearing visually superior. There's a brief mention of using the Needle tool, with MetaRick clarifying they're using the Unity version rather than the Blender plugin. The conversation highlights how lightmap baking can significantly enhance visual quality in 3D scenes while maintaining efficiency by using shared texture files across multiple objects.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can you export geometry nodes to GLTF? (implied from Ashxn's comment) A: Yes, but there are limits (answered by á²¼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\nQ: Are you using needle-tool-blender? (asked by á²¼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/) A: No, I'm using the Unity version (answered by MetaRick)\nQ: What's the advantage of this lightmap approach? (implied from MetaRick's explanation) A: You can set up a scene with multiple models using different textures, then bake them to use the same lightmap texture file (answered by MetaRick)\n\n## 3.

Users exchanged greetings and expressed frustration about a model that couldn't be deleted despite multiple attempts. There was also a link shared to a Twitter space about a project building on Hyperfy. No substantial technical discussions, decisions, or problem-solving occurred in this limited exchange.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: (No significant questions with meaningful responses were present in this chat segment)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\n(No significant help interactions were present in this chat segment)\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Investigate issue with model deletion that users reported being unable to delete \"like 100 times\" | Mentioned By: Cayden0207",

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in ðŸª™â”‚hyper Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains two messages discussing Hyperfy token ($HYPER) distribution and a proposed tokenomics model. The first message from Ashxn outlines the current token allocation: approximately 10% consists of unclaimed airdrops (effectively burned), 15% is linearly vested over 3 years, and 30% is allocated to a currently inactive DAO. MUDBONE then proposes a new tokenomics model to better align team and user interests. The proposal suggests implementing buybacks where the team would use a portion of fee revenue to purchase $HYPER and deposit it into a one-sided liquidity pool. Community members would stake SOL on the other side, creating a community-backed LP. This would increase liquidity, attract larger buyers, and demonstrate the team's commitment to reinvesting in $HYPER. The model includes modest APY rewards for stakers from DAO reserves, buyback programs, and unclaimed airdrop tokens. The team would still earn marketplace fees and benefit from $HYPER appreciation. This approach aims to create a positive feedback loop of usage, fees, buybacks, liquidity depth, confidence, and increased usage.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What percentage of tokens are unclaimed airdrops? (asked by Ashxn) A: Around 10%, essentially burnt. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How much of the token supply is vested? (asked by Ashxn) A: 15% is linear vested over 3 years. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What percentage is allocated to the DAO? (asked by Ashxn) A: 30% is allocated to the DAO, which is currently inactive. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Where do swap fees currently go? (asked by MUDBONE) A: Right now, all fees from swap go to the team. (answered by MUDBONE)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: MUDBONE | Helpee: Community | Context: Lack of alignment between token and users | Resolution: Proposed a tokenomics model with buybacks and community-backed LP to create better alignment and incentives\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "MetaRick shared information about a 2D to 3D generation tool by Tencent Hunyuan that can be used for both 3D printing (high poly) and game development (low poly). He specifically highlighted the low poly version at https://3d.hunyuan.tencent.com/lowpoly, noting it works best when the input image already has a low poly aesthetic. For game development assets, he recommends using this approach rather than the high poly version. MetaRick mentioned using ChatGPT to create low poly T-pose reference images that work well with the generator. He also shared an example of his reference image with the resulting generated model including wireframe visualization.",

MetaRick shares examples of scenes where a single lightmap is applied across multiple objects, demonstrating the efficiency of this approach. The discussion highlights that while geometry nodes aren't supported by GLTF, regular scripting can achieve similar results. There's also discussion about Needle Tools compatibility with different Blender versions, with b0gie mentioning performance issues in version 4.4.3. Later, 0mka shares HypScript code snippets for toggling block visibility in UI elements, providing practical implementation examples for developers. Marcel (likely from Needle Tools) offers troubleshooting support regarding addon performance issues in Blender.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can geometry nodes be exported to GLTF? (implied from Ashxn's comment) A: You can export geonodes but there are limits (answered by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\nQ: Is this HypScript? (asked by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/) A: Self-confirmed by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/ (\"ong it is!\")\nQ: Are you using needle-tool-blender? If so, what version of blender are you in? (asked by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/) A: \"nah im using the unity version\" (answered by MetaRick)\nQ: What was slow exactly? Selecting objects/editing? Something else? Is it faster when you disable the addon? Which os are you on? (asked by marcel 🌵) A: \"on windows, something locked up the whole program when i enabled the the addon. i'll try to reprod and send logs\" (answered by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\n\n## 3.

Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around excitement for upcoming developments in Hyperfy, particularly a period referred to as \"Hyp-Summer\" which promises significant advancements. Community members discussed issues with deleting models, with one user offering troubleshooting steps. Several users shared links to Hyperfy worlds, especially v2 worlds. There's anticipation for new features and releases, with mentions of something significant that \"vox made\" that others \"are not ready for.\" A podcast host inquired about worlds to visit for their show \"Virtual Destinations,\" and community members offered suggestions and potential collaboration. The overall tone is enthusiastic about Hyperfy's development progress, with references to the \"hypengine\" getting better daily while not yet being fully featured.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How to fix issues with deleting models? (asked by Cayden0207) A: Try selecting all code with ctrl+a, then ctrl+/ or remove code and try deleting again; if still having trouble, it could be network-related (answered by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\nQ: What is Hyp-Summer?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for channel \"🪙│hyper\"\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion in the \"hyper\" channel primarily revolves around token economics and potential strategies for the $HYPER token. MUDBONE proposed a detailed token model involving buybacks where the team would use a portion of earned fees to swap SOL for $HYPER and deposit into a one-sided liquidity pool. Community members would stake SOL on the other side, creating a community-backed LP. This approach aims to increase liquidity, attract larger buyers, and demonstrate the team's commitment to reinvesting in $HYPER. The proposal suggests that stakers could earn $HYPER at a modest APY from DAO reserves, buyback programs, and unclaimed airdrop tokens. Other community members offered alternative perspectives, with cru suggesting a simpler approach where $HYPER's value is driven by mindshare rather than utility. Ashxn provided context about token distribution, noting that approximately 10% consists of unclaimed airdrops, 15% is linear vested over 3 years, and 30% is currently inactive DAO allocation.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What happens to unclaimed airdrops? (implied from Ashxn's message) A: Around 10% is unclaimed airdrops, essentially burnt. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How is the $HYPER token vested? (implied from Ashxn's message) A: Another 15% is linear vested over 3 years. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What's the status of the DAO allocation? (implied from Ashxn's message) A: DAO 30% is also inactive right now. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What could be done with buyback tokens? (implied from MUDBONE's follow-up) A: They can be used for incentives and initiatives rather than just being a \"black hole\" or one-sided LP. (answered by MUDBONE)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: MUDBONE | Helpee: Community | Context: Lack of connection between $HYPER token and users | Resolution: Proposed a token model with buybacks and community-backed LP to increase liquidity and demonstrate team commitment\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: Community | Context: Understanding token distribution | Resolution: Provided breakdown of token allocation percentages and vesting schedules\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Analysis of 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe channel discussion focused on AI-powered 3D modeling tools and their applications. MetaRick shared experiences with a 2D-to-3D generation tool from Tencent Hunyuan that offers both high-poly (suitable for 3D printing) and low-poly (better for game development) options. He noted that the low-poly generator works best when the input image already has a low-poly aesthetic. MetaRick also mentioned using AI to generate character sketches, which he then refines in VR before 3D printing. Additionally, he shared a link to PartCrafter, another 3D modeling tool. Ashxn briefly mentioned Blender lightmap support via a Hyperfy addon, which sparked some interest from other users, particularly b0gie who requested more information about this addon.\n\n## 2.

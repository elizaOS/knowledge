      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: üíª‚îÇdevelopers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on Hyperfy world hosting and technical implementation details. HypPrivakos mentioned that backing up worlds on fly.io is possible through SSH container access, and announced the release of an export feature on hyperworld.host. Ashxn provided a detailed Docker Compose setup guide for deploying Hyperfy worlds on Coolify, including environment variables configuration and domain setup. They also warned against using transmission on transparent materials due to performance issues on mobile/VR.\n\nSeveral feature requests were discussed, including making the skybox follow characters vertically for space settings, and adding code/script functionality to the Scene field in World settings. Ashxn confirmed plans to implement \"environment\" apps that would be locked to 0,0,0 coordinates with scriptable extras. Community members also shared creative ideas for digital twins of real-world objects like fish, cows, and trees that could interact between physical and virtual environments.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What was the biggest issue with using fly.io? (asked by ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì) A: Backing up worlds, but it's actually possible through SSH to the container (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: Is there another coolify-optimized compose image for the latest stable 0.10.0 or dev release 0.13.0? (asked by Reneil) A: We're running a stock coolify with docker compose (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to make the skybox follow the character vertically without modifying core? (asked by Alephic) A: Ashxn offered to add this functionality\nQ: Could the Scene-field in World settings allow code/.hyp functionality? (asked by vox) A: This was the plan - to have \"environment\" apps locked to 0,0,0 with scripts (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there no more 'locking' scripts? And any movement on more permissions/roles? (asked by 0mka) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for üßä‚îÇ3d-design\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on techniques for creating realistic lighting effects in 3D scenes. The main technical discussion centered around making sunlight pass through glass objects by manipulating shadow properties. Users discussed setting castShadow and receiveShadow to false on glass objects to allow light to penetrate, with the option to keep receiveShadow true in certain cases. This technique was recognized as particularly useful for indoor scenes with skylights, cathedrals with stained glass, and creating god ray effects. Alternative approaches were suggested, such as using transparent cones with fading to simulate light rays. Additionally, a user mentioned the benefits of UV scrolling for creating effects with minimal performance impact. The chat concluded with a link to a GitHub repository for GaussianSplats3D, suggesting potential integration with Hyperfy.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to get the sun to shine through glass? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Set castShadow and receiveShadow to false on the glass, though in some cases you might want receiveShadow to still be true. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can you get sun to shine through glass this way? (asked by untitled, xyz) A: Yes, if you have a primarily indoor scene, you can set your roof to let light in etc. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: Gert-Jan Akerboom | Context: Needed to know how to make sunlight pass through glass | Resolution: Advised to set castShadow and receiveShadow to false on glass objects\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: untitled, xyz | Context: Discussing cathedral design with stained glass and god rays | Resolution: Suggested using a transparent cone with fading to fake light rays as an alternative approach\n\n## 4. Action Items\nFeature: Integration of GaussianSplats3D with Hyperfy for .splat support | Description: Consider adding support for the GaussianSplats3D library | Mentioned By: mattimus\nDocumentation: Create a workflow post for light through glass techniques | Description: Document the process of creating realistic light effects through glass | Mentioned By: peezy",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on Hyperfy platform development, deployment, and technical features. Key topics included:\n\nDeployment methods for Hyperfy worlds, with detailed instructions from Ashxn on setting up Docker Compose with Coolify, including environment variables configuration and domain setup. HypPrivakos mentioned that exporting features were recently released on hyperworld.host.\n\nTechnical rendering advice was shared, with Ashxn warning against using transmission effects on transparent materials due to performance issues on mobile/VR as it \"renders the entire screen multiple times\" and consumes excessive CPU/GPU resources.\n\nSeveral feature requests and improvements were discussed, including a request from Alephic for skybox vertical following functionality for space settings, which Ashxn agreed to implement. Vox suggested adding code/.hyp functionality to the Scene field in World settings, which Ashxn confirmed was already planned as \"environment\" apps locked at 0,0,0 coordinates.\n\nCommunity members shared creative applications, including 0mka's portal pack with emissive edges and scaling features, and discussions about digital twins for fish, cows, and trees that could interact with real-world counterparts.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What was the biggest issue with using fly.io? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: Backing up worlds, but it's actually possible though complicated - need to SSH to the container then clone content (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: Is there another coolify-optimized compose image for the latest stable 0.10.0 or dev release 0.13.0? (asked by Reneil) A: We're running stock coolify with docker compose (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to make the skybox follow the character vertically without modifying core? (asked by Alephic) A: Ashxn agreed to add this functionality (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Could the Scene-field in World settings allow code/.hyp functionality? (asked by vox) A: This was the plan - to have \"environment\" apps locked to 0,0,0 with scripts (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there no more 'locking' scripts? And any movement on more permissions/roles? (asked by 0mka) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Ashxn confirmed that LiveKit is currently supported for spatial voice chat, though push-to-talk and recording features aren't implemented yet. User management was identified as an urgent need, with Ashxn suggesting two key features for formal events: a voice chat permission switch and admin controls (mute, kick, ban). Portal functionality was discussed, with confirmation that users can create portals between maps. Community members also proposed features like object grouping in building mode and making hyperlinks clickable in visitor mode. The conversation indicates ongoing development with focus on improving user management and building tools.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Do you have any suggestions or solutions if we want to have a meeting in the Hyperfy-based metaverse? (asked by ovo) A: Right now it's more suitable for super casual events.

The main technical discussion centered around making sunlight pass through glass objects by manipulating shadow properties. Users discussed setting castShadow and receiveShadow to false on glass objects to allow light to penetrate, with the note that receiveShadow might still be useful in some cases. This technique was highlighted as particularly valuable for indoor scenes with skylights, cathedrals with stained glass, and creating god ray effects. Additional techniques mentioned included using transparent cones with fading to fake light rays. The chat briefly touched on UVscrolling as a zero-overhead technique for creating effects, and there was a mention of GaussianSplats3D, with a suggestion that Hyperfy could support .splat files.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to get the sun to shine through glass? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Set castShadow and receiveShadow to false on the glass, though in some cases you might want receiveShadow to still be true. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can you really get sun to shine through glass this way? (asked by untitled, xyz) A: Yes, if you have a primarily indoor scene, you can set your roof to let light in.

Users discussed finding and implementing a tech grid texture for floor replacement. Agent12 shared implementations for rocket launch chat notifications and teleport/emote commands, but reported persistent issues with teleport locations not saving after world refresh. The user also noted that when setting both emote and teleport to the same command, only the emote executes. Additionally, szjanko shared a marketplace link demonstrating new functionality where app links now display name, description, and thumbnail images.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where can I find the tech grid texture for replacing the default floor?

      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat revolves around Hyperfy platform development with significant focus on UI improvements, physics interactions, and app development frameworks. Ashxn introduced several major features including player physics push/force mechanics, undo functionality for world editing, and a comprehensive \"Elemental\" framework (formerly \"Lootify\") for inventory, combat, and item management. Developers discussed UI improvements with new positioning capabilities and emoji support in props. The community actively shared code snippets and workarounds for various issues, including UI positioning, Twitter integration, and avatar interactions. Several developers worked on creating apps for inventory management, health systems, and social media integration. Physics improvements enable new gameplay mechanics like launchers and pushback. The chat demonstrates a collaborative environment where developers share code, troubleshoot issues, and build upon each other's work to expand Hyperfy's capabilities.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to make imported GLB bigger like we used to be able to do in V1? (asked by fractilians) A: Only via script currently, but it's a one-liner: `app.scale.setScalar(10) // 10x bigger` (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do we find our avatar position in world? (asked by MetaRick) A: Use `const player = world.getPlayer(); player.position` to get the world position of the local player (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Why does it duplicate my rock instead of picking it up? (asked by ToxSam) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there a way to make cursor not leave the browser when clicking UI elements at the edge? (asked by peezy) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can I use UIImage on the onscreen UI? (asked by Omka) A: Yes, it should be 100% the same as in-world UI (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How hard is it to get the lower body blending for emotes like in V1? (asked by peezy) A: V1 had a base locomotion emote with custom emotes on top. If your emote doesn't have leg bones, it'll play walk/run anims for legs while showing custom emote for upper body (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Any plans for X (Twitter) OAuth? Is that something I can cook in an app? (asked by ToxSam) A: Would need a modded engine, can't add to core. A platform like Hyperworld could add it (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Was just thinking on the pickup mechanics...having physics push would allow for quite a few Mario Party style games? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Ashxn implemented player push/force mechanics that enable this functionality (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Does latest dev have the zone area that hurts health? (asked by MetaRick) A: It's gone but was simple - just call player.damage(30) on trigger entry or contact (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

Users shared links to Twitter/X posts about a new game gaining significant traction, with comments suggesting it's attracting more users than established platforms like Decentraland (DCL). There was brief discussion about advertising within this game space, noting that people are willing to pay for ad space due to the large audience of tech enthusiasts. Technical discussions included mentions of WebXR integration in Hyperfy's main branch, a proposed \"redeploy mechanic\" feature, and the idea of integrating a large language model (LLM) similar to GitHub Copilot into the Hyperfy app to assist developers, particularly now that documentation is available to train it on.\n\n## 2.

The conversation primarily revolves around an off-topic discussion about tire repair, with a user named Saori asking about gluing a tire sidewall that was damaged from hitting a curb. Another user (devilsadvocate.sol) suggests using specialized tire patch glue rather than rubber cement, noting that a two-part epoxy might be more suitable due to tire heat concerns. The chat also briefly touches on cryptocurrency topics, with users asking about the ticker symbol for a token (answered as $hyper or $hyperfy), and includes some political commentary about the SEC. There is no substantive technical discussion about the Hyperfy project itself, development decisions, or implementations in this segment.\n\n## 2.

Users are trying to locate where to implement VRM updates in the codebase, with suggestions to check playerlocal, proxy, or vrmfactory components. There's significant discussion about Meshy's API pricing structure, with some users noting they may have grandfathered pricing plans. Users report inconsistent texture generation quality, particularly for uploaded models not generated by Meshy, with texture retries failing after 1-2 attempts instead of the expected 4. The conversation highlights that Meshy seems better at texturing character backs than object backs like bushes. A link to an impressive AI work was also shared.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where should VRM.update be implemented in the new paradigm? (asked by Saori) A: Possibly in playerlocal, proxy, or vrmfactory (answered by ᲼)\nQ: Is Meshy charging 10 credits per text-to-3D generation? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: API pricing may be cheaper because not all features are available (answered by Valiant)\nQ: Are texture retries being throttled?

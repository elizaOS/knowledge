Summary\nThe chat segment contains brief technical discussions about development platforms, with a focus on Hyperfy's ease of use compared to Unity. Lastraum mentions quickly creating a forge leaderboard in Hyperfy, highlighting its efficiency. A technical issue is raised by .hyp shaman regarding animation problems with cloned skinned meshes in a GLB file, where only 1/3 of the clones play animations with logs showing \"bones are missing\" errors. Ash offers to examine the GLB file. Marcel shares links to audio episodes about Three.js WebGPU/WebXR updates and Blender engineering.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment is very brief with minimal technical discussion. Users exchanged greetings and made a few comments about NFTs and asset generation. One user shared a link to what appears to be a tool or method for generating assets. Another user questioned the relevance and utility of NFTs in current projects, suggesting that crypto should be \"invisible\" and \"noob friendly\" rather than explicitly showcasing NFTs. The user also expressed a preference for more game-related ideas instead of NFT implementations. Overall, this chat segment contains very little substantive technical discussion or problem-solving.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Anyone tried this to generate assets? (asked by rando1337) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

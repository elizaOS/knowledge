      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical aspects of Hyperfy development, with several key topics emerging. Ashxn shared code snippets for making GLB models clickable with hyperlinks and creating action buttons. There was significant discussion about avatar formats, with Ashxn expressing doubts about VRM being the ultimate format and suggesting a potential working group to develop a more efficient alternative built on GLTF. Terrain development was highlighted with Ashxn's splatmap terrain demo at island.hyperfy.xyz. VR improvements were implemented, including snap turn functionality and better action handling in VR. Performance limitations were discussed regarding a meeting that crashed when too many users joined a fly.io-hosted instance, revealing resource constraints (1 CPU, 1GB RAM) on the free tier. Other topics included methods for programmatically placing objects in worlds, token-gated access, and UI improvements like a reconnect button for mobile disconnections.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there code I can add to an existing GLB model that will make it a clickable hyperlink to a new tab? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: Yes, you can use `app.onPointerDown = () => world.open(\"https://foo.com\", true)` or create an action button (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How many users can a Hyperfy space handle depending on CPU, memory, graphic load, and server usage? (asked by DevStarlight | Numinia) A: It depends on optimization - with optimized avatars >100 users, but with unoptimized 20MB VRMs with 10 draw calls each, maybe only 10 users (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How/where would you start to build something like drts in v2? (asked by vox) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is it possible to create an App that allows for folks to sign in with SOL and do a Token Check? (asked by Agent12) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can I define position, rotation, scale and glb path on a text file instead of using the visual editor? (asked by carlosmu) A: The foundation of the engine is built on the premise of the in-world editor, but there may be programmatic ways to load apps (answered by maximus)\nQ: Is there any way to force an auto refresh when a disconnect happens or an on screen refresh button? (asked by MetaRick) A: Yes, a refresh button has been added to the dev version (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

Users 0mka and maximus exchanged information about Recall's documentation and community. 0mka shared the documentation link and mentioned related technologies like backpacks/arweave, ceramic/tableland, orbis, and \"sqlite on chain stuff.\" Maximus noted that Recall has been working on data infrastructure for years and is running competitions. Maximus also mentioned that while Recall is keeping their tables functionality, they appear to be shifting focus toward data consumption and AI applications. Both users acknowledged they haven't closely followed Recall's recent developments, particularly since \"the merging.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is Recall Network working on?

Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical optimization of 3D assets in Hyperfy. ~/drdoge.eth reported reducing the monorail textures from 80MB to 18MB, bringing the entire world under 2GB for browser loading. Vox suggested further optimization to 6MB with 18 drawcalls. Several optimization techniques were discussed including material combining, atlasing, and collision generation. Ashxn mentioned wanting an automated \"game ready\" converter for 3D models. The conversation also touched on InstaLOD as a potential optimization tool. HypPrivakos and maximus discussed implementing auto-reconnect functionality with exponential backoff (capped at 20-30 seconds) to handle connection drops. Roustan tested VR trigger actions on Quest 3, demonstrating VRM avatar functionality. The group also discussed mobile accessibility of Hyperfy, with confirmation that it works on iOS devices. There was mention of a WIP meetup hosted by Roustan using fly.io for deployment, with discussion about server specifications and performance.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the game already released or is it still in beta phase? (asked by alhxss) A: The engine is available for creators to build experiences and/or digital items right now, but it's still in beta though very capable already. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Are the utilities for hyper token live or will it be released once the platform launches? (asked by alhxss) A: Hyper will power the marketplace when it launches soon. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is the game not live yet for gamers? (asked by alhxss) A: They dropped a token PVP game called Fallen which is live now: https://fallen.hyperfy.xyz (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is Hyperfy like an infrastructure where developers can build 3D games powered by hyper token? (asked by alhxss) A: Yes (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is Hyperfy accessible through mobile? iPad or iPhone? (asked by 1Existence-Metabeast) A: Yes it works on mobile, and Roustan is making his world very lite for that purpose. (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3.

Vox shared a technique for creating a UV scrolling plane that works with skybox buildings by cutting a sphere mesh, duplicating it, shrinking it slightly, and applying a UV scroll material with a custom script. The script controls texture scrolling speed and offset on X and Y axes. Ashxn discussed experiments with terrain splatmaps, demonstrating high-resolution sand blending into stone using a regular mesh node with a special triplanar material. There was a brief discussion about whether terrain creation should happen in-world or in Blender. A user named carlosmu inquired about Hyperfy v1 sample projects and text-based scene definition, but maximus recommended against coding for v1, directing them to Hyperfy v2 documentation instead. There was also a request to update documentation links in the channel.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there any place to download sample projects of hyperfy v1? (asked by carlosmu) A: I recommend against coding anything for v1, ancient unsupported code. Hyperfy v2 is the way to go.

The only notable technical reference was ash's comment about WoW's housing build mode, highlighting that the toolset is designed to be accessible for beginners while still offering depth for advanced users. Ash noted that this design philosophy aligned with their own previous statements about balancing usability and power in design tools.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the WoW housing build mode about?

Summary\nThe chat discusses UI toggling functionality, specifically the behavior of the 'z' key which now removes all UI elements including those from \"hyps\" (presumably Hyperspace or a similar component). User 0mka expresses a preference for more granular UI toggling options, wanting to keep certain gameplay elements like the reticle and on-screen UI while hiding chat and core UI. They suggest that the previous behavior was different and that a separate chat toggle would be beneficial. User ash responds by questioning the practicality of asking visitors to use the 'z' key to hide UI elements and defends the current all-or-nothing approach as being consistent with standard game design patterns, emphasizing that the default behavior should remain simple and meet user expectations.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to have more configurable UI toggling options?

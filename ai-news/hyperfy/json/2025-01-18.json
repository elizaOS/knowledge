      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat focuses on developers working with Hyperfy, a platform for creating 3D virtual worlds. Key technical discussions include:\n\nThe development team is migrating functionality from Hyperfy v1 to v2, with UI components recently added. Ashxn rewrote the in-world UI library using yoga, creating components like UI, UIView, and UIText with documentation added to the GitHub repository. The UI supports chat bubbles for agents and players.\n\nSeveral developers worked on implementing physics and collisions in 3D models. Adding colliders to objects requires setting custom properties in Blender and ensuring \"Custom Properties\" is selected during GLB export. This caused confusion for some users who struggled with the implementation.\n\nMetaMike successfully implemented OSC (Open Sound Control) integration, which enables features like facial/body tracking from webcams without VR equipment. This could potentially support VRM puppeteering similar to what VTubers use.\n\nThe team is working on agent functionality, with progress on chat bubbles and movement. The app state system was explained: server-side state is sent to clients when they connect, allowing clients to initialize in the correct modes.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do we get the app state? (asked by Spizzy) A: State is an empty object by default. Anything put in server-side is sent to clients when they connect. On the client, you can use it to update and store info about the current state. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do apps communicate with each other? (asked by peezy) A: You can use world.emit() to send events across apps, and app.send() sends events from client to server or server to all clients just for the app. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do we add collision to objects? (asked by jar0d) A: Add custom properties in Blender and ensure \"Custom Properties\" is selected during export. (answered by hiroP)\nQ: Is it technically possible to achieve VRM puppeteering that VTubers have on Hyperfy? (asked by peezy) A: Yes, it's possible using OSC for facial/body tracking from webcam without VR. (answered by MetaMike)\nQ: Does Hyperfy v2 support embedding YouTube videos and websites like v1 did? (asked by Spizzy) A: Not yet, but it will be implemented. (answered by PabloFM)\nQ: How do we detect if an AI agent is present in a world? (asked by felixdigit://) A: Agents would be like \"apps\" and might be distinguishable by their right-click context menu. (answered by Saori and Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

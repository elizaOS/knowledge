      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat revolves around developers working with Hyperfy, a platform for creating 3D virtual worlds. Key technical discussions include:\n\nThe development team is migrating functionality from v1 to v2 of Hyperfy, with Ashxn recently implementing in-world UI components (UI, UIView, UIText) using yoga. Developers are exploring how to add collisions to objects in Blender by setting custom properties and ensuring they're exported correctly with GLB files. MetaMike implemented OSC (Open Sound Control) integration for potential VRM puppeteering and body tracking via webcam. \n\nSeveral developers encountered issues with the new API, particularly with importing modules in scripts, adding collisions to objects, and understanding app state management. Ashxn clarified that app state is empty by default, with server-side state being sent to clients upon connection. The team is working on agent functionality, with Ashxn showing progress on agent chat bubbles that will also be used for player chat.\n\nDevelopers discussed hosting multi-world instances on personal servers, with PabloFM indicating they're working on self-hosting solutions. There were also discussions about marketplace potential for scripts and apps, with Saori noting that apps will be files (model + script) that could be included in NFT metadata.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do we get the app state? (asked by Spizzy) A: State is an empty object by default. Anything put in server-side is sent to clients when they connect. On the client, you can use it to update and store info about the current state. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How to add collision to meshes in Blender for v2? (asked by jar0d and Roustan) A: Add custom properties to the mesh in Blender and ensure \"Custom Properties\" is selected in the export dialog. (answered by hiroP and Ashxn)\nQ: Does `main` branch work? I see a black screen with frontend console saying `Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined` (asked by Spizzy) A: You need .env file. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How are apps supposed to communicate? (asked by peezy) A: world.emit() lets you send events across apps on client/server. app.send() sends events from client to server or server to all clients just for the app. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do we detect if an AI agent is present in a world? (asked by felixdigit://) A: Agents would be like \"apps\" and the right-click context menu will be different from players. (answered by Saori and Ashxn)\nQ: Is it technically possible to achieve VRM puppeteering that VTubers have on Hyperfy? (asked by peezy) A: Yes, it's possible using webcam without VR via OSC or potentially using existing solutions like kalidoface-3d. (answered by MetaMike)\nQ: In v1 there was a way to add 2D YouTube videos and websites in the scene. Does that exist yet in v2? (asked by Spizzy) A: Not yet, but it will be implemented. (answered by PabloFM)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🪙│hyper Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe chat revolves around a significant market event where a Trump-related cryptocurrency launched and caused major disruption across the crypto market, particularly affecting Hyper token. The Trump token rapidly gained value (reaching billions in market cap), causing liquidity to drain from other tokens including Hyper, which experienced a severe price drop. This was followed by additional celebrity tokens like Melania's, further exacerbating market volatility.\n\nTechnical discussions focused on several key issues:\n- Hyperfy team is working on metadata fixes for the token to improve visibility on platforms like Jupiter\n- The team is developing an API endpoint for CoinGecko to correctly display circulating supply\n- Discussions about the actual circulating supply vs. displayed market cap (roughly half of what's shown)\n- Network congestion on Solana due to the Trump token trading volume\n- Development updates on Hyperfy V2, which is importing features from V1 rather than building from scratch\n- Plans for in-world UI improvements to support agents and game mechanics\n\nCommunity members discussed trading strategies during the volatility, with some buying the dip while others expressed frustration. The team reassured users about their continued development focus despite market turbulence, emphasizing that they're building \"the future of the internet.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: Why is the market cap displayed incorrectly for Hyper? (asked by frank_grimes_sr) A: The DAO tokens and dev supply aren't circulating, so actual market cap is around 30M (answered by maximus)\nQ: Does Hyper token have a planned utility? (asked by zombiekid12) A: It's being worked on (answered by MUDBONE)\nQ: Why doesn't Hyper have a logo or verification on Jupiter? (asked by Beats) A: The team submitted verification but Jupiter hasn't processed it yet (answered by Saori)\nQ: Do we think hyper can go to 5-10b? (asked by zombiekid12) A: Eventually possible, but not short-term (answered by jar0d)\nQ: Why is the chat called speculation? (asked by scoe) A: Because they talk about price (answered by Saori)\nQ: After the carnival is over, will the funds return to hyper? (asked by BlazeHorizon) A: Unanswered\nQ: If Hyper is on moonshot, can it have much more holders? (asked by mkl) A: It shows up on moonshot but only if you paste CA. Searching Hyper shows nothing (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What happened to liquidity? Jito fucked? (asked by Beats) A: Liquidity is unstable due to massive Trump token trading (answered by jar0d)\nQ: When 100 Mill again Sirr? (asked by eagleforindo) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Key discussions included alternatives to Simplygon for model baking and LOD creation, with recommendations for Substance Painter, Marmoset, and SimpleBake plugin for Blender. There was technical discussion about GPU instancing, mesh merging, and texture atlasing for optimizing 3D environments in Hyperfy. The community is collaboratively developing documentation on world optimization, with several members contributing their expertise. Other topics included creating cinematic scenes in Unity, implementing physics for character models, and preparing 3D assets for virtual events. The conversation highlighted the importance of optimization techniques like occlusion culling, LOD implementation, and efficient asset referencing to create performant 3D environments for web-based platforms.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What alternatives exist for Simplygon to bake models and make LODs? (asked by emotionull) A: Substance Painter, Marmoset, or SimpleBake plugin for Blender (answered by TheMattEmpire and hiroP)\nQ: How does GPU instancing work in Hyperfy? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: The engine references a single model and reduces calls by drawing once and copying for each instance, similar to Unity prefabs (answered by maximus)\nQ: How many models can Hyperfy handle? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: According to maximus, the engine can handle \"9 billion trees in a world, just not all in one small area\" with proper LOD implementation\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"🤖│agents\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion focused on AI agents for Hyperfy, a metaverse platform. Community members proposed various agent concepts including parenting bots, creator clones, trade facilitators, and world-building assistants. Technical conversations centered on implementation frameworks like Eliza and Vvaifu, with debates about self-hosting versus paid options. Key technical points included the 10x cost difference between deployment options (0.15 vs 1.5 SOL), self-hosting Eliza without domain configuration, and the potential for agents to be stored as NFTs in user inventories. The discussion highlighted Hyperfy's v2 goals of supporting portable NPCs/pets across worlds through an app system where hosting sites would implement versions of user-brought NPCs. Integration with web3 functionality was mentioned, specifically connecting Nani.ooo Smart Wallet to agents for token distribution on Arbitrum, with reference to existing Solana branch code for web3 connection examples.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What is the main difference between Dasha and Eliza framework? (asked by bitpixi) A: Vvaifu (Dasha) is an agent building platform that's easy to set up but requires tokens for features, while Eliza can be self-hosted (answered by MetaMike and peezy)\nQ: Is there a way AI-NPCs aka ai agents could be stored in inventory and spawned by anyone visiting your world? (asked by felixdigit://) A: That's one of the goals of v2, where hosting sites would need to support the app you're bringing into the world (answered by maximus)\nQ: Would I get 10x features for the 10x price difference (0.15 vs 1.5 sol)?

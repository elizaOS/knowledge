      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy's development, particularly the transition from v1 to v2. A significant technical discussion focused on video integration capabilities, with ash announcing the implementation of geometry video projection that enables curved or paneled screens and opens possibilities for screensharing. This feature allows videos to be projected onto various 3D surfaces, not just flat planes. Community members discussed previous implementations where videos could be applied to GLB models, creating animated elements or 360° experiences. vox highlighted powerful applications like animated skyboxes using equirectangular videos on spheres and the potential to stream VRChat events directly into Hyperfy. Cluny_the_Scourge shared plans to convert modular Galactic Geckos city models to work with Hyperfy v2, praising the ease of conversion using the Hyperfy Blender add-on. Several users inquired about the differences between v1 and v2, with discussions about hosting capabilities, mobile compatibility, and VR support status. The chat also touched on potential community engagement strategies through avatar customization in games.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does that mean the screen would be a glb? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: The way it worked in v1, it was a GLB with a \"live\" video stretched across the surface. Works with complex objects, not just simple shapes. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Why doesn't Hyperfy open a yelegram channel? (asked by Roone) A: Unanswered\nQ: How do I do that [change skin in Fallen]? (asked by MUDBONE) A: It's disabled but I could probably add a couple avatar stands in there (answered by ash)\nQ: Can someone send link to V2? (asked by uuilliam.k) A: Hyperfy V2 Github https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy, Community Book: https://hackmd.io/@RealmWeaver/SkLMyAIvye, Docs https://hyperfy.how/ (v2) (answered by Agent12)\nQ: What are perks of owning the V1, should I just sell it and use the browser base V2? (asked by uuilliam.k) A: V1 is still good enough for events. You can set max 20 people and scale horizontally instead of having 100 people. (answered by Saori)\nQ: Is V2 already available for me to host people on phones, VR and more or is that still being worked on? (asked by uuilliam.k) A: V2 can host people on phones, but you need dev skills to spin up your own server or use hosting services. VR support isn't ready yet. (answered by Agent12 and maximus)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on app development in Hyperfy, with significant discussion around a rain effect app being developed by Gert-Jan Akerboom. The rain app creates circles on the ground that needed improvements like fade-out effects and better positioning controls. Developers discussed texture scrolling techniques for visual effects, with cru sharing a blend file as reference. There was also technical discussion about rigidbody physics implementation, with smickelbeard working through issues with colliders and raycasts. A key discovery was that `world.attach(body)` is required for raycasts and rigidbodies to function properly. Other topics included environment variable access, Android volume control issues with voice chat, and app positioning/manipulation challenges. The community demonstrated collaborative problem-solving, sharing code snippets, reference files, and troubleshooting advice.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can apps access all environment variables in a world? (asked by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host) A: Unanswered\nQ: How do I grab and position an app accurately? (asked by vox) A: You can 'aim' at the circles on the ground and press 'r' until you catch it, and then you can move it. Also added a cube for grabbing that can be turned on/off in UI. (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: Can we now lock apps and models to not be accidentally moved around? (asked by vox) A: Yes, you can pin them. (answered by vox/Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: Why doesn't my rigidbody code add physics to my app? (asked by smickelbeard) A: You need to use dynamic instead of kinematic, use radius instead of size for sphere colliders, and call world.attach(body). (answered by ash/.hyp shaman/peezy)\nQ: Should two dynamic rigidbodies collide with one another? (asked by smickelbeard) A: Only if they are 'convex'. (answered by .hyp shaman)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: cru | Helpee: Gert-Jan Akerboom | Context: Needed reference for texture scrolling implementation | Resolution: Shared original blend file with seamless grid texture\nHelper: peezy | Helpee: smickelbeard | Context: Incorrect collider configuration for physics | Resolution: Explained that collider.size does nothing and suggested using radius for sphere colliders\nHelper: .hyp shaman | Helpee: smickelbeard | Context: Rigidbody collision issues | Resolution: Explained that dynamic rigidbodies need to be 'convex' to collide with each other\nHelper: ash | Helpee: smickelbeard | Context: Incorrect rigidbody type | Resolution: Explained that kinematic doesn't move and dynamic should be used instead\nHelper: Gert-Jan Akerboom | Helpee: vox | Context: Difficulty positioning app | Resolution: Added a cube for grabbing that can be toggled on/off in UI\n\n## 4.

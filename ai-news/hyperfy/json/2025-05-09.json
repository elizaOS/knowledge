      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on agent development in Hyperfy, VRM avatar implementation, and world-building features. Ashxn provided technical details about the node client for agents, explaining that it properly runs all systems regular players do, including physics and player controllers, making agents behave almost identically to human players. Jin mentioned working on \"stonk market world\" (https://hyperfy.io/stonkwip) and converting avatars to VRM format. Vox announced that v2 now supports screenUV video with streaming, UVscrolling, and agents. There was also discussion about documentation resources, with Ashxn pointing to both the docs folder in the repo and the community knowledge base at docs.hyperfy.xyz. The chat included sharing of examples showing flying mechanics and barrel rolls, suggesting vehicle or movement system development is progressing.\n\n## 2.

The main technical points include:\n- Ashxn mentioned that the Hyperfy platform development was paused for R&D to ensure the best direction, which is now \"locked in\" and moving to execution phase\n- Agent12 noted that since Hyperfy Core is open-source, there have been community efforts to make Hyperfy compatible with both Solana ecosystem and EVM\n- There was a brief mention of documentation links, specifically that docs.hyperfy.xyz should replace the old hyperfy.how link\n- AI integration was briefly mentioned as being part of Hyperfy's vision, with AI entities intended to play games and teach people in virtual worlds\n\nThe chat also included health advice about desk work, a question about platform launch timing, and general greetings.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When do you plan to launch the platform? (asked by Alexa) A: I can't give dates but it'll happen out of nowhere like most things we do here. We paused on the platform to do some RND and make sure we were going in the absolute best direction. That direction is now locked in so it's execution time. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: No ai? (asked by johan) A: It's literally in the pic haha. AI are like humans. We want them playing games and teaching people etc in every world. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Curious if the platform will be Solana or multi-chain (asked by nettuser) A: Since the Core is Open-Source there has been community efforts towards making Hyperfy usable for BOTH Solana ecosystem and EVM Compatibility.

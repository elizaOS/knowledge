      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussions in the developers channel primarily focused on technical aspects of the Hyperfy platform, particularly around agent implementation, VRM avatars, and vehicle physics. Ashxn shared details about the node-client for agents that properly runs all systems regular players do, including physics and player controllers. There was significant interest in vehicle mechanics, with Ashxn sharing videos of car implementations and explaining that vehicles are being pivoted to use a single armature with bones for moving parts (wheels, doors, lights) to optimize draw calls. TheMattEmpire provided technical tips for VRM blendshapes in Blender, specifically how to combine multiple mesh blendshapes into presets and optimize file size. The channel also touched on world functionality in v2, including screenUV video with streaming, UV scrolling, and agent capabilities. Several members expressed excitement about implementing vehicles and agents in their projects.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are the avatars shown in the Twitter link VRM? (asked by jin) A: Yes, they are VRM because they're literally players (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Should I stall working with the eliza agent starter repo? (asked by 0mka) A: No, but the dev branch has an agent.mjs file showing how to use the true node client (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a single place/board kept up to date with core functionality for v2? (asked by hiroP) A: The docs folder in the repo includes all functionality and is comprehensive, plus https://docs.hyperfy.xyz has community knowledge (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a max file size/video length for videos? (asked by vincentskele) A: It's a setting per world (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: We got any cars with solid drifting/Dirt Showdown mechanics yet? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Ashxn shared a video of cars from about 3 weeks prior (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is it possible to start making our own vehicles? (asked by ~/drdoge.eth) A: Yes, everything is in the engine including skinnedmesh.getBone() and physics for raycasting suspension (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of ⚡│general Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy platform development updates and technical discussions. Ashxn mentioned that the platform will initially be Solana-focused due to synergy with their token, though EVM mods already exist for self-hosting. The team has paused platform development to conduct R&D and determine the best direction, which is now \"locked in\" for execution. There was discussion about embedding Hyperfy worlds in Next.js applications, with clarification that while Next.js is for 2D websites, Hyperfy worlds can be embedded via iframes. The multiplayer component presents challenges for serverless applications like Vercel. Community members discussed portfolio use cases for Hyperfy, noting its advantage over Three.js for creating 3D environments. Hyperworld.host was recommended as a solution for embedding worlds or pointing subdomains to them. There was also mention of React Native potentially enabling mobile app development for Hyperfy.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When do you plan to launch the platform? (asked by Alexa) A: I can't give dates but it'll happen out of nowhere like most things we do here. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Will the platform be Solana or multi-chain? (asked by nettuser) A: Initially the platform will be Solana focused as it has a synergy with our token, and yeah there are evm mods already for those self hosting. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can anyone clarify the actual market cap for Hyper, is it currently 6.2 or 2.7? (asked by Greguar) A: Fully diluted 6.2, market cap takes into account circulating supply. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Do you think it's possible to spin a world on a next.js vercel web app? (asked by Sceth iii) A: It's difficult to deploy on vercel because hyperfy requires a server to be running and vercel focuses on serverless applications. (answered by peezy)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: Sceth iii | Context: Integrating Hyperfy worlds with Next.js websites | Resolution: Suggested using hyperworld.host and either embedding iframe in Next.js website or pointing a subdomain to hyperworld\nHelper: peezy | Helpee: Sceth iii | Context: Explaining limitations of deploying Hyperfy on Vercel | Resolution: Clarified that multiplayer component requires a server, but single-player experiences or embedding are possible\nHelper: Agent12 | Helpee: nettuser | Context: Question about blockchain compatibility | Resolution: Explained that community efforts have made Hyperfy usable for both Solana and EVM compatibility\nHelper: maximus | Helpee: vox | Context: Sharing experience about workplace ergonomics | Resolution: Provided additional context about monitor positioning and importance of taking breaks\n\n## 4.

Ashxn provided some information about the utility of the Hyper token, explaining that it powers the marketplace, DAO, and a narrative-driven experience with digital items and avatars. They mentioned that the \"forge\" allows users to mint digital items backed by the Hyper token. There was also a mention of future staking plans, though these are not imminent. A question about Hyper's market cap was raised, with conflicting figures of 6.2 and 2.7 (units unspecified), but no definitive answer was provided. The conversation included minimal technical details or problem-solving.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can anyone clarify the actual market cap for Hyper, is it currently 6.2 or 2.7?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat in the \"🐞│issues\" channel focused on two main technical issues. First, Gert-Jan Akerboom reported an inability to access the \"play world\" environment, which ash investigated and potentially reset, resolving the issue. Second, Gert-Jan encountered a problem with NEON apps in a world where the color settings weren't being maintained individually when multiple apps were added - instead, all apps would revert to the default color when a new one was added. Ash explained this was due to the engine's mesh instancing behavior, where \"unique\" settings still share materials behind the scenes. Ash provided a technical solution by suggesting setting `mesh.linked=false` to unlink meshes, while noting this approach would impact performance at scale.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When adding multiple NEON apps to a world, why doesn't the color setting remain unique for each app? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: The \"unique\" setting applies to settings but the engine still instances meshes behind the scenes, causing them to share materials. You can unlink meshes with mesh.linked=false, but this reduces performance at scale. (answered by ash)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Gert-Jan Akerboom | Context: Unable to access the \"play world\" environment | Resolution: ash investigated and possibly reset the environment, after which Gert-Jan confirmed it was working again\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Gert-Jan Akerboom | Context: NEON apps color settings not remaining unique when adding multiple apps | Resolution: ash explained the technical reason (mesh instancing) and provided a solution (setting mesh.linked=false)\n\n## 4.

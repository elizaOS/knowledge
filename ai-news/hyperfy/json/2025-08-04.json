It contains only four messages: two morning greetings (\"gm\") from users Ashxn and ailes, and a longer message from Natefrog proposing a concept called \"Spatial Democracy.\" Natefrog suggests implementing Hyperfy as a platform for spatial DAO governance, where community members could participate in governance through immersive 3D experiences rather than traditional token voting. The proposal includes ideas like quadratic voting mechanisms, a Governance Amphitheater, Conviction Voting Rooms, and Privacy Zones using zero-knowledge proofs. Natefrog also suggests positioning Hyperfy as an infrastructure layer for spatial governance that other DAOs could use, potentially creating new revenue streams.\n\n## 2.

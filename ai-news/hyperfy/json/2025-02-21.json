Ashxn announced that iPhone worlds now run without external dependencies. Significant discussions centered around implementing UIImage for displaying images in UI windows, with Omka providing code examples and implementation details. The effects system received an update, moving from player.setEffect() to control.setEffect() to better track app lifecycles and prevent players from getting stuck with effects. Peezy improved the Solana branch with networked wallets, allowing for player-to-player token transfers. Other technical achievements included object avoidance using raycasting, backend integration for board games, and animation conversion tools. Developers shared various implementations including particle systems, automatic doors with trigger zones, and a documentation search tool. The community actively collaborated on solving problems and sharing code snippets.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do we add an image into a UI window? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Use UIImage component (answered by MetaMike and Omka)\nQ: How can I make an action ontrigger activate by player proximity and not E? (asked by Omka) A: Don't use an action; instead create a trigger zone using rigidbody with a collider (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can I use the .onPointerDown on a uiview? (asked by Omka) A: It works with the crosshair pointer; check the stereo app on hyperworld (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Are there docs somewhere for packaging things up into .hyp apps? (asked by cwe) A: After you write a script with a model, click the download button (answered by Saori)\nQ: How would you limit builders to certain areas? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: It's challenging because scripts can move meshes anywhere; unlike Minecraft where blocks are on a grid (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there anyway to embedded audio in a .hyp file without exposing it to the inspector using props? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Maybe props should have a \"hidden\" value (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around technical discussions about 3D asset optimization for web-based metaverse environments in Hyperfy. A significant conversation between treed and ùöüùöòùö°ùöüùöíùöéùöóùöóùöé focused on optimizing 3D architectural assets, with detailed discussion about triangle counts, file sizes, and the balance between visual quality and performance. They discussed how complex architectural assets require different optimization benchmarks than smaller objects. Several optimization tools were mentioned including gltf.report, glb.babylonpress.org, and Spark AR add-on for Blender.\n\nThe chat also touched on Hyperfy V2, which was released over a month ago and no longer requires an NFT to create worlds. There was a brief technical discussion about PhysX support in NVIDIA's RTX 50-series GPUs and how Hyperfy handles physics in the browser, with Ashxn clarifying that Hyperfy runs physics on CPU with WASM that supports SIMD. Documentation efforts were discussed, with multiple members working on consolidating documentation from various sources into hyperfy.how using Starlight Astro.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are there any competitors to Hyperfy at the moment? (asked by cloudAI) A: Depends what you mean by competitors. Game engines - yes. But that category is too broad. (answered by MetaMike)\nQ: Do we still need an nft to create a world? (asked by IamKR) A: For v2, nope. https://hyperfy.how/setup/quickstart/ to set up locally then self-host or go to https://hyperworld.host/ to have them host and spin up world. (answered by Omka)\nQ: When hyper v2 released? (asked by mkl) A: Over a month ago. (answered by HPrivakos)\nQ: Would NVIDIA RTX 50-series not supporting PhysX have an impact on Hyperfy? (asked by HPrivakos) A: It's mainly 32-bit support dropped. 64-bit still supported. (answered by Valiant)\nQ: Would a server hosting hyperfy benefit from having a GPU that supports PhysX? (asked by HPrivakos) A: We're running it on the CPU. The WASM we have DOES support SIMD though so it could theoretically use the GPU, but it's already extremely fast. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: I still don't understand how physx works in the browser without a Nvidia card? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: It's just a physics engine. You give it colliders and it simulates. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can someone link the public V2 play space? (asked by Paradoxx) A: Play.hyperfy.xyz (answered by devilsadvocate.sol)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of üßä‚îÇ3d-design Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on 3D asset optimization for web-based environments, particularly in Hyperfy. TheMattEmpire shared a solution for converting A-Pose to T-Pose for VRMs in Blender, which fixed avatar rigging issues. A significant portion of the conversation revolved around technical aspects of asset optimization, including polygon count reduction, material management, and draw calls. Ashxn explained that in game engines, meshes can only have one shader, and multiple materials on one object in Blender actually become multiple meshes elsewhere. The chat explored how Hyperfy handles instancing, with Ashxn confirming that duplicated objects are automatically instanced, significantly improving performance. Sceth demonstrated polygon reduction techniques using Zbrush, reducing a 105k poly building to 60k while maintaining visual fidelity. The discussion also covered vertex colors as an alternative to textures in some cases. Performance considerations for web-based 3D experiences were extensively discussed, with participants debating the balance between visual quality and performance, particularly for avatars and large environments.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do you set current position as rest pose in Blender for VRMs? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Use the method described at https://egneva.com/how-to-set-current-position-as-rest-pose-in-blender/ to convert A-Pose to T-Pose (answered by TheMattEmpire)\nQ: How do materials and meshes relate to draw calls? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Each material creates a separate draw call; if you have multiple materials on one mesh in Blender, they become separate meshes in game engines (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How does instancing work in Hyperfy? (asked by Sceth iii) A: Duplicated objects are automatically instanced; you can place hundreds of objects with minimal performance impact (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What happens when you edit an instanced object in Hyperfy? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: If objects are linked (not unique), changing one will update all linked instances; you can use \"Unique\" toggle to unlink duplicates (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can you optimize a high-poly model while maintaining visual fidelity? (asked by treed) A: Use decimation tools like those in Zbrush to reduce polygon count; a 105k model could be reduced to around 60k without noticeable quality loss (answered by Sceth iii)\nQ: What are the recommended polygon counts for VRMs? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Around 15k is medium, but it depends on the end experience and must consider material count and texture resolution too (answered by TheMattEmpire)\nQ: What are the performance limitations for web-based 3D experiences? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: WebGL has hard limits compared to native applications; optimization is crucial for browser-based experiences (answered by TheMattEmpire)\n\n## 3.

Participants debated when each approach is more appropriate, with cost versus accuracy being a key consideration. They explored analogies to human learning, comparing the AI model to the human brain and discussing how humans learn through both structural changes (like neural pathways) and contextual information. The conversation touched on how fine-tuning might be more cost-effective at scale, while context works better for dynamic information. There was also mention of the challenges in explaining these technical concepts to newcomers who view AI capabilities as \"black magic\" rather than understanding the underlying mechanisms.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What's the difference between fine-tuning a model and feeding it context? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: It's a balance between efficiency and accuracy; fine-tuning changes the model weights while context provides information without changing the model (answered by maximus)\nQ: When would you want to tune a model versus feed it context? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Fine-tuning is better for large/specific project scopes and can be more cost-effective at scale, while context works better for dynamic information (answered by maximus)\nQ: Why aren't more people doing fine-tuning with all the agent hype? (asked by MetaMike) A: It feels like \"black magic\" to most people who don't understand the difference between training and providing context (answered by devilsadvocate.sol)\n\n## 3.

Key discussions included:\n\nAshxn announced iPhone worlds now run without external dependencies. A significant focus was on UI image implementation, with Omka providing code examples for displaying images from URLs in UI windows. The chat revealed limitations with certain file formats (SVG, WebP) due to CORS errors.\n\nPlayer effects were enhanced with Ashxn moving them to the control system (`control.setEffect()`) to prevent players from getting stuck when apps are modified. A new \"turn\" option was added that makes players face the camera direction, useful for weapons and interactive objects.\n\nPeezy improved the Solana branch with networked wallets, allowing player-to-player token transfers. The token program now dynamically retrieves metadata tokens, simplifying script development.\n\nSeveral developers shared progress on projects: MayD524 demonstrated object avoidance using raycasting, Bear connected Hyperfy to a custom backend for board games, and Omka created a documentation search tool. Developers also explored animation integration, with Saori sharing scripts to convert Mixamo animations to Hyperfy-compatible GLB format.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do we add an image into a UI window? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Use UIImage (answered by MetaMike and Omka with code examples)\nQ: How can I make an action ontrigger activate by player proximity and not E?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around technical discussions about 3D asset optimization for web-based metaverse environments in Hyperfy. A significant conversation between voxvienne and treed focused on optimizing 3D architectural assets, discussing triangle counts, file sizes, and performance considerations for complex geometry. They debated the balance between visual quality and performance, with voxvienne suggesting that while treed's 3.9MB asset was acceptable, further optimization could help when combining multiple complex assets in a scene.\n\nDocumentation efforts were highlighted with mentions of hyperfy.how, a documentation site built with Starlight Astro, and discussions about consolidating documentation from various sources. Omka mentioned working on putting all docs in-world with UI components and search functionality.\n\nTechnical updates included discussions about PhysX support in NVIDIA's RTX 50-series GPUs, with clarification that Hyperfy runs physics on CPU using WASM with SIMD support. The chat also revealed that Hyperfy V2 has been released over a month ago and no longer requires an NFT to create worlds.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are there any competitors to Hyperfy at the moment? (asked by cloudAI) A: Depends what you mean by competitors. Game engines - yes. But that category is too broad. (answered by MetaMike)\nQ: Do we still need an nft to create a world? (asked by IamKR) A: For v2, nope. https://hyperfy.how/setup/quickstart/ to set up locally then self-host or go to https://hyperworld.host/ to have them host and spin up world. (answered by Omka)\nQ: When hyper v2 released? (asked by mkl) A: Over a month ago. (answered by HPrivakos)\nQ: NVIDIA RTX 50-series doesn't seem to support PhysX, would that have an impact on Hyperfy? (asked by HPrivakos) A: Seems to be 32-bit support dropped. 64-bit still supported...according to an Overclock3d article. (answered by Valiant)\nQ: Would a server hosting hyperfy benefit from having a GPU that supports PhysX? (asked by HPrivakos) A: Nah we're running it on the cpu. The wasm we have DOES support simd though so it could theoretically use the GPU, but it's already extremely fast. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: I still don't understand how physx works in the browser without a Nvidia card? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: It's just a physics engine. You give it colliders and it simulates. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can someone link the public V2 play space? (asked by Paradoxx) A: Play.hyperfy.xyz (answered by devilsadvocate.sol)\n\n## 3.

Summary:\nThis chat segment primarily consists of price tracking for the HYPER token on Solana, with users repeatedly checking its value using the \"$hyperfy\" command. The conversation shows HYPER's price fluctuating between approximately $9.6M and $10.9M market cap with varying percentage changes. There is minimal technical discussion, with only brief mentions of Ethereum's transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, gas prices, and a reference to \"hyperfy game loops\" potentially enabling token mining. Users express mixed sentiment during what appears to be a market downturn, with some continuing to DCA (Dollar Cost Average) despite losses. There's a brief mention of Hyperfy v2 having been released approximately two months prior to the conversation. The chat lacks substantial technical problem-solving or implementation discussions.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: When hyper v2 released?

      "summary": "# Analysis of 🧊│3d-design Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on 3D asset optimization for web-based environments, particularly in Hyperfy. TheMattEmpire shared a solution for converting A-Pose to T-Pose for VRMs in Blender, which fixed avatar rigging issues. A significant portion of the conversation revolved around technical aspects of asset optimization, including polygon count reduction, material management, and draw calls. Ashxn explained that in game engines, meshes can only have one shader, and multiple materials on one object in Blender actually represent multiple meshes elsewhere. The chat explored how Hyperfy handles instancing, with Ashxn confirming that duplicated objects are automatically instanced, significantly improving performance. Sceth demonstrated polygon reduction techniques using ZBrush, reducing a 105k poly building to 60k while maintaining visual fidelity. The discussion also covered vertex color attributes as an alternative to textures in some cases. Performance considerations for web-based 3D experiences were extensively discussed, with participants comparing WebGL limitations to native applications and debating appropriate polygon counts and file sizes for avatars and environments.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do you set current position as rest pose in Blender for VRMs? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Use the method described at https://egneva.com/how-to-set-current-position-as-rest-pose-in-blender/ to convert A-Pose to T-Pose (answered by TheMattEmpire)\nQ: How do materials and meshes relate to draw calls? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Each material creates a separate draw call; if you have multiple materials on one mesh in Blender, it's actually multiple meshes in the game engine (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How does instancing work in Hyperfy? (asked by Sceth iii) A: Duplicated objects are automatically instanced; you can place hundreds of objects and they'll be optimized, with limitations mainly being GPU-related (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: If an asset is linked and I update the model in the .hyp, would all linked assets be updated too? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Yes, if it's not unique and you have duplicates, changing the model, code, or props of any app will update all linked ones (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do you make duplicates unique in Hyperfy? (asked by Omka) A: Click \"Unique\" inside an app to ensure all duplicates are always unlinked (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What are the recommended material counts for optimization? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: 1 is best, 2-3 is fine, 3-6 is on the high end, 6+ is heavy (answered by ii_cable_ii)\nQ: How many polygons is acceptable for a large building asset? (asked by treed) A: For a building with complex architecture, 60-100k triangles is reasonable; reducing below 60k starts to lose shape fidelity (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can vertex colors be used instead of textures in Hyperfy? (asked by Sceth iii) A: Yes, Hyperfy supports vertex colors, which can be a useful optimization technique (answered by Sceth iii)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"🤖│agents\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on the differences between fine-tuning AI models versus providing context. MetaMike initiated the conversation by expressing surprise that more people aren't doing fine-tuning despite the agent hype. Participants debated the merits of both approaches, with devilsadvocate.sol suggesting that fine-tuning seems like \"black magic\" to average users who struggle to understand the difference between training and providing context. Maximus shared resources explaining when to use RAG versus fine-tuning, noting that context works well for dynamic information while fine-tuning is better for establishing baseline behaviors. The conversation evolved into an analogy comparing AI models to human brains, with Omka pointing out that brains constantly tune themselves through neural plasticity. Devilsadvocate.sol also mentioned the challenge of explaining to a friend that AI agents can be programmed simply by telling them what to do, highlighting the counterintuitive nature of prompt engineering for newcomers.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What is the difference between fine-tuning and providing context to an AI model? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Fine-tuning changes the weights of the model to better suit specific needs, while context provides information without changing the model itself. For dynamic information like game states, context works better, while fine-tuning is good for establishing baseline behaviors. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Why aren't more people doing fine-tuning despite the agent hype? (asked by MetaMike) A: It feels like \"black magic\" to most people, and it's difficult to explain the difference between training and providing context. Most developers prefer to use existing models rather than optimize further. (answered by devilsadvocate.sol and maximus)\nQ: When would you want to tune a model versus feed it context? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: It depends on project scope, scale, and cost considerations. It's a balance between efficiency and accuracy. (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3.

Currently, the engine runs in \"standalone\" mode with co-located components (world folder, assets, SQLite DB). The proposed infrastructure changes would enable scaling through ephemeral containers that launch on-demand. The architecture would separate client and server components, each configurable through environment variables. Client configurations would include connection strategies (direct or resolver-based), while server configurations would support different asset strategies (local folder or Cloudflare R2) and database strategies (local SQLite or remote PostgreSQL). This approach would enable cost-effective world hosting ($3-9/month per world based on Hetzner's $200/month for 128GB/80 cores that could host 32-64 worlds). A critical bug was identified where some environment configurations used \"http://\" instead of \"ws://\" for WebSocket URLs, causing loading issues specifically on iOS/Safari devices.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How much would it cost to run worlds at scale? (implied by ash) A: About $3.2/world/month on Hetzner hardware, potentially $5-9/month for a hosting service (answered by DefiniteOptimist)\nQ: Why are some worlds not working on iPhone?

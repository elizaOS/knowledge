      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat \"💻│developers\"\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe discussion primarily revolves around Hyperfy's development, focusing on app cloning, controller modes, and inter-app communication. Developers explored cloning app objects with `app.clone(true)` to recursively clone meshes, with Ashxn providing guidance on proper implementation. A significant debate emerged about control schemes, with many advocating for separate \"build mode\" and \"game mode\" controllers to improve user experience. Saori argued that the current approach limits gameplay possibilities, while Ashxn was concerned about maintaining accessibility for non-technical users. The team also discussed asset optimization challenges, with some suggesting that requiring Blender knowledge is inevitable while others advocated for supporting direct use of optimized Sketchfab models. Developers implemented new features including flying mode, pointer lock controls, and a hierarchy inspector for viewing object structures. The chat also covered inter-app communication using world events, allowing apps to share data and coordinate behaviors. Other topics included Docker image optimization, Solana wallet integration, and TypeScript adoption considerations.\n\n## 2. FAQ\n\nQ: How do I properly clone an app or mesh? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Use `app.clone(true)` with the true parameter to recursively clone all child elements. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can I get the actual avatar position when using world.getPlayer()? (asked by Shiffty) A: Use `player.position.copy()` to get the position, but be aware of potential offsets when working with child meshes. (answered by Saori)\nQ: Is there a way to add a spawnpoint? (asked by ToxSam) A: Use the command \"/spawn set\" to set a spawn point. (answered by HPrivakos)\nQ: How do I enable flying in build mode? (asked by ToxSam) A: Double jump to activate flying mode. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Will Hyperfy be moved to TypeScript? (asked by 0xBison) A: While TypeScript would be beneficial long-term, it's not a priority as the codebase is too far along and resources are limited. (answered by Saori)\nQ: How can apps communicate with each other? (asked by MetaMike) A: Use world.emit() and world.on() to broadcast and listen for events between different app instances. (answered by MetaMike)\n\n## 3.

Users shared tweets about repository chat functionality and discussed the Eliza app's behavior. One user (peezy) experienced confusion about how the Eliza app was functioning on their local environment, initially thinking it was \"alive by itself\" before realizing it was part of the overview page. The discussion clarified that when exporting an app, it includes the config fields' contents as metadata. Later, another user (drdoge.eth) mentioned successfully getting Eliza to recognize surroundings for directions, indicating progress with the agent's spatial awareness capabilities.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around cryptocurrency trading discussions, particularly focusing on the HYPER token and various meme coins on the Solana blockchain. Users shared trading experiences with tokens like CHLOE, which saw significant price volatility. There was discussion about claiming HYPER tokens from an airdrop, with users seeking guidance on the process. The community also discussed potential improvements to the token's visibility, suggesting updates to Twitter profiles and linktrees to better promote HYPER. A brief technical discussion occurred regarding a suspicious RPC product (CELIO) where code comments revealed potential fraudulent activity. Additionally, there was conversation about Hyperfy's hosting platform pricing tiers, with suggestions to add a mid-tier option between the $5 and $25 plans. The chat also touched on Roblox's revenue model for creators, noting the platform takes approximately 70-80% of earnings.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I claim my hyper tokens?

Key technical discussions included:\n\nQuad topology vs. triangles in 3D models, with users noting that quad-based models from Meshy are better for retopology and decimation. Users shared examples of models with good quad topology that could be easily optimized.\n\nSignificant discussion about Hyperfy Tools, a Blender addon that enables snap points for modular assets. The tool requires rigidbodies to be applied before export, and users explored its functionality for creating interconnectable 3D assets.\n\nAsset optimization was a major theme, with users discussing texture compression (JPG vs. PNG vs. WebP), mesh instancing, and draw call reduction. A test confirmed that linked duplicates in Blender automatically instance in Hyperfy v2, improving performance.\n\nUsers also discussed Hyperfy v2's interface controls, particularly the inverted mouse wheel zoom direction between Windows and Mac, which was subsequently fixed in development.\n\nSeveral creative projects were shared, including modular road systems, a \"portable hacker hut,\" and a Fallout-inspired \"EyeBotRadio\" for Hyperfy worlds.\n\n## 2.

First, a user (b34k3r) sought help with embedded Discord activity SDK integration in Hyperfy, encountering CSP and proxy issues when trying to load external scripts. Second, HypPrivakos shared a Docker multi-stage build approach to reduce image size from over 300MB to around 130MB by moving client dependencies to devDependencies and optimizing the build process. The Dockerfile uses a two-stage approach: a builder stage with full dependencies and a production stage that only copies necessary build artifacts. While functional, HypPrivakos noted this approach might not be production-ready and could break in future updates. Finally, there was a discussion about world portability between hosting services, with users expressing interest in functionality to export worlds with app coordinates preserved, allowing users to maintain control of their data when switching hosting providers.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Anyone use embedded discord activity sdk? (asked by b34k3r) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can I export my world if I use a 3rd party hosting service?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on 3D design techniques for creating realistic environments. Ashxn shared a technique for creating grass that blends into the ground by forcing grass normals upward, allowing PBR materials to correctly respond to lighting changes while preventing shadow casting between grass and ground elements. This approach mimics techniques used in games like Disney Dreamlight Valley. 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 discussed building a large-scale city environment using optimization techniques like atlasing and instancing to maintain performance while preserving visual quality. They mentioned using AI as a helper for 3D design and Krea for altering base textures to achieve different architectural styles. The community showed enthusiasm for these techniques, with discussions about their potential applications in creating immersive environments. There were also attempts to test a 3D environment in VR mode, but users encountered technical issues where the VR mode wouldn't fully load despite the environment running well on mobile and PC.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can anyone get this running in VR? (asked by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎) A: Users reported issues with VR mode not loading properly (answered by drdoge.eth)\nQ: What are you working on?

      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on UI updates, performance optimizations, and new features in Hyperfy. Ashxn pushed updates including physics material optimization that improved occlusion culling on mobile devices. Peezy discussed an AI assistant package integration with the new UI, featuring provider selection (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter) and model customization. Ashxn demonstrated a PRNG-based environmental asset system that efficiently places thousands of objects without networking individual transforms, creating consistent worlds that perform well on mobile and VR. The team discussed VR compatibility issues on PICO 4 headsets. Ashxn created a Blender plugin for non-destructive Hyperfy-specific properties. Vox showcased a world using heavy instancing for mobile optimization. Several technical challenges were addressed including transparency performance in VR, screen sharing functionality requiring LiveKit integration, and collision/movement mechanics that allow players to climb supposedly inaccessible areas.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Did anything change with occlusion culling? (asked by MetaRick) A: The physics material optimization might matter a lot on mobile. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is the new UI style 100% done? (asked by peezy) A: There are a few things that could be cleaned up but there's no rush. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Are there any \"connector\" standards for AI providers? (asked by Ashxn) A: Everything uses OpenAI SDK pointing to different endpoints except for Anthropic. (answered by peezy)\nQ: Why isn't VR working on PICO 4? (asked by PabloFM | Numinia) A: Performance matters for VR; PICO 4 should run Hyperfy but might need browser/firmware updates. (answered by Ashxn and hypb0gie)\nQ: When I hold F to use the TV with screen sharing, it just keeps cycling through. Is this something others have come across? (asked by vincentskele) A: You need LiveKit server for screen sharing functionality. (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3.

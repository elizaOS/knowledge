      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on UI development and package management in what appears to be a Hyperfy-based 3D environment. 3rdEyeVisuals mentioned updating UIVideo to be compatible with z-indexing and later confirmed implementing respect for UI RenderOrder, including an option to remove transparency from UI element containers. They decided to keep video elements behind the root UI to prevent visual distraction and text readability issues. There was a brief discussion about package management safety, with 3rdEyeVisuals warning about the risks of using --force when updating packages as it could break dependency compatibility. A user named 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰 inquired about integrating Eliza into their 3D world, to which 3rdEyeVisuals responded that if Eliza isn't already integrated into Hyperfy's backend, implementation would be complex. The conversation also touched on development environments, with .hyp shaman mentioning using bun locally and reminding about setting .env.local files.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where and how should I import an app like Eliza into the code so I can use it in my 3D world? (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰) A: If the Eliza framework is not already integrated into the backend of Hyperfy framework then it will be a lot more complex than just plug and play with the repo. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\nQ: Just create elisa folder in src and clone the repo? (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is it really important to do npm audit fix (without --force)? Any security risk for later in world? (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰) A: If you --force updates to your packages you could actually break things. Need to be careful there. Some dependencies only play nice with certain versions of other dependencies. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\n\n## 3.

Community members discuss the role of blockchain integration, with some noting it shouldn't be forced where traditional databases would suffice. There's debate about what constitutes a metaverse, with some advocating for connected worlds versus isolated experiences. The marketplace functionality (hyperworld.host/marketplace) is mentioned as existing but potentially needing better curation to avoid confusing new users. Technical features like solar panels (which control skybox, sunlight, and fog) and platforms are briefly discussed. A community member expresses frustration about V2 lacking core crypto components that were available in V1. The conversation reflects ongoing development challenges and differing visions for Hyperfy's direction, with some emphasizing building engaging worlds over focusing solely on cryptocurrency integration.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What does a solar panel do in Hyperfy? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: It controls the skybox, sunlight, fog, etc. (answered by ash)\nQ: Would it be possible to toggle on a right analog stick for camera movement instead of using screen?

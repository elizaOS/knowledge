      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in 🪙│hyper Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe conversation revolves around integrating web3 functionality, specifically Phantom wallet, into Hyperfy V2. 3rdEyeVisuals mentions having successfully implemented Phantom wallet integration with V2 and web3 transactions, describing it as \"extremely easy.\" Maximus provides context about V1's design decisions, noting that crypto integration was intentionally kept separate to avoid alienating non-crypto users, with the marketplace intended as the distribution method for blockchain extensions. There's discussion about potentially packaging this functionality as a .hyp file, though 3rdEyeVisuals indicates this would require additional work. They mention plans to open-source their custom implementation due to GPL license requirements, though users would still need to implement certain core components themselves.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it a Hype that I can add to Current Core? Or is this \"Devs Ohmly\" kind of thing? (asked by Agent12) A: No, its not a .hyp. That would be pretty cool. Would take a bit to figure that out. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: 3rdEyeVisuals | Helpee: Agent12 | Context: Agent12 asking about web3 integration availability as a .hyp package | Resolution: 3rdEyeVisuals offered to share custom source code and plans to open-source it before release due to GPL license requirements.\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Create a .hyp package for Phantom wallet and web3 integration | Description: Package the custom web3 integration into a distributable .hyp file | Mentioned By: Agent12 and 3rdEyeVisuals\nDocumentation: Document the custom web3 integration implementation | Description: Create documentation for the open-sourced web3 integration | Mentioned By: 3rdEyeVisuals",

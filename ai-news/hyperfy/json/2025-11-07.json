      "summary": "# Analysis of ⚡│general Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily discusses Hyperscape, a fork of Hyperfy v2 that has been heavily modified. Ash clarifies that Hyperscape uses Hyperfy's core functionality but removes features like in-world live-building and scripting. The conversation then shifts to ideas for enhancing Hyperfy, with Jayzen suggesting a global map to create a more cohesive metaverse experience and network effect. This sparked debate about the nature of the metaverse, with mrtzhckr arguing that the metaverse won't be singular but rather consist of countless environments tailored to specific industries and communities. Community members discussed potential implementations of a map feature, including a submission process for worlds and visualization similar to bubble maps or graph views. The chat also touched on the open-source nature of Hyperfy and appreciation for access to the source code. Dhin mentioned working on a wall hang feature that needs animations and further development.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is Hyperscape built on Hyperfy?

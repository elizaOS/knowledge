      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussions primarily focused on Hyperfy world development, deployment options, and app development techniques. Key technical topics included:\n\nSelf-hosting options for Hyperfy worlds were discussed, with recommendations for Fly.io, Coolify, and hyperworld.host ($5). A new documentation website was highlighted.\n\nSeveral innovative apps were shared, including a navmesh generator with A* pathfinding that creates walkable areas by raycasting in a grid pattern. This sparked discussions about agent movement and potential applications.\n\nMayD524 released significant developer tools including TypeScript definitions for Hyperfy's API and a Rollup configuration for modular app development, allowing developers to work outside the single-file app scripting environment.\n\nAvatar scaling and customization were discussed, with drdoge.eth working on making avatar scale changes persist when equipped. The community also explored texture handling, physics floors, and environment customization.\n\nAudio implementation was discussed, with MetaMike working on integrating ElevenLabs for voice responses, and questions about streaming audio capabilities in Hyperfy.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is now the way to deploy a hyperfy world to prod to just like clone the repo work on it locally and they deploy it to vercel? (asked by yung_algorithm) A: Hyperfy offers self-hosting options including Fly.io and Coolify, or hyperworld.host for $5 (answered by Saori and maximus)\nQ: Any advice on making 2d games that i can launch from inside hyperfy? (asked by Hearteyez) A: Not possible at the moment (answered by Saori)\nQ: I've noticed the texture size is much bigger in the outliner than the jpgs loaded? Was just curious as to why that might be? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: That's texture VRAM, uncompressed and pushed to the GPU (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can we just replace the glb? Or will that just get written over next update? (asked by MetaRick) A: We can replace it if we use a different name or directly modify in src/core/assets, but cannot just replace the glb in world data as those are overwritten on restart (answered by HPrivakos and Ashxn)\nQ: Can eliza do image gen? (asked by Omka) A: Yes, through the plugin-image repository (answered by peezy)\nQ: Were you able to get the scale to stick to the avatar by any chance? (asked by maximus) A: Not yet, working on it today (answered by drdoge.eth)\nQ: If I am trying to have one node make another node appear in front of it, what's the best way to do it? (asked by Omka) A: You can clone nodes and add them to the app (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can anyone give me a tldr on how I would expose a new installed npm package to app scripting? (asked by MetaMike) A: Unanswered\nQ: We don't have streaming audio yet do we? (asked by MetaMike) A: Only for user dedicated audio sources, nothing like YouTube or Spotify (answered by drdoge.eth)\n\n## 3.

Key mentions include Anthropic AI (via a Twitter/X link), the Oracle Framework (GitHub repository), and Microsoft's Phi-4 AI model release. There's a specific technical note about ElevenLabs' response capabilities, with MetaMike mentioning they can achieve agent voice responses in under 2 seconds. The conversation is fragmented with minimal technical depth, consisting mostly of short updates, links to resources, and brief comments rather than detailed technical discussions or problem-solving.\n\n## 2.

Members discuss Hyperfy's development, tokenomics, and potential integrations. Saori clarifies the team's focus on adoption over token flywheel mechanics, emphasizing that using HYPER as a currency for the economy with community governance makes more sense than complex tokenomics. There are mentions of upcoming features like marketplace development and Abstract support. Community events are highlighted, including \"Hyperfy.How #2\" focusing on self-hosting tutorials. Some members express interest in AI integration with Hyperfy for game development. The community appears active with regular greetings and social interactions, with some potential partnership discussions initiated by the SMOL/Treasure team.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can I ask about the use of $hyper tokens and tokenomics and @hyperfy_io's plan to unlock tokens? (asked by harike7) A: Unanswered\nQ: I can't find any info on @hyperfy_io's unlock schedule yet, or does the team have no plans to announce it yet?

(asked by manbull) A: We'll have support for abstract but idk what abs broadcast is (answered by Saori)\nQ: What happened to the working flywheel in 3 weeks? (asked by zobo) A: I do not care about a token flywheel even slightly. I care about adoption... the thing that makes most sense for hyperfy is simply using hyper as a currency for the economy and incorporating community governance wherever applicable (answered by Saori)\nQ: How to enter this channel?

The conversation primarily revolves around token price tracking through the \"$hyperfy\" command, which displays the market cap and price change percentage for HYPER/SOL. There's concern about the token's status when Kami asks if it's \"dead,\" to which QMA seemingly confirms. Despite market volatility with Solana dropping significantly (~30%), users note that HYPER has maintained relative stability around $0.01. Abinge05 provides some market analysis, suggesting early panic sellers moved from HYPER to SOL, then later from SOL to stables. Saori mentions an upcoming \"insane web3 app\" launching in a month, though provides no technical details. There's also a brief mention of a Twitter hack affecting \"pump fun,\" but no technical details are discussed. Overall, this segment lacks substantive technical content, focusing instead on price action and brief, non-technical updates.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: So the token is dead? (asked by Kami) A: yes. (answered by QMA)\nQ: What happened? (asked by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎) A: twitter hacked (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: how is $HYPER staying strong at 0.01 when solana has dropped like 30% (asked by Knar) A: The weak hands were shaken out in low caps before they were shaken out in large caps. Probably also some panic hyper sellers swapped into SOL, then later panic sold sol into stables. (answered by abinge05)\nQ: wen solana pump (asked by Ashxn) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: abinge05 | Helpee: Knar | Context: Knar was confused about HYPER price stability despite SOL dropping 30% | Resolution: abinge05 explained market dynamics where weak hands were shaken out of low caps first, and described the likely token flow from HYPER to SOL to stables\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on technical discussions around Hyperfy's app system, model rendering, and vehicle physics. Key technical topics included:\n\n- Discussion of the \"unique\" flag behavior in Hyperfy's app system, with clarification on how it affects duplicated models and linked copies. When a model is marked as unique, new copies will be disconnected from the original, but existing copies remain linked.\n\n- Development of a web-based GLB model renderer (wizard.grape.wtf) that generates animated GIFs of 3D models for quick sharing on Discord, with ongoing work on framerate issues and download functionality.\n\n- Vehicle physics implementation, particularly with the \"hyperduck\" model that was modified to have F-35 jet dynamics. Users discussed anchoring, sliding issues at high speeds, and sitting animations.\n\n- Animation control challenges, specifically with looping animations and the need for proper sitting poses. There was confusion about a \"holdPose\" parameter that doesn't actually exist in the API.\n\n- Brief discussion on future water physics implementation, with suggestions to use swimming mode with buoyancy for objects in water volumes, and animated surfaces with splash effects for visual representation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does unique only effect models duplicated after you set it? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Unique just means, any new duplicates will be completely disconnected from anything. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What does it do if I had already duplicated a model and then hit unique on it? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: What it does now is if i had already duplicated it, the ones prior all act as a copy. so they all get set to unique, public etc. then the new ones copied from those with the unique flag aren't copies. (answered by devilsadvocate.sol)\nQ: Is there a bot that will render a glb model and return the image to discord? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Unanswered\nQ: How are we gonna deal with water physics? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: If inside volume use swimming mode with buoyancy i guess. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Do we have access to vertices at all? (asked by Shiffty) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

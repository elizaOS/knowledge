      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on Hyperfy world development, deployment options, and app creation. Key technical discussions included:\n\nSelf-hosting options were discussed, with recommendations for Fly.io, Coolify, and hyperworld.host ($5). Documentation is available at hyperfy.how/hosting/self.\n\nSeveral innovative apps were shared, including a navmesh generator with A* pathfinding by Shiffty, which uses raycasting in a grid pattern to create navigation points. This sparked discussion about potential applications for NPC movement.\n\nMayD524 released App-Rollup, a tool that allows developers to work with multiple files instead of a single app.js file, using Rollup to bundle everything together. This solves organization issues and enables code reuse across projects.\n\nTechnical challenges discussed included texture size discrepancies in the outliner vs loaded JPGs, replacing the default environment plane, and scaling avatars. Developers also shared TypeScript definitions for Hyperfy's API to improve IDE integration.\n\nA marketplace redesign was previewed by szjanko, featuring app collections, tags for searching/filtering, and a store for creators, encouraging developers to upload more apps with better preview images.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is now the way to deploy a hyperfy world to prod to just like clone the repo work on it locally and they deploy it to vercel? (asked by yung_algorithm) A: Hyperfy can be self-hosted using options documented at hyperfy.how/hosting/self, with Fly.io and Coolify recommended by community members. Alternatively, hyperworld.host offers hosting for $5. (answered by Saori and maximus)\nQ: Any advice on making 2d games that i can launch from inside hyperfy? (asked by Hearteyez) A: Not possible at the moment. (answered by Saori)\nQ: I've noticed the texture size is much bigger in the outliner than the jpgs loaded? Was just curious as to why that might be? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: That's texture VRAM, i.e., uncompressed and pushed to the GPU. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can we just replace the glb? Or will that just get written over next update? (asked by MetaRick) A: We can replace it if we use a different name or directly modify in src/core/assets, but we cannot just replace the glb in the world data as those are overwritten on each restart. (answered by HPrivakos)\nQ: Can eliza do image gen? (asked by Omka) A: Yes, there's a plugin available at github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-image. (answered by peezy)\nQ: Can I make one node create a duplicate of another node? (asked by Omka) A: Yes, using clone method: const dog2 = dog1.clone(true); app.add(dog2); (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can anyone give me a tldr on how I would expose a new installed npm package to app scripting? (asked by MetaMike) A: Unanswered\nQ: What's the best way to store mp3s from elevenlabs API? (asked by MetaMike) A: If elevenlabs API returns an mp3 URL, you can use it directly: const sound = app.create('audio', { src: 'http://...' }); sound.play(); (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

The conversation primarily revolves around price tracking of the HYPER token on Solana through bot commands ($hyperfy) that display market data. Users discuss price movements, with some expressing concern about the token's status when Kami asks if \"the token is dead\" and QMA responds affirmatively. There's mention of Twitter being hacked (likely referring to a project called \"pump fun\"). Saori makes a forward-looking statement about developing \"the most insane web3 app period\" expected in a month, though provides no technical details. The chat also includes discussion about market dynamics, with abinge05 offering an explanation for why HYPER maintained its price despite Solana dropping significantly, suggesting earlier capitulation of \"weak hands\" in low-cap assets compared to large-caps.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: So the token is dead? (asked by Kami) A: yes. (answered by QMA)\nQ: What happened? (asked by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎) A: twitter hacked (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: how is $HYPER staying strong at 0.01 when solana has dropped like 30%? (asked by Knar) A: The weak hands were shaken out in low caps before they were shaken out in large caps. Probably also some panic hyper sellers swapped into SOL, thinking sol was safe, then later panic sold sol into stables. (answered by abinge05)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: abinge05 | Helpee: Knar | Context: Knar was confused about HYPER price stability despite SOL dropping 30% | Resolution: abinge05 explained market dynamics where weak hands were shaken out of low caps first and described the likely token flow patterns.\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 🧊│3d-design\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on technical discussions around Hyperfy's app system, model rendering, and vehicle physics. Key topics included:\n\n- Discussion of the \"unique\" flag behavior in Hyperfy's app system, clarifying how it affects duplicated models and their linkage. When a model is marked as unique, all existing copies become unique, and new copies maintain that uniqueness.\n\n- Development of a web-based GLB model renderer (wizard.grape.wtf) that creates animated GIFs of 3D models, with ongoing work to improve framerate and download functionality.\n\n- Implementation and testing of vehicle physics, particularly with the \"hyperduck\" model that was modified to have F-35 jet-like dynamics. Users discussed anchoring, sliding issues at high speeds, and animation challenges.\n\n- Animation system discussions, particularly around sitting animations and the challenges with looping vs. one-shot animations. Users debated the existence of a \"holdPose\" parameter and proper animation implementation.\n\n- Early discussions about water physics implementation, with suggestions to use swimming mode with buoyancy inside water volumes, and questions about rendering water surfaces with animated GLBs versus shaders.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does unique only effect models duplicated after you set it? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Unique just means, any new duplicates will be completely disconnected from anything. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What do you mean unlink, it's unique now? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: The unique flag was meant more to set the app configuration to be distinct from the rest of the apps. Configuration = the user settings so sign posts can be \"unique\". (answered by maximus)\nQ: Did you have to do anything to the anim in the swivel chair? (asked by Shiffty) A: The sitting emote used on chair is a floor sitting emote, so its technically off. (answered by MetaRick)\nQ: Any one got any ideas how were gonna deal with water physics? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: If inside volume use swimming mode with buoyancy i guess. Anyone should be able to make their own water, we just provide an invisible water volume that switches controller to swimming mode and maybe lets other things float in it.

Summary:\nThe chat discusses several technical issues and feature requests for what appears to be a 3D platform or game environment (likely Hyperfy). Key discussions include object positioning mechanics (push/pull vs. raise/lower), physics interactions with platforms and objects, and code editor improvements. A user implemented a word-wrap feature in the code editor by modifying the Monaco editor configuration. There were observations about collision detection with curbs of different heights and loading order issues where objects fall through platforms if loaded in the wrong sequence. A new feature/plugin proposal was submitted to GitHub (issue #54). Users also discussed potential improvements for handling emotes, including drag-and-drop functionality and API access.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Would it be possible to have word-wrapping in the code editor? (asked by 0mka) A: 0mka provided a solution by modifying the Monaco editor configuration to include \"wordWrap: 'on'\" in codepane.js.\nQ: Could the platform loading order issue be fixed with preload? (asked by general hyper) A: Unanswered\nQ: How do curbs of different heights affect player movement? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: TheMattEmpire noted that depending on the height (around 0.15m in Blender), it changes whether players can automatically walk up it.\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe discussion focuses on infrastructure improvements for Hyperfy, particularly around environment variable handling and client-server communication. MayD524 suggests implementing version compatibility checks similar to CMake to ensure worlds only run on compatible Hyperfy versions. \n\nThe main technical advancement comes from ash, who implemented changes to allow any client to connect to any server through websocket connections. This improvement enables the server to send essential configuration data to clients in the first websocket message, including max upload size, upload URL, and assets URL. This change supports more stateless infrastructure and increases flexibility in client-server connections.\n\nHypPrivakos explains their current approach to environment variable management in Docker, confirming they can support different worlds with different environment variables, though this requires manual updates when new variables are introduced.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How are you currently handling env variables? Can you have older worlds running older env variables and newer worlds running newer env variables? (asked by ash) A: I'm putting them in the docker service environment variable, so I can have different worlds with different set of envs. I'd have to change the set of envs manually for the newer images, but I have a command to do that over all my worlds at the same time. (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: When you support a new release/docker image each of those have their own env mappings? (asked by ash) A: I'd have to change the set of envs manually for the newer images, but I have a command to do that over all my worlds at the same time. It doesn't automatically get the envs from the .env.example and map them though. (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\n\n## 3.

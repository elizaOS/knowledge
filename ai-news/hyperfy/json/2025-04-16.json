          "text": "Hyperfy's Discord community has been actively discussing several technical features and implementations. The most prominent topic has been the new particle system, which allows for various visual effects like explosions and auras. Developers have been sharing code snippets and troubleshooting implementation issues, particularly around attaching particles to avatars, bones, and skinned meshes. The proper implementation involves using `getBoneTransform` and positioning via `world.add(particles)` instead of `app.add(particles)`.",

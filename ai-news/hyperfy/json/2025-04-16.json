There's brief mention of mobile functionality in Hyperfy, with Akuma asking about build mode availability on mobile. Ash mentions that they're working on ways to integrate with MCP (likely Master Control Program or similar AI system) after Roone shared that AI MCP narratives are gaining attention. The conversation is mostly casual with greetings and brief comments about the mobile interface. There's no detailed technical problem-solving or implementation discussions in this segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can the Hyperfy have a contact point with the MCP? (asked by Roone) A: Yeah, we're figuring out a few ways to make it really good. (answered by ash)\nQ: Is build mode possible on mobile? (asked by Akuma) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nNone present in this chat segment.\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on the new particle system in Hyperfy. Ash shared particle assets and documentation, with developers experimenting with implementations. The particles can be attached to avatars, bones, and skinned meshes, with features like rateOverDistance for movement-based emission. Several developers shared their implementations, including aura effects and trails.\n\nOther technical discussions included LiveKit integration for voice chat and screen sharing, with clarification on implementation across multiple worlds. There was discussion about attaching particles to bones with proper matrix transformations, and a fix for interactive UI nodes with billboard enabled. The chat also covered multiplayer functionality, vibe coding approaches, and blockchain integration capabilities.\n\nKey technical points included proper particle attachment using world.add() vs app.add(), matrix transformations for bone positioning, and the architecture of client/server code separation for multiplayer functionality.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to do sprite animation for onscreen UI? (asked by 0mka) A: Not yet 😄 (answered by ash)\nQ: Can we trigger particles with a specific key? (asked by ~/drdoge.eth) A: Yeah, listen for key press then attach it to the thing (answered by ash)\nQ: Can particles be attached to a skinned mesh? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Yeah you absolutely can, skinned mesh even has a getBoneTransform method like avatars (answered by ash)\nQ: Is voice comms available on dev branch? (asked by MetaRick) A: Yes, it's available on dev along with screensharing. You need a LiveKit account and add those keys to your .env (answered by ash)\nQ: Is it fine to use the same LiveKit server for multiple worlds? (asked by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host) A: Yes, every time the server boots up it generates a UUID to use as the room (answered by ash)\nQ: Is audio supported with screen sharing? (asked by ~/drdoge.eth) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is Hyperfy only tied to Hyperfy coin and could it be used on any chain? (asked by mongrlz) A: You don't need the token and you can use any chain with this (answered by Saori)\nQ: What's the player limit for worlds? (asked by mongrlz) A: Just depends how much stuff you put in the world. You can get hundreds if you don't put heavy stuff in there (answered by Saori)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Gert-Jan Akerboom | Context: Particles attached to bones were not positioning correctly | Resolution: Explained that bone transforms are in world space and suggested using world.add(particles) instead of app.add(particles), plus using particles.position.setFromMatrixPosition(matrix)\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Valiant | Context: Question about using getBoneTransform with custom bones | Resolution: Clarified that only VRM bones (both optional and required) can be used, not custom bones\nHelper: Saori | Helpee: mongrlz | Context: Questions about blockchain integration with Hyperfy | Resolution: Provided link to hypkg.sh/hypkg/evm/ and confirmed any chain can be used\nHelper: HypPrivakos | Helpee: MetaRick | Context: Needed LiveKit for voice chat in HyperWorld.Host | Resolution: Added LiveKit to all hosted worlds so voice would be available\nHelper: maximus | Helpee: mongrlz | Context: Needed resources for vibe coding | Resolution: Shared compilation of resources and key recommendations for AI-assisted coding\nHelper: Saori | Helpee: mongrlz | Context: Questions about multiplayer implementation | Resolution: Explained client/server code separation and automatic syncing of player positions\n\n## 4.

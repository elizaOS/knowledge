Summary:\nThe discussion centers around a technical issue with duplicating objects in what appears to be a 3D development environment. General Hyper encountered a problem where duplicated objects would \"disappear\" after placement. Ash explained that this happens because the script attached to the duplicated objects sets their positions to the same coordinates as the original object. Ash clarified that scripts are linked by default when duplicating objects for efficiency reasons: (1) to avoid editing multiple scripts when changes are needed, and (2) to reduce download requirements for users. Ash suggested two solutions: either make position updates relative to where the app is placed by moving the mesh inside the container, or move meshes to world-space using code that copies the app's position and quaternion before adding it to the world. General Hyper acknowledged the issue was related to using `app.position.set()` in the script and suggested that documentation might help users avoid this confusion.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why are scripts linked when you duplicate objects? (asked by general hyper) A: For two reasons: to avoid editing code in multiple places when changes are needed, and to reduce download requirements for users entering the world. (answered by ash)\nQ: How can I fix duplicated objects that move to the same position? (asked by general hyper) A: Either make position updates relative to the app's placement by moving the mesh inside the container, or move meshes to world-space using code that copies position and quaternion. (answered by ash)\nQ: Could the system warn users about position-setting scripts before duplication? (asked by general hyper) A: The engine can't logically determine if position-setting is intentional or not, as it might be part of intended game mechanics. (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

Key technical discussions include: implementing AI code generation for scripts (demonstrated by user cru), app configuration and props API improvements, audio streaming capabilities, UI development, and self-hosting options. Ashxn introduced a cleaner syntax for creating nodes with `app.create(node, props)` and improved props validation. Several users shared code examples for audio controls, movement synchronization, and UI components. The community discussed the limitations of the current sandbox environment, including restricted access to functions like `Date.now()`, `setTimeout`, and `crypto.randomUUID`. There were also conversations about physics interactions, collision settings, and avatar implementation. The chat highlights ongoing development of v2, which resolves many issues from v1 including camera clipping, tab switching jitter, and improved lighting and physics.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can you combine React Three Fiber (r3f) with Hyperfy? (asked by Ricky) A: Not directly inside Hyperfy; r3f is a React wrapper for three.js that's useful for landing pages but separate from Hyperfy (answered by Saori and bear)\nQ: How does the in-world phone blend walking animations? (asked by Ashxn) A: It has its own walking animations (answered by ~/HowiEDuhzit)\nQ: How can I generate a UUID in an app script? (asked by m₂) A: There's a global uuid() function injected into the script environment (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can I get the current timestamp in a script? (asked by m₂) A: Use world.getTime() for performance.now() synced to server time, world.getTimestamp() for ISO timestamps, or Date.now() which was just added (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can I make 3D objects solid so avatars can jump on them? (asked by frabra239) A: Yes, change collision to \"all\" (answered by frabra239 and Ashxn)\nQ: What does \"inherit\" mean for collision settings? (asked by frabra239) A: It uses collision shapes defined in Blender for better performance with more basic shapes (answered by Saori and Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to sleep for some milliseconds in a script? (asked by m₂) A: No direct setTimeout, but you can track time with the update event (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"🤖│agents\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion centers on integrating AI agents into Hyperfy, a virtual world platform. Lastraum and HPrivakos shared code for connecting Eliza-based agents from Decentraland to Hyperfy, enabling cross-platform agent interactions. The implementation uses a JavaScript framework that fetches agent data from endpoints like \"lkdcl.co/eliza\" and \"agents.dcl.guru\". The code creates UI elements for agent responses and handles chat commands. Users can trigger agent responses with \"/agent\" commands or configure automatic responses. Several community members expressed interest in non-developer solutions for agent creation and deployment. The conversation demonstrates successful integration of existing agent frameworks from Decentraland into Hyperfy, with working examples like \"Hawk Tuah\" and \"Ken Oath\" agents.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Has anyone made a tutorial to set up an agent in hyperfy that is easy to understand for less than devs?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy's development ecosystem, particularly focusing on the integration of AI agents using Eliza. HPrivakos shared information about hosting Eliza agents for Hyperfy worlds, explaining that it requires running a custom Hyperfy branch of Eliza with an LLM backend (like Ollama). Saori mentioned that v2 of Hyperfy is Solana-first but aims to include all chains and web2 authentication methods. There was discussion about hyperworld.host, a hosting service that now supports both crypto and fiat payments via Stripe. Documentation for Hyperfy development was referenced, with links to GitHub repositories containing setup guides. The technical conversation highlighted the workflow for adding AI agents to Hyperfy worlds, which involves setting up an Eliza server and connecting it to a VRM model in-world using a script.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Any idea when Hyperworld.host apps and documentation will be available? Also I'm a game dev so is there some code/stuff I can monkey around with in my world? (asked by SomeOtherGuy) A: HPrivakos shared that there are docs on GitHub and devilsadvocate.sol provided an updated link to documentation.\nQ: Hey so connecting to hyperfy uses metamask? i thought this was a solana thing? that is for the token only? (asked by frabra239) A: Jona explained that v1 worlds need an Ethereum NFT, while v2 doesn't require MetaMask connection. Saori added that v2 is Solana-first but aims to include all chains and web2 auth.\nQ: Is adding agents on the dev branch pretty straight forward? (asked by merk) A: HPrivakos confirmed it requires the custom Eliza branch running with Ollama as backend, plus a script in-world.\nQ: What is the script in world supposed to be though to get it to start talking? (asked by bitpixi) A: Saori confirmed it's the script shared in the chat but noted more is needed, specifically a URL to the Eliza server.\nQ: Does open router route the requests to the cheapest model? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: HPrivakos explained it routes to the cheapest provider for a chosen model.\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around the HYPER token's price action, with significant volatility observed (dropping from around $0.10 to as low as $0.01 before rebounding to $0.02). Community members express both concern and optimism about the token's performance amid a broader market downturn. Ashxn and Saori provide brief insights about the project's technical direction, mentioning they're working on making it easy for creators to build narrative-driven experiences and collectables, with everything remaining interoperable and open. There's mention of a new website coming soon. The conversation also touches on token distribution concerns, with clarification that large wallets are vested through Streamflow. A new user (frabra239) purchased a world on hyperfy.io (v1) and received guidance about the difference between v1 and v2, with recommendations to check GitHub for building options. The chat indicates the project is transitioning from v1 to v2, with v2 being open source and using the HYPER token to drive the ecosystem.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the strategy of airdrops just to sell as quickly as possible? (asked by bard ionson) A: Usually yeah unless the token is called hype (answered by zhades)\nQ: Do we use metamask to connect to hyperfy? (asked by frabra239) A: Hyperfy.io is the old v1 worlds. It was token gated by an ETH NFT. V2 project is open source and will use the hyper token to drive the ecosystem within the v2 paradigm. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Do I need to be a serious developer or can I figure this shit out? (asked by frabra239) A: hyperfy.io is friendly for non devs and you bought a world so you can use it, just need 3d models and stuff (answered by Saori)\nQ: What percentage of the supply needs to be in the LP to be enough to prevent crazy spikes on low volume? (asked by jar0d) A: too much in the LP at this point and the price will plummet... only 1.32% in the pool is a good thing but it can be bad too if a big whale sells (answered by BitFiend)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: maximus | Helpee: frabra239 | Context: User bought a world on hyperfy.io but didn't understand how to use it or create an avatar | Resolution: Explained that hyperfy.io is the v1 platform, shared FAQ link, and suggested checking GitHub for building options and hyperfy hosting options\nHelper: Saori | Helpee: frabra239 | Context: User wanted to build something but wasn't sure if they needed to be a developer | Resolution: Clarified that hyperfy.io is friendly for non-developers and they can use the world they bought with 3D models\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat revolves around Hyperfy, a 3D web platform for creating interactive worlds. Key technical discussions include: implementing AI code generation for scripts (demonstrated by user cru), app configuration and props API improvements, audio streaming capabilities, UI development, and self-hosting options. Ashxn introduced a cleaner syntax for creating nodes with `app.create(node, props)` and updated the props documentation. There were discussions about combining React Three Fiber (r3f) with Hyperfy, with bear explaining that r3f is just an abstraction layer around Three.js. MetaMike shared code for a cube movement app with synchronized UI text and action labels. Several users discussed audio implementation, including streaming MP3 support and the orientation of audio cones. The chat also covered avatar implementation using VRM models, world environments, and collision settings. Developers shared resources for creating 3D assets, including Vroid Hub for avatars and Blockade Labs for skyboxes.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can React Three Fiber (r3f) be combined with Hyperfy? (asked by Ricky) A: Yes, but with limitations. R3f is just a Three.js wrapper for React, and can be used for things like fetching updated world data and displaying a galaxy. (answered by Saori and bear)\nQ: How do you make 3D objects solid so avatars can jump on them? (asked by frabra239) A: Change collision to \"all\" in the object properties. (answered by frabra239 himself after figuring it out)\nQ: What does \"inherit\" mean for collision settings? (asked by frabra239) A: When you create collisions manually in Blender, you choose \"inherit\" for better performance and more basic collider shapes. (answered by Saori and Ashxn)\nQ: How can I generate a UUID in an app script? (asked by m₂) A: There's a global uuid() function injected into the script environment. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can I get the current timestamp in a script? (asked by m₂) A: Use world.getTime() for performance.now() synced to server time, world.getTimestamp() for ISO date timestamps, or Date.now() which was just added. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to sleep for some amount of milliseconds in a script? (asked by m₂) A: Raw setTimeout isn't available, but you can track time with updates using delta values. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I use a VRM model as my avatar? (asked by frabra239) A: Download a VRM model from Vroid Hub and drag and drop it into Hyperfy. (answered by Saori)\nQ: How can I create a mountainous environment for my world? (asked by frabra239) A: You can use skyboxes from Blockade Labs or generate 3D models with Meshy.ai.

The token experienced a price recovery toward the end of the chat period, moving from around $0.01 to approximately $0.02.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Will be great if it is token use case problem? (asked by homm) A: There is no token use case problem. The token will be used, and there are tokens with no use case that are worth billions because the open source code base they are attached to have adoption. (answered by Saori)\nQ: Should we hope it coming soon mate? (asked by homm) A: Soon, late - doesn't matter. At this point I believe better to hit anything relative good in market where we don't selloff everything. (answered by MichaelV)\nQ: Is the strategy of airdrops just to sell as quickly as possible? (asked by bard ionson) A: Usually yeah unless the token is called hype. (answered by zhades)\nQ: We use metamask to connect to hyperfy? (asked by frabra239) A: Hyperfy.io is the old v1 worlds. It was token gated by an ETH NFT. V2 project is open source and will use the hyper token to drive the ecosystem within the v2 paradigm. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Do I need to be a serious developer or can I figure this shit out? (asked by frabra239) A: hyperfy.io is friendly for non devs and you bought a world so you can use it, just need 3d models and stuff. (answered by Saori)\nQ: What percentage of the supply needs to be in the LP to be enough to prevent crazy spikes on low volume? (asked by jar0d) A: Too much in the LP at this point and the price will plummet. Only 1.32% in the pool is a good thing, but it can be bad too if a big whale sells. (answered by BitFiend)\n\n## 3.

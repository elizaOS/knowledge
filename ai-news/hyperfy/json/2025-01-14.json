Ashxn shared a Digital Ocean deployment guide, which several users successfully implemented. Physics discussions centered on implementing dynamic collision objects in Blender with proper rigidbody and collider properties. The most significant development was the introduction of scripting capabilities, allowing in-world app creation without modifying core code. Ashxn demonstrated a flyable drone prototype showcasing interaction nodes, networked state/events, and server authority. The community collaboratively documented Blender physics setup, skybox loading, and other technical aspects in a shared HackMD document. Mobile/touch controls were added in v0.2.0, and a dev branch was established for ongoing development before releases to main. The team is working toward making agents and interactive objects easier to implement with minimal coding.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does one set collision on an asset?

      "summary": "# Analysis of Hyperfy Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about Hyperfy's DAO governance structure, token price movements, and the upcoming V2 platform release. Maximus shared a recap of earlier DAO discussions, highlighting the balance between centralized leadership and community involvement. Key governance principles include tying fund distributions to value-adding activities, maintaining dev team control over platform direction, preventing whale dominance in voting, and implementing a tiered bounty system for funding community projects.\n\nTechnical discussions focused on V2 platform capabilities, with Ash demonstrating a test world where users could drag and drop 3D models. This world experienced crashes when users uploaded models with morph targets, which Ash quickly fixed. The community also discussed the integration of NFT verification features to authenticate ownership of avatars and items in-world. V2 is described as more performant than V1, with multiplayer coding capabilities and the ability to develop directly within worlds rather than requiring local SDK setup.\n\nThe chat also revealed that V2 is technically already available to those with technical backgrounds, with broader access coming soon. The open-source nature of V2 will enable external developers to build apps that extend platform functionality without waiting for the core team.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What are the key guidelines for the Hyperfy DAO? (asked by maximus) A: Fund distributions should be tied to value-adding activities, dev team leads platform direction, voting shouldn't be fully decentralized, projects should deliver production-grade output, and whales shouldn't have outsized voting effects. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Is it possible for people wearing NFTs to get authentication or verification that shows they own the NFT? (asked by Uuuuuuuuu) A: You can't prevent people ripping and using avatars, but you can definitely show a badge that they own it. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What is the timeline on V2? (asked by MUDBONE) A: V2 is technically out and being used by those with more tech/dev background. Access to regular builders will likely be what sets \"open to dev\" apart from \"open to ecosystem.\" (answered by maximus)\nQ: Is it strictly 16mb glb files I can drag in to the test world? (asked by Uuuuuuuuu) A: Yes, it's set to 16mb on this world because it's free build. We'll add drag and drop images eventually. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do you move objects up and down in the test world? (asked by Uuuuuuuuu) A: Hold shift and move the mouse. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is collab land still the best discord bot for token roles? (asked by Ashxn) A: Many people use guild.xyz for various reasons, but both have issues depending on integration depth. (answered by ApeironCreations)\nQ: What is RWA in this context? (asked by PurpleSack) A: RWA stands for real world assets. It has a mix of hype but real potential behind it. (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3.

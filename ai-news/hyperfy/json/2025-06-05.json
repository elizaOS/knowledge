      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical aspects of Hyperfy development. Shiffty showcased \"PartyGrid,\" a configurable dance floor system that generated significant interest despite high CPU usage, which was attributed to texture handling for individual tiles. A key technical exchange involved 0mka helping Gert-Jan implement Discord notifications for rocket launches by using chat as an intermediary communication channel rather than modifying the rocket app directly. Ashxn shared important performance advice, warning against using transmission effects on transparent materials due to severe performance impacts on mobile/VR. He also provided a detailed Docker Compose setup guide for deploying Hyperfy worlds on Coolify. Several feature requests emerged, including a desire for the Scene field in World settings to support code/.hyp functionality, which Ashxn confirmed was planned to enable environment apps with scriptable features. Other discussions touched on self-hosting configurations, skybox behavior modifications, and potential for PVP shooter implementations.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a reason the Teleport location may not Persist or Save between Sessions? (asked by Agent12) A: It should persist as it uses world.get/world.set storage (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What causes all that CPU usage in PartyGrid? (asked by Ashxn) A: Changing UV offsets individually likely requires each tile to have its own texture in memory (answered by Shiffty)\nQ: Is there an easy way to get a quick pvp shooter game up and running? (asked by Alephic) A: There aren't ready-to-go shooter packs yet, but a few people have experimented with the idea (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What was the biggest issue with using fly.io? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: Backing up worlds, but it's actually possible though complicated via SSH to the container (answered by HypPrivakos)\nQ: Is there a way to make the skybox follow the character vertically without modifying core? (asked by Alephic) A: Not currently, but Ashxn offered to add this functionality (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThis Discord chat in the \"⚡│general\" channel contains minimal technical discussion. The main technical topic was about voice chat capabilities in Hyperfy, specifically regarding LiveKit for spatial voice chat. A user named Cayden0207 inquired about advanced audio solutions with features like push-to-talk, voice activation detection, and admin-level mute controls. Ashxn responded that Hyperfy currently supports LiveKit for spatial voice chat, but features like push-to-talk and recording aren't implemented yet. There was also a brief mention of VR performance issues, with vox noting poor performance in Europe (audio and loading/streaming speed) and Ashxn mentioning getting kicked out of VR immediately with height-setting problems. The chat also included several greetings, sharing of links, and casual conversation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do you know any audio solution that allows only host and admin to voice, or gives access to unmute/mute someone in the world?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on technical aspects of 3D design, particularly lighting techniques and rendering. A significant discussion revolved around making sunlight pass through glass in 3D scenes by manipulating the castShadow and receiveShadow properties. This technique was highlighted as particularly useful for indoor scenes, cathedrals with stained glass, and creating god ray effects. Alternative approaches were suggested, such as using transparent cones with fading to fake light rays. Additionally, there was brief mention of Meshy AI's building generation capabilities, UV scrolling techniques, and a GitHub repository for Gaussian Splats 3D, with a suggestion that Hyperfy could support .splat files.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: I think there was a way to get the sun to shine through the glass but i forgot, anyone? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: set castShadow and receiveShadow to false, on the glass. in some cases you might want receiveShadow to still be true though (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: whaaat you can get sun to shine through glass this way?? (asked by untitled, xyz) A: haha yes. if you have a primarily indoor scene, you can set your roof to let light in etc (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

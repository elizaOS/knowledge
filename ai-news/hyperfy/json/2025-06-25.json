      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focuses on implementing cross-platform interactions in Hyperfy. HiroP is setting up scaffolding and trying to enable click functionality across desktop, VR, and mobile platforms. Ashxn provides critical guidance, explaining that the \"Action\" node system is the recommended approach for cross-platform interactions rather than pointer events. The Action system works on all devices including mobile and VR, while pointer/reticle events currently only work on desktop. On mobile, users get a hand button that appears when near an action, and on VR, triggers are used. HiroP successfully implements this system with simple red and green cubes as test objects. The conversation also includes some lighthearted exchanges about cubes being the starting point for development.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there some secret sauce needed to enable \"clicks\" in VR and mobile? (asked by hiroP) A: Use the \"action\" node which works on all devices including mobile and VR; pointer/reticle events currently only work on desktop (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do interactions work on different platforms? (asked by hiroP) A: On mobile you get a little hand button that pops up when near an action, on VR you use the triggers (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is onPointerDown supposed to work on mobile? (asked by hiroP) A: Pretty sure onPointerDown works on mobile, definitely seen it work on world UI in VR (answered by 0mka)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: hiroP | Context: HiroP needed to implement cross-platform interaction system | Resolution: Ashxn explained to use the Action node system instead of pointer events, which works across all platforms\nHelper: 0mka | Helpee: hiroP | Context: HiroP was trying to determine if clicks work in VR | Resolution: 0mka confirmed some functionality works and offered to test further\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"⚡│general\"\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on discussions about 3D NFTs and their history. Users johan and untitled, xyz initiated a conversation about creating a comprehensive list of historical 3D NFT collections, with untitled, xyz sharing a chronological list of architectural/design-based 3D NFT collections from 2019-2024. They discussed the importance of these collections having 3D files in their metadata. The conversation evolved into a proposal to create a \"3D NFT history Museum\" in Hyperfy to showcase these collections and their timeline. There was also a brief technical support interaction regarding portal functionality in Hyperfy, where a user asked about a potential bug with portals transporting entire worlds rather than just individual users. Community calls were mentioned, with Ashxn confirming one would take place.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: When i enter the website portal i bring everyone in my world to a new world, shouldn't only me go there? Is it a bug? (asked by Coinexpert) A: Every object in hyperfy is built independently by many different people in the community so quite literally anything could be the reason. You need to be more specific, maybe drop the portal app you are using. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Does anyone have a good resource on the history of 3d nfts? (asked by johan) A: Partially answered with untitled, xyz providing a chronological list of collections.\nQ: Do all of these [3D NFT collections] have the 3d file in the nft metadata? (asked by johan) A: Yes. All except maybe JOYWORLD, I initially thought those pointed to 3D files but I can't see them in the metadata. (answered by untitled, xyz)\nQ: Any call today? (asked by PurpleSack) A: Yes in 5 mins. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: Coinexpert | Context: User experiencing issue with portals transporting entire worlds instead of just the individual | Resolution: Ashxn explained that objects in Hyperfy are built independently by different community members and requested more specific information about the portal app being used.\nHelper: untitled, xyz | Helpee: johan | Context: Request for information about 3D NFT history | Resolution: untitled, xyz provided a chronological list of architectural/design-based 3D NFT collections from 2019-2024.\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"🪙│hyper\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around a disagreement between Discord users emotionull and philbert, with peezy mediating. The conflict stems from emotionull launching tokens and being removed from philbert's group chat. Beyond this interpersonal conflict, philbert shares substantial technical insights about Hyperfy's engine architecture and potential development directions. He argues that Hyperfy is trying to be both a game engine and metaverse platform simultaneously, creating tradeoffs that limit its effectiveness in either role. Philbert suggests that focusing on being a Three.js game engine with strong networking capabilities while embracing AI-assisted development workflows could be more successful than the current approach. He notes that after 7 months of v2 development, Hyperfy still lacks critical platform features like cross-world identity and discovery that existed in v1. Philbert shares his own project (pewbet.fly.dev) as an example of game development using Hyperfy's engine, highlighting pain points in the current developer experience including lack of version control and difficult script management.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is philbert's perspective on Hyperfy's current direction? (asked by PurpleSack) A: Philbert believes Hyperfy is trying to be both a game engine and metaverse platform, creating tradeoffs that limit effectiveness, and suggests focusing on being a Three.js game engine with strong networking while embracing AI-assisted development (answered by philbert)\nQ: What are the key features philbert wants in a game engine? (asked by PurpleSack) A: Networking handled automatically, easy deployment, easy scripting language with server/client access, low-level optimizations, and support for AI-assisted development (answered by philbert)\nQ: What is the name of philbert's project? (asked by PurpleSack) A: Not doing any tokens and will post on Twitter if it eventually becomes usable; later shared link to pewbet.fly.dev (answered by philbert)\nQ: Does Hyperfy handle networking for end users? (asked by PurpleSack) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: philbert | Context: Tension around different development approaches and forks of Hyperfy | Resolution: Ashxn validated philbert's perspective while suggesting both game engine and metaverse functionality could coexist in one platform\nHelper: maximus | Helpee: emotionull | Context: emotionull was getting an error with their token | Resolution: maximus sent funds to the creator wallet to help resolve the issue\n\n## 4.

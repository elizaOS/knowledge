      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on VR and mobile interaction capabilities in the Hyperfy platform. hiroP inquired about enabling \"clicks\" in VR and mobile environments after setting up their Hyperfy scaffolding. 0mka confirmed that clicking functionality should work on UIs in VR and mobile, specifically mentioning that the onPointerDown event handler should work for object interactions. They discussed the possibility of controller pointers in VR, with 0mka offering to test this functionality. Additionally, 0mka mentioned experimenting with UIView shapes to create radials, accidentally creating something resembling a \"metaworld flag.\" The conversation briefly touched on hit-scan functionality when Agent12 asked if it was working. The chat also included sharing of motivational content related to VR development.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there some secret sauce I need to enable to get \"clicks\" in VR and mobile or is that something that doesn't exist yet? (asked by hiroP) A: You can click on UIs in VR already and mobile I believe. Definitely seen it work on world UI in VR. Pretty sure onPointerDown works on mobile. (answered by 0mka)\nQ: How were you pressing UI in VR before? (asked by 0mka) A: Unanswered\nQ: Got hit-scan working? (asked by Agent12) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: 0mka | Helpee: hiroP | Context: hiroP was trying to implement click functionality on 3D objects in VR and mobile | Resolution: 0mka suggested using onPointerDown event handler, mentioning they had successfully used it for camera interactions, and offered to test VR controller functionality\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Test onPointerDown functionality for object interactions in VR | Description: Verify that clicking on 3D objects works in VR with controllers | Mentioned By: hiroP\nTechnical: Investigate VR controller pointers implementation | Description: Explore how to implement and use VR controller pointers for interaction | Mentioned By: hiroP\nTechnical: Test UI interaction in VR | Description: Verify how UI pressing works in VR environments | Mentioned By: 0mka",

Johan initiated a discussion about resources on the history of 3D NFTs, which led to untitled, xyz sharing a chronological list of architectural/design-based 3D NFT collections from 2019-2024. They confirmed that most collections include 3D files in their metadata. The two users expressed interest in creating a 3D NFT history museum in Hyperfy to showcase these collections. Additionally, there was a brief technical support interaction where Coinexpert asked about a portal issue in Hyperfy where all users are transported together instead of individually, with Ashxn responding that more specific information about the portal app would be needed to diagnose the problem. The chat concluded with a reminder about an upcoming call.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When i enter the website portal i bring everyone in my world to a new world, shouldn't only me go there? Is it a bug? (asked by Coinexpert) A: Every object in hyperfy is built independently by many different people in the community so quite literally anything could be the reason. You're gonna have be more specific, maybe drop the portal app you are using in here and we can check it out for you. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Does anyone have a good resource on the history of 3d nfts? (asked by johan) A: Unanswered\nQ: Do all of these [3D NFT collections] have the 3d file in the nft metadata? (asked by johan) A: Yes. All except maybe JOYWORLD, I initially thought those pointed to 3D files but I can't see them in the metadata. (answered by untitled, xyz)\nQ: Any call today? (asked by PurpleSack) A: Yes in 5 mins (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around tension between community members regarding token creation and project development approaches. User \"emotionull\" launched a token called \"Phetta\" on daos.fun, which sparked controversy. Philbert (formerly known as Phil) removed emotionull from a private group chat after emotionull promoted multiple tokens, leading to a heated exchange. The discussion highlights different philosophies about token creation, with peezy expressing concerns about launching tokens without substantial backing. Later, philbert shared technical insights about Hyperfy's engine, explaining that it faces challenges balancing game engine functionality with metaverse capabilities. He described his work on an FPS game with identity management, matchmaking API, and P2P rooms, and mentioned creating pull requests for primitives and local scripting. Philbert suggested that refactoring Hyperfy or extracting its core components into a different framework might better support his desired features while enabling AI-assisted development outside the browser.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why did philbert remove emotionull from a group chat? (implied by emotionull) A: Because emotionull \"minted and shilled 3 of your own tokens in 24 hr span\" (answered by philbert)\nQ: What is philbert working on technically? (asked by PurpleSack) A: A project using Hyperfy engine components, with no tokens planned, and updates will be posted on his Twitter (answered by philbert)\nQ: What are the technical limitations of Hyperfy as a game engine?

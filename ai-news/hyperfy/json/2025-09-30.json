      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical issues related to the Vibe World platform. Ash mentioned that Vibe World is experiencing crashes due to one of approximately 2000 AI-generated apps causing a memory leak, though they have some ideas to address this. There was a question about accessing cookies/localStorage, which remained unanswered. Gert-Jan Akerboom inquired about revoking builder rights from players not present in the world, with ash and .hyp shaman confirming that builder rights are persistent but can only be revoked when users are simultaneously present in the world. Mrtzhckr mentioned implementing changes locally to work with an Azure OpenAI endpoint, referencing an existing pull request (#134). Nicola Bertoglio raised a concern about the mobile version's avatar not allowing proper viewing of images and suggested adding a zoom function.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"⚡│general\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment shows minimal technical discussion. Maximus mentioned two significant technical developments: the integration of \"prims\" with AI and the recent enabling of OpenRouter, which allows users to run custom LLMs to power generation in the platform. There was a brief question about the continued availability of the \"legacy world version\" for building, which was confirmed to still work. The conversation also indicates some community content creation is ongoing, with members sharing and appreciating a project that appears to be a \"diner\" world. Overall, the chat suggests reduced activity in the project compared to previous periods, with less frequent community updates and communication.\n\n## 2.

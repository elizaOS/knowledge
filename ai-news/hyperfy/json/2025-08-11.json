      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical development issues in the Hyperfy platform. Key topics included:\n\n- Environment configuration troubleshooting, specifically the need for an `ASSETS=local` setting in the .env file\n- Free camera implementation with linear interpolation replacing quadratic easing functions\n- Primitive (Prim) component usage and rotation issues, with clarification that rotations must be specified in radians\n- A $500 bounty for implementing a \"Tile Dash\" game in Hyperfy v2, similar to the existing HyperCloud in the play world\n- Discussion about self-hosting multiple Hyperfy worlds using Coolify, with a warning about storage management to prevent crashes\n- Git troubleshooting for a developer experiencing undefined imports with Prim components\n- Brief mentions of Conway's Game of Life implementation and WSL file access\n\nThe most significant technical exchange involved Shiffty's implementation of a free camera with linear interpolation instead of easing functions, which was positively received as feeling identical to the v1 implementation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are primitives broke in dev? (asked by Shiffty) A: No, I'm on latest dev right now (answered by ash)\nQ: How can I set up an easy way to have multiple worlds like the real hyperfy site if I'm self hosting? (asked by emotionull) A: One server with coolify on it! Coolify can manage multiple worlds (answered by ash)\nQ: How do I rotate prim planes? (asked by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz) A: Rotation is in radians, but for degrees you'd use `rotation: [0, 45 * DEG2RAD, 0]` (degrees to radians) (answered by ash)\nQ: How can I find my-world folders in WSL? (asked by Valiant) A: \\\\\\\\wsl$ is typically a shortcut to your wsl folder (answered by Shiffty)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Shiffty | Context: Git issues with undefined Prim imports | Resolution: Not directly resolved, but Shiffty wiped and cloned the repo which fixed the issue\nHelper: Shiffty | Helpee: ash/vox | Context: Free camera implementation with linear interpolation instead of easing function | Resolution: Successfully implemented and approved for further refinement\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz | Context: Difficulty rotating prim planes | Resolution: Explained rotation needs to be in radians, using DEG2RAD for conversion\nHelper: Shiffty | Helpee: Valiant | Context: Unable to find my-world folders in WSL | Resolution: Provided path shortcut \\\\\\\\wsl$ to access WSL folders\n\n## 4. Action Items\nType: Technical | Description: Remove quadratic easing completely and make linear interpolation configurable with default of 0.05 | Mentioned By: Shiffty\nType: Technical | Description: Update play world to latest version | Mentioned By: ash\nType: Feature | Description: Implement Tile Dash game in Hyperfy v2 with chat output for levels | Mentioned By: ash\nType: Feature | Description: Add multiplayer support to Tile Dash game (stretch goal) | Mentioned By: ash\nType: Technical | Description: Implement Conway's Game of Life in 3D environment | Mentioned By: MetaMike\nType: Documentation | Description: Be aware of storage management in Coolify to prevent crashes when self-hosting | Mentioned By: .hyp shaman",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"⚡│general\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy platform development and community engagement. A user named vox shared an experimental world featuring UV scrolling and PBR (Physically Based Rendering) capabilities, which received praise for its optimization and visual quality despite some intermittent connection issues that were later resolved (the issue was related to a preloaded Audio App). There was discussion about GitHub activity, with Shiffty and untitled,xyz confirming that development remains active despite jeff's concerns. Questions about Hyperfy v2 were raised, along with inquiries about documentation resources after a user noted that hyperfy.how domain is no longer available (replaced by docs.hyperfy.xyz). Ash mentioned plans for unified controls across devices (mobile, desktop, VR) to provide consistent interaction methods, such as long-clicking objects to access action menus. The community appears engaged with both technical aspects and promotional activities for the platform.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Will Hyperfy v2 be announced with a major release and promotion? (asked by Saracismo) A: Unanswered\nQ: It seems like github activity mostly stopped? (asked by jeff) A: This shows a bunch of recent contributions...? (answered by Shiffty)\nQ: Can you make a Hyperfy tutorial video for smartphone and windows? (asked by Xukonth) A: It natively works on smartphone, there is nothing special to do. To run a server, you can either use docker or nodejs locally or use a hosted solution like fly.io or a platform like mine: hyperworld.host (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: Is hyperfy.how coming back? (asked by Mtv969.eth) A: domain had to be changed. it's not coming back. (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\nQ: Do you know a way to build inside an HF world from Android (smartphones / Quest headsets)? Since the tab keyboard button is missing... (asked by Enryt) A: yeah that's part of the unified controls i've spoken about a few times. instead of having different controls on every device, the goal is to unify them, eg long clicking on an object brings up an action menu on mobile, desktop, vr with options to move/duplicte/delete etc (answered by ash)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Shiffty | Helpee: jeff | Context: Confusion about GitHub activity levels | Resolution: Shiffty provided a link to the GitHub activity page showing recent contributions\nHelper: vox | Helpee: vox | Context: Self-debugging connection issues with experimental world | Resolution: Identified and fixed the issue, which was related to a preloaded Audio App\nHelper: vox | Helpee: Mtv969.eth | Context: Looking for documentation after finding hyperfy.how unavailable | Resolution: Provided link to docs.hyperfy.xyz as the current documentation resource\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nTechnical: Implement unified controls across devices (mobile, desktop, VR) with consistent interaction methods | Description: Long-clicking objects to bring up action menus with move/duplicate/delete options | Mentioned By: ash\nDocumentation: Update media references that point to hyperfy.how domain | Description: Current references to the old domain may confuse users and hinder growth | Mentioned By: Mtv969.eth\nTechnical: Fix mobile building interface for Android/Quest devices | Description: Tab keyboard button is missing on mobile interfaces, making building difficult | Mentioned By: Enryt",

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"🌆│share\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief discussion about Microsoft's organizational changes affecting GitHub. A user shared news about GitHub's CEO stepping down and GitHub being integrated into Microsoft's AI Tooling division. Community members expressed concern about GitHub potentially losing its independence and being transformed into something different from what users have come to appreciate. The conversation was speculative rather than technical, with users wondering about the future implications of this organizational change for the GitHub platform they rely on.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What does GitHub being rolled into Microsoft's AI Tooling division mean? (asked by ash) A: It likely means GitHub will be less independent and more integrated into Microsoft, potentially changing what users have come to love about the platform (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nNo significant help interactions were present in this chat segment.\n\n## 4. Action Items\nNo specific action items were identified in this chat segment.",

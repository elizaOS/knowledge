      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for üíª‚îÇdevelopers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on technical issues and improvements related to the Hyperfy development environment. A user encountered an issue with missing environment variables, which was resolved by referencing the .env.example file and adding `ASSETS=local`. Another user experienced problems with primitives in the dev environment, but this was resolved by wiping and cloning the repository. \n\nThe most significant technical discussion centered around improvements to the free camera functionality. Shiffty proposed a version with fixed linear interpolation instead of an easing function, which was well-received by ash and vox. Shiffty then decided to remove the quadratic easing completely and make the linear interpolation configurable with a default value of 0.05. There was also a brief mention of a potential DOF (Depth of Field) slider feature.\n\nThe conversation included references to the Hyperfy GitHub repository, specifically the MIGRATIONS.md file, which appears to be a resource for developers working on the platform.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are primitives broke in dev? (asked by Shiffty) A: nah i'm on latest dev right now (answered by ash)\nQ: wen DOF slider? (asked by vox) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment primarily revolves around discussions about Hyperfy's development activity and technical demonstrations. A user named \"jeff\" questioned GitHub activity, which was quickly refuted by community members who provided evidence of ongoing development. Vox shared an experimental world featuring UV scrolling and PBR (Physically Based Rendering) capabilities, demonstrating Hyperfy's technical potential. The world experienced some technical issues that were later identified as being caused by a preloaded Audio App. There was also discussion about Hyperfy's documentation, with questions about the status of hyperfy.how domain, which has been replaced by docs.hyperfy.xyz. The chat shows active community engagement around technical implementations and troubleshooting, with members helping each other understand platform capabilities and resolve issues.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Will Hyperfy v2 be announced with a major release and promotion? (asked by Saracismo) A: Unanswered\nQ: It seems like github activity mostly stopped? (asked by jeff) A: This shows a bunch of recent contributions...? (answered by Shiffty)\nQ: Can you make a Hyperfy tutorial video for smartphone and windows? (asked by Xukonth) A: It natively works on smartphone, there is nothing special to do. To run a server, you can either use docker or nodejs locally or use a hosted solution like fly.io or a platform like mine: hyperworld.host (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: Is hyperfy.how coming back? (asked by Mtv969.eth) A: domain had to be changed. it's not coming back. (answered by ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì)\n\n## 3.

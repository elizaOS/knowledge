      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical limitations and implementations in Hyperfy. A key topic was UV scrolling on skinned meshes, which is currently unsupported despite attempts to implement it. Another significant discussion involved IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) file integration in Hyperfy using ThatOpen's engine components, though with performance concerns. Canvas-texture with dirty flags was mentioned as a method for implementing games in Hyperfy, specifically for optimizing redraw rates and maintaining FPS for in-world games like Space Invaders and slot machines. There was brief mention of database integration and queries for Hyperfy builds. The conversation also touched on grouping meshes to improve CPU/GPU performance and the potential use of webview, though with concerns about memory overhead for multiple instances.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Do we have UV scrolling on skinned meshes? (asked by Valiant) A: Only regular mesh currently. Skinned mesh support is a bit harder. (answered by ash)\nQ: Is there a way to group the individual meshes with ctrl+j and still access each nested mesh separately? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: Yes, use the group node or empties in Blender. (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: What kind of database's have people incorporated into their builds? What tools/techniques are you using to query your tables and DB's? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Valiant | Context: Trying to implement UV scrolling on skinned meshes | Resolution: Confirmed it's not currently supported, saving Valiant from spending more time on an impossible task\nHelper: .hyp shaman | Helpee: 3rdEyeVisuals | Context: How to group meshes while maintaining individual access | Resolution: Suggested using group nodes or empties in Blender\nHelper: ash | Helpee: mrtzhckr | Context: Looking for a previously mentioned web tile renderer repo | Resolution: Suggested Cesium.js as a possible solution\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nType: Technical | Description: Develop API for UV scrolling on skinned meshes | Mentioned By: ash\nType: Technical | Description: Optimize IFC file integration for better performance | Mentioned By: mrtzhckr\nType: Feature | Description: Implement map tiles in Hyperfy | Mentioned By: mrtzhckr\nType: Technical | Description: Explore webview implementation with consideration for memory overhead | Mentioned By: .hyp shaman\nType: Documentation | Description: Document methods for optimizing Canvas-Texture with Dirty Flags for in-world games | Mentioned By: 3rdEyeVisuals",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe conversation primarily revolves around development capabilities within the Hyperfy ecosystem. A key technical discussion centers on wallet connectivity features, with .hyp shaman pointing out that wallet connect functionality has been available through hypkg.sh for months. The discussion highlights a tension between those who can modify code and those who cannot, with .hyp shaman encouraging Agent12 to develop skills to contribute directly. There's mention of cars and pets features being implemented but not iterated upon, and discussion about web3 gating and smart contracts. 3rdEyeVisuals notes they're taking a backend session-based approach rather than on-chain gaming to avoid transaction fees. The conversation also touches on development learning curves and the challenges of keeping up with rapidly changing technologies.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Anything New on the Horizon for the Github? (asked by Agent12) A: \"ngl it's pretty stable. on hyp.\" (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: We got Cars, Pets, Or Web3 Gating yet in Stable Dev? (asked by Agent12) A: \"cars and pets have been done for a minute now. afaik no one has looked at the code to iterate\" (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: Where is @179546010303856640? (asked by lambert2288) A: \"Usually when he goes quiet, it means he's working on something big.\" (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: .hyp shaman | Helpee: Agent12 | Context: Agent12 was looking for wallet connect functionality in the current dev branch | Resolution: .hyp shaman shared that wallet connect has been available through hypkg.sh for months and provided the link https://hypkg.sh/\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Iterate on existing cars and pets code | Description: Code exists but needs further development | Mentioned By: .hyp shaman\nTechnical: Implement wallet connect into core/stable branch | Description: Functionality exists in hypkg but not in main branch | Mentioned By: Agent12\nFeature: Web3 gating implementation | Description: Add web3 gating capabilities to the platform | Mentioned By: Agent12\nTechnical: Backend session-based approach for games | Description: Alternative to on-chain gaming to avoid transaction fees | Mentioned By: 3rdEyeVisuals",

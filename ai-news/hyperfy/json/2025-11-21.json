      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical limitations and implementations in Hyperfy. Key topics included UV scrolling on skinned meshes (currently unsupported), IFC file integration for architectural models, optimization techniques for reducing CPU/GPU load, and canvas-texture implementations for in-world games. A developer shared progress on implementing IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) files in Hyperfy using ThatOpen's engine components, though with performance concerns. Another developer discussed their approach to running games in Hyperfy using canvas-texture with dirty flags to optimize redraw rates, mentioning a slot machine implementation with Solana integration. There were also brief discussions about grouping meshes to improve performance, database integration questions, and mobile UI/controller suggestions.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Do we have UV scrolling on skinned meshes? (asked by Valiant) A: Only regular mesh currently. Skinned mesh support is a bit harder. (answered by ash)\nQ: Is there a way to group the individual meshes with ctrl+j and still access each nested mesh separately? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: Yes, use the group node or empties in Blender. (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: What kind of database's have people incorporated into their builds? What tools/techniques are you using to query your tables and DB's? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Valiant | Context: Trying to implement UV scrolling on skinned meshes | Resolution: Clarified that UV scrolling only works on regular meshes currently, saving Valiant from spending more time on an unsupported feature\nHelper: .hyp shaman | Helpee: 3rdEyeVisuals | Context: Grouping meshes while maintaining individual access | Resolution: Suggested using group nodes or empties in Blender to organize meshes while maintaining access\nHelper: ash | Helpee: mrtzhckr | Context: Looking for a previously mentioned web tile renderer | Resolution: Suggested Cesium.js as a possible solution for map tiles in Hyperfy\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nType: Technical | Description: Develop API for UV scrolling on skinned meshes | Mentioned By: ash\nType: Technical | Description: Optimize IFC file implementation for better performance | Mentioned By: mrtzhckr\nType: Technical | Description: Implement map tiles in Hyperfy | Mentioned By: mrtzhckr\nType: Feature | Description: Add virtual controller UI for mobile similar to reference image | Mentioned By: Akuma\nType: Feature | Description: Add Bluetooth controller key binding options | Mentioned By: Akuma\nType: Technical | Description: Explore webview implementation with consideration for memory overhead | Mentioned By: .hyp shaman",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe conversation primarily revolves around the development status of Hyperfy, with discussions about feature implementation and development capabilities. A key technical point is that wallet connect functionality has been available through \"hypkg\" (https://hypkg.sh/) for some time, though there's debate about its accessibility to non-developers. There's frustration expressed about the learning curve for development, with Agent12 expressing difficulty in learning programming despite efforts. The chat reveals tension between those who believe anyone can develop with AI assistance versus those who feel limited by technical knowledge barriers. Some members mention they're taking alternative approaches to blockchain integration, such as 3rdEyeVisuals who prefers backend session-based approaches over on-chain games to avoid transaction fees. There's also brief mention of community members wondering about the lead developer's absence, with speculation that silence typically indicates work on significant updates.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Anything New on the Horizon for the Github? (asked by Agent12) A: \"ngl it's pretty stable. on hyp.\" (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: We got Cars, Pets, Or Web3 Gating yet in Stable Dev? (asked by Agent12) A: \"cars and pets have been done for a minute now. afaik no one has looked at the code to iterate\" (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: Where is @[user]? (asked by lambert2288) A: \"Usually when he goes quiet, it means he's working on something big.\" (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: .hyp shaman | Helpee: Agent12 | Context: Agent12 was asking about wallet connect functionality in the current dev branch | Resolution: .hyp shaman shared that wallet connect has been available through hypkg.sh for months and provided the link\nHelper: 3rdEyeVisuals | Helpee: Agent12 | Context: Discussion about learning curve for development | Resolution: 3rdEyeVisuals shared personal experience about the difficulty of learning 3D modeling (making a donut in Blender) and encouraged persistence through failed attempts\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nTechnical: Implement wallet connect functionality from hypkg into the main development branch | Description: Integrate existing wallet connect capability from hypkg.sh into core codebase | Mentioned By: Agent12\nTechnical: Review and iterate on existing cars and pets code | Description: Existing implementations need review and improvement | Mentioned By: .hyp shaman\nFeature: Web3 gating implementation | Description: Add blockchain-based access control to the platform | Mentioned By: Agent12\nTechnical: Consider backend session-based approach instead of on-chain games | Description: Alternative to blockchain transactions that would avoid constant fees | Mentioned By: 3rdEyeVisuals",

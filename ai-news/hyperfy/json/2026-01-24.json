Summary:\nJin developed a conversion pipeline for Hyperfy v1 worlds to v2, initially requiring Blender but later streamlined to direct v1→v2 conversion. The goal is to provide all world owners with ready-to-launch v2 worlds and assets. Jin identified several developer experience improvements needed, including better documentation and making app code more accessible. The conversion process successfully ports models, spawn points, skies, environment elements, audio, text, and images, but faces challenges with skinned/animated models and lighting. Ash clarified that v2 is more streamlined than v1, running on a single server with a data-driven approach, making it easier to host but requiring some technical knowledge. V2 doesn't support Draco/Meshopt compression or dedicated light nodes (using emissive materials instead). Jin created a priority list of entities to port, with seats, portals, lights, and zones being highest priority.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What's the difference between v1 and v2, if hyperfy.io gets shutdown why would the token remains relevant? (asked by rando1337) A: Unanswered\nQ: Does v2 have draco / meshopt / EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing gltf extension support? (asked by jin) A: None of those! Ultra simple. (answered by ash)\nQ: Will emissive materials in v2 reflect on models/avatars the same way lights did in v1? (asked by jin) A: Unanswered\nQ: Which world made with hyperfy is most advanced? (asked by Radko) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe conversation primarily revolves around a service created by fly.io that provides virtual machines in the cloud for AI agents. Ash explains that this service is easier to use than fly.io itself, with the benefit of hibernation when not in use to avoid unnecessary charges. They're working on implementing backup/restore functionality to allow users to keep backups on their local machines. There's also discussion about a project called \"hyper scape\" which is identified as a modified fork of Hyperfy. Additionally, Ash mentions that webviews are in development for Hyperfy, referencing a GitHub pull request (#147) contributed by Saori. The conversation touches on pricing models, with participants noting that the ability to spin up temporary worlds for experiments or events without ongoing subscription costs would be beneficial.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is it? A simple AI server? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: It's made by fly.io, meant for giving agents a VM in the cloud to work in, but easier to use than fly.io (answered by ash)\nQ: Does the hyper scape thing Shaw's making have anything to do with hyperfy or just similar naming? (asked by general hyper) A: It's built off Hyperfy (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 | Context: Understanding what the AI server is | Resolution: Explained it's a fly.io service for cloud VMs with hibernation features\nHelper: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 and Jayzen | Helpee: general hyper | Context: Question about hyper scape's relationship to Hyperfy | Resolution: Clarified it's a modified fork of Hyperfy\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Implement backup/restore functionality for the cloud VM service | Description: Allow users to keep backups on their local computers | Mentioned By: ash\nTechnical: Continue development of webviews feature | Description: Referenced in GitHub PR #147 | Mentioned By: ash\nDocumentation: Create documentation for the fly.io VM service | Description: Ash mentioned planning to create docs for it | Mentioned By: ash",

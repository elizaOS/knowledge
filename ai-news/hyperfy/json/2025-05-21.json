      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical aspects of Hyperfy development. Gert-Jan Akerboom shared progress on a \"followcurve\" app that allows meshes to follow curves. Ashxn mentioned working on occlusion culling implementation using pre-pass depth checking, which would significantly improve performance by skipping rendering of objects hidden behind walls or other large structures. Peezy announced the release of IDE scripting functionality via hypkg. Several developers discussed animation issues, particularly regarding root bones and foot planting in VRM-compatible emotes. Lastraum integrated .hyp files into a UGC Catalog with 6,300+ assets. There were also discussions about NPC implementation, parent-child hierarchies for objects, and curve/line support in GLTF exporters. The chat included sharing of resources like animation converters and tutorials for working with custom animations in Hyperfy.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to add NPCs in Hyperfy v1? (asked by carlosmu) A: Yes, a VRM can be an app that moves around and can even use AI responses in chat (answered by peezy)\nQ: Can I create a parent object in Hyperfy v1? (asked by carlosmu) A: Not directly within apps yet, but you could export objects as one in a 3D program or spawn and position with code (answered by peezy)\nQ: Do we have a database of vrm compatible emotes? (asked by carlosmu) A: Some are available in shared resources and at hyperfy-animations.vercel.app (answered by Valiant and b0gie)\nQ: How do I solve the problem of feet not staying planted on the ground with Mixamo animations? (asked by carlosmu) A: Need to add a Root bone that doesn't move (answered by 0mka and Ashxn)\nQ: Is occlusion culling set up manually or automatically? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: You mark big objects as \"occluders\" by ticking an option, and it automatically tests other objects (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to pull the glb models from Json of a CV world? (asked by drdoge.eth) A: Yes, resources were shared to help with this (answered by Lastraum)\n\n## 3.

Lastraum announced integration of Hyperfy's `.hyp` file format into their catalog of 6,300 assets, allowing users to download and drag-and-drop 3D assets into Hyperfy worlds. There was brief mention of community meetings being recorded but needing migration to another YouTube channel. A user inquired about animating GLBs in v2, though this received no direct technical response. Johan shared a link to what appears to be a mobile-compatible experience that users tested and achieved different medal rankings (silver, bronze). There was discussion about implementing Pudgy Penguins in Hyperfy, with Ashxn mentioning they had previously created a Pudgy model and even started developing a game called \"Icebreaker\" before switching to other projects.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are the community meetings recorded somewhere? (asked by untitled, xyz) A: Recorded yes! I think we need to migrate to another YouTube channel. Will keep you posted.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"🪙│hyper\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on discussions about the Hyper platform's relationship with its native token and its open-source nature. Ashxn clarified that the platform will automatically inject wallet and Hyper integrations into all worlds without requiring additional work from world creators. The platform is designed to be Hyper-centric, with creators only able to forge objects using Hyper, and builders/collectors trading them with Hyper. Despite being open-source, which means others could potentially build their own ecosystems without Hyper, the team believes this approach is beneficial for all parties. There was also a brief discussion about Sui blockchain and why Phantom wallet might be promoting it, with speculation about VC backing. Additionally, there was a tangential conversation about DeLorean Labs and DeLorean cars.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are there plans to make the coin a native part of the open source platform? Or does it require the SOL hypkg to integrate? (asked by Mugenomics) A: The platform will inject wallet and hyper integrations directly into all worlds without needing to do anything on the world side (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Just curious to what degree the success of the platform is tied to the coin (asked by Mugenomics) A: The platform itself is hyper centric. Creators can forge objects only with hyper and builders/collectors trade them using hyper (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What if New Agents built & connected to hyper world but they only promote & accept their own tokens? (asked by ai16zgm) A: It is an open source project, if people want to use it to create their own ecosystem they will be able to do that (answered by jar0d)\nQ: Can some explain to me if I should give a shit about sui (asked by general hyper) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: Mugenomics | Context: Understanding how the Hyper platform integrates with worlds | Resolution: Explained that wallet and Hyper integrations are injected directly into all worlds without requiring additional work\nHelper: jar0d | Helpee: ai16zgm | Context: Concern about agents potentially using their own tokens instead of Hyper | Resolution: Clarified that while the open-source nature allows for this, there will likely be incentives to incorporate Hyper into economies\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Implement automatic wallet and Hyper integrations into all worlds | Description: Platform should inject these integrations without requiring work from world creators | Mentioned By: Ashxn\nTechnical: Develop incentives for projects to incorporate Hyper | Description: Create ways to encourage projects to use Hyper in their economies despite open-source nature | Mentioned By: jar0d\nFeature: Forge objects using only Hyper | Description: Ensure creators can only forge objects with Hyper token | Mentioned By: Ashxn\nFeature: Trading system for builders/collectors using Hyper | Description: Implement trading functionality that uses Hyper as the currency | Mentioned By: Ashxn",

Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on 3D design topics with emphasis on technical considerations for VR and mobile platforms. A key technical insight shared was to avoid transparency in 3D models for better performance on non-desktop platforms, with the recommendation to use alpha-cutout instead of alpha-blend. Community call highlights were shared, covering VR interactions, splat map experiments, housing kit development, and performance improvements including memory optimization and server usage monitoring. There was a brief discussion about Auto Rig Pro's new AI integration, though details weren't elaborated. The conversation also touched on VRM models, with a specific request for pudgey VRMs. Additionally, participants discussed the shutdown of a game called Ember Sword, with some suggesting it was a \"rug pull\" rather than simply running out of funding.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does anyone have a pudgey vrm? (asked by maximus) A: i do actually, i got one made a month ago for a thing (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Anyone using latest Auto Rig Pro?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on mobile experience in Hyperfy v2. Akuma advocated for prioritizing mobile functionality, citing statistics that mobile gamers outnumber desktop users globally. Ash responded that analytics from v1 showed mobile/VR users were the minority but confirmed plans to roll out missing mobile and VR controls soon. Saori provided technical context about mobile limitations, explaining that mobile browsers (especially Safari) throttle data loading, causing crashes, and that WebGL doesn't perform as well as native apps. There was also mention of compatibility issues between v1 and v2 builds. Maximus shared that prototyping with Electron is underway, which could lead to \"baked experiences\" as apps that might perform better than web versions. A VRM for Blender Workshop was highlighted as an upcoming tutorial to help creators prepare assets for v2.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: If I have a build in v1 can I use that in v2? (asked by johan) A: There are some compatibility issues. You may need to do some work in Blender to prepare the assets in a v2 world. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Why isn't mobile experience prioritized when there are more mobile users than desktop users? (asked by Akuma) A: Analytics from v1 show mobile/VR users are the minority, but missing mobile and VR controls will be rolled out soon. (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical aspects of Hyperfy's development, particularly around version 2 (v2) features and screensharing functionality. Ash shared that v2 will allow users to customize file type to app mappings, similar to how operating systems let users change default applications for file extensions. Screensharing was implemented and tested in the development environment, with 0mka confirming it was working. There was discussion about streaming versus editing content, with some debate about workflow efficiency. Peezy mentioned working on game mechanics like combat target lock but noted they're focusing on learning Blender to overcome asset creation bottlenecks. Saori shared insights about using Cursor AI for development workflows, including how to organize app folders and add documentation to context for better results.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How will file handling work in v2? (inferred from ash's explanation) A: In v2, when you drag and drop files, they'll auto-create built-in apps for that type (like v1), but users will also be able to customize those mappings from file type to app (answered by ash)\nQ: Has anyone made templates for a soul-like game? (asked by emotionull) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can I use Cursor effectively for Hyperfy development? (asked by Zen) A: Create an app folder with current/saved folders containing example apps, then make new ones and add docs/ref to context as needed (answered by Saori)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Saori | Helpee: Zen | Context: How to use Cursor AI for Hyperfy development | Resolution: Explained folder structure organization with current/saved folders and adding documentation to context\nHelper: Saori | Helpee: mrtzhckr | Context: Struggling with dev workflow using Cursor AI | Resolution: Shared screenshot of context setup for UI development and explained linking relevant documentation\nHelper: maximus | Helpee: peezy | Context: Learning Blender for asset creation | Resolution: Suggested attending a session on Blender basics and mentioned it would be recorded for later viewing\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nTechnical: Add VR interaction for new Screenshare functionality | Description: Implement VR-specific interactions for the newly added screensharing feature | Mentioned By: 0mka\nTechnical: Implement Gamepad API | Description: Add support for gamepad controllers | Mentioned By: 0mka\nTechnical: Launch remix of 'fallen' with new mechanics | Description: Create a modified version of the fallen world with combat lock and other new features | Mentioned By: peezy\nFeature: Allow customization of file type to app mappings in v2 | Description: Let users change which apps handle specific file types | Mentioned By: ash",

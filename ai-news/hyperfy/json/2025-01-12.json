Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around setting up and running Hyperfy v2, with developers sharing their experiences across different environments. Ashxn, a core developer, provides updates on app integration progress, mentioning that apps are executing in his local environment sooner than expected. There are technical discussions about server configuration, with vincentskele sharing steps for VPS setup including nginx configuration and upload limits for GLB files. Several users report issues with GLB files that use Draco/MeshOpt compression. \n\nThe chat also covers Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, with hiroP suggesting setting up an MCP server to help developers use LLMs more efficiently with the Hyperfy codebase. Reneil provides detailed information about local LLM setups using Ollama and vLLM. There are discussions about platform features like VRM support, world population counters, and portal systems between worlds. Developers report varying experiences setting up the environment on Windows/WSL versus Linux, with some encountering specific dependency issues related to Python, glibc, and SIMD support.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy's transition from V1 to V2, with significant technical discussions about the platform's capabilities. V2 is being developed as an open-source, decentralized metaverse platform that will allow users to create and host 3D worlds without requiring coding knowledge. Key technical points include: multi-instance hosting capabilities, token-gated access to worlds, the ability to extract models from V1 worlds using browser developer tools, and the implementation of in-world scripting. The team confirmed that V1 worlds will remain hosted while V2 is being developed, with no immediate timeline for deprecation. The airdrop claim period for HYPER tokens has ended, with approximately 80M unclaimed tokens effectively removed from circulation. There were also discussions about interoperability between metaverse platforms and the potential for AI agents to be integrated into Hyperfy worlds.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Hyper Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about the Hyper token, its price movements, and the future governance structure of the Hyperfy platform. Key technical discussions focused on the token claim period ending, with approximately 11% of the supply remaining unclaimed and effectively \"burned.\" The team confirmed they're working on establishing a DAO foundation to manage the treasury, with significant debate about the optimal governance structure. \n\nCommunity members with experience from Decentraland (DCL) shared insights about failed DAO governance models, warning against repeating similar mistakes. The discussion highlighted concerns about funding projects that don't deliver and the need for accountability mechanisms. Several governance models were proposed, including retroactive funding for successful contributions, bounty systems with clear success criteria, and staking mechanisms where voters have \"skin in the game.\"\n\nThe team is developing V2 of the platform which will enable users to create and customize worlds more easily. Ash mentioned that many prominent builders in the space are eager to use Hyperfy's technology. The platform aims to integrate AI agents into metaverse worlds, with potential for user-created content and experiences that could drive token value.\n\n## 2.

Valiant helped maximus with a VRM file that was showing errors, identifying issues with MToon materials and suggesting the model had disconnected head/body parts causing extra draw calls. Another significant discussion involved vincentskele experiencing GLB models causing screen flickering in Hyperfy worlds, which Ashxn confirmed was likely a post-processing bug. Valiant analyzed these models and found issues with janky normals and excessive materials (19 total). The chat also covered VRM exporting tools for Blender, with several members comparing the VRM Addon for Blender versus UniVRM in Unity. TheMattEmpire shared a link to the Blender 4.2+ extension, while Whambammy noted UniVRM is superior for spring bones implementation. Additionally, scoe mentioned working on \"tent city street dwellers\" assets, with some discussion about needed outdoor assets.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's the best VRM exporting tool to use with Blender? (asked by MetaRick) A: Several options mentioned: VRM Addon for Blender with Blender 3.6.1 (answered by Ashxn), UniVRM tools with Unity (answered by TheMattEmpire), and Blender 4.2+ extension (answered by TheMattEmpire)\nQ: Has anyone experienced a seemingly good GLB breaking their world? (asked by vincentskele) A: Yes, Ashxn confirmed the issue happens at certain angles and is likely a post-processing bug (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can someone create a JSON file for a 3D model of Leeroy Jenkins?

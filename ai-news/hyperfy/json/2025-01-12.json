Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around setting up and running Hyperfy v2, with developers sharing their experiences across different environments. Ashxn, a core developer, provides updates on app integration progress, mentioning that apps are executing in his local environment sooner than expected. There are technical discussions about GLB file compatibility issues, with recommendations to use regular GLBs instead of those using Draco/Meshopt compression. Several users report their experiences setting up Hyperfy on VPS systems, with Ubuntu being the most successful platform. Windows/WSL users encounter various issues during setup. The chat also covers discussions about Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration to improve LLM assistance for developers, with recommendations to support Ollama for local LLM hosting. Other topics include VRM support in v2, TypeScript integration possibilities, and ideas for world population counters and portal systems between worlds.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"⚡│general\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy's transition from V1 to V2, with significant technical discussions about the platform's capabilities. V2 is being developed as an open-source, decentralized metaverse platform that will allow users to create and host 3D worlds without requiring coding knowledge. Key technical points include multi-instance hosting capabilities, token-gated access to worlds, and the integration of AI agents. The team confirmed that V1 worlds will remain hosted while V2 is being developed, with V2 offering improved performance and more flexibility. There were discussions about world-building features, including in-world scripting, 3D asset management, and the ability to retrieve models from V1 worlds. The registration period for the HYPER token airdrop has ended, with unclaimed tokens (approximately 80M) effectively being removed from circulation.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Hyper Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about the Hyper token, its price movements, and the future governance structure. Key technical discussions focused on the development of Hyperfy's metaverse platform and how the DAO should be structured. The team announced the closure of token claims, effectively locking up 11% of the supply that wasn't claimed. There were significant discussions about tokenomics and governance models, with many participants advocating for a \"benevolent dictator\" approach where Ash (the founder) maintains significant control while incorporating community input. Former Decentraland (DCL) contributors shared lessons about failed DAO governance models, suggesting retroactive rewards for contributions rather than upfront grants. The team is working on establishing a foundation for the DAO treasury and developing a strategy that balances funding projects without negatively impacting the market. V2 of the platform is in development, which will enable users to create their own worlds and integrate AI agents, potentially creating a \"memaverse\" where users can easily deploy meme-focused content.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are there any plans for tokenomics? (asked by Psyxology) A: Nothing concrete yet but definitely coming. The team is open to hearing ideas on how the token could be used to drive a flywheel.

Valiant helped maximus with a VRM file that was showing errors, identifying issues with MToon materials and suggesting the model had disconnected head/body parts causing extra draw calls. Another significant discussion involved vincentskele experiencing GLB models causing screen flickering in Hyperfy worlds, which Ashxn confirmed was likely a post-processing bug. Valiant analyzed these models and found issues with janky normals and excessive materials (19 total). The chat also covered VRM exporting tools for Blender, with several members discussing options including the VRM Addon for Blender and UniVRM tools in Unity. TheMattEmpire shared a newer Blender 4.2+ extension approach. Members debated the merits of using Blender-only versus Blender+Unity workflows for VRM creation, with Whambammy noting UniVRM is superior for spring bones while the Blender addon works well for basic avatars without spring bones.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🐞│issues Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around users experiencing issues with the $HYPER token airdrop claiming process. Users needed to register their Solana wallets by linking them to their Ethereum addresses that held Hyperfy NFTs (worlds) before the January 12th, 2025 deadline. Many users reported \"wallet not eligible\" messages despite completing registration. The process required users to visit hyperfy.io/airdrop to register and then check hyperfy.xyz/claim to claim tokens. Several technical issues emerged during the claiming process, particularly for hardware wallet users and SAFE multisig wallets. Community managers (ash, Saori, maximus) actively assisted users by verifying wallet registrations and troubleshooting claim errors. Some users missed the registration deadline and expressed concerns about the process, suggesting the airdrop should have been sent directly to qualified wallets. The team explained they had extended the deadline once already and needed to end registration to move forward with other plans. They also noted that many unclaimed wallets showed no activity for over a year, suggesting many holders were inactive.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I know when I'm able to claim? (asked by lulú) A: When the claims are updated it will show up on https://hyperfy.xyz/claim (answered by Saori)\nQ: If I've registered the nominated/delegated SOL address on the airdrop page and it has a check mark, is this all that is required by Jan 12th 2025? (asked by luckyotis1992) A: Yup will show up in the next push tomorrow, as long as you've linked (answered by ash)\nQ: Wondering if anyone knows if the next batch has gone out? (asked by Destitute) A: Batch will likely be right at the end of registration itself. Make sure you have a check mark next to your SOL address. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Any update on fixing the $HYPER circulating mcap on Dexscreener? (asked by Kizzah) A: We submitted something to coingecko yesterday and thats where dexscreener gets its data apparently (answered by Saori)\nQ: Where did the 80 million unclaimed tokens go?

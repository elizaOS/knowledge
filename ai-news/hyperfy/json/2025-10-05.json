The user suggests that when a GLB file is selected in edit mode, developers can access its URL by typing either \"app\" or \"entity\" in the console. This appears to be a quick tip for developers working with 3D models in a web-based editor.",

      "summary": "# Analysis of ⚡│general Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment shows minimal technical discussion. There appears to be some community concern about Hyperfy's development status and communication. Roustan responded to questions by directing users to other Discord channels where they can find information about ongoing development and user-created worlds. The conversation indicates there may be a Github integration bot that posts updates, which Agent12 noted hasn't been active recently. Overall, this segment contains very little substantive technical content, mostly consisting of community members asking about project status and direction.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Earlier this year you mentioned a \"platform\" with a nice UI, but nothing's happened so far. Could you be more specific about your vision? (asked by Alexa) A: Lots happening. Just explore the worlds here that people have been building. (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\nQ: When will Sign in with SOL App be available? (asked by Agent12) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Second, odds announced the soft launch of Edify Engine, a multi-tenant platform built on Hyperfy that simplifies world creation. Edify Engine targets creators without technical backgrounds who struggle with GitHub, hosting setup, and domain configuration. Key features include: a user dashboard for server management, one-click domain setup with automatic DNS configuration, a browser-based code editor for direct file manipulation, automatic subdomain provisioning, and SOL integration for purchases (with hosting handled via credit card). The platform is currently in soft launch within the Hyperfy community, with plans for expansion in 2026. The announcement received positive feedback from maximus.\n\n## 2.

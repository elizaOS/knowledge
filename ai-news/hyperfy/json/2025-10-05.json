The user suggests that when a GLB file is selected in edit mode, developers can access its URL by typing either \"app\" or \"entity\" in the console. This appears to be a quick tip for developers working with 3D models in a web-based editor.",

It contains three messages: a link to an Instagram reel shared by vox, two empty messages from Fibelius, and a post from Sceth iii about an environmental asset they worked on previously and are now optimizing for rendering, with a link to their Twitter/X post. The only technical mention is about asset optimization for rendering purposes. There was one positive reaction from fractilians calling Sceth's work \"super cool\".",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on methods for distributing and downloading .hyp applications within Hyperfy worlds. Gert-Jan Akerboom inquired about hosting .hyp files for download in his world, and several solutions were proposed: contributing to the \"awesome-hyps\" GitHub repository, uploading to Hyperfy host, or using the `world.open('URL', true)` function to trigger downloads from external sources. The discussion revealed that developers can implement download buttons for visitors to obtain .hyp files directly within worlds. There were also mentions of an upcoming platform feature being developed by Ash and a \"black ops team.\" Additionally, ~/drdoge.eth shared updates about optimizing a day/night/weather system with skybox transitions, and Lastraum announced a Forge hyperfy world setup for managing VRMs and other data from within Hyperfy.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What would be the best place to store .hyp files so they can be downloaded in-world? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: You could contribute to `awesome-hyps` GitHub repo, upload to Hyperfy host, or wait for \"the platform\" coming soon. You can also call `world.open('https://somedomain.com/myapp.hyp', true)` from a script. (answered by á²¼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/ and Ashxn)\nQ: What is \"the platform\"? (asked by Lastraum) A: Ash and the \"black ops team\" are developing it; it was mentioned in builder calls about 2 weeks ago. (answered by á²¼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\n\n## 3.

Several methods for sharing .hyp files were discussed, including using the `world.open()` function with a URL parameter to enable downloads. ~/drdoge.eth mentioned optimizing a day/night/weather system with skybox transitions at sunrise/sunset. There were references to upcoming features like \"the platform\" being developed by Ash and the \"black ops team.\" Lastraum shared updates about Forge hyperfy world setup for managing VRMs and data from inside Hyperfy. HiroP discovered that Hyperfy was indexed on deepwiki, making it easier to use with LLMs for app development.

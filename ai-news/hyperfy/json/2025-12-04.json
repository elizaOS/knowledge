The discussion centers around determining the appropriate location in the codebase to implement pointer-lock detection functionality. Ozymandias initially asks if this is the right channel to discuss feature implementation strategies, then specifically questions where pointer-lock detection should be sourced from, suggesting several possible files: `PlayerLocal.js`, `World.js`, or `ClientPointer.js`. In a follow-up message the next day, Ozymandias indicates they decided to implement the functionality in `ClientControls.js` and shares a link to what appears to be their implementation in another Discord channel.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Would this be the channel to talk about strategies for new features? (asked by Ozymandias) A: Unanswered\nQ: From where should be sourced the functionality which detects the pointer-lock for the first time? `PlayerLocal.js`? `World.js`? `ClientPointer.js`?

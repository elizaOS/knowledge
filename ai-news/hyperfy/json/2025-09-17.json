      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical implementation questions related to Hyperfy worlds. Key topics included setting up voice chat functionality using LiveKit, managing admin/builder roles in worlds, and data storage options. A user named Nicola Bertoglio sought help implementing voice chat in their space, and mrtzhckr provided the necessary environment variables. Another user (0mka) inquired about admin privileges and role management, which ash clarified involves setting admin codes and using the Free Build option. There was also a brief discussion about accessing localStorage from within scripts, with Gh0stt expressing a desire for browser-side storage capabilities beyond the existing world.storage API, which only stores data in the world JSON rather than in the user's browser.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How do I add the voice chat to my space? (asked by Nicola Bertoglio) A: You need to setup a LiveKit server or use LiveKit cloud service and set the parameters in the .env file (answered by mrtzhckr)\nQ: How do I manage roles for players? (asked by 0mka) A: Use the Free Build option in world settings or give people builder role in the players list (answered by ash)\nQ: Is there a reason we cant access the localStore directly?

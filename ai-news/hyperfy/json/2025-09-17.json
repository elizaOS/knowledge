Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical implementation of voice chat functionality in Hyperspace worlds using LiveKit. A user sought help setting up voice chat for their space, and received guidance on configuring LiveKit parameters in the .env file. The conversation also covered world administration features, particularly how the admin/builder role system works in newer builds. Key points included: setting admin codes, granting builder permissions through the players list, and the \"Free Build\" option that appears after setting an admin code. There was also a brief discussion about security considerations regarding script sandboxing and why direct access to localStorage is restricted to prevent malicious scripts from stealing user data like authentication tokens.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How do I add the voice chat to my space? (asked by Nicola Bertoglio) A: You need to setup a LiveKit server yourself or use the LiveKit cloud service and set the parameters in the .env file. (answered by mrtzhckr)\nQ: Is there a new process for admin public toggle for people in world? (asked by 0mka) A: Bottom of the world settings menu is a Free Build option. If you haven't set an admin code then everyone is a builder anyway. (answered by ash)\nQ: Is there a reason we cant access the localStore directly? (asked by Gh0stt) A: Scripts are sandboxed, you can't access the window object. It's a security issue if apps can read cookies as they could steal auth tokens.

Summary\nThe chat discusses a screen flickering issue experienced by Gert-Jan Akerboom on his Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G Android 14 phone when entering worlds in the application. Initially, 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 suggested the problem might be related to a specific palm tree asset, but Gert-Jan clarified that the issue predates the tree and occurs across different worlds. Other users (Valiant) confirmed no flickering occurs on iPhone 12 Pro or Samsung S9 devices, suggesting the issue might be device-specific. Ash recommended troubleshooting by disabling apps to isolate the cause, noting it could either be a fixable bug or a device-specific limitation. Gert-Jan agreed to investigate further.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does the flickering happen only when looking at the palm tree? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: No, the tree was made recently but the flickering has been happening for a while in different worlds (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: Does the flickering occur on iPhone or Samsung devices? (asked by Valiant) A: No flickering on iPhone 12 Pro or Samsung S9 (answered by Valiant)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on UI/UX improvements for Hyperfy's development interface. Ashxn shared mockups for a redesigned UI that separates regular player views from builder views, with a more intuitive tab-based organization. The proposed design includes main menu sections for world settings, documentation, app management, and a cleaner app inspection interface with dedicated tabs for properties, scripts, nodes, and metadata. 0mka and Ashxn debated implementation approaches, with 0mka suggesting additional refactoring of the codebase structure while Ashxn preferred focusing solely on the UI reorganization. They also discussed a potential new file structure for the world folder that would make assets more git-friendly and AI-friendly, with blueprints/manifests pointing to models, scripts, and assets. The \"keepActive\" option was introduced as a feature that allows apps to remain live while being moved, maintaining their script-driven state, scale, and rotation during repositioning. There was also discussion about the current limitations of manually editing files in the world folder versus using the in-world editor.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does the keepActive option solve keeping the scale size of something when you are moving it? (asked by 0mka) A: Yes (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Does anyone have any examples of .hyp files/folders? (asked by JollyGrin) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there a way to add code via IDE rather than in-world? (asked by JollyGrin) A: This is something we've been discussing because we all want version control of some kind (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can I edit the code snippets with the IDE or is it advised to do so in-world? (asked by JollyGrin) A: You can keep your own format in vscode etc and version control that, but you'd be copying pasting back and forth (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What do you think about pros and cons of folder per app versus scripts/assets/blueprints structure? (asked by peezy) A: The blueprint is essentially just a manifest pointing to a model, script and prop assets (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: JollyGrin | Context: JollyGrin was trying to add code via external editor and have it show up in the app menu | Resolution: Ashxn explained that the world folder is an engine/artifact format not meant to be manually changed, and that drag-and-drop is the current workflow\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: 0mka | Context: 0mka asked if keepActive option maintains scale during movement | Resolution: Ashxn confirmed it does maintain scale when moving objects\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: Community | Context: Explaining the new keepActive option | Resolution: Clarified it's opt-in because developers need to understand limitations with world space apps\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"âš¡â”‚general\"\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. Users primarily shared their \"hype dreams\" - desired features they'd like to see in Hyperfy. Maximus described an object importer that would allow users to bring items from their blockchain wallets or external data sources into worlds without gaining builder permissions. Agent12 proposed \"Engage-MINT Systems\" that would add value to interactable objects, enabling rogue-like growth games where interactions mint tokens on a curve. These tokens could be spent on in-world NFTs or upgrades. Agent12 also suggested enhancing the \"Summon App\" with \"hittable objects\" or different \"skins\" for throwable items. Jin mentioned summarizing three months of Hyperfy Discord activity into daily reports. The conversation included some joking references to the platform being \"dead,\" which MUDBONE clarified was an ongoing joke.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: If there was one hype you wanted for a world you are building in, what would it be? (asked by 0mka) A: Maximus described an object importer for blockchain wallets/data sources; Agent12 described \"Engage-MINT Systems\" for adding value to interactable objects\nQ: What do you mean 'hittable objects'? (asked by 0mka) A: Objects that can be thrown to hit and destroy other objects, with the app providing them when set down (answered by Agent12)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: 0mka | Helpee: Agent12 | Context: Clarifying what Agent12 meant by \"hittable objects\" | Resolution: Agent12 explained they meant throwable objects that can destroy other objects when the app is set down\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nFeature: Object importer for blockchain wallets/external data sources without granting builder permissions | Description: Allow users to bring objects into worlds with owner-defined restrictions | Mentioned By: maximus\nFeature: Engage-MINT Systems | Description: Add value to interactable objects where interactions mint tokens on a curve | Mentioned By: Agent12\nFeature: Enhanced Summon App | Description: Include \"hittable objects\" or different \"skins\" for throwable items | Mentioned By: Agent12\nFeature: Destroyable objects for the Earthbender cube | Description: Add barrels, ground targets, floating targets, and moving targets to aim at | Mentioned By: Agent12",

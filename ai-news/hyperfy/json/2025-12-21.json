      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment discusses the news about Ready Player Me (RPM) shutting down or changing its service, which has negatively impacted games that integrated with it. Ash shared a Twitter link about this situation, describing it as games getting \"rugged\" (abandoned/left without support). The conversation highlights the risks of relying on free but closed-source services. Roustan expressed dislike for RPM's closed nature and mentioned that Netflix might be partnering with Msquared instead, noting that Black Mirror is using Msquared. There was also a question about whether RPM avatars could be used in Hyperfy, with Ozymandias pointing out that RPM's terms forbid \"minting\" GLB files, making it incompatible with web3 principles.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it actually possible to use their [Ready Player Me] avatars in Hyperfy? (asked by Ozymandias) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nNo significant help interactions were present in this chat segment.\n\n## 4. Action Items\nNo specific action items were identified in this chat segment.",

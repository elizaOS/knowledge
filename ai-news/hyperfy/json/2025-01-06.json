      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for üíª‚îÇdevelopers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around developers seeking help with Hyperfy's React applications and documentation challenges. Several users, particularly StrawberrySith, express frustration with the current documentation's clarity and comprehensiveness. The developers mention that improved documentation is coming with V2, which will simplify app development by allowing coding directly in the browser without local setup. Jin shares an unofficial documentation repository that hasn't been merged into the official docs yet. There are discussions about multi-chain support in V2, with Ashxn confirming that every chain will be supported through plugins. Performance issues like camera jitter are mentioned, with maximus suggesting using the tilde (~) key to view performance stats. The chat also includes mentions of livestreaming development work and potential documentation improvements from the Numinia team who are planning to open-source their components with comprehensive documentation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I access my live Hyperfy space using CLI to edit React apps? (asked by StrawberrySith) A: Partial answer provided by yung_algorithm about using npm commands, but the full workflow wasn't clear\nQ: Will we have an opportunity to suggest new integrations like Zora when Hyperfy goes open source? (asked by StrawberrySith) A: Likely yes, according to maximus, as developers have spoken about open sourcing\nQ: Was the source code for the custom solana program (airdrop) ever published? (asked by t-900) A: Unanswered\nQ: Do V1 lands support the Solana network? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: No (answered by ApeironCreations)\nQ: Is it safe to assume V2 will offer Solana capability? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: Yes, V2 will be multi-chain with every chain supported through plugins (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: If I write a custom app for v1 is it likely to work in v2? (asked by hiroP) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can we integrate our agent (bossu) running on eliza on hyperfy? (asked by SotoAlt) A: Yes, using a modified direct-client (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Was there a fix to the camera-jitter bug when switching from 1st to 3rd person? (asked by yung_algorithm) A: It's related to performance issues; Knar had an idea but focus has been on V2 (answered by Ashxn and maximus)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"‚ö°‚îÇgeneral\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat revolves around the launch of $HYPER, a token for Hyperfy, a browser-based 3D metaverse platform. The project is transitioning from a V1 model (where access was gated by ETH NFTs called \"Worlds\") to a V2 model that will be open source and permissionless. A token airdrop was conducted for holders of Hyperfy World NFTs who owned them before December 7th and for ai16z partners who held 100k+ tokens. The airdrop process requires users to link their ETH wallet to a SOL wallet for claiming tokens.\n\nThe team, led by Ash and Saori, explained that V2 will be a significant improvement over V1, allowing anyone to build worlds without needing an NFT. The token will power the ecosystem and DAO. Many discussions centered around the airdrop claim process, token utility, and the project's vision. The team emphasized that V1 NFTs are now considered legacy and won't have additional utility in V2 beyond their current building capabilities.\n\nA key technical aspect highlighted is Hyperfy's ability to run in browsers without requiring powerful hardware, making it accessible across devices including VR. The platform will soon integrate AI agents (including Eliza) into the metaverse, creating interactive experiences. The team conducted an interview with \"threadguy\" in VR to demonstrate the technology.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the difference between V1 and V2? (asked by Dave.) A: V1 was NFT-gated to build worlds, V2 will open gates and allow people to build more freely with newer features. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Is there any value in buying V1 NFTs now? (asked by felixcrypto0034) A: No, they're only useful for building on V1, not for speculation or airdrops. (answered by maximus)\nQ: How many tokens did each world holder receive in the airdrop? (asked by syGMatMATTIOBOY üá¶üá∫) A: 151,200 tokens per world. (answered by TropixMusic)\nQ: Is the liquidity locked? (asked by Amy) A: Yes, it's locked in Raydium. (answered by Saori)\nQ: How much of the airdrop is left to be claimed? (asked by Arcane) A: 13% out of 35%. (answered by Saori)\nQ: Will V1 worlds be able to migrate to V2? (asked by SomeOtherGuy) A: Unanswered directly, but implied no automatic migration.\nQ: How long does it take after registering a SOL address to become eligible for claiming? (asked by stikkx) A: Could be a few hours, team processes in batches. (answered by ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì)\nQ: What will the token be used for? (asked by MokonaW) A: It will be used for governance through the DAO. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a deadline for claiming the airdrop? (asked by Sceth iii) A: The original Jan 7th deadline has been relaxed. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Will Hyperfy be on other chains besides Solana? (asked by QMA) A: Hyperfy will be on all chains and web2. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for üßä‚îÇ3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on an issue with bone hierarchies in 3D models when imported into Hyperfy. JUAN and ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì discussed a problem where animations were connecting to the hip bone instead of the root bone in Hyperfy, causing incorrect animation behavior. The issue appears inconsistent, affecting some Mixamo and Rokoko animations but not others. They identified that Hyperfy might be misinterpreting bone hierarchies, especially with complex rigs that use control bones or multiple animation layers. ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì mentioned using Rokoko to get animations working properly, but the hip-root connection problem persisted. JUAN suggested using retargeting tools to assign animations to the correct bones. The conversation briefly touched on documentation for Blender integration with Hyperfy, with Ashxn providing a link to the v1 documentation.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Any docs on how it works for blender? (asked by Matt [Cheems Guevara]) A: https://docs.hyperfy.io/designers/overview This is for v1 (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

The only technical insight shared was about resource usage for lights in Hyperfy V1, with the recommendation to use few or no lights for optimal performance. Community members mentioned issues with in-world commerce functionality, noting that stands weren't accepting payments. The conversation also revealed that co-founder Saori has left the project, with ash mentioning burnout as the reason. There were announcements about upcoming events including an M3 Demo Day, Poly's Immersive Award show, and tutorial sessions covering Git/GitHub, Architectural 3D design, and Optimization. A content creator (jar0d) expressed interest in creating visually engaging content from the platform, suggesting the community is at a stage where they're building both creator tools and end-user experiences.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How resource intensive are the Lights in Hyperfy V1? (asked by Paradoxx) A: Use 2-3 at maximum. Best is none. (answered by vox)\nQ: Who is behind this project and is there any roadmap? (asked by Jayzen) A: ash and saori seem to be the founders, but there are regulars working along. (answered by smickelbeard)\nQ: Is Saori no longer co-founder or just taking a break? (asked by Lemur) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Ash shared progress on new physics for vehicles with a basic car implementation that's currently client-side but could be simulated server-side in the future. Peezy demonstrated work on server-side mobs with weapon capabilities, discussing implementation challenges with multiple clones causing client crashes. There was discussion about creating reusable mob systems with different behaviors (melee vs. ranged). 0mka and Valiant collaborated on race track components including gates and waypoints for timing and anti-cheat measures. Several developers encountered technical issues with player teleportation, mouse controls, and animation synchronization. Jin discussed documentation improvements and submitted a PR. The conversation also touched on potential portal functionality between worlds, with HypPrivakos suggesting it would require decoupling the web from the server and implementing a system to disconnect/connect between world instances.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does player.teleport work? (asked by general hyper) A: Unanswered\nQ: What is the player controller speed? (asked by general hyper) A: smickelbeard shared code showing running is twice as fast as walking (8 vs 4 * mass)\nQ: Is there a reason why PR #64 hasn't been merged? (asked by jin) A: It was on a list of many things to do and needed to merge to dev branch (answered by ash)\nQ: When will elementals be available? (asked by peezy) A: Soon, after completing the new world menu UI (answered by ash)\nQ: When behavior trees? (asked by Shiffty) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Key discussions included:\n\n- Importing 3D models with collisions into worlds, with ash providing a solution using an app that auto-enables collisions for models\n- Texture support limitations, specifically that KTX/Draco compression isn't yet supported on the server side, with webp recommended as an alternative to KTX\n- A user encountering an error when trying to place models in a world, which was resolved by using the dev branch where support had recently been added\n- A workflow for importing animations from Hyperfy, which required downloading GLBs from a specific site, importing them as VRMs to Blender, and deleting transforms on the hips for proper functionality with player controller movement\n\nThe discussions demonstrated collaborative problem-solving among community members, with specific technical solutions provided for each issue raised.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does somebody know how to import collisions or a 3D model with collisions in a world? (asked by MiaHigashikata) A: This app lets you auto-enable collisions for its model. Drop it in the world, click \"Model\" to choose your glb, and toggle collision on etc (answered by ash)\nQ: Is this still the case? We have been having problems with some textures and we have been wondering if it's the ktx texture support (asked by MiaHigashikata) A: Yup no ktx/draco support yet because we haven't solved loading them on the server (answered by ash)\nQ: why do these animations import to blender as a giant iconosphere? (asked by general hyper) A: Self-answered: they download from that site as glb's but are vrms\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🪙│hyper Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThis chat segment primarily revolves around concerns about the Hyper token's price decline and questions about project development progress. A significant price dip occurred due to one wallet dumping approximately $10,000 worth of tokens. Community members expressed concern about the token's future, with some questioning the project's direction. Team member \"ash\" provided reassurance about ongoing development efforts, explaining they're working on multiple fronts: attracting content creators, building games internally, developing a Roblox-like platform, and continuing core engine work. The team acknowledged that development takes time and often appears to progress slowly before suddenly accelerating. There was also mention of upcoming roadmap updates and a new channel for community ideas.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why's the market cap so low now? What happened to it? (asked by chckyo) A: Someone gave us a big sale on hyper! One wallet dumped 10k worth. (answered by 0mka)\nQ: Could you briefly introduce the recent progress of the project? (asked by chckyo) A: Nah there's plenty to see all over the server. Or builders calls. (answered by 0mka)\nQ: What does Hyper Token mean to this community? (asked by eigb) A: Unanswered\nQ: What I'm curious about is the actual release and commercialization of real games? (asked by eigb) A: Engines and games take time to finish. Check more channels than hyper to see what's happening. Roadmap updates are underway. (answered by 0mka)\n\n## 3.

The conversation focuses on the possibility of linking users to specific coordinates within a game or world using URL parameters (like `play.hyperfy.xyz?x=5&y=5&z=5`) as an alternative to the standard `/spawn set` approach. A comparison is made to Decentraland (DCL), which has a similar feature allowing scene coordinates with local plot spawns set by plot owners. The participants suggest that coordinates could be passed as parameters either on the root route or a sub-route, or potentially using a named location that maps to specific coordinates.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I link a user to a certain location in my Hyperfy world?

User 0mka shared several images, including what appears to be a \"game timer start\" interface element. Agent12 proposed a gameplay feature suggestion about creating ambient healing zones that could serve as gathering points for players before the implementation of \"Citadels,\" conceptualizing them as \"Campsites out in the Dark Forest.\" 0mka responded positively to this suggestion. The conversation lacks detailed technical discussions, problem-solving, or implementation details.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Would it be possible to create ambient areas that slowly restore health points within a certain range? (asked by Agent12) A: That's a nice idea. (answered by 0mka)\n\n## 3.

A user shared a link to what appears to be an autonomous camera technology, suggesting it could be forked into a \"V2\" version for autonomous live productions. Another user proposed extending this concept to multi-agent workflows where camera positions would change based on which agent is speaking. The idea received positive feedback, with one user mentioning they had seen a working project with photos.

Key technical discussions included: grid snapping functionality for easier building, hosting options for Hyperfy worlds, and IP usage concerns. Several community members explored building capabilities, with one user (treed) receiving admin access to test world-building features. There was significant discussion about hosting services, particularly around \"hyperfy.host\" and whether using the Hyperfy name was appropriate. Ash (creator) clarified that while he doesn't personally mind, there could be legal implications and suggested alternative naming like \"hyperhost\" to avoid confusion. Technical features discussed included model importing limitations (file size caps of 12-16MB), OCR capabilities for processing images, and the potential for high concurrent user counts (CCU) in worlds. The community also discussed alignment tools, array tools, and the balance between powerful features and ease of use for non-technical users.\n\n## 2.

The token experienced significant price drops, with community members discussing market conditions, capitulation events, and technical developments. A notable incident involved a user accidentally burning 25k HYPER tokens due to a Solana token account closing bug, which the community collectively helped recover. The team is working on V2 of the platform with improved infrastructure, though specific tokenomics details remain undisclosed. Community members expressed frustration about the market's failure to recognize Hyperfy's technical value compared to other projects with less substance. The discussion also touched on hosting solutions for Hyperfy worlds, with independent service providers offering options for users to deploy their own instances.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How much is the real market cap of HYPER? (asked by Ahun) A: There are different figures - 15.8M circulating supply and 35M fully diluted value (answered by pawpaw_pirate)\nQ: Can V2 save $hyperfy?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the development of a game called \"Hyperball\" in Hyperfy, with extensive discussions about stadium design, game mechanics, and technical implementation. ~/HowiEDuhzit shared a Hyperfy-Tools GitHub repository that includes features for collision generation and scene export. The community extensively discussed stadium designs for Hyperball, with TheMattEmpire creating and iterating on a cyberpunk-themed arena. The game concept evolved from a soccer-like game to a \"king of the hill\" style where teams score points by keeping a ball in their team's circle. Technical discussions included implementing UV scrolling for animated textures, optimizing collision meshes, and handling materials in Blender exports. There were also conversations about VRM character models, with several users seeking help with rigging and optimization. The chat demonstrates strong community collaboration with users sharing models, tools, and technical advice to solve various 3D design challenges.\n\n## 2.

First, Pete reports problems with avatar switching in Brave browser, which ash suggests is likely a browser-specific issue rather than a platform change, noting that Brave often has compatibility issues with virtual world applications. Second, there's a brief exchange about blockchain transaction irreversibility when friyde seeks help with what appears to be a transaction problem. Third, Agent12 reports difficulties with the WalletConnect module in Hyperfy V1, specifically that it's unresponsive when trying to sign in with an \"AI Smart Wallet.\" Peezy provides valuable insight that WalletConnect v1 was deprecated approximately 18 months ago, suggesting this might be the root cause of the authentication problems in the older V1 platform. Additionally, treed mentions inconsistent physics behavior when rotating the grid, though Saori clarifies that gravity remains constant.\n\n## 2.

Summary:\n\nThe discussions in the infra channel focus on Hyperfy world hosting infrastructure and technical architecture improvements. Ash outlined plans to make the Hyperfy world repository more flexible by abstracting database access and asset endpoints, which would enable stateless world servers and containerized deployments. Multiple community members (Lastraum and HypPrivakos) are offering hosting services for Hyperfy worlds. There's discussion about authentication approaches, with tension between web2 and web3 solutions. HypPrivakos contributed a Dockerfile improvement reducing image size from 1.3GB to 387MB using node:22-alpine. The community is discussing standards for world portability, user data management, and cross-platform identification. There's also interest in documentation improvements and infrastructure standardization to ensure admins can easily port worlds between hosting providers.\n\n## 2.

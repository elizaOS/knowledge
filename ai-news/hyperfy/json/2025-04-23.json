      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical aspects of Hyperfy development. Key topics included: 1) An upcoming production branch launch planned by Ashxn; 2) UV scrolling implementation for materials in Hyperfy, with voxvienne successfully implementing it despite not being a coder; 3) Optimization techniques for 3D models, particularly regarding mesh joining and material handling; 4) Shadow control for specific meshes via Blender custom properties or script commands; 5) Hierarchy tab improvements for showing \"live\" elements; 6) External model loading issues on the server; 7) Particle system implementation for a rocket launcher effect; and 8) Brief mentions of wallet integration for avatar customization based on blockchain holdings. The conversations demonstrated collaborative problem-solving and knowledge sharing among developers with varying experience levels.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Any estimated date for the next launch in the production main branch? (asked by PabloFM | Numinia) A: Going to make one tonight or tomorrow. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is it possible to join all meshes to avoid drawcalls and just address specific materials? (asked by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎) A: Merging/joining in blender is only useful for performance if they all use one material. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can we make render ignore shadows from specific meshes? (asked by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎) A: Use Blender custom properties (boolean type) `castShadow=false` `receiveShadow=false` or via script with `mesh.castShadow = false` and `mesh.receiveShadow = false`. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Would it be nice if the hierarchy was the 'live' one showing elements added via script? (asked by peezy) A: The hierarchy tab could have a \"live\" toggle to switch between the two. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 | Context: UV scrolling implementation and mesh optimization | Resolution: Explained how Blender exports meshes with multiple materials and that joining meshes only helps performance when they share the same material\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 | Context: Controlling shadows for specific meshes | Resolution: Provided two methods - using Blender custom properties or script commands to control shadow casting/receiving\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: Gert-Jan Akerboom | Context: Particle system implementation for rocket launcher | Resolution: Suggested using `rateOverDistance` field for moving particles that can be easier to configure correctly\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: peezy | Context: Making hierarchy tab show live elements | Resolution: Suggested adding a \"live\" toggle to switch between static and dynamic views\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy's transition from V1 to V2 of their platform/engine. A significant discussion was initiated by voxvienne, who shared thoughts about the shift from V1's non-coder-friendly sandbox approach to V2's more code-centric development paradigm. Ashxn clarified that V2 will not be exclusively code-focused and promised \"app palettes\" similar to V1 but \"on steroids,\" suggesting that non-coders will still have accessible tools. The conversation indicates Hyperfy is a 3D world engine that powers various experiences, with several example worlds mentioned (play.hyperfy.xyz, fallen.hyperfy.xyz, tattedalien.club). There was also discussion about technical implementation of interactive elements like levers, which involves manipulating position, rotation, and quaternion of nodes. Community members shared links to their Hyperfy-powered worlds and discussed representing Hyperfy at upcoming events like Solana Conference in New York.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why is the $HYPER token pumping? (asked by johan) A: Likely due to general market movements, particularly Solana's rise, or recognition of recent V2 builds shared by community members (answered by maximus)\nQ: I'm trying to do exactly the same you did with the levers. Is playing with position, rotation & quaternion of the node enough to make the same effect? (asked by DevStarlight | Numinia) A: Unanswered\nQ: WEN palettes? (asked by miguel_amargo) A: Unanswered, though Ashxn mentioned earlier that app palettes like V1 are coming soon\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: HPrivakos | Helpee: MUDBONE | Context: Sharing examples of Hyperfy engine capabilities | Resolution: Provided link to uncannydev.hyperworld.host to demonstrate emissive models support\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: voxvienne | Context: Concerns about V2 being too code-focused for non-developers | Resolution: Clarified that V2 will have app palettes like V1 but enhanced, and that the current code focus is temporary\nHelper: devilsadvocate.sol | Helpee: MUDBONE | Context: Question about liquidity and trading volume | Resolution: Explained that 24hr trading volume reached nearly 100% of liquidity, which was unusual compared to typical <10% ratio\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on 3D asset optimization for Hyperfy environments. Users discussed tools for tree generation and optimization, specifically highlighting eztree.dev for creating tree models and babylonpress.org for optimizing GLB files. A key technical discussion centered around texture optimization, with emphasis on using WebP format for transparent textures instead of PNG to achieve up to 80% file size reduction. The conversation also addressed polygon count concerns with tree models, noting that leaves implemented as planes can significantly increase triangle counts (up to 800k triangles). Users acknowledged the importance of balancing high-quality assets with performance considerations, suggesting that while detailed trees work for individual scenes, low-poly alternatives would be necessary for larger environments like forests. There was also a brief mention of using drones and screen sharing for perspective views in Hyperfy.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can you get this perspective? (asked by peezy) A: You can use drone + screenshare (answered by ᲼)\nQ: How do you reduce file size for tree models? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: The original has a 7 mb png. WebP is awesome because it supports transparency while jpeg can't. It reduces file size almost 80% (answered by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)\nQ: Does babylonpress.org reduce the polygon count too?

      "summary": "# Analysis of 🪙│hyper Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around a conflict regarding token allocation transparency. Saori transferred 2 million HYPER tokens from his personal vesting allocation to peezy as a retroactive grant for his work on hypkg, which enables cross-chain functionality for Hyperfy. This sparked a heated discussion when general hyper asked about the team's token distribution structure (9%, 4%, 1%, 1% split among team members). The conversation became contentious when Saori refused to disclose specific allocation details, claiming such information is typically not publicly shared in projects. The discussion devolved into personal attacks. \n\nLater, HowieDuhzit criticized the project's funding priorities, suggesting that OnCyber (a competitor) was gaining an advantage because Hyperfy was funding individual preferences rather than establishing standards and supporting broader teams. Technical discussions included mentions of hypkg's importance for cross-chain compatibility, allowing builders to work with different blockchains including EVM, SVM, and MCP, with production-ready documentation already created by peezy.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the team token allocation structure? (asked by general hyper) A: 15% over 3 years, with a 9%, 4%, 1%, 1% split among team members (answered by Saori)\nQ: What determines the team split and does it unlock monthly over 3 years? (asked by general hyper) A: It's 15% over 3 years (answered by Saori)\nQ: What is hypkg? (asked by HowieDuhzit) A: A quick standard way to add and distribute modifications/custom libraries/functionality to Hyperfy that allows builders to use different chains with documentation (answered by Saori)\nQ: What chains does hypkg support? (implied by context) A: EVM, SVM, MCP with production-ready documentation (answered by Saori)\nQ: How can I integrate a Smol avatar into Hyperfy? (asked by Smol Preeminent) A: Follow the VRM standard in the avatar specs, and the folks in the design elements channel can help (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3.

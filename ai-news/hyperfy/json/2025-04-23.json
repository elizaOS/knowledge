      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussions in the developers channel focused on several technical topics. A production branch update was confirmed by Ashxn for \"tonight or tomorrow.\" Voxvienne successfully implemented UV scrolling in v2 with help from Grok, sharing code that scrolls textures on meshes with specific materials. Ashxn explained that Blender exports meshes with multiple materials as separate meshes per material, which is standard across game engines, and clarified that joining meshes only improves performance when they share the same material. \n\nThe conversation also covered shadow control in Hyperfy, with Ashxn explaining two methods: adding custom boolean properties in Blender (`castShadow=false`, `receiveShadow=false`) or using script commands (`mesh.castShadow = false`, `mesh.receiveShadow = false`). Peezy suggested improvements to the hierarchy tab, proposing a \"live\" toggle to show dynamically added elements, which Ashxn agreed would be feasible. Peezy also reported an issue with `world.load()` not working on the server for external URLs.\n\nGert-Jan Akerboom shared a rocket launcher particle effect implementation, with Ashxn suggesting the use of `rateOverDistance` for moving particle emitters. Jin shared information about recent Three.js updates. The chat also touched on wallet integration for avatar customization based on blockchain holdings.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Any estimated date for the next launch in the production main branch? (asked by PabloFM | Numinia) A: Going to make one tonight or tomorrow (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is it possible to join all meshes to avoid drawcalls and just address specific materials? (asked by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎) A: Merging/joining in blender is only useful for performance if they all use one material (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can we make render ignore shadows from specific meshes? (asked by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎) A: Use custom properties in Blender (`castShadow=false`, `receiveShadow=false`) or script commands (`mesh.castShadow = false`, `mesh.receiveShadow = false`) (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy's transition from V1 to V2 of their platform. A significant discussion came from voxvienne who shared reflections on this transition, noting that V1 was a non-coder's sandbox while V2 appears more code-focused. Ashxn clarified that V2 will not be exclusively code-dependent, describing it as \"V1 on steroids\" with app palettes coming soon. The community appears excited about Hyperfy's development, with members sharing tweets and discussing market movements. There was also mention of technical implementation questions regarding levers and node manipulation. The chat indicates Hyperfy is a world engine/platform powering various experiences, with several accessible worlds mentioned (play.hyperfy.xyz, fallen.hyperfy.xyz, tattedalien.club). Community members discussed representing Hyperfy at the Solana Conference, and there was a side conversation about CloneX's metadata issues, highlighting the importance of proper decentralized storage solutions like Arweave.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why is the token pumping? (asked by johan) A: Likely due to general market movements, particularly Solana's rise, or recognition of recent V2 builds shared by community members (answered by maximus)\nQ: I'm trying to do exactly the same you did with the levers. Is playing with position, rotation & quaternion of the node enough to make the same effect? (asked by DevStarlight | Numinia) A: Unanswered\nQ: WEN palettes? (asked by miguel_amargo) A: Unanswered, though Ashxn mentioned earlier that app palettes like V1 are coming soon\nQ: What did General mean by this? Is there something about the LP I am not understanding fully? (asked by MUDBONE) A: Trading volume was high, reaching nearly 100% of total liquidity, which is unusual as it's typically under 10% (answered by devilsadvocate.sol)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: maximus | Helpee: johan | Context: Questioning why the token was pumping | Resolution: Explained it was likely due to general market movements and Solana's rise\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: voxvienne | Context: Concerns about V2 being too code-focused | Resolution: Clarified that V2 will not be exclusively code-dependent and will include app palettes like V1\nHelper: HPrivakos | Helpee: MUDBONE | Context: Sharing examples of the engine | Resolution: Provided a link to uncannydev.hyperworld.host to showcase emissive models support\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: CheddarQueso 🧀 | Context: Question about CloneX metadata issue | Resolution: Explained they're migrating to Arweave, which should have been used from the beginning\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on 3D asset optimization for Hyperfy environments. Key technical discussions centered around tree models and file optimization. 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 shared eztree.dev for creating downloadable GLB tree models, recommending processing them through glb.babylonpress.org before using in Hyperfy. The conversation highlighted optimization challenges with tree models, particularly regarding polygon count and texture file sizes. The discussion revealed that tree models from eztree have high polygon counts (potentially 800k triangles with alpha foliage) because leaves are implemented as numerous plane objects. 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 emphasized the importance of texture optimization, noting that converting from PNG to WebP format can reduce file size by approximately 80% while maintaining transparency needed for tree leaves. There was also brief mention of using drones and screen sharing for perspective views in Hyperfy spaces. The conversation concluded with 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 offering 20k Hyper to support development of a low-poly tree generator tool that could output WebP textures.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can you get this perspective? (asked by peezy) A: You can use drone + screenshare (answered by ᲼)\nQ: How do you reduce file size for tree models? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: The original has a 7 mb png. WebP supports transparency and reduces file size almost 80% (answered by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)\nQ: Does the optimization tool reduce polygons too? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: No, it primarily reduces texture sizes (answered by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)\n\n## 3.

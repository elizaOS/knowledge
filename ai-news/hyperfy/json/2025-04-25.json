Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on UI/UX improvements for Hyperfy, with Omka sharing work on a redesigned interface that moves away from floating panels to a more structured layout with tabs and split views. Ashxn expressed concerns about UI organization, particularly regarding app palettes and the need for better component placement. They discussed technical implementations including scroll capture in hyps, key event handling, and loading assets from IPFS. The conversation touched on the challenges of apps spawning other apps and the potential security implications. Other topics included pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs), with Ashxn sharing code implementations, and UI feedback during loading processes. There were also discussions about first-person camera controls and custom player controllers.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I capture scroll events in a hyp to prevent them from controlling in-world scroll? (asked by Omka) A: Use `control.scrollDelta.capture = true` to take over the scroll wheel, but only capture it when needed (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can I implement a hotkey toggle for UI elements? (asked by Omka) A: Use control.keyI.onPress with a boolean flag to track visibility state (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can an app load another app from IPFS? (asked by Omka) A: Currently not supported as it raises security concerns; world.load only handles models and avatars (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is it possible to have a custom player/camera controller and first person view? (asked by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎) A: Yes, can be implemented similar to the drone example Omka shared (answered by Omka)\nQ: What's a good PRNG implementation for Hyperfy? (implied by Ashxn sharing code) A: Ashxn shared two implementations, with preference for the LFSR-based one (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around 3D avatar creation using AI tools. Users discuss TripoSG, an AI tool that can generate 3D models from images in under a minute. Ashxn demonstrates a workflow for creating, optimizing, and rigging 3D avatars, helping peezy create a 3D version of himself. The conversation highlights how AI is rapidly changing avatar creation, making it accessible and fast (15 minutes from generation to rigged model). Users share examples of \"Retardio\" models, which appear to be a subcultural NFT collection related to but distinct from \"Milady.\" There's also discussion about Hyperfy, a platform where these avatars can be used, with mentions of functionality like punching animations and the need for shadow optimization on mobile devices. Some technical challenges are mentioned, including transparency issues in models and the need for mesh optimization.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can we punch now in hyperfy?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 🧊│3d-design\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion focused on performance optimization and environmental design in Hyperfy. Key topics included performance visualization tools, LOD (Level of Detail) implementation, and object distribution techniques. Ashxn shared updates about app toggling functionality in development that allows users to disable apps to measure performance impact. The conversation explored ideas for performance indicators like a bar system showing resource usage across different device types (mobile, VR, desktop). \n\nA significant technical demonstration involved tree generation and wind effects, with code examples for cloning and distributing objects in a world space. The chat highlighted the importance of proper LOD implementation for performance optimization when scattering many objects. Shiffty shared work on a terrain object distribution system using raycasting to place objects on tagged terrain. Other development updates included new UI features like scale gizmo and mousewheel controls for rotation and scaling.\n\nThe discussion revealed current workflow challenges in the asset pipeline, particularly around LOD generation, which currently requires multiple tools (Hyperfy Tools for custom properties, Armory for auto-LOD, then manual renaming and reorganization).\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to tell what the FPS would be on all devices, even when using only one of them? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Not directly, but it might be possible to make an estimate (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can we make hyp files to toggle them? (asked by MetaRick) A: Apps can already toggle their own meshes with mesh.active=false, but toggling the whole app would prevent it from turning back on (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can I toggle visibility of multiple hyp objects at once when crossing a zone? (asked by MetaRick) A: You need logic for that - apps are being built for this functionality, but you can already do cross-app events via scripts (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for Channel \"🪙│hyper\"\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe conversation primarily revolves around Raydium's \"Burn and Earn\" mechanism for the HYPER token. General hyper and ash discuss how DEX screener records transactions where pool fees are claimed as \"removing liquidity,\" which they feel should be labeled differently. Ash clarifies that 99% of the liquidity is locked (\"burnt\" in Raydium terminology) while the remaining portion earns fees from trading volume. General hyper gains understanding about how the pool works - the locked portion accumulates fees that need to be periodically \"harvested.\" The chat also briefly mentions a potential co-marketing opportunity with hyperfy for character integration, which ash suggests discussing in DMs.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How does Raydium's \"Burn and Earn\" work for HYPER? (asked by general hyper) A: 99% is locked and the rest earns fees off volume. We burnt the entire thing when we launched, it was like 500k when we locked and burnt it. (answered by ash)\nQ: Why does DEX screener show fee collection as \"removing liquidity\"? (asked by general hyper) A: It's technically \"liquidity removed\" because the fees accumulate in the pool until you claim them. (answered by general hyper, confirmed by ash)\nQ: Is the project dead? (asked by Kami) A: As long as Agent12 is alive it won't be \"Dead\" (answered by Agent12)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: ash | Helpee: general hyper | Context: Understanding how Raydium's \"Burn and Earn\" mechanism works for HYPER token | Resolution: Ash explained that 99% of liquidity is locked/burnt while the remainder earns fees, and clarified that \"burn\" in this context means \"locked\"\nHelper: general hyper | Helpee: general hyper | Context: Understanding why DEX screener shows fee collection as removing liquidity | Resolution: Self-resolved by realizing fees accumulate in the pool until claimed, which technically is removing liquidity\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around two main technical issues. First, users are discussing problems with GLB models containing bones that cannot be interacted with properly because there's nothing for the reticle or mouse to click on. There's mention of gizmos for object manipulation, with some confusion about whether scaling functionality is available while holding objects. \n\nThe second major issue involves Pearl Hyacinth experiencing persistent loading problems with Hyperfy across multiple computers and browsers. The loading bar progresses slightly before stopping, and even the UI squares appear black. Several community members offered troubleshooting suggestions, including checking if it's related to wallet authentication (specifically Phantom wallet), trying incognito mode to rule out browser extensions, and clearing site data through developer tools. The issue appears to affect all worlds, not just specific ones, suggesting a more fundamental problem with Pearl's account or setup.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can someone give me troubleshooting ideas for why Hyperfy does not load on 4 different computers and 2 different browsers? (asked by Pearl Hyacinth) A: It could be related to Vipe avatars fetched via URL with servers down, browser extensions, or wallet authentication issues. Try incognito mode and clearing site data. (answered by vox, Saori, and 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\nQ: Is it just your world not loading? (asked by vox) A: It is all worlds - and even the squares are black. (answered by Pearl Hyacinth)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: vox | Helpee: Pearl Hyacinth | Context: Hyperfy not loading on multiple devices | Resolution: Suggested it might be related to Vipe avatars or VRM issues while logged in, and confirmed foxp2 world loads on iPhone12 mini\nHelper: Saori | Helpee: Pearl Hyacinth | Context: Hyperfy not loading | Resolution: Suggested trying incognito mode to check if browser extensions are causing the issue\nHelper: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 | Helpee: Pearl Hyacinth | Context: Black screen when loading Hyperfy | Resolution: Suggested clearing site data in Chrome developer tools\n\n## 4.

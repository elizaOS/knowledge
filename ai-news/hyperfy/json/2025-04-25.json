      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on UI/UX improvements for Hyperfy, with developers Omka and Ashxn exchanging ideas about enhancing the build interface. Omka shared progress on a redesigned UI with split views, tabbed components, and improved menu systems that would make the interface more intuitive and less cluttered. The conversation covered technical implementation details for inventory systems using hotkeys, loading assets from IPFS, and concerns about apps spawning other apps. \n\nOther technical topics included pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs), with Ashxn sharing optimized code implementations. Developers also discussed UI scroll capture functionality, the challenges of implementing CSS-like styling in VR environments, and the potential for app palettes to improve the building experience. There was significant interest in improving how assets are loaded and displayed, with references to other platforms like Resonite (Neos) that provide detailed loading feedback.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I capture scroll events in a Hyp without affecting world scroll? (asked by Omka) A: Use `control.scrollDelta.capture = true` to take over the scroll wheel, but only capture it when needed (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is it possible to use hotkeys to toggle UI elements? (asked by Omka) A: Yes, using control.keyI.onPress with a toggle flag to add/remove UI elements (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Why doesn't CSS work in Hyperfy? (asked by Omka) A: CSS doesn't work in VR; Hyperfy uses a CSS-like system where each rule is written to a canvas, allowing UI to exist in VR as a transparent screen (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can an app load another app from IPFS? (asked by Omka) A: Currently not supported as it raises concerns about control and potential abuse (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What's a good PRNG implementation for Hyperfy? (asked by Omka) A: Ashxn shared two implementations, with the second being preferred for better randomization (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around 3D avatar creation using AI tools. Users discuss TripoSG, an AI tool that can generate 3D models from images in under a minute. Ashxn demonstrates a workflow for creating, optimizing, and rigging 3D avatars, particularly for characters called \"retardio\" (a subculture related to Milady NFTs). The process involves using AI generation, then optimizing meshes in Blender, adding armatures with the VRM addon, and rigging with AutoRigPro. Several users share their 3D models and discuss implementation in Hyperfy (a metaverse platform). There's mention of functionality needs in Hyperfy, including avatar swapping and punch animations. The conversation also touches on technical challenges like transparency issues in models and phone performance considerations (turning off shadows). Users express excitement about the rapid advancement of 3D creation tools and the potential for automation of the workflow.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can we punch now in hyperfy? (asked by Akuma) A: In some worlds yeah (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Where are u running it? the hugging face space is ded (asked by peezy) A: Looks like its up again https://huggingface.co/spaces/VAST-AI/TripoSG (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What's retardio? I'm living under a rock these days. (asked by CheddarQueso 🧀) A: A milady sub culture inverse culture lol (answered by Akuma)\nQ: Is fallen down rn? (asked by MUDBONE) A: Working for me (answered by peezy)\nQ: What's milady? (asked by CheddarQueso 🧀) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe discussion focused on performance optimization and asset management in 3D environments, particularly for Hyperfy's platform. Key technical topics included:\n\n- Implementation of app toggling functionality to assess performance impact\n- Discussion of performance visualization tools, including a proposed performance bar that would indicate resource usage across different device types\n- Tree generation and wind animation effects with efficient instancing\n- LOD (Level of Detail) implementation for optimizing 3D assets\n- Scripting for object distribution and terrain generation\n- New UI features including scale gizmo and mousewheel controls for rotation and scaling\n- Performance considerations across different platforms (mobile, standalone VR, desktop)\n\nThe conversation highlighted the balance between visual quality and performance, with particular emphasis on texture optimization, polygon count management, and efficient instancing. Community members shared code snippets for tree generation and discussed workflows for creating auto-LOD systems, though noting current workflow challenges.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to tell what the FPS would be on all devices, even when using only one of them? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Not directly, but it might be possible to make estimates (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can we make hyp files to toggle them? (asked by MetaRick) A: Apps can already toggle their own meshes with mesh.active=false, but toggling the whole app would prevent it from turning back on (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How would cross-app events work for toggling visibility? (asked by MetaRick) A: You can already do cross-app events via scripts if you're adventurous, and dedicated apps for this functionality are being built (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

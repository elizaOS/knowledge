𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 shared progress on adding seats to their website (roustan.xyz) and later upgraded to a version that works with Actions. They implemented this by copying scripts from v2 and replacing v1 scripts, then re-adding emotes - a technique suggested by another user that saved significant time. The optimization discussion continued with file size considerations for the sitting GLB models, with 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 noting they were able to reduce the size of a particularly heavy model. There was also a brief discussion about the technical feasibility of creating No Man's Sky-like aesthetics in web environments, with Agent12 suggesting it's possible but would require significant development resources similar to what went into refining the game itself.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Anyone here played No Man's Sky? Is it possible to make worlds as aesthetically pleasing as that game or is the web too limiting to allow for that? (asked by Jayzen) A: I think it's will within reason to pull that off. But just as it took a Large Experienced teams Years to \"Refine\" what No-Mans sky is. It would take as much or more Dev-Power to make something like that native for Web/ or on Hyperfy. (answered by Agent12)\nQ: I guess webgpu intergration will be a big step in that direction? (asked by Jayzen) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is the project dead? (asked by Filbert) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Summary:\nThe chat segment primarily contains discussions about Hyperfy's market positioning, development timeline, and investor expectations rather than technical content. Community members debate the balance between technical development and marketing/outreach. Ashxn mentions that Hyperfy was considered as a \"brand coin\" in early development stages, as the company builds various interconnected technologies including AI, VR, virtual worlds, avatars, and digital collectibles. There's a sentiment that while technical excellence is important, market timing and investor interest are also crucial for success. The Cambrian partnership is highlighted as potentially significant. Some members express impatience about progress, while others advocate for patience in the development process.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does anyone know the Twitter user \"sayinshallah\" who shared something about Hyperfy? (asked by Saracismo) A: Unanswered\nQ: Should Hyperfy position itself as a brand coin? (asked by Rick, sharing a tweet) A: Hyperfy considered being a brand coin in early days due to building various interconnected technologies (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nNo significant help interactions were present in this chat segment.\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nFeature: Consider repositioning Hyperfy as a brand coin with the Hyperfy mascot as the coin image | Mentioned By: Rick (sharing tweet from osf_rekt)\nTechnical: Continue development of interconnected technologies (AI, VR, virtual worlds, avatars, digital collectibles) | Mentioned By: Ashxn",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion centers around a new 3D model generation tool from Tencent Hunyuan that produces cleaner meshes with better topology. Users are testing its capabilities and limitations. The tool generates 3D models with rigging and animations, though the quality varies. Key technical points include:\n\n- The generated meshes are clean (75% usable) but require tweaks\n- The tool times out during texturing phase for some users and consumes credits\n- Generated textures are often low quality (\"looks drawn on by a child\")\n- Rigging is basic Mixamo-style without finger articulation\n- Users are exploring alternative texturing workflows with UCUPaint in Blender\n- Some users are manually rigging to VRM format\n- The workflow includes using the generated mesh but replacing or improving the textures\n- Mesh optimization was discussed (Sparc 3D at 1M tris, Quadremeshed to 10K)\n\nUsers are excited about the time savings for base modeling but acknowledge limitations in texturing and rigging quality.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's wrong with the textures from the Tencent tool? (asked by Valiant) A: They look drawn on by a child (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: Does the tool have rigging and animations? (asked by .hyp shaman) A: Yes, it does have rigging and animations (answered by Valiant)\nQ: Where's the text-to-avatar that Ash is teasing? (asked by cwe) A: Ashxn clarified it's something different that requires \"no human work needed\" (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How long does generation take? (asked by .hyp shaman) A: The 240 seconds tends to be inaccurate (answered by Valiant)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: .hyp shaman | Helpee: cwe | Context: Confusion about how to use the Tencent tool | Resolution: Advised to go to the \"lab\" section to try the newest features\nHelper: Valiant | Helpee: .hyp shaman | Context: Sharing workflow for character creation | Resolution: Explained process using Sparc 3D (1M tris), Quadremeshing (10k) and baking\nHelper: .hyp shaman | Helpee: cwe | Context: Identifying which tool Ash was referring to | Resolution: Clarified it was the Tencent tool being discussed\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily discusses dynamic 3D model loading in the Hyperverse platform. Ashxn shares an experimental method to dynamically load GLB models from URLs using the `world.load()` function, which returns a model that can be added to the world. This functionality allows developers to load models at runtime rather than bundling them with applications. The loaded models behave like other node hierarchies, allowing for manipulation of individual meshes. Creazy.eth inquires about query parameters, which Ashxn confirms are not currently implemented. There's also a brief mention of \"Game Objects\" as a future plan by Lastraum. HypPrivakos notes that dynamic loading has been a long-requested feature in Decentraland. The conversation concludes with Gert-Jan Akerboom sharing what appears to be a successful implementation, receiving positive feedback from other members.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to dynamically replace or load a 3D model into the world on load? (asked by creazy.eth) A: Yes, you can use `const model = await world.load('model', 'https://somewhere.com/something.glb')` followed by `world.add(model)` (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Does the dynamically loaded model become attached to the script? How would you toggle its visibility? (asked by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz) A: Yes, it's spawned in the context of the app that loads it and behaves like any other node hierarchy where meshes can be deconstructed independently (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Are query parameters implemented right now? (asked by creazy.eth) A: No, they are not currently implemented (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: creazy.eth | Context: Needed a way to dynamically load 3D models into the world | Resolution: Provided code example using experimental world.load() function to load GLB files from URLs\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz | Context: Questions about manipulating dynamically loaded models | Resolution: Explained that loaded models behave like standard node hierarchies with independent mesh control\n\n## 4.

Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief discussion about a WebSocket disconnection issue on a website (world.visualworld798.xyz). A user reported frequent WebSocket disconnections and asked for help checking the issue. Another user suggested performing a speed test to determine if the problem was related to internet connectivity.

The update includes several new features: four emote choices, toggle between click-to-use and action trigger (VR-friendly) modes, options to toggle chair icon visibility, toggle chair mesh visibility, customize action labels, adjust action location, and fine-tune anchor positioning. 0mka provided instructions for transferring position data when replacing old versions and mentioned that emotes can be downloaded via shift-click. Later, 0mka shared an update that included an optimized \"Sitting and Talking\" emote from Roustan. The conversation was brief but focused on sharing technical improvements to what appears to be a VR-compatible sitting system with emote integration.\n\n## 2.

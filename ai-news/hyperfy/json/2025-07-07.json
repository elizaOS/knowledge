Roustan shared progress on adding seats to their website (roustan.xyz) and later successfully implemented \"seat v2\" with Actions functionality by copying scripts from v2 to replace v1 scripts, then re-adding emotes. This approach saved significant time compared to manually copying positions for approximately 40 seats across three instances. The implementation was confirmed working on mobile devices. There was also discussion about file size optimization for sitting GLB models, with Roustan noting they optimized a particularly heavy model and sharing a lighter alternative, though with positioning issues. A brief discussion about the technical feasibility of creating No Man's Sky-like aesthetics in web environments occurred, with Agent12 suggesting it's possible but would require significant development resources similar to what the original game needed.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Anyone here played No Man's Sky? Is it possible to make worlds as aesthetically pleasing as that game or is the web too limiting to allow for that? (asked by Jayzen) A: I think it's will within reason to pull that off. But just as it took a Large Experienced teams Years to \"Refine\" what No-Mans sky is. It would take as much or more Dev-Power to make something like that native for Web/ or on Hyperfy. (answered by Agent12)\nQ: I guess webgpu intergration will be a big step in that direction? (asked by Jayzen) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is the project dead? (asked by Filbert) A: Only at the end. (answered by Pete)\n\n## 3.

Summary:\nThe chat segment primarily contains discussions about Hyperfy's market positioning and development strategy rather than technical content. Community members debate the balance between technical development and market outreach. Ashxn mentions that Hyperfy was considered as a \"brand coin\" in early development stages, as the company builds various interconnected technologies including AI, VR, virtual worlds, avatars, and digital collectibles. The conversation reveals tension between those wanting faster market results and others advocating patience with the development process. There's also brief mention of a potential Cambrian partnership that some members consider significant. No specific technical implementations or solutions are discussed in detail in this segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does anyone know the Twitter user \"sayinshallah\" who shared something about Hyperfy? (asked by Saracismo) A: Unanswered\nQ: Should Hyperfy position itself as a brand coin? (asked by Rick, sharing osf_rekt's tweet) A: Ashxn mentioned they considered this approach in early days due to their diverse technology focus (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ§Šâ”‚3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion centers around a new 3D model generation tool from Tencent Hunyuan that produces cleaner meshes with better topology. Users are testing its capabilities and limitations. Valiant reports timeouts during the texturing phase that consume credits, though regular generation works fine. The tool produces clean meshes that are good for seams and UVs, estimated at 75% usable with some tweaks needed. The generated models include rigging and animations in a basic Mixamo-style armature without fingers. Users find the textures less impressive, described as looking \"drawn on by a child,\" leading some to discard them in favor of manual repainting using tools like ucupaint in Blender. Valiant shares a workflow using Sparc 3D for initial generation (1M tris), followed by Quadremesh reduction (10K) and baking. There's also discussion about Ash's tweet regarding a text-to-avatar tool, with some confusion about whether it refers to the Tencent tool or something new. Ash clarifies it's something different that requires \"no human work.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's wrong with the textures from the Tencent Hunyuan tool? (asked by Valiant) A: It looks drawn on by a child (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: Does the tool have rigging and animations? (asked by .hyp shaman) A: Yes, it does have rigging + anims (answered by Valiant)\nQ: What kind of armature does it generate? (implied by .hyp shaman) A: Armature is mixamo mode...basic, no fingers (answered by Valiant)\nQ: Where's this text-to-avatar that ash is teasing? (asked by cwe) A: Unanswered directly, but Ash later clarifies it's not the Tencent tool\n\n## 3.

Ashxn shares an experimental method to dynamically load GLB models from URLs using `world.load()` and `world.add()` functions. This capability appears significant as HypPrivakos mentions it was requested for years in Decentraland. Lastraum notes this functionality aligns with their plans for Game Objects. The discussion also briefly touches on query parameters, which are currently not implemented. Gert-Jan Akerboom shares something they're working on (likely a 3D model or scene), receiving positive feedback from other members. The conversation reveals ongoing development and experimentation with the platform's capabilities, particularly around dynamic asset loading.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to dynamically replace or load a 3D model into the world on load? (asked by creazy.eth) A: You can dynamically load GLB from a URL using `world.load('model', 'https://somewhere.com/something.glb')` followed by `world.add(model)` (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Does the dynamically loaded model become attached to the script? How would you toggle its visibility? (asked by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz) A: It's spawned in the context of the app that loads it, and works like any other node hierarchy where meshes can be deconstructed independently (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Are query parameters not implemented right now? (asked by creazy.eth) A: Correct, they are not implemented (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

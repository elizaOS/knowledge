The main topic revolves around the transition from Hyperfy v1 to v2, specifically addressing whether worlds can be migrated between versions. A user asks about copying worlds from legacy to 2.0, and ash clarifies that this isn't possible because v2 uses a completely different engine. The original v1 was tightly integrated with its platform, while v2 offers more freedom. Another user expresses confusion about accessing the new platform and asks if it requires a server, to which Gert-Jan Akerboom responds by sharing a link to the quickstart documentation.\n\n## 2.

Ash mentions that Fly (presumably Fly.io hosting service) provides temporary file systems that are wiped when the service shuts down, suggesting that persistent volumes are needed for data that should survive restarts. Later, a user named \"untitled, xyz\" confirms this solved their issue. Ash also acknowledges a GitHub pull request (PR #147) submitted by Saori to the Hyperfy repository, expressing appreciation for the contribution.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does storage work on Fly.io? (implied by context from ash) A: Fly provides temporary file systems that are wiped on shutdown; persistent volumes are needed for data that should survive restarts (answered by ash)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: untitled, xyz | Context: Issue with data persistence on Fly.io | Resolution: Suggested using persistent volumes instead of temporary file system, which solved the problem\n\n## 4.

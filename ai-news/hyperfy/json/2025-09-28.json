      "summary": "# Analysis of ⚡│general Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion, primarily focusing on animation sources for VRM models. Users discussed alternatives to Mixamo, with mentions of ActorCore (which one user reported wasn't working) and SayMotion by DeepMotion. There was feedback that SayMotion's bone mapping might not be accurate. The chat also included an interaction with what appeared to be a scam attempt, which users quickly identified. A community member announced an upcoming Hyperfy V2 presentation on a show/podcast where they plan to demonstrate hyps they've created and potentially take requests for in-world AI generations. There was also a brief exchange about making links clickable or copyable in the Discord app.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Besides Mixamo, what are other sources of animation for VRM? (asked by Cayden0207) A: SayMotion by DeepMotion was suggested, though it may have bone mapping accuracy issues (answered by mrtzhckr)\nQ: Has anyone had experience with SayMotion? (asked by mrtzhckr) A: Cayden0207 tried it but found the bone mapping not very accurate\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: mrtzhckr | Helpee: Cayden0207 | Context: Looking for VRM animation sources besides Mixamo | Resolution: Suggested SayMotion with a link, though the solution had limitations with bone mapping\nHelper: Shiffty | Helpee: Enryt | Context: Links not being clickable or copyable in Discord Android app | Resolution: Added links below each post as a workaround\n\n## 4. Action Items\nFeature: Improve clickable/copyable links in Discord interface | Description: Users noted difficulty accessing links on Android Discord app | Mentioned By: Enryt\nDocumentation: Information about compatible animation sources for VRM | Description: Compile reliable animation sources that work well with VRM | Mentioned By: Cayden0207",

Key discussions included:\n\n- szjanko shared updates about HyperWorld.Host marketplace, highlighting features like hyp updating, tagging, search/filtering, and a tipping system for creators.\n- mrtzhckr updated their GitHub fork of GS (presumably Gaussian Splatting) with several improvements: upgraded spark.js to 0.19, implemented consistent asset loading/caching logic, fixed the \"invalid gzip error\" for splats persistence across browser reloads, and resolved color/opacity issues.\n- A discussion about 3D Gaussian Splatting implementation was referenced, with hiroP sharing inspiration from a Twitter post showing examples running on iPhone.\n- mrtzhckr requested a feature enhancement to ServerAI.js to support custom OpenAI-compatible API endpoints beyond the default OpenAI implementation, specifically to enable Azure OpenAI, self-hosted vLLM instances, Ollama, and other compatible APIs through environment variables.\n- emotionull sought advice on coding hyp files, with Dhin and Gert-Jan offering suggestions about iterative development and using example scripts.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does someone have a fly .hyp so everyone can look from above? (asked by mrtzhckr) A: Unanswered\nQ: Anyone got any pointers for vibe coding hyp files? (asked by emotionull) A: I find keeping it very simple and then iterate one thing at a time. I tried a sort of non destructive workflow with dot's diner that kinda shows my process for it. (answered by Dhin)\nQ: Anyone got any pointers for vibe coding hyp files? (asked by emotionull) A: Feed it example scripts (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: mrtzhckr | Helpee: Community | Context: Updated GS fork with improved splat handling | Resolution: Fixed \"invalid gzip error\", color/opacity issues, and implemented consistent asset loading/caching logic; shared GitHub repo and demo link\nHelper: hiroP | Helpee: Community | Context: Sharing inspiration for 3D Gaussian Splatting implementation | Resolution: Shared Twitter link showing examples including one running on iPhone\nHelper: Dhin | Helpee: emotionull | Context: Advice on coding hyp files | Resolution: Suggested iterative development approach referencing dot's diner as an example\n\n## 4.

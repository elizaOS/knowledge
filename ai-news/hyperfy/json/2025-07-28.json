      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on network performance optimization for Hyperfy worlds. Ashxn implemented changes to reduce jitter and improve smoothness, which were deployed to the dev environment and play world. Cru tested these changes and confirmed improvement, mentioning they had increased the network rate to 1/24 for better responsiveness, though Ashxn noted this triples data transfer. They briefly compared tick rates with CS2's 64 tick rate.\n\nA significant technical limitation was discussed regarding WebSocket connections. Gh0sTt wanted to establish secondary WebSocket connections for AI integration but discovered this isn't supported without forking the engine. This sparked discussion about the limitations this imposes on developers building interactive applications.\n\nThe chat also covered Gh0sTt's implementation of a chess game with 3D elements, which they found surprisingly easy to add. There was discussion about customizing the chess pieces with VRM models, potentially allowing users to use NFT-based avatars as chess pieces through wallet connections.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to set up a secondary websocket connection from an app? (asked by Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘) A: Not without a forked engine, it's easy to add but it's not supported yet. And if you fork, then your apps won't be interoperable. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can't play in the play world anymore? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: I dunno if I or someone else turned off free build but it's back on. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Wen built in audio app with spatial trigger box toggle?

The first mentions a visual artifact described as a \"seam\" in the world that makes it appear as if a model is repeating, though they note this isn't visible in some video reference. The second issue concerns the removal of a \"double jump\" feature, which has made certain areas in built worlds inaccessible to visitors. This suggests a gameplay mechanic was changed, breaking existing world designs that relied on this movement ability.",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on network performance optimization in Hyperfy worlds. Ashxn implemented changes to reduce jitter and improve smoothness, which were deployed to the dev environment and play world. Cru tested these changes and confirmed improvement, mentioning they had increased the network rate to 1/24 for better responsiveness, though Ashxn noted this triples data transfer. There was also significant discussion about WebSocket limitations in the platform, with Gh0sTt expressing frustration about not being able to establish secondary WebSocket connections from apps, which would benefit AI interactions and games. Ashxn explained this would require forking the engine, compromising interoperability. The shaman suggested a potential workaround using headless Hyperfy instances, similar to how Eliza Hyperfy works, though Gh0sTt preferred direct connections to their own AI systems.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can't play in the play world anymore? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: I dunno if I or someone else turned off free build but its back on (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to set up a secondary websocket connection from an app? (asked by Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘) A: Not without a forked engine, it's easy to add but its not supported yet (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

Both messages indicate that they purchased more of something (likely cryptocurrency or tokens related to the \"hyper\" channel). There are no technical discussions, problem-solving, or implementations mentioned in this limited exchange. The conversation simply shows two community members sharing that they've increased their holdings despite what appears to be a price decline, as suggested by johan's \"going down with the ship\" comment.",

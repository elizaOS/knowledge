      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around Hyperfy development, with several key technical topics emerging. A marketplace for Hyperfy assets (hyperworld.host) was shared, allowing users to upload, update, tag, and receive tips for their creations. There was significant discussion about 3D Gaussian Splatting technology, with mrtzhckr sharing an updated fork of the GS implementation that fixes several technical issues including invalid gzip errors, color/opacity problems, and improved loading/caching logic. The updated fork uses spark.js 0.19 and implements the same loading mechanisms as other assets. \n\nAnother technical discussion centered on AI integration, with mrtzhckr requesting support for custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints through an AI_BASE_URL environment variable, which would enable integration with Azure OpenAI, self-hosted vLLM instances, Ollama, and other OpenAI-compatible APIs. This feature would expand the AI capabilities beyond the current implementation that only supports the standard OpenAI API.\n\nThere were also mentions of challenges with \"vibe coding\" Hyperfy files, with suggestions to feed example scripts to AI and iterate incrementally. Ash mentioned issues with the vibe world crashing, potentially due to memory leaks in one of many AI-generated apps.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does someone have a fly .hyp so everyone can look from above? (asked by mrtzhckr) A: Unanswered\nQ: Would it be possible to have the vibe world back up just for visiting and looking around? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Unanswered\nQ: There really isn't a way to access the cookies/localStore? (asked by Gh0stt) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment shows minimal technical discussion. The main technical point mentioned is the integration of \"prims\" with AI and the enabling of OpenRouter, which allows users to run custom LLMs for generation in Hyperfy. There was a brief mention of SayMotion having bone mapping accuracy issues. A community member (Gert-Jan Akerboom) announced an upcoming Hyperfy V2 presentation that will include demonstrations and in-world AI generations. The conversation also touched on concerns about the project's activity level, with maximus confirming he's still monitoring but has reduced involvement. The chat included a spam/scam alert that community members quickly identified.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is SayMotion's bone mapping accurate? (asked by Cayden0207) A: No specific answer provided, but Cayden0207 mentioned it was not accurate in their experience.\nQ: Has project activity decreased? (asked by Jayzen) A: Maximus confirmed he's still around but has \"had to step back quite a bit\" and noted that bi-weekly calls happen but aren't consistent.\nQ: What are the recent major updates to the project? (asked by Jayzen) A: Integration of \"prims\" with AI and enabling OpenRouter for custom LLMs (answered by maximus).\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Shiffty | Helpee: Enryt | Context: Enryt mentioned links weren't clickable or copyable from Android Discord app | Resolution: Shiffty added links below each post as a workaround.\n\n## 4.

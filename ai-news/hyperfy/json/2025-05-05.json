      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on technical discussions around several key topics. Ashxn announced the availability of skinnedmesh.getBone(name) in a dev branch. There was an extensive discussion about emission color in materials, with solutions involving texture atlases and matching diffuse/emissive colors. Vox shared advanced lighting techniques using transparent stencil meshes with cutouts to create lighting effects without performance-heavy dynamic lights, combined with baked lighting for optimal performance. Peezy revealed work on a UI for managing hypkg mods with a system that loads mods from separate folders to prevent conflicts. A significant development was Gert-Jan's new NEON app, which was collaboratively improved with b0gie adding sound effects and snap points. The community also discussed skybox implementation, world disconnection issues, and documentation updates with the launch of docs.hyperfy.xyz.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to change the color of the emission? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Add a texture in the emission slot, then use texture atlas; match diffuse and emissive colors for consistent bloom (answered by b0gie and Ashxn)\nQ: How can I get rid of any default skybox image that is built in core? (asked by vox) A: The plan is to have no default skysphere and worlds start with a sky app that you can delete (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What does app.keepActive = true do? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: It keeps the set text set (answered by b0gie)\nQ: Do you guys get random disconnects in your servers? (asked by vincentskele) A: Yes quite often (answered by vox)\nQ: How far away are the Vehicles from being ready? (asked by drdoge.eth) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

There was a brief mention of a potential teleportation feature for builders in Hyperfy, with concerns about collision issues. A community member inquired about the legacy platform (v1) and received confirmation that it would continue to function with no immediate retirement plans. There was also discussion about documentation, with 0mka sharing links to Hyperfy docs and mentioning plans to add AI chat functionality to the site. The chat included references to upcoming events by VTATV and mentions of Pizza DAO. Technical content was limited, with 0mka briefly mentioning work on emits/receives for locationator app placement, though not yet added to the apps/inspect pane.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can I still use the legacy platform? (asked by Harambe Advocate) A: You should be able to (answered by Agent12)\nQ: Will it be retired at all? (asked by Harambe Advocate) A: There will be a time that the worlds cannot be hosted any longer but there is no set deadline. If your running events on them still they should continue working. You should get plenty of notice when v1 worlds are to be closed. (answered by minimus-audio-issues)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 🧊│3d-design\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily discusses Level of Detail (LOD) implementations and vertex painting techniques. Ashxn introduced a scale-aware LOD feature that adjusts the LOD transition distance based on object scale, solving the issue where scaled-up objects would switch to lower quality models too soon. This ensures that larger objects maintain their high-quality models at proportionally greater distances. The discussion also covered vertex painting using UCUPaint, with b0gie sharing their experience implementing it for \"filler objects\" in scenes. They demonstrated a vertex color implementation created on their laptop, though noted an issue with emission not properly using the color attribute. Vox raised a question about drawcalls with multiple LODs, which Ashxn confirmed would increase but noted the performance benefits still outweigh the drawcall cost.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: If I instance many different items across the scene with 3 LODs, do I get 3 times the drawcalls compared to using 1 LOD? (asked by vox) A: Yes, but you're still far better off performance-wise. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Do you have a vertex painted thing in a world to show me a simple result? (asked by vox) A: Not yet, gotta prod something. (answered by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\n\n## 3.

Users are checking the price of a token called \"Hyperpigmentation\" (HYPER) using a bot command \"$hyper\". One user (DevStarlight | Numinia) notices a discrepancy between the reported price (0.013) and what they believe is the actual price (0.0062). The bot shows the token has a market cap of 12.8M with fluctuating percentage changes (54.2% in the first query, then 44.6% in a subsequent query minutes later). Another user checks a different but similarly named token \"Hyperfy\" using \"$hyperfy\" command. The chat doesn't contain any technical discussions, decisions, or problem-solving beyond this price checking activity.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Something's wrong here? It says 0.013, but the real price is 0.0062 (asked by DevStarlight | Numinia) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nNo significant help interactions were present in this chat segment.\n\n## 4.

TheMattEmpire reported an avatar facing issue when clicking while moving. User 0mka raised concerns about key bindings, specifically the 'R' key for duplication conflicting with browser reload (Ctrl+Shift+R) and requested that the 'Z' key (which hides UI) should keep the reticle visible. Ash confirmed the 'R' key issue was fixed in the development version and inquired about the use case for keeping the reticle visible when hiding UI. Two bugs were discussed but difficult to reproduce: a Z key sometimes not working (with Ash offering a bounty for reproduction steps) and a camera flip bug where the view suddenly changes to look down at the player or up from below.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can 'R' maybe be a different key for duplicating? (asked by 0mka) A: Fixed in dev. I kept doing this too. (answered by ash)\nQ: Would like to Z to remove UI, but still have reticle active/visible (asked by 0mka) A: Intention for Z to hide UI is for recording cinematics and stuff. What's your usecase? (answered by ash)\nQ: There's this weird thing where Z sometimes doesn't work. Anyone seen this? (asked by ash) A: I did it once but haven't been able to do it on command. (answered by 0mka)\n\n## 3.

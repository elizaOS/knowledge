      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on implementing lightmaps in 3D environments across different tools. Ashxn shared code for integrating Needle lightmaps with Three.js, showing how to extract and apply lightmap data from GLTF files. The code handles texture extraction, material modification, and shader customization to properly display lightmapped scenes. MetaRick demonstrated examples of scenes using a single lightmap across multiple objects, highlighting the efficiency of this approach. Lastraum mentioned integrating Privy into The Forge to simplify user connections from Hyperfy without requiring web3 wallets. There was also brief discussion about geometry nodes in Blender and their exportability limitations. The technical focus was on improving rendering quality and efficiency while maintaining compatibility across different 3D platforms.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can geometry nodes be exported to GLTF? (implied by Ashxn) A: You can export geonodes but there are limits (answered by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\nQ: Are you using needle-tool-blender? If so, what version of Blender are you using? (asked by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/) A: I'm using the Unity version (answered by MetaRick)\nQ: Does the baking work on both Unity and Blender versions? (implied by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/) A: I believe the baking works on both (answered by MetaRick)\n\n## 3.

A user asked about downloading multiple .hyp files as a single file, specifically for a conference hall with chairs. Community members provided solutions including downloading individual apps or zipping the entire \"world\" folder. There was also a suggestion to use Blender with empty objects to position seat apps. A technical issue was reported where users couldn't delete a specific model from their world despite multiple attempts. The chat included minimal technical discussion but showed community members helping each other with practical Hyperfy usage questions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to select multiple .hyp files and download them as a single .hyp file? (asked by Cayden0207) A: You can either download individual apps, or all apps together. The latter is by zipping up your `world` folder (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can we delete this model from our world? (asked by Cayden0207) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: Cayden0207 | Context: User wanted to download multiple .hyp files (conference hall with chairs) as a single file | Resolution: Suggested downloading individual apps or zipping the entire \"world\" folder\nHelper: 0mka | Helpee: Cayden0207 | Context: Alternative approach to managing multiple objects | Resolution: Suggested using Blender with empty objects to position seat apps and provided a downloadable GLB example\n\n## 4.

Community members proposed several ideas including a \"stake-to-host\" model where users could stake HYPER tokens to receive free hosting services. Another suggestion involved creating an asset marketplace that exclusively accepts HYPER tokens for transactions, potentially reducing token supply through burns or redistribution. Ashxn, likely a team member, clarified that Hyperfy is completely open source (including the engine, editor, and ecosystem tooling) and that users won't need to worry about hosting in the future. The platform allows for real-time collaborative world building with persistent changes, differentiating it from Roblox's offline building approach. Ashxn also provided information about token distribution, noting that approximately 10% consists of unclaimed airdrops (essentially burnt), 15% is linearly vested over 3 years, and 30% is currently inactive DAO allocation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Will Hyperfy offer hosting as a part of the solution in the future? (asked by Jayzen) A: All I can say currently is that people won't need to worry about hosting. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How much of the project is open source? (asked by Jayzen) A: Everything is completely open source, the engine, the editor, and any ecosystem tooling we'll be releasing along the way. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can you build and modify assets directly in Hyperfy like you can do in Roblox? (asked by Jayzen) A: Unanswered\nQ: What is the actual circulating supply? Is there any plan to burn or otherwise deal with the tokens that are not in circulation? (asked by haihui) A: Around 10% is unclaimed airdrops, essentially burnt. Another 15% is linear vested over 3 years. DAO 30% is also inactive right now. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: Jayzen | Context: Jayzen asked about Hyperfy's open-source nature and how it compares to Roblox | Resolution: Ashxn explained that Hyperfy is fully open source and allows for real-time collaborative world building with persistence, unlike Roblox's offline building approach.\n\n## 4.

He specifically mentioned using the high-poly version for 3D printing purposes, while noting the low-poly version is suitable for game development. MetaRick explained that the low-poly generator works best when the input image already has a low-poly aesthetic, and recommended using ChatGPT to create appropriate low-poly T-pose reference images. He warned that if the supplied image is too detailed, the generator will produce high-poly models unsuitable for game development. MetaRick included a link to the low-poly generator (https://3d.hunyuan.tencent.com/lowpoly) and shared an example of his reference image with the generated result including wireframe.",

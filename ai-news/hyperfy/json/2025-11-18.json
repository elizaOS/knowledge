There are brief mentions of a few AI models and development work, but no detailed technical conversations. 3rdEyeVisuals mentions working on \"BE Docker Guts\" suggesting backend Docker configuration work. MetaMike inquires about Gemini 3 builds, indicating interest in Google's AI model. .hyp shaman mentions working with \"kimi k2\" (likely referring to an AI model) and recently installing \"antigrav\" (possibly a development tool). There's also a mention of \"neworld.ai coming soon\" which appears to be an upcoming project or service. Overall, the chat contains mostly brief updates and casual exchanges rather than substantive technical discussions or problem-solving.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why are there no Gemini 3 build posts here yet?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat in the \"⚡│general\" channel primarily focused on development and collaboration opportunities. Gert-Jan Akerboom shared a TriggerZone app he created, noting a bug with the 'unique' toggle functionality and providing a workaround by copying code to fresh blocks. Dhin proposed building a Fall Guys-style platforming game with 100 levels and sought collaborators, with Gert-Jan and Pete expressing interest. Pete mentioned he could contribute 3D assets rather than code. There was also a brief interaction about enabling custom avatars in a world, with Roustan providing instructions to turn on the feature in the admin menu and drag in a .hyp file. The chat demonstrates community members actively sharing their projects and seeking collaboration opportunities.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I use the TriggerZone app with multiple zones? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: You can have multiple trigger zones on 1 discord hook, but when the 'unique' toggle doesn't work, add one zone then copy/paste the code into fresh default blocks. (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: How do I enable custom avatars? (implied by Roustan's response) A: Turn on custom avatars in the admin menu under the world icon and drag the .hyp file into the window. (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\n\n## 3.

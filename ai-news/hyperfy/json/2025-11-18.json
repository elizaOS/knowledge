      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on development and collaboration in what appears to be a game or virtual world platform. Gert-Jan Akerboom shared a TriggerZone app he developed that allows multiple trigger zones on a single Discord hook, though he noted an issue with the \"unique\" toggle functionality. He provided a workaround by suggesting users add one trigger zone and then copy-paste the code into fresh blocks for additional zones. Dhin expressed interest in building a Fall Guys-style platforming game with 100 levels and sought collaborators. Several members showed interest in joining this project, including Gert-Jan Akerboom and Pete (who offered to create 3D assets). There was also a brief exchange about enabling custom avatars in an admin menu and adding a \"hyp\" file, with Roustan providing instructions to MetaDJ.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I implement multiple trigger zones when the 'unique' toggle doesn't work? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Add one trigger zone and then copy-paste the code into fresh default blocks for additional zones. (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: How do I enable custom avatars?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily revolves around in-world app development and management in HyperWorld. User mrtzhckr inquired about resetting the play-world to access NPCs for AI agent development. Other users directed them to specific community members who have developed NPCs. The main technical conversation centered on 3rdEyeVisuals' efforts to create an in-world app bundling system. They developed an upload button for the sidebar that allows users to upload plain .js files as apps and are working on a HYP BUNDLER GUI for in-world app creation. This tool would enable users to bundle .hyp files through a drag-and-drop interface without manually accessing system files. The discussion confirmed that currently, adding apps to the sidebar requires placing files in the server's world assets folder, which 3rdEyeVisuals is trying to circumvent for easier collaboration. They also mentioned adding UI components to the core system files, noting cross-compatibility concerns for worlds without these additional components.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can we reset play-world?

(asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: mrtzhckr confirmed there's no way to do it without touching the server by placing files in the folder\nQ: Is there a tool that bundles the .hyp files for you or is it a manual process?

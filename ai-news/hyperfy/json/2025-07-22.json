      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around new feature developments and implementations in Hyperfy. Key technical discussions include:\n\nAshxn introduced a dynamic customizable emote wheel with hotkeys and head tracking capabilities. The emote wheel can be accessed with the \"G\" key (later customized to \"B\" by a user) and supports gaze tracking during emotes.\n\nHiroP demonstrated an impressive AI assistant implementation using Google's Gemini model with voice interaction in Hyperfy. The system allows for real-time voice commands to manipulate objects in the world, with potential applications for enterprise use cases like warehouse planning.\n\nAshxn implemented voice chat zones functionality, allowing different voice modes (disabled, spatial, global) that can be modified by apps using player.setVoiceLevel(). This enables creating special areas like stages with different voice behaviors.\n\nDiscussions about animation support revealed that skinned mesh animations work, but importing GLB files with animations still requires scripting. Ashxn modified the model app to add an animation field.\n\nOther technical topics included procedural terrain generation using ThreeJS in custom systems rather than apps, player roles/permissions system development, and a screenshot feature that can send images to Discord.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to play a `clip` in reverse? (asked by .hyp shaman) A: Unanswered\nQ: What line can I change in the script to make the Hot key B instead of G?

      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat revolves around Hyperfy's new build mode and UI improvements. Ashxn is leading development of a pointer-lock based building system with features like grab, duplicate, snap, rotate, and push/pull functionality. The community is actively testing and providing feedback on this system. Other significant discussions include WebXR integration for VR support, wallet integration approaches, asset optimization guidelines, and AI-driven collectible items that can scan for and collect resources. Developers are exploring the creation of teleportation systems, audio reactivity, and other interactive elements. There's also discussion about marketplace features, asset quality ratings, and the need for documentation. The development pace is rapid with multiple PRs being merged and new features being deployed to the test environment at play.hyperfy.xyz.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to change the color of a material in app script? (asked by Shiffty) A: Not yet but will be possible. Only emission intensity right now for bloom. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Do we have a way to have secrets in scripts yet? (asked by HPrivakos) A: Not yet but could implement it with server-side access to secrets that are null on client. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I chat with the new controls? (asked by peezy) A: Hit enter to focus chat even while pointer locked, and after sending it blurs so you can keep running around. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there scale functionality yet? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can I destroy an app? (asked by MetaMike) A: Apps can't delete other apps as it would cause chaos, but you can build an app that listens for events to unmount meshes. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way I can type in an angle? (asked by Omka) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can you support controllers on web? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: The Gamepad API could be used for this. (answered by Omka)\nQ: Is it possible to encode objects as it is done in voxels or substrata? (asked by denshipilovart) A: Unanswered\nQ: How does the collectron seek things? (asked by Ashxn) A: It triggers perception scans randomly while moving and when searching an area, emitting 'ping' events and listening for 'pong' responses. (answered by MetaMike)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of \"🤖│agents\" Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around two main technical topics. First, there's discussion about a Blender-related tool that was previously available for download but now redirects to a personal site. Users coordinate sharing this tool via WeTransfer. Second, there's significant discussion about an Eliza agent configuration dashboard for Hyperfy being developed by szjanko. This dashboard will allow users to configure AI agents through input fields and preset options. The interface will support various AI models, though the final list hasn't been determined. The dashboard will offer both hosted solutions and the ability to download character.json files for use with personal subscriptions. There's concern about Claude Sonnet 3.5's inclusion due to its cost (approximately 30x more expensive than other models on OpenRouter). Additionally, a user shared a GitHub project called \"Gangland-Genesis\" seeking feedback, which appears to be an AI collaboration experiment for Project 89.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is the Blender tool still downloadable? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Yes, but it works better on older versions like Blender 3.4 (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\nQ: Could you share whatever you downloaded? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Yeah totally. [Shared WeTransfer link] (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\nQ: Is gaianet node included in that model dropdown? (asked by Omka) A: We haven't finalized the list of which models will be offered yet initially (answered by szjanko)\nQ: Can it also just generate the character.json to use with your own subscriptions/models? (asked by Omka) A: For both, will have a download button added to it also (answered by szjanko)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around cryptocurrency trading discussions, particularly focusing on the Hyperfy token ($HYPER) on Solana blockchain. A significant technical discussion occurred when user devilsadvocate.sol shared detailed trading strategies for meme coins, explaining how to use technical indicators like MACD and RSI to make trading decisions. They described looking for tokens 0-6 hours old with at least 1M in hourly volume and specific trading patterns. The user contrasted this approach with traditional blue-chip trading, noting the potential for 10-40% gains with 12-15 trading cycles per day versus 3-5% with fewer cycles on platforms like Kraken. There was also brief mention of Hyperfy's development plans, including a marketplace for .hyp apps and assets, and in-world $HYPER tips functionality being developed.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What technical indicators are useful for trading meme coins? (asked by Jona) A: RSI with MACD as a secondary indicator; look for MACD gap size and crossings combined with RSI levels (answered by devilsadvocate.sol)\nQ: Does MACD consider volume or only price movement? (asked by Jona) A: It's the difference between the 26/12 EMA with a 9-day EMA indicator (answered by devilsadvocate.sol)\nQ: Is $Hyper utility about to be revealed yet? (asked by Beats) A: Omka mentioned a marketplace for .hyp apps and assets is being worked on, and in-world $hyper tips are in progress (answered by Omka)\nQ: What's a good trading strategy for meme coins? (implied by conversation with Jona) A: Look for coins 0-6hrs old with 1M+ hourly volume, good trading pattern, and trade based on RSI/MACD indicators with 10-40% profit targets (answered by devilsadvocate.sol)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of 3D-Design Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on VRM avatar creation, optimization, and troubleshooting in Hyperfy V2. A key technical issue involved properly rigging and weight-painting 3D models for VRM export. Users discovered that V2 requires properly skinned meshes with weight painting rather than just parenting objects to bones. Several users collaborated to solve this problem by joining separate meshes, applying automatic weights, and ensuring proper bone positioning. The conversation also covered optimization techniques like reducing draw calls by combining materials and meshes.\n\nSecondary discussions included hexagon tiling for game development (with mathematical spacing solutions), procedural generation possibilities, and low-poly art styles versus realistic approaches. There were also mentions of upcoming features like improved snap point tools and discussions about animation playback capabilities. The community showed strong interest in collaborative learning through streaming sessions and tutorials.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why isn't my VRM model showing up in Hyperfy V2? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: V2 requires properly skinned meshes with weight painting rather than just parenting objects to bones. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I parent with automatic weights in Blender? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Select all meshes *then* the rig, right click, parent > Automatic weights. The rig has to be selected last. (answered by TheMattEmpire)\nQ: What's causing high draw calls in my VRM model? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Each separate mesh with its own material creates additional draw calls. Joining meshes and combining materials reduces this. (answered by Valiant)\nQ: Is there a difference between VRM 0 and VRM 1 in Hyperfy? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Both work, but V2 has additional optimization requirements for skinned meshes. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What's the correct way to make hexagon platforms in Blender that tile seamlessly? (asked by Ashxn) A: Use the mathematical spacing where hexagons are placed at distances of 2 × radius × cos(30°) horizontally and radius × 1.5 vertically. (answered by ToxSam)\nQ: How can I add colliders to my models in Hyperfy V2? (asked by carlosmu) A: Use the Hyperfy Tools add-on for Blender to add colliders. (answered by scoe)\nQ: What's better for web experiences - low poly or realistic models? (asked by ToxSam) A: Low poly is generally better for web due to performance, faster development, and allowing players' imagination to fill in details. (answered by multiple users)\nQ: Can I do procedural generation in Hyperfy? (asked by Pablo) A: Yes, code can be used to generate content procedurally. (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3.

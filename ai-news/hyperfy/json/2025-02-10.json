      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat revolves around Hyperfy's new build mode and UI improvements. Ashxn is leading development of a pointer-lock based building system with features like grab, duplicate, snap, rotate, and push/pull functionality. The community is actively testing and providing feedback on this system. Other significant developments include WebXR support for VR, world settings for admin controls, and various app scripting capabilities. MetaMike created an AI-driven collectron robot that can scan for and collect items in the world. Developers are discussing wallet integration approaches, asset optimization guidelines, and teleportation mechanics. The community is enthusiastic about Hyperfy becoming a \"meta game engine\" with capabilities similar to game building platforms but with web-based accessibility and better composability.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to change the color of a material in app script? (asked by Shiffty) A: Not yet but will be possible. Only emission intensity is available right now for bloom. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Do we have a way to have secrets in scripts yet? (asked by HPrivakos) A: Not yet but could implement it with server-side access to secrets that are null on client. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I chat with the new controls? (asked by peezy) A: Hit Enter to focus chat even while pointer locked, and after sending it blurs so you can keep running around. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way I can type in an angle? (asked by Omka) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there scale functionality yet? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can you support controllers on web? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Could be implemented using the Gamepad API. (answered by Omka)\nQ: How can I destroy an app? (asked by MetaMike) A: Apps can't delete other apps as it would cause chaos, but you can listen for an event and unmount meshes. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a wall app for building structures? (asked by frabra239) A: Ash is making building tools that will help with this. (answered by Omka)\n\n## 3.

First, there's a discussion about a Blender add-on that works better with older versions (specifically Blender 3.4), with users sharing download links via WeTransfer. Second, szjanko presents progress on an Eliza agent configuration dashboard for Hyperfy, which features a form interface allowing users to customize settings or select from preset options. The dashboard will include various AI models, though the final list hasn't been determined. HPrivakos notes that Claude (especially Sonnet 3.5) might not be available due to being significantly more expensive than other models on OpenRouter. The dashboard will support both hosted solutions and local deployments with a download button for character.json files. There's also a brief mention of a GitHub project called \"Gangland-Genesis\" by Natefrog, though details are minimal.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is the Blender add-on still available for download? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Yes, it works better on older versions like Blender 3.4 (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\nQ: Which AI models will be offered in the Eliza agent configuration dashboard? (asked by Omka) A: The list hasn't been finalized yet initially (answered by szjanko)\nQ: Will Claude be available in the dashboard? (asked by HPrivakos) A: Not sure, as Sonnet 3.5 is about 30 times more expensive than other models on OpenRouter (answered by HPrivakos)\nQ: Can the dashboard generate character.json files for use with your own subscriptions/models? (asked by Omka) A: Yes, it will have a download button added (answered by szjanko)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around cryptocurrency trading discussions, particularly focusing on the Hyperfy token ($HYPER) on Solana blockchain. A significant technical discussion occurred when user devilsadvocate.sol shared detailed trading strategies for meme coins, explaining how to use technical indicators like RSI and MACD to make trading decisions. They described looking for tokens 0-6 hours old with at least 1M in hourly volume and specific trading patterns. The user contrasted this approach with traditional blue-chip trading, noting the potential for 10-40% gains with 12-15 trading cycles per day versus 3-5% with fewer cycles on platforms like Kraken. Regarding Hyperfy development, Omka mentioned that user 183099323142242304 is working on a marketplace for .hyp apps and assets, and that in-world $HYPER tips functionality is in development.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Analysis of 3D-Design Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on VRM avatar creation, optimization, and troubleshooting in Hyperfy V2. A key technical issue involved properly rigging and weight-painting 3D models for VRM export. Users discovered that V2 requires properly skinned meshes with weight painting rather than just parenting objects to bones. Several users collaborated to solve this problem by joining separate meshes, applying automatic weights, and ensuring proper bone structure. The conversation also covered optimization techniques like reducing draw calls by combining materials and meshes.\n\nSecondary discussions included hexagon tiling for game development (with mathematical spacing solutions), procedural generation possibilities, and low-poly art styles versus realistic approaches. There were also mentions of upcoming features like improved snap point tools and discussions about animation improvements. The community showed strong interest in collaborative learning through streaming sessions and potential regular design calls.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why isn't my VRM model showing up in Hyperfy V2? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: V2 requires properly skinned meshes with weight painting rather than just parenting objects to bones. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I parent with automatic weights in Blender? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Select all meshes *then* the rig, right click, parent > Automatic weights. The rig has to be selected last. (answered by TheMattEmpire)\nQ: What's causing high draw calls in my VRM model? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Each separate mesh with its own material creates additional draw calls. Joining meshes and combining materials reduces this. (answered by Valiant)\nQ: Is there a difference between VRM 0 and VRM 1 in Hyperfy? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Both work, but V2 has additional optimization requirements for skinned meshes. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What's the correct way to make hexagon platforms in Blender that tile seamlessly? (asked by Ashxn) A: Use the mathematical spacing where distance between centers is 2 × radius × cos(30°). (answered by ToxSam)\nQ: How do I add colliders to my models in Hyperfy V2? (asked by carlosmu) A: Use the Hyperfy Tools Blender add-on or follow the node collider documentation. (answered by Omka)\nQ: Can procedurally generated infinite maps be created in Hyperfy?

Roustan shared a tweet about an NFT collection that includes VRM files in the metadata, which was validated by ToxSam who confirmed the VRM was placed correctly. The NFT appears to be based on a body-painted model named Sawyer. There was discussion about 3D scanning models for VRM creation, with Roustan mentioning they have one scan available on Hyperfy and another scan that hasn't been delivered after two years. The conversation also touched on wallet setup for purchasing NFTs and VTATV offering free NFTs to users who visited specific metaverse worlds (DCL, Hyperfy, or Crypto Voxel).\n\n## 2.

Pablo shared a VRM file that vox examined in different viewers (v1 and v2). Vox was impressed with the avatar's appearance but encountered editing limitations due to extremely high emissive strength values (45-100) in the materials. Vox suggested reducing these values to 5-10 maximum for better compatibility. When attempting to edit the file, vox encountered a \"blockage licence thing\" and asked for help to bypass it. Unable to find a direct solution, vox worked around the issue by removing the MToon shader completely, which altered the avatar's appearance.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on health/damage system implementation and UI development. Ashxn introduced significant changes to the core health system, including health bars, damage numbers, and critical hit functionality. This required breaking changes to the effects system, moving from `control.setEffect` to a new approach using player IDs to properly track effects. The change enables server-side application of effects and better cross-app integration. \n\nUI discussions centered around health bar styling, with references to WoW addons for inspiration. Omka worked through UI challenges related to screen vs. world space interactions and pointer events. Player-to-player collision was implemented and tested, with acknowledgment that it should be optional to prevent abuse.\n\nSeveral developers shared progress on their implementations, including weapon attachments to character hands and various animation tests. The community actively tested new features in multiplayer environments and provided feedback on bugs and potential improvements.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I migrate from the old effects system? (asked by drdoge.eth) A: Change from using `control.setEffect` to the new approach using player IDs and `world.getPlayer(playerId)` (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is player-to-player collision optional? (asked by Ashxn) A: It should be optional to prevent abuse like blocking entrances (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Which bone is anchor for weapons? (asked by Valiant) A: It's set to right hand, but you can change it in the hyp file (answered by Omka)\nQ: What do people use to do screen records? (asked by maximus) A: OBS, Medal, Nvidia (answered by Gooey) and Snag it (answered by TheMattEmpire)\nQ: With the on screen UI, does UIView work? Is there any z-index ability?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 🧊│3d-design\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on 3D model optimization and technical fixes. Ashxn resolved texture blurriness in a GLB file by changing texture settings from \"closest\" to \"linear,\" which improved visual quality. The group discussed a new display board for JPEGs and PNGs, with Ashxn suggesting using `image.objectFit = 'cover'` instead of 'fill' to maintain aspect ratio without stretching images. Bear encountered issues with VRM format uploads, receiving help from MisfitPIXELS and Valiant who provided a detailed workflow for properly rigging and optimizing the model, including combining meshes and textures. The chat also touched on floor textures, with a brief discussion about Kenney's free asset packs and their licensing restrictions for crypto projects. There was a brief mention of implementing spring bones in VRM V2.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why was the GLB file blurry?

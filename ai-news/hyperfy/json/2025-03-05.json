      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on health/damage system implementation and UI development. Ashxn introduced significant changes to the health system, including health bars, damage numbers, and critical hit functionality. A breaking change was announced regarding player effects, moving from `control.setEffect` to a new system requiring `world.getPlayer(playerId)` to properly track effects. This change improves server-side application of effects but breaks backward compatibility with existing apps. \n\nUI discussions centered around screen vs. world space interactions, with Omka exploring issues related to pointer events and UI layering. The developers also implemented player-to-player collision, though noted it might need to be optional to prevent abuse. Several developers shared progress on their implementations, with testing occurring in multiplayer environments. There were also discussions about weapon attachment points (hand bones) and various UI styling approaches.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I migrate from the old effects system to the new one? (asked by drdoge.eth) A: Change from using `control.setEffect` to using `world.getPlayer(playerId)` to get the player handle, then apply effects (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is player-to-player collision optional? (asked by drdoge.eth) A: It should probably be optional to prevent abuse like blocking people from accessing areas (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Which bone is anchor for weapons? (asked by Valiant) A: The sword is set to right hand, but you can change it in the hyp file (answered by Omka)\nQ: With the on screen UI, does UIView work? Is there any z-index ability? (asked by Omka) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: Community | Context: Breaking change in effects system | Resolution: Provided detailed migration guide and offered to personally fix broken apps if sent the hyp files\nHelper: Omka | Helpee: Valiant | Context: Weapon attachment points for models | Resolution: Explained that swords are set to right hand by default but can be changed in the hyp file, and added a switch in the inspector to choose left or right hand\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: Saori | Context: Discussion about health bar implementation | Resolution: Explained that health bars are in core to make it easier for different apps to tie into the same health/damage systems\nHelper: Gooey/TheMattEmpire | Helpee: maximus | Context: Screen recording software recommendations | Resolution: Suggested OBS, Medal, Nvidia, and Snag it as options\n\n## 4.

Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief discussion about an unnamed project that was successfully implemented but not yet packaged for distribution. There's also a significant conversation about SoulGraph (referred to as \"grph soul\"), a project developing AI personalities with built-in voice capabilities. Whambammy⚡ mentions having done branding work for SoulGraph and discusses the potential integration of their technology with 3D avatars, specifically mentioning the Hyperfy agent/eliza app as a possible integration point once API access becomes available. The participants highlight SoulGraph's responsive voice-to-voice chat capabilities, including its ability to handle interruptions and adjust responses in real-time.\n\n## 2.

Members discuss celebrity tokens (specifically Nick Cannon's \"Wild 'N Out\" token), with several users advising against investing in celebrity coins due to poor historical performance. There's brief mention of Hyperfy's capabilities for 2D/3D game development, with some suggesting it could eventually support full 2D game engines. A user named Saori jokingly claims development stopped due to lack of funding (clearly sarcastic based on context). The chat also includes reactions to external content about other projects like Treeverse and Axie Infinity, with brief technical speculation about whether a particular game uses Three.js. Overall, this segment lacks substantive technical discussions, decisions, or problem-solving.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Did Nick Cannon get hacked? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Looks real, has a bunch of promos it looks like on Twitter (answered by merk)\nQ: Couldn't hyperfy do the thing yacine is looking to do?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 🧊│3d-design\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on 3D design issues and solutions. Ashxn fixed blurriness in a GLB file by changing texture settings from \"closest\" to \"linear\" and proposed a new default floor. ApeironCreations shared a display board for JPEGs and PNGs, with Ashxn suggesting using `image.objectFit = 'cover'` instead of 'fill' to maintain aspect ratio without stretching. Bear encountered issues with VRM format uploads, receiving help from MisfitPIXELS and Valiant who identified problems with the rig's bone structure and provided a detailed workflow for properly rigging and optimizing the model. This included creating a new VRM armature, proper bone positioning, weight painting, and texture optimization. The chat also discussed Kenney's free asset packs, though noting his anti-crypto stance. Valiant inquired about spring bones in VRM V2 implementation.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why was there blurriness in the GLB file? (asked by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎) A: The texture settings were set to \"closest\" instead of \"linear\" (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can we fix image stretching in the display board?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat in the \"🐞│issues\" channel contains two main technical discussions. The first involves hiding 3D models in what appears to be a v2 version of a software platform, where Gert-Jan Akerboom asked about the correct method to hide original models/GLBs. Ash provided the solution using `cube.active = false` rather than the initially proposed `cube.visible = false`. The second discussion involves a PhysX warning about triangles being too large in a simulation, which 0mka encountered while working with minimal world elements (UI test, chest, and floor). Ash suggested the issue was likely caused by the grass/floor having excessively large triangles, which could affect simulation stability. 0mka then expressed interest in alternative solutions like a default grid or a \"hyp app\" for floor management, mentioning concepts like \"appvironment\" that suggest a modular environment system.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is this the correct way to hide the original model/glb in v2? `cube.visible = false` (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Use `cube.active = false` instead (answered by ash)\nQ: Any idea what's causing this PhysX warning about triangles being too big?

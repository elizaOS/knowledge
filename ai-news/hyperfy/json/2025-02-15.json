      "summary": "# Analysis of ðŸ’»â”‚developers Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical development topics within the Hyperfy platform. Key discussions included app spawning capabilities, with MayD524 asking about making one app spawn another (like spawning dice with a button press). Ashxn mentioned this isn't currently possible but suggested workarounds like embedding everything in one GLB and unmounting/spawning as needed. \n\nThere was significant discussion about combat systems and player interactions, with Saori and others discussing the potential for adding native combat functionality to Hyperfy. Ashxn indicated they're considering adding player health and damage concepts to the core, with weapons being handled by apps that would attach to players.\n\nTheMattEmpire raised important points about standardization for weapons and pickups, suggesting a framework that would allow assets to work across different worlds. This sparked discussion about interoperability and the balance between standardization and flexibility.\n\nTechnical implementation details were shared by several developers, including Shiffty who demonstrated progress on a hex-a-gone game derivative with nearly 1000 lines of code. Asset placement and rotation snapping issues were discussed, with Ashxn pushing a fix to the dev branch to make drag-and-drop put objects on 5-degree snap points by default.\n\nOther notable technical topics included voice settings implementation, day/night cycle development, and discussions about organizing code in multiple files for better maintainability.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I make an app spawn another app? (asked by MayD524) A: You can't yet, but you can embed everything in one GLB and unmount/spawn as needed. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Could I put sub scripts on the children objects? (asked by MayD524) A: Unanswered\nQ: What's the file that lists out what packages are accessible in in-world scripting? (asked by MetaMike) A: Unanswered\nQ: Could I have a `joint` example to help figure out what to add for doors with physics? (asked by á²¼) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is this the code of the VRM drag and drop menu? (asked by djrabbit) A: Yes, it is. (answered by á²¼)\nQ: How hard would it be to modify .hyp apps to be able to have code split up in multiple files/pages? (asked by szjanko) A: We could maybe do fake tabs for multiple files but combine into one file behind the scenes. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is 'Main' the best branch to use locally? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Play world is closest to dev. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: In your mind, which way is forward in Blender? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Right now if you look top down in Blender, up is forward, and when you drop in the world we rotate 180 to face you. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy's VR capabilities, technical implementations, and community feature suggestions. Key technical discussions include VR interaction capabilities (opening fridges using VR controllers), potential implementation of VRM arms with controllers/hand tracking, and controller compatibility with Hyperfy on Solana mobile. Akuma demonstrated a PS5 controller working in Hyperfy on Solana mobile using a browser extension, though camera angles weren't properly mapped with mouse movements. There were discussions about performance issues in certain worlds, with MetaDoge reporting lag in the play.hyperfy.xyz world. The community also discussed file format compatibility, noting that .hyp files are only supported in V2 worlds, not V1. Several members expressed interest in creating 3D avatar NFT collections and implementing minting experiences directly within Hyperfy worlds.\n\n## 2.

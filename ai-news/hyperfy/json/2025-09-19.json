Summary\nmrtzhckr shared a project implementing Gaussian Splatting support for Hyperfy using Spark.js, allowing users to drag and drop PLY/SPLAT files with real-time controls for photorealistic 3D worlds. The implementation enables rendering of Gaussian splats in Hyperfy environments, with a GitHub repository available at https://github.com/moritzhckr/hyperfy-splatting. However, several critical issues are blocking the merge, including asset cleanup bugs (splats being deleted after server restart), falloff control problems, memory leaks (timeouts, intervals, blob URLs not being cleaned up), and race conditions. Missing features include dynamic model switching via properties and better error handling. mrtzhckr confirmed that Spark.js works with Three.js, which was the reason for choosing it as the implementation foundation. A demo is available at https://hyperfy.mrtzhckr.de/. mrtzhckr acknowledged that there might be more elegant and performant approaches than the current implementation and suggested forming a splatting workgroup to collaboratively design an optimal approach. ash expressed willingness to help with high-level guidance if there's sufficient community demand.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's the gist of implementation? Does spark.js work with threejs? (asked by ash) A: Yes spark.js works with threejs https://github.com/sparkjsdev/spark thats why i used it as a starting point. (answered by mrtzhckr)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: mrtzhckr | Helpee: Community | Context: Implementing Gaussian Splatting support for Hyperfy using Spark.js | Resolution: Created a repository and demo, identified critical issues, and requested community assistance to make it production-ready\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment shows minimal technical discussion. There was a brief mention of Hyperfy and Mesa, suggesting some development platform discussion. A user inquired about fullscreen API on iOS Safari, indicating interest in mobile web capabilities. There was positive feedback about tutorial sessions that were previously held, with users expressing they were helpful for learning. A community member asked about and received help accessing VRM files for Vipe Heroes NFTs. The conversation was largely casual with limited technical substance, including some references to NFTs, VRMs, and GLB files in the context of the Vipe Heroes project.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What happened to a specific channel? (asked by Juank) A: Unanswered\nQ: Did anyone here work for the Vipe Heroes team? (asked by Fibelius) A: Unanswered, though 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 tagged two users who might know\nQ: Is fullscreen API available on iOS Safari? (asked by ash) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ToxSam - IBIH | Helpee: Fibelius | Context: Fibelius purchased Vipe NFTs and needed to find VRM files for them | Resolution: ToxSam directed Fibelius to vipe.city where the files could be easily downloaded from IPFS, though room files were unavailable\n\n## 4. Action Items\nDocumentation: Preserve or restore tutorial sessions that were found helpful by users | Mentioned By: Dhin\nFeature: Investigate fullscreen API support on iOS Safari | Mentioned By: ash",

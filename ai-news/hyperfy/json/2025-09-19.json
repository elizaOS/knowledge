      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around implementing Gaussian Splatting support for Hyperfy using Spark.js. User mrtzhckr has developed a prototype that allows drag & drop PLY/SPLAT files with real-time controls for photorealistic 3D worlds. The implementation faces several critical issues including asset cleanup bugs, falloff control problems, memory leaks, and race conditions. The developer is seeking community help to fix these issues and implement missing features. The repository is available at GitHub, and a demo is accessible online. Ash, presumably a Hyperfy team member, showed interest in the implementation approach and suggested a potentially simpler solution using a new \"splat\" node with splat file type support. The discussion briefly touched on Spark.js compatibility with Three.js, which mrtzhckr confirmed. There's consideration of forming a splatting workgroup to design an optimal approach for Hyperfy's architecture rather than retrofitting the current implementation.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What's the gist of implementation? Does spark.js work with threejs? (asked by ash) A: Yes spark.js works with threejs https://github.com/sparkjsdev/spark thats why i used it as a starting point. (answered by mrtzhckr)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"âš¡â”‚general\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. There's a brief mention of Hyperfy and Mesa, suggesting a question about which platform is being used. One user mentions a desire for \"DeSci AI & virtual wood-wide-web\" related to their background in fungi farming and metaverse forestry. There's a comment about display issues on a new iPhone, and excitement about a possible fullscreen API on iOS Safari. A user also expresses appreciation for tutorial sessions that were previously held, noting they were helpful and hoping they would return. Overall, the chat lacks substantial technical problem-solving or implementation discussions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are you using hyperfy for mesa? (asked by ash) A: Unanswered\nQ: What happened to [channel reference]? (asked by Juank) A: Unanswered\nQ: Are you running the ios26 beta? (asked by MetaMike) A: No (answered by johan)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Dhin | Helpee: Community | Context: Acknowledging value of previous tutorial sessions | Resolution: Expressed appreciation and hope for their return\n\n## 4.

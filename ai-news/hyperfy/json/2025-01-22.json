      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on Hyperfy V2 development and features. Key technical topics included world building controls (rotation with mouse wheel, Y-axis movement with shift), nametag implementation using shaders with a single draw call, and environment improvements like sky and HDR nodes. Developers discussed infrastructure implementation using AWS (ECS, EFS, S3) with Terraform for infrastructure as code. Several scripting capabilities were explored, including player teleportation, app creation, and UI development. The chat revealed that Hyperfy V2 uses vanilla JavaScript with ThreeJS (not React like V1), and apps are created through a custom API similar to DOM manipulation. Developers also discussed optimization techniques for HDRs and textures. The platform now supports VRM model drag-and-drop functionality, and there was discussion about scaling world deployments through AWS infrastructure.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can you currently rotate an item in world without scripting? (asked by MetaMike) A: Mouse wheel rotates on Y axis, hold shift and move mouse up and down to lift up and down (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Do I need an NFT to create a world? (asked by Revolution) A: No NFT needed. V2 is open sourced now and anyone can spin up a world (answered by maximus)\nQ: Is Hyperfy V2 using WebGL or WebGPU as a foundation? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: WebGL but once WebGPU is ready I'm all for it (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there somewhere that one can access all objects of the world and transforms in a JSON? (asked by MetaMike) A: They're all in world/db.sqlite but JSON files might be more accessible (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Does the concept of apps still exist in V2? (asked by FrankyLimon) A: It exists in the sense that you can write scripts and append them to in-world objects (answered by MetaMike)\nQ: Is it possible to load an arbitrary image from a URL and apply it as a texture? (asked by m₂) A: Not yet but easy to add (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Are all node packages available to access for apps? (asked by MetaMike) A: No, there's no imports, all goes through App.js (answered by Saori)\nQ: How do I teleport a player from an app? (asked by peezy) A: Need to add to the player proxy, likely will be something like player.teleport(position, cameraY) (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What's the best platform to test VRMs? (asked by SotoAlt) A: Hyperfy, just drag and drop (answered by MetaMike)\nQ: Where does one find the list of available nodes that can be used? (asked by MetaMike) A: docs/ref/scripts.md (answered by peezy)\n\n## 3.

Saori shared a sample character.json for a \"Trump\" agent, explaining it's a simplified version of what would be used in production. The JSON includes fields for name, username, system instructions, bio, lore, message examples, post examples, topics, style guidelines, and adjectives. Saori mentioned they need more character.json files for avatars available on VroidHub. Bitpixi noted they created JSONs for 12 bots very quickly. There was discussion about the technical requirements for running agents, with Saori explaining users currently need an \"eliza server\" to run agents, though a user-friendly option is planned for the future. MetaMike suggested forking \"howie\" or using \"fleek\" for multi-agent functionality. The group also discussed potential agent applications like chauffeurs, tour guides, and hospitality concierges.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Are agents currently only available to people who know how to code? (asked by chiefdegen.eth) A: Yes, the main thing right now is you need an eliza server. (answered by Saori)\nQ: Is there gonna be a user option later? (asked by chiefdegen.eth) A: Yes.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 🧊│3d-design\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion focused primarily on collider optimization in Hyperfy, a 3D platform similar to Unity. hiroP shared detailed information about collider types (Static, Kinematic, Dynamic) and their computational complexity, which was later verified and expanded upon by Ashxn. The conversation highlighted that simpler collision shapes are more performant, with convex colliders being more efficient than trimesh colliders. A significant development occurred when hiroP created and shared a Blender script/plugin called \"hiros-tools\" that automatically generates simplified collision meshes for complex 3D models. This tool was well-received by the community. Ashxn also shared a Blender script for auto-exporting individual objects with proper centering. The discussion touched on the need for better environment controls in Hyperfy, including the ability to modify skyboxes, lighting, and coordinate systems. maximus documented the collider optimization information in a community HackMD book with diagrams. The chat concluded with discussions about AI models like deepseek-r1 running locally.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the computational complexity order for colliders? (asked by hiroP) A: Nothing -> Static -> Kinematic -> Dynamic (answered by hiroP and confirmed by Ashxn)\nQ: When should I use Static colliders? (asked by hiroP) A: For basic stuff like buildings, walls, trees etc. (answered by hiroP)\nQ: When should I use Kinematic colliders? (asked by hiroP) A: For objects that you want to control through code (e.g. a moving platform) (answered by hiroP)\nQ: When should I use Dynamic colliders? (asked by hiroP) A: When you want to create objects that react in a physically accurate way like balls or cars (answered by hiroP)\nQ: Are convex colliders more performant than trimesh? (implied by hiroP) A: Yes, convex colliders are more performant than trimesh (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can two dynamic trimesh colliders collide with each other? (implied by hiroP) A: No, two dynamic trimesh colliders don't collide with each other, a limitation that also exists in Unity (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Where is the optimization information published?

Saori explained this was due to Phantom overriding MetaMask since Phantom now supports EVM chains, and suggested changing settings to fix it. The second issue involved Pete experiencing problems changing avatars in v1 Hyperfy, where the system displayed an error message. Bitpixi attempted to troubleshoot, confirming their own avatar functionality was working correctly, and asked about Pete's browser and wallet connection status. Both issues represent interface/connection problems in the v1 platform, with the first issue successfully resolved through settings adjustment.\n\n## 2.

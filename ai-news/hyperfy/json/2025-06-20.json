      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"⚡│general\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on technical discussions about image formats and metadata in Hyperfy. A key technical insight was about .hyp metadata images, with b0gie explaining they're visible via a \"+\" icon in Hyperfy and that 400x400 is the optimal size for these images. Ashxn added that this metadata can be used by marketplaces and potentially as thumbnails with extension support. The conversation revealed that animated WebP files work in this context, which excited several users due to WebP's superior compression capabilities. There was a brief comparison between WebP and PNG formats, with b0gie suggesting WebP is generally superior while Valiant noted PNGs might still be needed in specific quality-sensitive cases. The chat also included mentions of a Hyperfy edit mode fork by cru and a milestone of highest user count in a world. The technical focus was primarily on image optimization for Hyperfy worlds and hyps, with WebP emerging as the preferred format for its balance of quality and compression.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where/when would the image you can add to a .hyp's metadata be visible? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: In Hyperfy there is a little + icon where you can see the image in the metadata. We setup \"awesome-hyps\" so anyone who is world hosting/building can add hyps to the add section easily. (answered by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\nQ: Could these magical animated WebP's be used as particles? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: I haven't tried. My guess is they don't animate on particles? Maybe just first frame. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🪙│hyper Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThis Discord segment shows community concerns about the HYPER token's declining value and lack of clear tokenomics. Users are expressing frustration about the token's price performance, with some calling it \"useless\" while others remain hopeful. There's minimal technical discussion, with conversation primarily focused on price action and requests for more information about the project's direction. Several users note that the token lacks utility and management, with one user (Jayzen) pointing out that since the token isn't strictly needed for the platform to function, there's uncertainty affecting its price. The Hyperfy platform itself is mentioned as \"very cool\" despite token concerns. A team member (general hyper) briefly appears, noting they've been away for a month. Overall, the chat demonstrates community frustration with the token's performance amid a lack of clear communication about tokenomics and utility.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Need tokenomics or a concept of a plan to keep moving forward (asked by MUDBONE) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why mint a Hyperfy token if there's no minimum token LP managing?

Summary\nThe chat segment discusses technical issues related to screen sharing with audio in what appears to be a collaborative development environment. Users are troubleshooting why audio doesn't work during screen sharing, with Ashxn explaining that Chrome only allows audio sharing when sharing a specific tab rather than fullscreen, and even then only for that tab's audio. 0mka notes that the webshare screen functionality has never supported audio since initial testing in a product called \"fallen.\" \n\nAdditionally, hiroP shares information about adding a badge to GitHub repositories that automatically keeps documentation on \"deepwiki\" updated, which Ashxn agrees to implement. 0mka also mentions UI improvements with message boxes and chat toggles, and inquires about updating documentation with missing reference information.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way for the screenshare to have audio as well? (asked by ~/drdoge.eth) A: Chrome only lets you share audio if you pick a specific tab to share instead of fullscreen, and only audio from that tab itself. Full audio would require an OBS stream or similar. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Do you have a working example of audio working from a tab? (asked by 0mka) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: ~/drdoge.eth | Context: User needed to know how to share audio during screen sharing | Resolution: Explained Chrome's limitations with audio sharing and suggested OBS as an alternative for full audio\nHelper: hiroP | Helpee: Ashxn | Context: Sharing knowledge about automatic documentation updates | Resolution: Shared a badge link for GitHub READMEs that automatically keeps deepwiki documentation updated\n\n## 4.

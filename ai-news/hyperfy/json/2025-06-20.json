      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe conversation primarily focused on the use of images in .hyp metadata files within the Hyperfy platform. Users discussed where these images are visible - specifically through a \"+\" icon in Hyperfy's interface. The optimal image size for .hyp metadata was identified as 400x400 pixels, with WebP format being the preferred choice due to its superior compression capabilities. Users discovered that animated WebP files work in this context, sparking interest about potential applications. There was a brief technical comparison between WebP, PNG, and GIF formats, with WebP being highlighted as having the advantages of both PNG and GIF with better compression. Some speculation occurred about whether animated WebP could be used for particles in the platform, though this wasn't confirmed. The discussion also touched on format compatibility issues across different platforms, with a mention that WebP might not work well on iOS devices.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Where/when would the image you can add to a .hyp's metadata be visible? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: In Hyperfy there is a little + icon where you can see the image in the metadata. We setup \"awesome-hyps\" so anyone who is world hosting/building can add hyps to the add section easily. (answered by ·≤º~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\nQ: Could these magical animated WebP's be used as particles? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: I haven't tried. My guess is they don't animate on particles? Maybe just first frame. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

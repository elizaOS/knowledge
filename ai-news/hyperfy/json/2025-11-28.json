      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on licensing aspects of the Hyperfy v2 engine, which uses GPL-3. Ash clarified that while the engine code is open-source under GPL-3, apps added via the UI interface can remain closed-source as they aren't part of the licensed codebase. The license requires that major improvements to the engine itself should be shared with the community. Ash explained that the main purpose of using GPL-3 is to prevent others from profiting off forks with improvements that should have been contributed back to the main repository. The license ensures that if someone benefits significantly from the code, those benefits are extended to everyone. Ash mentioned they would only enforce this if someone was making substantial profit from a fork with significant improvements without contributing back.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When someone mods this engine, does the result have to stay open-source? And can apps added via the UI interface remain closed-source? (asked by Ozymandias) A: Yes, under GPL-3 which Hyperfy v2 engine uses, mods to the engine must stay open-source, but apps aren't part of the codebase the license covers so they can remain closed-source. (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host and ash)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Ozymandias | Context: Clarification about GPL-3 license implications for the Hyperfy engine and apps | Resolution: Explained that the license doesn't apply to apps, only to the engine code, and detailed when and why they would enforce the license terms.\n\n## 4.

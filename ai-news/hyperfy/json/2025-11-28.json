The messages appear to be acknowledgments of someone's work related to implementing trees in what seems to be a development project. The first message from \"ash\" compliments someone referred to as \"resident botanist\" for their work. The second message from \"Valiant\" expresses gratitude for the implementation of trees, noting that they were on their need/todo list.",

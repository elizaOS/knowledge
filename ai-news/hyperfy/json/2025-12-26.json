Valiant shared a link to an article about a free Blender add-on that allows users to preview objects in the Outliner. The add-on likely enhances workflow efficiency by providing visual previews of objects directly in Blender's Outliner panel, rather than requiring users to select objects to see what they look like. User .hyp shaman responded positively to the shared resource with a brief acknowledgment.",

The app allows users to create customizable neon signs in Hyperfy worlds. Community members collaborated to improve the app by adding features like sound effects, snap points, and color sliders. B0gie contributed code improvements including `app.keepActive = true` to maintain text settings and added snap functionality to make the neon signs attachable to other objects.\n\nAnother discussion involved Vincent troubleshooting connection issues with his self-hosted Hyperfy server. He determined that lag spikes in his internet connection were causing disconnects rather than server performance issues. The server runs on a Digital Ocean droplet with 1 CPU core and 2GB RAM.\n\n0mka shared updates about documentation, announcing that docs.hyperfy.xyz is now live. There was also a brief mention of vehicle physics, with Ashxn noting that ball colliders create unrealistic \"tank steering\" physics compared to more sophisticated approaches.\n\n## 2.

A community member inquired about the continued availability of the legacy platform, to which moderators confirmed it remains accessible with no immediate retirement plans. They clarified that v1 worlds will eventually be discontinued but with advance notice and after achieving feature parity with v2. User 0mka shared information about work related to emits/receives for locationator app placement and shared documentation resources, mentioning plans to add AI chat functionality to the site and make code references available through gitingest. There was also an offer from a community member to host an archive of content to preserve history.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can I still use the legacy platform?

Users are checking the price of a token called \"Hyperpigmentation\" (HYPER) using a bot command \"$hyper\". One user (DevStarlight | Numinia) notices a discrepancy between the reported price (0.013) and what they believe is the actual price (0.0062). Another user checks a different but similarly named token \"Hyperfy\" using \"$hyperfy\". The conversation doesn't contain any technical problem-solving, decisions, or implementations.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Something's wrong here? It says 0.013, but the real price is 0.0062 (asked by DevStarlight | Numinia) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

They created a model using vertex color painting on their laptop and were impressed with the tool's capabilities, comparing the experience to using Photoshop. However, they encountered a technical issue where the emission property wasn't properly using the color attribute. Despite this limitation, they still found the tool valuable for creating background or filler objects in 3D scenes.",

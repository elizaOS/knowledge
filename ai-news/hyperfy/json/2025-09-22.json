First, there's a question about OpenRouter.ai integration for in-world AI generation in Hyperfy, with HypPrivakos providing links to the current server AI implementation code and a pull request from Howie that might address this feature. Second, there's a question about using control.touchStick for non-avatar movement, with ash suggesting it might not be fully implemented in the runtime yet since they couldn't find examples of apps using it.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is openrouter.ai already supported for in-world AI generation? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Not yet, but there was a PR for it from Howie (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: Does anyone have or know of a .hyp that uses control.touchStick to control/move anything other than avatar?

      "summary": "# Analysis of ⚡│general Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment primarily revolves around a user named marlus discovering and learning about the HYP format in Hyperfy. Marlus expresses interest in migrating a project from Cryptovoxels to Hyperfy and asks several technical questions about the platform's capabilities. Community members provide resources including documentation links, video tutorials, and access to example files. Key technical points discussed include fly mode availability (currently builders-only), the HYP format compilation process (engine compiles .hyp when downloading .glb with .js attached), and creating colliders for GLB files. The conversation demonstrates the community's supportiveness in helping new users understand the platform's technical aspects. Marlus ultimately announces plans to migrate their Cryptovoxels project (distrito.museu.xyz) to Hyperfy.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to make fly mode available to all players? (asked by marlus) A: It's builders only at the moment (answered by ash)\nQ: Is there examples for download, like vehicles and other interactive stuff?

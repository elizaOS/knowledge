      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe main technical discussion centered around app-to-app communication in Hyperfy. Valiant sought help implementing a race system comprising four apps (StartRace, RaceGate, FinishRace, and RaceManager) that need to communicate with each other. Ashxn provided a detailed explanation of two main communication methods: app.send()/app.on() for same-app communication across the network, and app.emit()/world.on() for inter-app communication. Ashxn clarified that world.emit() was deprecated and replaced by app.emit(). 0mka suggested exploring world.set and world.get as additional options. There was also a brief mention of Gaussian splats integration possibilities with PlayCanvas, and a question about VRM exports with blendshapes across multiple meshes in Blender. The chat concluded with Valiant reporting progress on the race system implementation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I implement app-to-app communication for a race system with multiple apps? (asked by Valiant) A: Use app.send()/app.on() for same-app communication across network and app.emit()/world.on() for different-app communication (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What replaced the deprecated world.emit()? (asked by Valiant) A: It was replaced by app.emit() because \"it is the app emitting an event to the world\" (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Has anyone done anything to show Gaussian splats in v2 yet? (asked by hiroP) A: Not that I know of... That's going to be COOL AF (answered by Agent12)\nQ: What's the new quickstart installation link?

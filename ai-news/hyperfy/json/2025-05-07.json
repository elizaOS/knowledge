      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on app-to-app communication in Hyperverse. Valiant sought help implementing a race system comprising four apps (StartRace, RaceGate, FinishRace, and RaceManager) that need to communicate with each other. Ashxn provided a detailed explanation of two main communication methods: app.send()/app.on() for same-app communication across the network, and app.emit()/world.on() for inter-app communication on the same client/server. Ashxn clarified that world.emit() was deprecated and replaced by app.emit(). 0mka suggested exploring world.set and world.get as additional options for app communication. The chat also briefly touched on the possibility of implementing Gaussian splats in v2, with hiroP mentioning PlayCanvas repositories as a potential integration path.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I implement app-to-app communication for a race system with multiple apps? (asked by Valiant) A: Use app.send()/app.on() for same-app communication across network and app.emit()/world.on() for different-app communication on same client/server (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What replaced the deprecated world.emit()? (asked by Valiant) A: app.emit() replaced it because \"it is the app emitting an event to the world\" (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Has anyone implemented Gaussian splats in v2 yet? (asked by hiroP) A: Not that I know of... That's going to be COOL AF (answered by Agent12)\n\n## 3.

Gert-Jan Akerboom demonstrated a weight painting app for particle placement in worlds, sparking excitement about creative possibilities. Ashxn shared insights about the upcoming portable app system where objects can be equipped, used across worlds, and have permission controls through publisher signatures and a \"codex\" system with flux levels (1-5) for performance management. HiroP proposed a \"leaves\" concept for content layering in worlds, allowing users to subscribe to specific content channels. There was discussion about world persistence through world.get() and world.set() methods for storing data. Community members also debated logo designs, explored the concept of worlds as NFTs, and discussed self-owned worlds through DAOs. The chat revealed Hyperfy's technical architecture allows for building interactive worlds stored in .hyp files with cross-world functionality.\n\n## 2.

(asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: You can use world.get(key) and world.set(key, value) to store data at the world level (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there any example .hyp that uses world.get(key) and world.set(key, value)? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: The portal app uses it to store teleport position (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How will portable apps work across worlds? (asked by hiroP) A: Objects can be signed with a publisher, and world owners can control what objects can be used through various permission levels (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Would it be possible to make worlds into NFTs?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about Hyperfy's features and capabilities, particularly regarding web content integration in virtual worlds. A key technical limitation was identified: Hyperfy's V2 currently lacks webview functionality, though screensharing is available as a workaround. Users discussed the screen.hyp component which can share video but apparently not audio. There was also a brief discussion about avatar rendering issues where a user experienced problems with how shorts appeared in-world despite looking fine in Blender. Community members expressed interest in adding iframe/webview functionality to core/nodes in the future. Some off-topic discussion about market comparisons with other projects and metaverse narratives also occurred, but these weren't technically substantive.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do we have an app that is a screen in the world can show a designated webpage? (asked by Coinexpert) A: No webview in v2 yet. But you can use screenshare and show a tab or a stream (answered by 0mka)\nQ: Is there a screensharing .hyp yet? (asked by hiroP) A: This one might suffice: [link to Discord message] (answered by 0mka)\nQ: I found this screen.hyp only share video, but no audio, is that made by purpose or a bug? (asked by Coinexpert) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

A user named MUDBONE expresses frustration about the lack of visible progress compared to what was promised in a January podcast with Threadguy. They mention that many investors have put significant money into the project but see little tangible development or clear direction. \n\nAshxn and Reneil defend the project, explaining that substantial development is happening but not being effectively communicated. Reneil points to weekly community calls on YouTube and plugin development in a dedicated channel. Ashxn acknowledges their communication weakness, stating they're \"99% building, 1% marketing\" and focusing on creating a solid product before marketing it. They mention work on a litepaper that's taking time because Ashxn wants it to be accurate.\n\nMUDBONE suggests more frequent updates and videos to build investor confidence, and notes that the current V2 can only be accessed through Discord links rather than through a proper website portal. Ashxn agrees that their communication needs improvement and acknowledges the validity of constructive criticism.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are we going to zero? (asked by austin) A: Unanswered\nQ: What progress has been made on the project since January? (asked by MUDBONE) A: There are weekly community calls on YouTube and plugins being built in public, but communication about developments needs improvement (answered by Reneil)\nQ: Why isn't there better communication about project direction? (asked by MUDBONE) A: The team is focused on building the tech first, with plans to focus on growth later when the product is ready (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

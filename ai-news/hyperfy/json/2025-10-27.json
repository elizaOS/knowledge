The most significant technical exchange involves emotionull requesting a feature for world builders to download a zip of all worlds as single GLB files per world, which ash confirmed is possible to implement. Additionally, 3rdEyeVisuals shared progress on developing a custom Video_Enhanced.hyp component with various mesh options including rectangle, circular, oval, octagonal, and planned rounded corners rectangular mesh, mentioning they took time off work to complete this development. There was also a brief mention of \"x402 protocol for Hyperfy\" by Xukonth, though without further elaboration. The remaining messages were primarily casual conversation, including comments about Discord's Halloween-themed alert sounds.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around blockchain platform considerations for Hyper, with a focus on potential migration from Solana to EVM-compatible chains. Several users express support for migrating to EVM chains due to better tooling for governance, NFTs, and token-gating functionality. Specific alternatives mentioned include Ethereum and Monad (an upcoming L1 EVM-compatible chain launching in November). Tone introduces Realms, a Solana-based governance platform, as a potential solution for DAO governance. The conversation highlights a technical decision point regarding which blockchain infrastructure would best serve Hyper's needs, with considerations for governance tools, NFT functionality, and scalability.\n\n## 2.

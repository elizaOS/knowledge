      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around troubleshooting network connectivity issues in Hyperfy. A user named \"vox\" experienced repeated disconnections while trying to access a world, despite having good ping. The server admin confirmed the servers are located in France. The discussion revealed that Hyperfy doesn't implement auto-reconnect functionality because the networking is based on an initial state snapshot with delta updates, making reconnection equivalent to a full refresh.\n\nThe conversation also touched on AI-assisted development in Hyperfy, where users collaboratively enhanced a dragon in the \"playworld\" by adding features like fire and flight capabilities through AI prompts rather than manual coding. Another example mentioned was a working networked flash memory game created in the \"vibe world\" through prompts. A suggestion was made to improve the editing experience for moving objects by allowing prompts to be added to code, with visual indicators for items still being generated.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Where are the servers located? (asked by vox) A: France (looking to get other servers to provide options to people to host elsewhere) (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: Is there a reason for not having an auto reconnect in Hyperfy? (asked by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host) A: Auto reconnect is the same as refreshing. Since all networking is based on an initial snapshot of state and then delta updates, the only way to resume from a disconnect is to restart essentially. (answered by ash)\nQ: How you do the edits? (asked by Gh0stt) A: `/edit an edit` (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: fps games made with Hyperfy? (asked by Xukonth) A: Code the change you wish to see!! (answered by smickelbeard)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: ash | Helpee: vox | Context: User experiencing repeated disconnections from Hyperfy world | Resolution: Suggested trying 5G network which proved more stable, indicating a network issue\nHelper: ash | Helpee: HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host | Context: Question about auto-reconnect functionality | Resolution: Explained technical limitations and design decision to show a manual reconnect button instead\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nFeature: Allow adding prompts to code for easier editing of moving objects in vibe world | Description: Add visual indicators (different colors) for items still being generated | Mentioned By: Gert-Jan Akerboom\nFeature: FPS games in Hyperfy | Description: Request for first-person shooter functionality | Mentioned By: Xukonth\nTechnical: Investigate network connectivity issues | Description: Diagnose why some users experience disconnections despite good ping | Mentioned By: HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"âš¡â”‚general\"\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on AI integration with Hyperfy, particularly around generating 3D content. Dhin shared their experience using GPT-5 to create Star Wars AT-T models for \"vibe world,\" noting it performed significantly better than other AI models despite being slow. They used high reasoning level settings and required multiple iterations. Ash provided technical guidance on how to integrate additional AI models into Hyperfy by modifying the ServerAI.js file. There was also brief discussion about Project89's partnership with Hyperfy, with some users mentioning they discovered Hyperfy through Project89. The conversation touched on the potential for AI to generate gameplay elements and NFTs, though this was not explored in depth.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does this have any effect? (asked by cloudAI) A: Unanswered\nQ: Who made the star wars ATT stuff in vibe world? (asked by ash) A: I did the star wars stuff. Was testing out different ais. GPT 5 was best by a fair margin for me. (answered by Dhin)\nQ: Did you prompt it in your own world and then come drop it in vibe? (asked by ash) A: Yea some of it (answered by Dhin)\nQ: What reasoning level did you use? (asked by ash) A: High reasoning (answered by Dhin)\nQ: Can we already plug in kimi k2 or deepseek 3.1 from comput3? (asked by Reneil) A: Not built in but its easy to add your own at the bottom of this file: https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy/blob/dev/src/core/systems/ServerAI.js (answered by ash)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Dhin | Helpee: ash | Context: Inquiring about Star Wars AT-T models in vibe world and AI used to create them | Resolution: Dhin explained they used GPT-5 with high reasoning level and multiple iterations\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Reneil | Context: Asking about integrating additional AI models (kimi k2, deepseek 3.1) | Resolution: Provided GitHub link to ServerAI.js file where custom AI models can be added\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Update the Comput3 AI integration in ServerAI.js | Description: The integration may need updating as mentioned by ash | Mentioned By: ash\nFeature: Integrate kimi k2 and deepseek 3.1 AI models from comput3 | Description: Users want to use these models for content creation | Mentioned By: Reneil\nFeature: AI-generated gameplay and NFT creation | Description: Interest in AI creating actual gameplay elements and rare NFTs | Mentioned By: johan",

      "summary": "# Hyperfy Discord Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy's transition from V1 to V2, with significant technical discussions about the platform's evolution. V2 represents a major shift from the NFT-gated worlds of V1 to an open-source, self-hostable metaverse platform. Developers are already testing V2, with the code available on GitHub, while a more user-friendly version is in development. Key technical topics included world hosting requirements, performance optimization for large events (supporting up to 100 users per instance), and interoperability between worlds. The community discussed AI agent integration through ElizaOS, allowing for interactive NPCs that can respond to natural language commands. There were also conversations about token utility, NFT integration options, and the airdrop claim deadline. The platform aims to be accessible without requiring downloads or wallet connections, with emphasis on its web-based nature making it more approachable than competing metaverse platforms.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can someone explain the worlds? Is it possible to start a new world today? (asked by cryptomosin) A: No need to buy V1 worlds anymore, you can self-host the code and spin up a world on your own using instructions in the community documentation. (answered by maximus)\nQ: What are the specs needed for a server to run Hyperfy? (asked by WarfreakzPlays) A: At least with the barebones version that's out now, it'll basically run on a potato. (answered by merk)\nQ: What are the limits for a world to still be loadable in under 5 minutes? Number of max users, fps or triangle max? (asked by MokonaW) A: You can set a limit of around 50-100 people before a new instance is created. Performance depends on world optimization and avatar complexity. (answered by Cynnx)\nQ: If I put a limit for each instance, like 100 for example, does it create automatically a new instance when the limit is reached? (asked by MokonaW) A: Yes, the 101st user will go to a new instance when trying to join. (answered by Cynnx)\nQ: If the visitor has an old PC, will the fps automatically adjust? (asked by MokonaW) A: There's no specific FPS dropping mechanism for low performance in V1, but V2 could potentially recognize struggling devices and adjust accordingly. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Will the website index all V2 worlds? Is there a metaverse registry where we can make our world discoverable? (asked by felixdigit://) A: Yes, potentially through a portal. Since it's all web-based, worlds can be scanned using meta tags. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is it possible to NFT gate a world in V2? (asked by Labden) A: Yes, through multi-instance hosting and using world portals where access is controlled by blockchain verification. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Will V1 worlds stop working? (asked by Pete) A: There will be a long wind-down period, and the team will work on solutions for the most visited/impressive V1 worlds. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Will you add any NFT stuff in the future at all? (asked by PurpleSack) A: Yes, every world can choose their own chain and support whatever they want. The team will make it easy to implement. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is V1 going to still be online or disappear? Is V2 only by code or accessible like V1? (asked by mofl13) A: V1 will stay hosted for now with no timeline for deprecation. V2 is in alpha through code, with platforms being built to make it 1-click like website builders.

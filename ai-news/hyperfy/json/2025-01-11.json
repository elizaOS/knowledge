      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the recent release of Hyperfy v2, an open-source platform for building 3D virtual worlds. Developers are discussing setup issues, particularly with deploying instances on VPS services like DigitalOcean. Key technical discussions include configuring environment variables for proper WebSocket connections, setting up HTTPS with Nginx for file uploads to work, and handling admin permissions. Ashxn (core developer) is actively supporting users and mentioned that persistence functionality was recently added. There's significant interest in developing apps for the platform, with Ashxn indicating this is the next development priority. The community is also discussing asset optimization, with suggestions to use AI tools like TRELLIS and Stable Point Aware 3D for generating models, and Blender's decimate modifier for optimization. Future governance may involve a DAO structure to curate approved apps and maintain quality standards.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I access player position? (asked by MetaMike) A: world.entities.player is the local player, can check in console (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can we send and receive Solana tokens inside Hyperfy world? (asked by WarfreakzPlays) A: You can, but probably not how you're thinking yet (answered by vincentskele)\nQ: Why can't I drag and drop GLB files on my server like I can locally? (asked by vincentskele) A: Your browser might not be happy because it's HTTP or it might be directory permissions issues. Try through Nginx for HTTPS (answered by HPrivakos)\nQ: How do I set up admin permissions? (asked by vincentskele) A: If your .env has ADMIN_CODE= and it's empty, anyone can drag and drop. If you give it a value like ADMIN_CODE=hyper, nobody can build, but admins can type /admin hyper to get the role (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: When will the Solana contracts be released as open source? (asked by t-900) A: Not planning on it (answered by Saori)\nQ: Was aixbt built using Hyperfy? (asked by satiev1) A: No (answered by Saori)\nQ: Is VRM support live on v2? (asked by vincentskele) A: VRMs are in v2 core, just need to expose it via apps (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Hyperfy Discord Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy's transition from V1 to V2, with significant technical discussions about the platform's evolution. V2 represents a major shift from the NFT-gated worlds of V1 to an open-source, self-hostable metaverse platform. Developers are already testing V2, with the code available on GitHub, while a more user-friendly version is in development. Key technical topics included world hosting requirements, performance optimization for large events (supporting up to 100 users per instance), and interoperability between worlds. The community discussed AI agent integration through ElizaOS, allowing for interactive NPCs that respond to natural language. There were also conversations about token utility, NFT integration options, and the airdrop claim deadline. The platform's architecture allows for customization where world creators can choose which blockchain to support and implement their own features, emphasizing Hyperfy's commitment to an open metaverse ecosystem.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can someone explain the worlds? Is it possible to start a new world today? (asked by cryptomosin) A: No need to buy v1 worlds anymore, you can self-host the code and spin up a world on your own. There are instructions in the community documentation to use a VPS to host a world. (answered by maximus)\nQ: What are the specs needed for a server to run Hyperfy? (asked by WarfreakzPlays) A: At least with the barebones version that's out now it'll basically run on a potato. (answered by merk)\nQ: What are the limits for a world to still be loadable in under 5 minutes? Number of max users, fps or triangle max? (asked by MokonaW) A: We've run events close to 100 people in the same instance. It's important to have the world be as lean and optimized as possible, but with 100 people, how heavy their avatars are becomes the larger part of the load. (answered by Cynnx)\nQ: If I put a limit for each instance, like 100 for example, does it create automatically a new instance when the limit is reached? (asked by MokonaW) A: The 101st user will go to a new instance when trying to join. (answered by Cynnx)\nQ: If the visitor has an old PC, will the fps automatically adjust? (asked by MokonaW) A: There's no specific FPS dropping mechanism for low performance in V1, but V2 could potentially recognize if a device is struggling and tell it to drop to lower fps. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Will the website index all v2 worlds? Is there a metaverse registry where we can make our world discoverable? (asked by felixdigit://) A: Maybe some kind of portal. Either we or others can build it. Since it's all web based we can scan the entire web for worlds using meta tags etc. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is v1 going to still be online or going to disappear? Is v2 only by code or accessible like v1? (asked by mofl13) A: V1 will stay hosted for now with no timeline of when worlds will be deprecated. V2 is in alpha now through code, with people building platforms to host the code and make building 1-click. (answered by maximus)\nQ: If I make a world, is it possible to NFT gate it? (asked by Labden) A: Yes, multi-instance hosting is possible. Gating could be done using world portals where access is only given to people with a certain flag set, which could reference a blockchain. (answered by maximus)\nQ: What's the timeline for v2? (asked by MUDBONE) A: Base code is out now, native apps probably another week or so. People are already creating things with v2. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Will you add any NFT stuff in the future at all? (asked by PurpleSack) A: Every world can choose their own chain and support whatever they want. We'll make it easy to do all this. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

Users are registering their Solana wallet addresses through the hyperfy.io/airdrop site to claim tokens associated with their Ethereum wallets. A common issue is the \"wallet not eligible\" message appearing on the claim site, which administrators clarified is normal until wallet addresses are processed in batches. The registration process requires users to submit their Solana address and ensure they see a checkmark confirmation. Several community members sought verification that their registrations were properly recorded. Administrators advised users to disconnect and reconnect to the site to confirm their SOL address was saved correctly. There was also mention of addressing market cap data on Dexscreener through a Coingecko submission. The registration deadline of January 12, 2025 was referenced, with batch processing occurring around that time.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on development activities within the Hyperfy platform. Key technical discussions included:\n\nCru shared updates on interactive objects created for Hyperfy, including a projector with on/off functionality and sound effects, and a drum pad with potential for improved colliders and visual feedback. Devilsadvocate.sol worked on authentication implementation for a backend service, discussing session management approaches with other developers and sharing code examples of login functionality using PostgreSQL for session storage. \n\nPeezy developed an integration between Cursor (an AI-powered code editor) and Hyperfy using MCP (Machine Control Protocol), enabling live code updates in the Hyperfy environment. This allows developers to modify entity scripts on the fly without manual copy-pasting. The implementation includes server-side tools for querying the database and modifying entity scripts.\n\nAshxn provided technical guidance on the plugin system architecture, explaining how to use the inject method to extend functionality in createClientWorld/createServerWorld. He also confirmed that rigidbody.addForce() and rigidbody.addTorque() methods are available for physics interactions.\n\nJin and Omka collaborated on improving the Hyperfy GitHub repository documentation, creating pull requests to add links to documentation, website, and playable demos to make the project more accessible to newcomers.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do you hook up both client and server to the plugin system? (asked by peezy) A: Add systems in createClientWorld/createServerWorld and use the inject method in the system's init() function to extend functionality (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Does the \"1 light is best in a world\" guideline include the world sun? (asked by ᲼) A: Yes, it does include it, but two lights won't make a huge difference (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can we add forces to rigidbodies? (asked by Shiffty) A: Yes, rigidbody.addForce(force: Vector3) and rigidbody.addTorque(force: Vector3) are available, with more functions planned for vehicles (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Why use stateful sessions with a session ID instead of stateless tokens? (asked by mattimus) A: Stateful sessions are useful when you need to attach additional information within a session, while stateless is simpler for basic auth validation (answered by mattimus)\n\n## 3.

Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around 3D city building techniques and VR compatibility issues. 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 is working on building 500 building blocks for a large-scale city project, utilizing AI assistance for 3D design. They mention using atlasing and instancing techniques to create a city that's both visually appealing and performance-efficient. The discussion highlights how Krea can be used to alter base textures to achieve different building styles. A significant technical issue emerged regarding VR compatibility with 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎's project hosted at vox.b34k3r.com - multiple users confirmed the VR button was clickable but VR mode wouldn't fully load. Ashxn later mentioned this was fixed in the latest dev branch. There was also a brief discussion about UI elements, with Omka mentioning Ash's updates to padding/margin on UI that would allow images to fit as triangles on pyramids, and sharing a project with proximity triggers.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can anyone get this running in VR?

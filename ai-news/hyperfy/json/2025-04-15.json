      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on the development and implementation of a new particle system in Hyperfy v2. Ash announced the completion of particles that are \"free\" (performance-efficient) and shared demos, code examples, and documentation. The particle system supports various effects including whirlwind vortex, spritesheet animations, and can be attached to avatars and objects. Other technical discussions included a server browser for connecting different Hyperfy instances, a 360-degree video player with various improvements, and TV/video functionality. There were also conversations about real-time chat streaming, speech-to-text capabilities, and emote systems. Several developers shared their implementations and experiments with the new particle system, demonstrating different effects like auras and movement trails. The chat confirmed that Hyperfy v2 is fully open-source, self-hostable, and can work with any blockchain, not requiring the Hyperfy token.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a self-hosted option for Hyperfy?

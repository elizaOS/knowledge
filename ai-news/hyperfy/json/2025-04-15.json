          "text": "Hyperfy v2 development is progressing with several new features being implemented. The most significant addition is a highly optimized particle system introduced by ashxn.eth that supports spritesheet animations, various emission patterns, and can be attached to avatars or objects with minimal performance impact. Documentation for the particle system has been published to GitHub for developer reference.",

        {
          "text": "The Discord chat discussions covered two main areas: technical development in Hyperfy v2 and community engagement ideas.\n\nOn the technical side, the primary focus was on a new particle system introduced by ashxn.eth. This highly optimized system supports spritesheet animations, different emission patterns, and can be attached to avatars or objects with minimal performance impact. Documentation was published to GitHub, and several demos were shared showing implementations like whirlwind effects, auras, and movement trails. Other technical discussions included a server browser implementation by crufro, 360-degree video player improvements by metarick, real-time chat streaming experiments, and TV/video player implementation with multiple video support. It was also clarified that Hyperfy v2 is fully open source and self-hostable, unlike v1.\n\nOn the community side, there were suggestions to connect with a developer named \"Orange\" from Neos/Resonite who could create valuable content with Hyperfy. There was also a proposal to organize a monthly death match event called \"Saturday Slaughter\" in a space called \"Fallen.\" The community discussion was more social and focused on building engagement rather than technical problem-solving.",

This game features a grid of colored blocks where players navigate through obstacles to collect yellow tiles while avoiding red ones. The game was initially developed for Decentraland (DCL) and is now being ported to Hyperfy with multiplayer functionality. The discussion highlights the performance improvements in Hyperfy compared to DCL, particularly regarding rendering numerous blocks. Lastraum shared a link to test the game, which features 50 levels with increasing difficulty.

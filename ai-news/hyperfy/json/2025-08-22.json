      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around AI-generated content in Hyperfy worlds, particularly a new feature that allows users to prompt AI to create 3D objects. Developers discussed the \"vibe world\" which contains AI-generated objects (300+) with impressive stats (1 million triangles). Several technical challenges emerged, including world crashes from overly complex AI-generated objects and the need for model optimization. The conversation covered different AI models for generation (Sonnet 4, Grok 4, Qwen 3 Coder via OpenRouter) with discussions about cost efficiency, speed, and quality. Developers shared implementation details about adding OpenRouter support and discussed the need for a \"safe mode\" to load worlds without running scripts to fix buggy applications. There was also discussion about adding prompt history to scripts and exploring new rendering technologies like Self-Organizing Gaussians (SOGS) for efficient 3D model loading. The community expressed interest in adding empty objects as a primitive type and improving the user experience for non-coders.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What are the stats for the vibe world? (implied from ash's post) A: 21 materials, 39 geometries, 84 draw calls, 1 MILLION triangles, 300 AI generated objects (answered by ash)\nQ: What's the ENV for an API key? (asked by HowieDuhzit) A: See .env.example (answered by ash)\nQ: Which AI models are best for balance of speed and price? (implied from discussion) A: Sonnet 4 and Grok 4 are best balance of speed and price without blowing credits (answered by ash)\nQ: Is there a way to add OpenRouter support? (asked by HowieDuhzit) A: Just changing the endpoint URL is needed as the API is identical to OpenAI (answered by HowieDuhzit)\nQ: How much has the AI generation in vibe world cost so far? (implied from ash's comment) A: Around 5-10 bucks, which isn't bad but could be costly at scale (answered by ash)\nQ: How can we handle crashes from complex AI-generated objects? (implied from discussion) A: Adding a limit to the prompt to prevent creation of objects that crash the world (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

The conversation consists primarily of greetings (\"gm\") and brief, disconnected comments. Fibelius shared some philosophical thoughts about prompting in virtual worlds, comparing experiences with Niji, MJ, and video LLMs to the current 3D environment where real people interact with objects and NPCs. Xukonth inquired about the possibility of creating minigames in Hyperfy, sharing a YouTube link as an example. Overall, the chat lacks substantive technical content, decisions, or implementations.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there no builder who can make minigames with Hyperfy? (asked by Xukonth) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nNo significant help interactions were observed in this chat segment.\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for channel \"🪙│hyper\"\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat segment primarily revolves around community concerns about unfulfilled promises in the Hyper project. A user named zobo expresses frustration about features promised 8 months ago that haven't been delivered, specifically mentioning an economic flywheel, interoperable in-game asset marketplace, and agent-ran worlds (including a stock market). PabloFM from Numinia responds that significant work is happening behind the scenes, though it may not be visible to users. There's some tension between zobo and Shiffty regarding whether these are broken promises or simply delayed features. Another user (maximus) confirms that earlier communications had suggested these features would be available within weeks. The conversation includes some sarcastic comments about token price, and one user (jar0d) expresses interest in purchasing more HYPER tokens.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What was promised that wasn't delivered? (asked by Shiffty) A: Economic flywheel, interoperable in-game asset marketplace, agent-ran worlds (e.g. agent-ran stock market) (answered by zobo)\nQ: Are those [promised features] not coming? (asked by Shiffty) A: Marketplace was last mentioned in February with no updates since then (answered by zobo)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: PabloFM | Numinia | Helpee: zobo | Context: Concern about lack of visible progress on promised features | Resolution: Provided reassurance that teams are working behind the scenes and committed to the project\nHelper: Dhin | Helpee: Community | Context: Negative sentiment about project progress | Resolution: Suggested checking out the \"vibe world\" as a positive aspect of the project\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion focused on implementing water animation in a 3D planet model created with the Hyperfy Tool in Blender. 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰 was trying to adapt a sample script to make water textures move while maintaining collision properties. The key technical issue was correctly referencing mesh names in the script. Vox identified a typo in the mesh name (\"Sphere001MeshLOD0\") that was preventing the script from working. Ash provided a code snippet demonstrating how to reference nodes and implement rotation. Vox confirmed that texture scrolling works with collision intact and suggested distorting UVs slightly for more realistic water movement. Vox shared a working .hyp file demonstrating the solution. The conversation highlighted the importance of accurate node referencing when implementing animations in Hyperfy.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there a way to adapt a script for the hierarchy created by the Hyperfy Tool addon in Blender to make water move while keeping collision? (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰) A: Yes, the script will use the mesh with applied texture you want scrolling. Collision will stay intact. (answered by vox)\nQ: Can all movements (water, ring, etc.) be managed in script if exported as Batch GLB with Hyperfy Tool? (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰) A: You can have several meshes with different textures scrolling in the same GLB and .hyp by extending the script to look for other meshes. (answered by vox)\nQ: How can I reference nodes in my scripts? (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰) A: In the nodes tab you can see the nodes and reference them in your scripts, e.g., const sphere = app.get('Sphere001MeshLOD0') (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat contains a single message from user \"johan\" reporting an issue that occurred during a WIP (Work in Progress) meetup. Multiple users were unexpectedly disconnected (\"booted out\") from a virtual world. Johan shared a link to the specific Hyperfy world where the incident occurred (https://hyperfy.io/vertex/~SqP1) and speculated that it might be related to stability issues but acknowledged uncertainty about the root cause. No further discussion, troubleshooting, or resolution is present in this brief chat segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What might have caused users to be booted from the world during the WIP meetup?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🏗│infra Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion focused on self-hosting LiveKit servers and configuring external asset storage and databases for Hyperfy spaces. HypPrivakos mentioned running LiveKit on a $4/month VPS without rate limiting issues and offered to provide a free LiveKit server for those who don't want to self-host. Later, cru inquired about offloading assets to S3 storage to evaluate performance differences. DevStarlight from Numinia shared detailed configuration examples for setting up S3 storage for assets and PostgreSQL instead of SQLite3 for databases. The configuration included environment variables for connecting to S3 buckets (ASSETS, ASSETS_BASE_URL, ASSETS_S3_URI) and PostgreSQL databases (DB_URL, DB_SCHEMA). DevStarlight also noted that one database can host multiple schemas, each containing all the space tables needed.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Do I just plug a public s3 bucket in there? (asked by cru) A: You need to set up specific environment variables including ASSETS=s3, ASSETS_BASE_URL pointing to your CloudFront or S3 URL, and ASSETS_S3_URI with your access credentials and S3 path. (answered by DevStarlight)\nQ: How to self-host LiveKit? (asked by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host) A: Follow the documentation at https://docs.livekit.io/home/self-hosting/vm/ (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\n\n## 3.

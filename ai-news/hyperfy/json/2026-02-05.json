They created a script that generates tests for converted apps in isolated grid worlds, solving the previous issue where apps were difficult to find in test worlds. Jin proposed creating a dedicated repository for \"skills\" - specialized knowledge modules that help AI agents understand Hyperfy development without losing context during debugging sessions. They demonstrated success using these skills to create a pet app in one attempt.\n\nJin also made UI improvements to the Hyperfy interface by adding labels to previously unlabeled columns and adding pitch/yaw/roll labels, enhancing usability. They submitted a pull request (#151) with these changes. Jin mentioned testing with Opus 4.6, which they found impressive. The conversation also touched on using combined skills (Solana + building-Hyperfy-apps) to experiment with Hyperfy tokenomics ideas.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why aren't these columns labeled or have tooltip? (asked by jin) A: I was just saving space (answered by ash)\nQ: Can you make a repo called skills I can contribute to or can I PR to the hyperfy repo? (asked by jin) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat segment covers a brief discussion about a GitHub repository called \"hyperfy-ref\" which appears to be an older reference repository that served as a blueprint for a v2 version of a project. Jin submitted a pull request (#2) to add a README to this repository. Ash acknowledged that while the repository is outdated, it still deserved documentation before being archived. Jin also suggested adding information to a specific location that would be \"easy to hit with gh API\" before archiving. There was also a brief mention of Roblox's foundation model announcement and a question about Kubernetes requirements for \"worlds\" with jin suggesting that \"janus servers\" could run on inexpensive hosting. Ash later clarified that the v2 version is very lightweight and can \"run on a raspberry pi.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: why are k8s needed per world (asked by jin) A: what? for v2? nah dude they run on a potato. you can run v2 on a raspberry pi (answered by ash)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: jin | Helpee: ash | Context: Noticing GitHub commits were no longer being verified | Resolution: Notification provided, but no visible resolution in the transcript\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe conversation revolves around potentially adding the \"Visitors Of Imma Degen / VOID\" NFT collection to the open-source-avatars repository. Fibelius, who owns VOID avatars, inquires about the practical steps to share these assets. ToxSam explains that while technically feasible, there are licensing concerns since the original project isn't open source. The technical implementation would involve uploading the 3D assets (VRM/GLB files) to GitHub, creating a collection JSON file similar to existing examples, and adding a project reference to the projects.json file. ToxSam offers assistance but emphasizes the need to resolve licensing issues first, especially regarding what happens when NFTs are sold. The open-source-avatars repository can fetch various file types (images, FBX, GLB, VRM) but primarily displays VRMs.\n\n## 2.

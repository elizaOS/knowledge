      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe conversation primarily revolves around the development status of Hyperfy, focusing on wallet integration and web3 functionality. A key discussion point is the availability of wallet connect functionality through hypkg.sh, which .hyp shaman indicates has been available for months. There's debate about development accessibility, with .hyp shaman encouraging Agent12 to develop skills and contribute directly, while Agent12 expresses frustration about personal technical limitations. The chat reveals tension between those who want features added to the core branch versus those advocating for community-driven development. 3rdEyeVisuals mentions taking a backend session-based approach to gaming rather than on-chain implementation to avoid transaction fees. The conversation also touches on the learning curve for technical skills and concerns about the crypto ecosystem's integrity.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Anything New on the Horizon for the Github? (asked by Agent12) A: \"ngl it's pretty stable. on hyp.\" (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: We got Cars, Pets, Or Web3 Gating yet in Stable Dev? (asked by Agent12) A: \"cars and pets have been done for a minute now. afaik no one has looked at the code to iterate\" (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: Where is @[179546010303856640]? (asked by lambert2288) A: \"Usually when he goes quiet, it means he's working on something big.\" (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: .hyp shaman | Helpee: Agent12 | Context: Agent12 wanting wallet connect functionality in the core branch | Resolution: .hyp shaman shared https://hypkg.sh/ and explained wallet connect has been available for months\nHelper: 3rdEyeVisuals | Helpee: Agent12 | Context: Discussion about learning curve for technical skills | Resolution: 3rdEyeVisuals shared personal experience about the learning process taking time and requiring many failed attempts\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Integrate wallet connect functionality from hypkg into core branch | Description: Wallet connect functionality exists but needs to be added to main development branch | Mentioned By: Agent12\nTechnical: Review and iterate on existing cars and pets code | Description: Features exist but need refinement | Mentioned By: .hyp shaman\nFeature: Implement Web3 gating | Description: Add blockchain-based access control | Mentioned By: Agent12\nTechnical: Explore backend session-based approach for games | Description: Alternative to on-chain gaming to avoid transaction fees | Mentioned By: 3rdEyeVisuals",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical limitations and implementations in Hyperfy. A key topic was UV scrolling on skinned meshes, which is currently unsupported despite attempts by users to implement it. Another significant discussion involved IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) file integration into Hyperfy using ThatOpen's engine components, though with performance concerns. Canvas-texture with dirty flags was mentioned as a technique for optimizing game implementations within Hyperfy, specifically for running games like Space Invaders and slot machines with better performance. The conversation also touched on optimization techniques like grouping meshes to reduce CPU/GPU load, and briefly mentioned database integration questions. Overall, the chat revealed current technical boundaries of the platform while showcasing creative workarounds developers are implementing.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Do we have UV scrolling on skinned meshes? (asked by Valiant) A: Only regular mesh currently. Skinned mesh support is a bit harder. (answered by ash)\nQ: Is there a way to group the individual meshes with ctrl+j and still access each nested mesh separately? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: Yes, the group node or use empties in blender. (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: What kind of database's have people incorporated into their builds? What tools/techniques are you using to query your tables and DB's? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Valiant | Context: Trying to implement UV scrolling on skinned meshes | Resolution: Confirmed it's not currently supported, saving Valiant from spending more time on an impossible task\nHelper: .hyp shaman | Helpee: 3rdEyeVisuals | Context: How to group meshes while maintaining individual access | Resolution: Suggested using group nodes or empties in Blender\nHelper: ash | Helpee: mrtzhckr | Context: Looking for a previously mentioned web tile renderer repository | Resolution: Suggested Cesium.js as a possible solution\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nType: Technical | Description: Implement UV scrolling support for skinned meshes | Mentioned By: ash\nType: Technical | Description: Optimize IFC file integration for better performance | Mentioned By: mrtzhckr\nType: Feature | Description: Consider adding webview support for in-world applications | Mentioned By: .hyp shaman\nType: Technical | Description: Explore map tiles integration in Hyperfy | Mentioned By: mrtzhckr\nType: Documentation | Description: Document canvas-texture with dirty flags technique for optimizing in-world games | Mentioned By: 3rdEyeVisuals",

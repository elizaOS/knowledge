      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on naming conventions in the codebase and UI improvements. Ashxn raised concerns about confusing naming in the system, particularly with ServerLoader.js and ClientLoader.js, suggesting they should be renamed to NodeLoader.js and BrowserLoader.js respectively to better reflect their functions. The chat also covered recent UI updates that added model, image, and button functionality, which was well-received. Roustan provided specific feedback about image placement against walls and suggested adding a spatial toggle for video loading based on avatar proximity. There was brief discussion about audio reactivity features, with mentions of using \"curve\" functionality for implementation. The hyperfy.how website was reported as being down.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why is the node client using a system labeled \"server\" and why does the client folder use nodejs APIs? (asked by Ashxn) A: Unanswered\nQ: What happened to hyperfy.how?

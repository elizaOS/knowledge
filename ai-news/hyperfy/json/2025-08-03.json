      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical issues related to player spawning, world loading, and new features in Hyperfy. A key problem addressed was players falling through the ground when they spawn before the world loads. Solutions included implementing scenes, preloading islands before the world, and adjusting spawn points to be higher in the air. Ashxn mentioned important PRs and updates to the dev branch, including a new `CLEAN=true` environment variable that automatically cleans up old blueprints and assets on world startup, eliminating the need for manual cleanup. Lastraum shared a new Audius Music Player HYP with various commands for playlist management and playback control. The chat also briefly touched on primitives and potential blockchain integrations.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there anywhere to delay the player spawn until world spawns? Or better way? (asked by shmoji) A: Check out \"scenes\" for your island, ensure your island preloads before the world, or change your spawn point to higher in the air (answered by Shiffty and 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\nQ: Does that mean EVM is coming to Core? OR SOL? (asked by Agent12) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

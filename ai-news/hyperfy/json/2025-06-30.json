Gert-Jan Akerboom demonstrated a weight painting app for particles that allows users to place elements like grass and flowers in their worlds. The conversation evolved into discussions about portable apps that can be used across different worlds, with Ashxn explaining the planned system for object signing, publisher verification, and the \"codex\" - an official list of objects with assigned performance ratings (flux levels). \n\nHiroP shared a concept called \"leaves\" for layering content in virtual worlds, allowing users to subscribe to specific content themes that would be visible across different worlds. The community discussed moderation approaches, with some favoring human/AI moderation through channels and others suggesting token-based systems for proof of engagement.\n\nTechnical discussions included data persistence using world.get() and world.set() methods, resource management with netdata for server monitoring, and the potential for worlds to be tokenized as NFTs. The chat revealed enthusiasm for Hyperfy's building blocks approach that makes complex development more accessible, with members expressing excitement about creating interconnected experiences where objects earned in one world can be used in others.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I store data in my world to persist after reload? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: You can use world.get(key) and world.set(key, value) to store data at the world level (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Would it be possible to make worlds into NFTs? (asked by PurpleSack) A: Not directly answered, but Agent12 suggested it could be done through a DAO with pre-programmed rules\nQ: How will portable apps work across different worlds? (asked by hiroP) A: Objects can be signed with a publisher, and world owners can choose what objects can be used in their world through various permission levels (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What is the world.snapshot function used for? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

A significant technical discussion centers on an upcoming whitepaper release mentioned by Ashxn, which will be available \"in the next couple of days.\" There's a brief technical note from 0mka about needing to make changes to how LiveKit works in the core rather than via hyp. The community also discusses avatar rendering issues, with ovo sharing a problem about shorts appearing differently in-world compared to Blender. There's mention of \"elizaOS\" as a dependency that should be noted in documentation. The conversation also touches on metaverse narratives, with some members suggesting combinations with AI and agents as more current technological directions.\n\n## 2.

A user named MUDBONE expresses frustration about the lack of visible progress compared to what was promised in a January podcast with Threadguy. Ashxn and Reneil defend the project, explaining that significant development is happening but not being effectively communicated to the community. They point to weekly community calls on YouTube and plugin development in another channel as evidence of progress. Ashxn acknowledges their communication weakness, describing the team as \"99% building, 1% marketing\" and explains they're focusing on building solid technology before investing in growth marketing. MUDBONE suggests more regular updates and better accessibility for V2, noting that currently users need to access Discord links rather than having a proper web portal.\n\n## 2.

A user (Coinexpert) is experiencing connection problems where some users can join their world while others cannot. Ash identifies that the issue stems from an incorrect WebSocket URL protocol - using \"https://\" instead of the required \"wss://\" protocol for WebSocket connections. While Coinexpert's .env file shows the correct \"wss://\" configuration, Ash points out that these settings are being overridden somewhere else in their implementation. Ash explains that some browsers might accept the incorrect protocol, explaining why some users can connect while others cannot. Later in the conversation, Coinexpert reports resource loading failures. Ash ultimately notes that since Coinexpert's team has modified the core engine, troubleshooting becomes difficult and suggests testing with an unmodified standard server to isolate whether the issues stem from their modifications.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why can some people join but some cannot? (asked by Coinexpert) A: Some devices/browsers allow using https:// for websocket urls but it's not valid to the specification.

Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Coinexpert | Context: Incorrect WebSocket URL protocol in configuration | Resolution: Identified that while .env file has correct wss:// protocol, it's being overridden elsewhere with https://\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Coinexpert | Context: Resource loading failures and connection issues with modified engine | Resolution: Suggested testing with unmodified standard server to isolate if issues are caused by their modifications\n\n## 4.

Summary\nThe chat segment primarily features MetaRick sharing past experiences exploring various metaverse platforms, including Webaverse and a Japanese web metaverse created by the team behind Vket. MetaRick mentions that this Japanese platform allowed for baking lighting in Unity and exporting .tunes files via \"boombox.\" The conversation reveals that many community members are developing projects privately before sharing them publicly. MetaRick expresses enthusiasm about the talent within the group and mentions plans to create a montage video of past metaverse explorations. There is brief discussion about potentially sharing content on Twitter. The overall sentiment is that community members are building significant projects \"behind doors\" that will eventually be ready for wider audiences once certain prerequisites are in place.\n\n## 2.

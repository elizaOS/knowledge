HiroP raised questions about reconnection logic in v1 and v2, noting that neither version has built-in reconnection handling - users start new sessions upon disconnection. This creates challenges for maintaining state in applications like quizzes where users need to resume from where they left off. Ashxn confirmed that both v1 and v2 lack reconnection logic and suggested that developers need to implement their own state tracking using player IDs. 0mka mentioned limitations of using playerIds, noting they reset with cache clears and don't persist across devices. There was also a brief discussion about implementing screenshot functionality in Hyperfy, with Gert-Jan Akerboom asking about saving camera captures locally, which isn't currently supported in the engine.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: If I understand correctly, v2 doesn't have any reconnection logic so if a user is disconnected they start an entirely new session when they reconnect. Was this handled the same way in v1? (asked by hiroP) A: Yeah both v1 and v2 don't have reconnection logic and if you get disconnected you just reload and start from spawn again. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: I want the camera to go up on the y axis, look down and take a pic of the world and then save that pic locally on my pc. Is this possible? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Haven't added a snapshot function to the engine yet. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: hiroP | Context: Handling user reconnection and state persistence in Hyperfy apps | Resolution: Advised that developers need to track progression on their own servers using player IDs to restore state when users reconnect\nHelper: Agent12 | Helpee: Gert-Jan Akerboom | Context: Taking screenshots in Hyperfy | Resolution: Suggested using Shift + Windows + S for manual screenshots on Windows\nHelper: HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host | Helpee: Ashxn | Context: Causes of disconnections | Resolution: Pointed out that user connection issues can be mistaken for server problems\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nTechnical: Implement custom state tracking for applications requiring persistence across sessions | Description: Store user progress, position, and inventory on external servers using player IDs | Mentioned By: hiroP\nTechnical: Consider alternatives to playerIds for authentication | Description: Set up proper authentication (e.g., Supabase) instead of relying on playerIds which reset with cache clears | Mentioned By: hiroP\nFeature: Add snapshot functionality to the engine | Description: Implement something like world.snapshot(width, height) to capture and save screenshots programmatically | Mentioned By: Ashxn",

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in ðŸª™â”‚hyper Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily features a discussion about development philosophy and token concerns. Ashxn explains their development approach as \"frontloading\" - investing significant effort in building strong foundations early to avoid technical debt later. They contrast this with \"backloading\" (rushing development and accumulating technical debt), noting that the original Hyperfy platform was backloaded, which limited innovation. Community members express concerns about the token's future and lack of clear tokenomics documentation. Ashxn acknowledges these concerns and mentions working on a detailed deck that will explain how the token fits into their vision for a creator and end-user marketplace. They emphasize that blockchain technology is essential for their goal of creating \"truly portable turing complete digital collectables\" which can't be achieved with fiat currency alone. Community members request more transparency about tokenomics and development progress to build confidence.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there an outline of the future tokenomics or a proposal somewhere on the Hyperfy website? (asked by PurpleSack) A: I'm working on a deck that goes into more detail about all of this and we can link to it on the company site. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: PurpleSack | Context: Concern about lack of documented tokenomics and token utility | Resolution: Ashxn explained they're working on a detailed deck about tokenomics and how the token is positioned for their marketplace vision.\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Create a detailed deck explaining tokenomics and token utility | Description: Document how the token fits into the creator/end-user marketplace vision | Mentioned By: Ashxn\nDocumentation: Update website to include tokenomics information | Description: Add clear information about token utility and future plans to build user confidence | Mentioned By: PurpleSack\nDocumentation: Update website to showcase available worlds | Description: Show examples of worlds users can explore to demonstrate progress | Mentioned By: MUDBONE",

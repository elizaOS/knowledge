      "summary": "# Analysis of \"ðŸ’»â”‚developers\" Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around Hyperfy, an open-source metaverse platform with both V1 (proprietary) and V2 (open-source) versions. Key technical topics include:\n\nDevelopers discussed integrating VRM bone position/rotation control using VMC protocol for avatar animation. Ashxn clarified this would require core modifications rather than being feasible as an app.\n\nSignificant work focused on AI agent integration using Eliza framework. Developers shared code for creating AI-powered avatars that respond to users, with detailed implementation of the agent response format including emotes, speech, and actions.\n\nThe team addressed various technical issues including script persistence, asset loading problems (often related to nginx upload size limits), collision setup for 3D models, and fetch API implementation in the sandbox environment.\n\nSeveral developers worked on hosting solutions, with HPrivakos demonstrating a service for easy Hyperfy world deployment with payment integration. The team also discussed the architecture of server vs. client authority in the platform, explaining that Hyperfy supports both models through app.send() and app.on() methods.\n\nRecent updates include a v0.4.0 release with numerous fixes and features, including drag-and-drop VRM support, and improved documentation organization to make getting started easier.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to adjust VRM bone positions/rotations in real time with VMC protocol? (asked by MetaMike) A: Yes, but it's not exposed to app runtime; would need to be a core feature rather than an app (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How should a basic script be formatted? (asked by bitpixi) A: Scripts should use the app.setup format and be saved with Ctrl+S (answered by Saori)\nQ: How do I set up colliders properly? (asked by Valiant) A: Make LogoEmpty node=rigidbody and LogoCollider node=collider (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a profiler to see polycount, drawcalls, materials? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: In V1 there's a performance button at the bottom of the editor window; similar functionality planned for V2 (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is it possible to create a multiplayer game that you can play local at parties? (asked by Rick) A: Unanswered\nQ: How do I play an animation via script in V2? (asked by á²¼) A: GLTF animations not yet supported; need to build a driver to convert threejs GLTF animations into app runtime node structure (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a concept of having \"client authoritative\" objects with unique properties not replicated across the network? (asked by hiroP) A: Yes, you can have full server authority, server simulation, client authority, or hybrid approaches using app.send() and app.on() (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Are we able to make network requests in object scripts? (asked by mâ‚‚) A: Yes, using fetch parameter in script function, but requires npm run build first (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can I add characters to the Eliza server once it's already running? (asked by Lastraum) A: Current architecture doesn't support adding characters at runtime (answered by hiroP)\nQ: Can we add an \"empty\" entity for scripting, or do they always need to be attached to a 3D representation? (asked by Lastraum) A: Use app.create('group') to create an empty container (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

Bitpixi proposed a detailed concept for a virtual post office system for Hyperfy, featuring conversational agents as mail carriers. The system would include letter design choices, delivery notifications, and a small fee structure to prevent spam. Maximus suggested treating the post office like email with on-demand activation rather than requiring agents to \"show up\" in users' worlds. He also proposed using notifications with hyperlinks to the experience. A separate discussion mentioned a wedding-themed virtual space being developed by Bitpixi, who expressed feeling stuck with implementation details like interactive elements and potential NFT gifts. Brief mentions of the deepseek-r1 AI model were made, noting its impressive reasoning capabilities, speed, and cost-effectiveness.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How could the post office system avoid being used for spam? (asked by bitpixi) A: By implementing a small fee, showing sender information before opening, and giving users options to open or trash messages (answered by bitpixi)\nQ: Should the post office require an agent to \"show up\" when a user logs in? (asked by maximus) A: No, it could be treated like email with on-demand activation and notifications to preferred communication methods (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3.

Key technical discussions include the implementation of LOD (Level of Detail) support for 3D models, collider functionality for physics interactions, and agent integration. A significant development is the \"HyperFone\" project by user HowieDuhzit, which creates an in-world phone interface allowing cross-world communication and app installation. The community is excited about Eliza agents being integrated into worlds, with demonstrations showing multiple AI agents interacting with each other. Technical discussions also covered model optimization, VRM avatar compatibility, and server-side execution for secure multiplayer experiences. The team clarified that V2 isn't fully ready for non-technical builders yet but is progressing rapidly with features like LOD support, colliders, and agent integration being implemented.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around Hyperfy's token price movements during a volatile market period dominated by Trump-related token launches. The token experienced significant price swings, dropping to around $0.03-0.04 before showing signs of recovery. Team members, particularly Saori and Ashxn, provided insights about Hyperfy's technical capabilities, emphasizing its open-source nature and potential as a powerful platform for 3D web experiences. The team described Hyperfy as a \"multiplayer infinite backrooms with environment recognition and custom behavior permissionless integration with any framework\" rather than just a metaverse. They mentioned the integration of the Eliza AI framework and discussed potential use cases. There were also discussions about the circulating supply API endpoint and Jupiter airdrop claims. Throughout the volatility, community members maintained optimism about Hyperfy's long-term potential despite short-term market distractions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What tokenomics does HyperFi have? For example, how do you use HyperFi tokens?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ§Šâ”‚3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on 3D design tools and optimizations for Hyperfy's V2 platform. A significant development was scoe's creation of a Blender plugin for making Collider Boxes, shared via GitHub. Ashxn proposed enhancements to this plugin to automate reading/writing custom properties without manual setup, offering to fund its development. The discussion evolved into potential UI improvements and automatic checkbox selection in the GLTF exporter. Other technical topics included bloom processing improvements in V2, collision editing techniques inspired by Unreal Engine, and optimization strategies like GPU instancing for duplicated objects. Ashxn shared that V2 automatically GPU instances GLB files and optimizes linked duplicates (cmd+D in Blender) into shared draw calls. The conversation also touched on LOD configuration in Blender and frustum culling behavior.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Where should I start to learn how to build on V2? (asked by OttisOts) A: The developers channel has pinned resources like HackMD or Docs (answered by TheMattEmpire)\nQ: How does mesh reuse/kitbashing work in V2? (asked by scoe) A: If you drop a GLB into a V2 world, they're automatically GPU instanced; duplicating objects results in one draw call (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is frustum culling always applied in V2? (asked by maximus) A: Frustum culling isn't always true and depends on different factors (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

Saori advises against purchasing v1 worlds as they are considered obsolete (\"ded\"), though they still allow building on the old platform. V2 is currently being developed and deployed, with some community members offering hosting services. The future plan includes a SaaS-like model where users can pay for worlds without requiring cryptocurrency or NFT purchases. There's also a brief discussion about token image updates on Jup (likely Jupiter, a Solana DEX), where metadata was updated but the image change requires time to propagate.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there any point in buying more v1 worlds now or should I wait for v2? Also how will v2 roll out? (asked by Jay_kaying) A: Don't buy v1 as they're obsolete. V2 is rolling out now, being built live with some people making hosting services. (answered by Saori)\nQ: I don't understand what format v2 will be. Is it going to be an NFT like the v1 or like a software program? (asked by Jay_kaying) A: Currently developers can run it locally and self-host, non-developers can pay community members to host. Eventually there will be a platform where anyone can pay for a world using a regular SaaS pricing model, not NFT pricing. (answered by Saori)\nQ: Interesting, so it'd be like a one time fee per world? (asked by Jay_kaying) A: Not really sure to be honest. (answered by Saori)\nQ: Did we request that for change? (asked by MUDBONE) A: Yes. (answered by Saori)\n\n## 3.

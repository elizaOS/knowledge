Users inquire about accessing and using the AI features that have been teased by Ash. It's revealed that the functionality exists in the dev branch and requires API keys to function. The AI can generate 3D assets using primitives that have been highly optimized. The system uses a well-crafted prompt that teaches the AI about Hyperfy's architecture. Users mention that while fast version models produce disappointing results, GPT-5 on medium settings delivers impressive, sometimes \"mindblowing\" results. There's also mention of a public world at vibe.hyperfy.xyz, though AI generation is temporarily disabled. The conversation indicates that various LLM models can be used with the system, with configuration details available in the .env.example file in the world folder.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to play with the AI asset creation stuff Ash keeps teasing? What's powering it? (asked by cwe) A: It's on the dev branch. Just plop in your API keys (answered by Dhin)\nQ: API keys for what? Any LLM? (asked by cwe) A: Check .env.example in world folder (answered by Valiant)\nQ: And they're able to generate 3D assets? How does that work? (asked by cwe) A: They build using primitives which are now highly optimized and ash has built a really good system prompt that teaches them all about the hyperfy architecture. (answered by Shiffty)\nQ: Is that in the OS repo too? (asked by cwe) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of ðŸ§Šâ”‚3d-design Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical aspects of 3D asset handling in Hyperfy. TheMattEmpire inquired about .hyp file capabilities, learning from ash that each .hyp file contains one GLB plus script and metadata, not multiple GLBs. The conversation then shifted to texture techniques, specifically texture splatting and vertex colors for GLB files. TheMattEmpire demonstrated successful implementation of vertex colors but sought more advanced texture splatting methods. Ash confirmed that the engine supports texture splatting (as seen on island.hyperfy.xyz) but noted the workflow is complex due to GLB format limitations requiring workarounds. TheMattEmpire also showcased modular asset development, appreciating the ability to update all assets simultaneously. Brief mentions of LOD (Level of Detail) capabilities were made by Dhin, suggesting efficient optimization techniques are available in the platform.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can a hyp file have multiple .glb assets in it? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Every hyp is one glb + script + metadata (answered by ash)\nQ: Has anyone had any luck with texture splatting or vertex colors with GLBs? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: The engine supports it, this is how the terrain was done on island.hyperfy.xyz but the workflow is complex (answered by ash)\nQ: Is there any way to get texture splatting or having different materials blend according to the vertex colors, in a GLB? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Partially answered - ash confirmed it's possible but complex, requiring workarounds\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: TheMattEmpire | Context: Understanding .hyp file structure and limitations | Resolution: Clarified that each .hyp file contains one GLB plus script and metadata\nHelper: ash | Helpee: TheMattEmpire | Context: Implementing texture splatting in GLB files | Resolution: Confirmed it's possible but complex, offered to share information but later noted it was too finnicky without proper documentation\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Document the complex workflow for texture splatting in GLB files | Description: Create documentation for the workarounds needed to implement texture splatting | Mentioned By: ash\nDocumentation: Create documentation for texture splatting workflow | Description: TheMattEmpire offered to help document the process in his Hyperfy section | Mentioned By: TheMattEmpire\nTechnical: Explore vertex colors as an alternative to texture splatting | Description: Continue developing the vertex color approach that was demonstrated to work | Mentioned By: TheMattEmpire\nTechnical: Investigate LOD (Level of Detail) implementation | Description: Explore the \"1 shot LOD\" capability mentioned | Mentioned By: Dhin",

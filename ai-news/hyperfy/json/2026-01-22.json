Summary:\nThe discussion primarily revolves around Hyperfy's transition from v1 to v2, with a focus on onboarding challenges for new users. Community members discussed the need for better entry points for non-technical users to start building in Hyperfy. Several solutions were proposed, including creating a starter pack with pre-installed apps from v1, developing a more informative homepage, and providing easier hosting options. There was mention of Hyperball, a game that could potentially be added to worlds.

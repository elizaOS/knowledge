CheddarQueso shared a link to a Twitter post, which appears to be about an AI-related development. Ash commented that similar approaches were seen previously but seemed to hit limitations, suggesting that Multi-Command Processing (MCP) development has slowed. They speculated that new approaches might emerge, particularly more specialized integrations with Blender (3D modeling software). Another user, .hyp shaman, mentioned that \"skills\" are becoming the new trend in AI development and shared a link to skillsmp.com. The conversation concludes with BallisticBanana tagging a user and Agent12 asking about a working vehicle for V2 (likely referring to a model or implementation).\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Anyone got a Working Vehicle for V2? (asked by Agent12) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nNo significant help interactions were present in this chat segment.\n\n## 4. Action Items\nFeature: Explore new approaches beyond MCP for AI tools, possibly direct Blender integrations | Mentioned By: ash\nFeature: Investigate \"skills\" as a new paradigm for AI capabilities | Mentioned By: .hyp shaman\nTechnical: Find or develop a working vehicle for V2 | Mentioned By: Agent12",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment revolves around a user (FrankyLimon) seeking documentation for developing custom worlds in Hyperfy. FrankyLimon expresses frustration about the state of documentation, noting that a year ago the docs were being migrated due to syntax reworking. They initially reference an older documentation URL (docs.hyperfy.io) and ask if it's still current. Gert-Jan Akerboom clarifies that the linked documentation is for V1, and provides a link to V2 documentation (docs.hyperfy.xyz). FrankyLimon expresses disappointment, questioning if cloning the \"myworld\" repository is the only way to start a new world. They criticize the documentation for focusing on drag-and-drop functionality rather than developer information. Another user (Dhin) suggests checking the docs folder in the GitHub repository, specifically pointing to scripting documentation that might be helpful.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where is the best place to find docs for coding a custom world using Hyperfy? (asked by FrankyLimon) A: The V2 documentation is at https://docs.hyperfy.xyz/ (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: Is the page https://docs.hyperfy.io/developers/overview still up to date? (asked by FrankyLimon) A: That's V1, you want V2 https://docs.hyperfy.xyz/ (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: Do I have to clone the myworld repo? Is there no other way to begin a new world? (asked by FrankyLimon) A: The GitHub has a docs folder with scripting information: https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy/tree/main/docs (answered by Dhin)\nQ: Is Hyperfy all coded in three.js now? (asked by FrankyLimon) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Gert-Jan Akerboom | Helpee: FrankyLimon | Context: Seeking current Hyperfy documentation | Resolution: Provided link to V2 documentation (docs.hyperfy.xyz)\nHelper: Dhin | Helpee: FrankyLimon | Context: Looking for developer documentation for Hyperfy | Resolution: Directed to GitHub docs folder with scripting information\n\n## 4. Action Items\nDocumentation: Update or improve developer-focused documentation for Hyperfy | Mentioned By: FrankyLimon\nDocumentation: Clarify the process for starting a new Hyperfy world without cloning repositories | Mentioned By: FrankyLimon\nDocumentation: Provide information about the current technology stack (e.g., three.js usage) | Mentioned By: FrankyLimon",

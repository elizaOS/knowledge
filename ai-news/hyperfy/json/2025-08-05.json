      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on Hyperfy app development, covering client-server architecture, mesh optimization, and UI improvements. A key technical insight was the explanation of how scripts execute on both server and client sides, with methods to differentiate execution context using `world.isClient` and `world.isServer` checks. The chat revealed that server-side code continues running even when no users are connected, enabling persistent world simulations. \n\nMesh optimization was discussed regarding a confetti popper app where multiple instances were sharing states unintentionally. The solution involved unlinking meshes using `mesh.linked = false` to allow individual state management. UI improvements were highlighted with upcoming features including a new color picker, primitive shapes with textures, and cursor state changes for interactive objects.\n\nOther topics included S3 integration, local app development for better version control, and potential AI integration for generating apps through text prompts. The community demonstrated collaborative problem-solving, with experienced members providing code snippets and explanations to help newer developers optimize their applications.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can the app still be updating if no one is in the world? (asked by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz) A: Code runs on both the server and the clients, the server is always running so you can have things like plants growing over time (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way for the server to know when a client has left and stop doing something? (asked by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz) A: Yes, using world.on('leave', e => {}) event handler on the server (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Why are states shared across multiple instances of the same app? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Duplicated apps share the same materials for optimization; you need to unlink them with mesh.linked = false (answered by .hyp shaman and Valiant)\nQ: Will it be possible to animate the cursor? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about Hyperfy's role in relation to emerging technologies like holograms and AI-generated content. A user named 3on_ inquired about Hyperfy's relevance in a world with hologram technology, to which Natefrog (not a team member) responded that Hyperfy builds the infrastructure layer including servers, networking, physics, social systems, and creator tools, while holograms are simply another display technology. The conversation also touched on Google's Genie 3 AI model for world generation, with users discussing its capabilities for real-time video generation and collision detection, though noting it doesn't create actual 3D worlds that can be exported as GLB files. There was brief mention of NFTs potentially making a comeback. The chat concluded with a casual discussion about top-level domains (TLDs) and their costs, with Ashxn mentioning it costs around $200,000 to buy a TLD.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the role of hyperfy in a world where holograms are a reality? (asked by 3on_) A: Hyperfy is building the infrastructure layer - the servers, networking, physics, social systems, and creator tools. Holograms are just another display technology. (answered by Natefrog)\nQ: What machines is this [Genie 3] running on? (asked by vox) A: Very very big ones...that Google owns (answered by hiroP)\nQ: When will Hyperfy have this [AI-generated content]? (asked by Z - MetaDJ) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Natefrog | Helpee: 3on_ | Context: Understanding Hyperfy's role in relation to hologram technology | Resolution: Explained that Hyperfy builds infrastructure while holograms are just display technology, comparing it to how Netflix became more valuable with smart TVs\nHelper: HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host | Helpee: vox | Context: Clarifying capabilities of Google's Genie 3 AI model | Resolution: Explained it's \"only\" real-time video generation, not actually generating 3D worlds that can be downloaded as GLB files\n\n## 4.

The conversation primarily consists of brief comments about tweets being shared and a short exchange about the metaverse concept. Two users (Xukonth and Z - MetaDJ) discuss the perception of the metaverse, with Xukonth stating it's a \"dead narrative\" that people avoid, while also asserting that \"Hyperfy is a versatile project\" that goes beyond just the metaverse concept. Z - MetaDJ partially agrees but suggests that in some ways \"we already live in the Metaverse\" and mentions having \"big thoughts about the scope of the Metaverse.\" No technical problems were solved, no implementations were discussed, and no concrete decisions were made in this chat segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the metaverse a viable concept? (asked by Xukonth) A: It's currently perceived negatively, but may evolve like the internet and social media did (answered by Z - MetaDJ)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion focused on 3D model optimization and light/shadow handling in Hyperfy environments. Valiant shared optimization techniques using gltf.report and gltf-compressor for VRAM and texture compression. The main technical conversation centered on 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓's challenge with windows not casting shadows while allowing light through. Multiple solutions were proposed: vox suggested flipping normals, though this affected collision properties. Ashxn later provided a more elegant solution by disabling both castShadows and receiveShadows properties through a Blender plugin. The conversation also touched on positioning precision limitations in the model app, where only tenths-level precision is available when thousandths are needed for exact window placement. The chat revealed that some users weren't aware of recent features like auto-collision in the model app (Hypertools).\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does anyone know how to make windows not cast a shadow and allow light through in world? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: Disable castShadows and receiveShadows properties using the Hyperfy Blender plugin (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I get that new hyperfy plugin? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: It's in the github repo: https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy/blob/dev/docs/extras/blender-addon.py (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

BallisticBanana encountered problems during an update process following Roustan's installation guide with fly.io, receiving an error message about needing to clear a tree despite having no tree to clear. Ash suggested this was likely caused by pulling the latest version while having local changes, creating a merge conflict situation. Several users provided Git command suggestions to resolve this, including using `git pull --rebase`, `git stash`, and `git stash apply`. Later in the conversation, .hyp shaman shared a separate issue where their world wouldn't open after a specific update, despite normal server logs, and shared their Docker compose configuration. Ash offered to help by requesting the world files for further investigation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I fix Git conflicts when updating Hyperfy? (asked by BallisticBanana) A: Use \"git stash\" to save local changes, then \"git pull --rebase\", and \"git stash apply\" to reapply your changes (answered by Shiffty)\nQ: What's the best practice for using fly.io with Hyperfy? (asked by .hyp shaman) A: Make a fork first and clone that to avoid accidentally trying to contribute (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: Why won't my world open after an update?

Lastraum mentioned updating an app to run only on the client side. Gert-Jan Akerboom shared a \"Confetti Popper\" and later demonstrated cursor change functionality when hovering over a mesh. Valiant encountered an issue with a file type, noting it needed a \".hyp\" extension to work properly. The conversation is primarily sharing work rather than in-depth technical discussion.\n\n## 2.

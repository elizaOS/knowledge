      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe conversation primarily revolves around a data migration effort from Hyperfy v1 to v2. Jin is developing a converter tool that transforms v1 world data into v2-compatible format. The tool outputs a structured folder containing both the original v1 data and the converted v2 files, with a Python script included to facilitate the conversion process. The converter creates a package with v2 format files (db.sqlite, collections, assets), the original v1 data (JSON and assets), a README, manifest, and the converter script itself. Jin notes the converted v2 files add approximately 270kb per world, which is minimal compared to overall archive size. There's also discussion about Hyperfy's VRM implementation for in-world avatar changing, and porting sky presets. Jin expresses concern about how Hyperfy files (.hyp) are shared on Discord and GitHub as binary files, which creates issues for LLM understanding and security.\n\n## 2.

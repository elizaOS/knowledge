      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy, a metaverse platform that recently launched its token ($HYPER) and is transitioning from v1 to v2. The community discussed several key technical aspects of the platform. Hyperfy v2 has been open-sourced on GitHub, allowing developers to build and host their own worlds. A significant technical advantage highlighted is that Hyperfy worlds can be accessed directly through browsers without downloads or wallet connections, making it highly accessible. The platform supports VR and is device-agnostic, working on any device that can handle HTTP requests. \n\nThe team held a community call where they discussed upcoming features including AI agent integration with Eliza, which will allow AI characters to roam worlds and interact with users. The v2 platform will include in-browser coding capabilities, making development more streamlined. Physics and maps that scale were also mentioned as technical features. The platform is designed to be lightweight enough that \"v2 runs on a potato\" while still supporting complex interactions.\n\nToken-related discussions revealed that unclaimed airdrop tokens (for v1 NFT holders and eligible ai16z token holders) will be burned after the January 12th registration deadline. The DAO controls 30% of the token supply, which will be used for community-voted initiatives, while founder allocations (15%) are vested over 3 years.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I claim the eligible tokens? (asked by multiple users) A: This is a 3-step process: (1) Go to register your ETH and SOL address on Hyperfy.io/airdrop (2) You must wait 24 hours for registrations to be saved (3) Go to Hyperfy.xyz/claim to connect SOL wallet eligible for claim (answered by maximus)\nQ: Will v1 be converted to v2 worlds? (asked by multiple users) A: No, the ETH NFT v1 worlds will remain in Hyperfy.io and will not have any utility for v2 Hyperfy (answered by maximus)\nQ: How can I get started using v2, is there documentation? (asked by multiple users) A: See the announcement on X and documentation at https://hackmd.io/@metamike/hyperfy-communal-note-pool and Git Repo at https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy (answered by maximus)\nQ: What is the Utility of the token? (asked by multiple users) A: Read the latest information on token utility at https://token.hyperfy.xyz/ and subscribe to Hyperfy on X for new announcements (answered by maximus)\nQ: Why is there a wallet with 30% allocation? (asked by Filbert) A: That's the DAO fund wallet, no votes to use the funds have been planned yet (answered by maximus)\nQ: When will $Hyper registration claims stop, what happens to those tokens? (asked by multiple users) A: New registrations will no longer be accepted after January 12; remaining tokens will be burned (answered by maximus)\nQ: Is the liquidity pool locked? (asked by multiple users) A: Yes (answered by maximus)\nQ: What allocation did founders get? (asked by frank_grimes_sr) A: They have a 15% allocation vested over 3 years (answered by maximus)\nQ: How do I prevent people posting illegal stuff in worlds? (asked by Uuuuuuuuu) A: For a while it'll just be self hosted so they'd be liable for publishing illegal content (answered by Saori)\nQ: Is VR support currently a thing on hyperfy? (asked by vincentskele) A: Yes, 100% VR supported. It is WILD how device agnostic hyperfy is (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🐞│issues Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around airdrop claim issues and Hyperfy V2 technical discussions. Many users reported being unable to claim their airdrops due to wallet eligibility issues, with the common error message \"wallet is not eligible.\" The team explained they're processing registrations in batches, causing delays for users who registered their Solana wallets. Maximus provided regular updates, explaining that wallet signature is required for registration and that changing SOL addresses creates complications in the automated process. \n\nOn the technical side, discussions focused on Hyperfy V2 implementation issues. Users like vincentrobo encountered mouse control problems in the local development environment, with ash and Saori explaining the differences between V1 (hyperfy.io) and V2 (localhost) controls. V2 requires holding right-click to look around, unlike V1 which automatically locks the pointer. The team also addressed world design capabilities, explaining that users can drag-and-drop .glb files but noted that scripting isn't yet implemented. MetaMike reported an issue with mesh placement constraints when the base mesh is deleted, with ash suggesting using a transparent ground mesh to maintain raycasting functionality.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why am I getting \"wallet is not eligible\" when trying to claim the airdrop? (asked by multiple users) A: Your registration needs to be processed in a batch, which takes time. Make sure you've registered correctly with a checkmark next to your SOL address. (answered by maximus)\nQ: How do I fix mouse control issues in the local development environment? (asked by vincentrobo) A: In V2 (localhost), you need to hold right-click to look around, unlike V1 which automatically locks the pointer. (answered by Saori and ash)\nQ: How do I design a world in Hyperfy V2? (asked by vincentrobo) A: You can drag and drop .glb files and move things around. (answered by Saori)\nQ: Can I claim the airdrop on Phantom mobile? (asked by heavydev) A: No, you need to do it on PC or laptop. (answered by VTATV and maximus)\nQ: Why can't I connect to my world with my bitfiend.eth wallet? (asked by BitFiend) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion focused on licensing implications for the Hyperfy v2 engine, which uses GPL-3. Ash clarified that while the engine's code falls under GPL-3 requirements (meaning modifications to the engine must remain open-source), apps added via the UI interface are not subject to the same license restrictions. The GPL-3 license was chosen specifically to ensure that significant improvements to the codebase would benefit the entire community rather than allowing forks to profit from improvements without sharing them back. Ash mentioned they would only enforce the license rights if someone was making substantial profit from a fork with valuable improvements that should have been contributed back to the main repository through pull requests.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When someone mods this engine, the result has to stay open-source, right? However, Apps which can be added via the UI interface, those can remain closed-source, if required? (asked by Ozymandias) A: Under GPL 3, which Hyperfy v2 engine is, that seems correct. (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host) / license doesn't apply to apps, those aren't part of the codebase the license is for. (answered by ash)\nQ: Why was GPL-3 chosen as the license? (implied question) A: The main reason it has this license is to deter people from making profit off a fork that has nice improvements that should have been PR'd back into our repo. (answered by ash)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Ozymandias | Context: Clarification about GPL-3 license implications for Hyperfy v2 engine and apps | Resolution: Explained that apps aren't subject to the GPL-3 license, only modifications to the engine itself, and detailed the reasoning behind using GPL-3.\nHelper: HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host | Helpee: Ozymandias | Context: Initial question about licensing requirements | Resolution: Provided initial confirmation that GPL-3 requires engine mods to be open-source while apps can remain closed-source.\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: None explicitly mentioned\nDocumentation: Consider creating clear documentation about licensing implications for engine modifications vs. apps | Mentioned By: Implied from Ozymandias' question\nFeature: None explicitly mentioned",

Ash clarified that while the engine's code falls under GPL-3 requirements (meaning modifications to the engine must remain open-source), apps added via the UI interface are not subject to the same license restrictions. Ash explained that GPL-3 is designed to ensure that significant improvements to the codebase benefit the entire community, not just individual forkers. The license serves primarily to prevent profit-making from forked versions with substantial improvements that should have been contributed back to the main repository. Ash noted they would only enforce these rights in cases where someone was making significant profit from a fork with valuable improvements, and expressed openness to incorporating good features developed by the community.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When someone mods this engine, the result has to stay open-source, right? However, Apps which can be added via the UI interface, those can remain closed-source, if required? (asked by Ozymandias) A: Under GPL 3, which Hyperfy v2 engine is, that seems correct. (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host) / license doesn't apply to apps, those aren't part of the codebase the license is for. (answered by ash)\nQ: What's the main reason for using GPL-3 license? (implied question) A: The main reason it has this license is to deter people from making profit off a fork that has nice improvements that should have been PR'd back into our repo.

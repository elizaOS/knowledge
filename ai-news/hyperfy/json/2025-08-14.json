      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on development updates and technical discussions around various Hyperfy projects. Valiant shared progress on a race system with persistent storage for leaderboards, inviting others to test it. Lastraum showcased \"Tile Dash,\" a multiplayer game with mobile compatibility, and later added token rewards. There were significant discussions about performance optimization, with .hyp shaman noting high resource usage on a 5060 Ti GPU. Ash investigated and found the app running at 30+ms in Angzaar world versus 5ms in a blank world. Lastraum removed 3D models (approximately 100MB) to improve performance. The chat also covered technical limitations in DCL (Decentraland) compared to Hyperfy, particularly regarding physics implementation. Lastraum explained their workaround using server-simulated physics with client-side colliders. Other topics included animation issues with cloned skinned meshes, the need for a dedicated world links channel, and Marcel sharing AI-generated audio tutorials.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does Lastraum implement physics in DCL without native physics support? (asked by ash) A: Server simulated physics with client-side colliders. The client-side collider blocks players from going through objects while the server tracks player positions and ball forces using Colyseus for WebSocket connections. (answered by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz)\nQ: Why is Tile Dash running sub 30FPS on a 5060 Ti? (asked by .hyp shaman) A: The performance issues were related to numerous 3D models ported from DCL consuming resources. Removing approximately 100MB of models resolved the issue. (answered by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz and ash)\nQ: Are NLA tracks supported in Hyperfy? (asked by .hyp shaman) A: No, they are not currently supported. (answered by Valiant)\nQ: Why are only 1/3 of skinned mesh clones playing animations with \"bones are missing\" errors? (asked by .hyp shaman) A: Unanswered (but ash acknowledged receiving the GLB file to investigate)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around community dynamics and tensions within the Hyperfy project, particularly regarding a user named Saori who appears to have left the community but continues to criticize the project. Ash (likely the project lead) expresses frustration about Saori's criticism while maintaining confidence in Hyperfy's direction and potential. Community members show support for Ash and the project's vision despite the drama.\n\nOn the technical side, there's brief mention of a game called \"Tile Dash\" developed by Lastraum, which includes leaderboard functionality and integration with \"The Forge\" for saving progress and earning LSC tokens. Ash tested the game and provided feedback about difficulty issues, particularly with the first level and game-over scenarios. There's also a brief mention of asset generation tools, though without detailed technical discussion.\n\nThe conversation reflects a project that's continuing development while managing community expectations and dealing with criticism from former contributors.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there anyone who can inform us more clearly about Saori's comments on token management? (asked by Saracismo) A: Unanswered\nQ: What were those [issues Saori has with the project]? (asked by Shiffty) A: Unanswered\nQ: Are Saori's tokens locked? (asked by Saracismo) A: Ash indicated this isn't a major concern as Saori \"could have top blasted his huge NFT airdrop and didn't\" (answered by ash)\nQ: Has anyone tried this [linked tool] to generate assets? (asked by rando1337) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

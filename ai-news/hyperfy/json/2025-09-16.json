      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on technical implementation questions for Hyperfy worlds. Key discussions included setting up teleportation portals, voice chat integration via LiveKit, AI generation capabilities, and data storage options. Several users sought help with specific features, particularly Nicola Bertoglio who needed assistance with portals and voice chat. Ash provided information about AI generation being available on the dev branch with environment variables for AI integration. There was clarification about admin roles and the \"Free Build\" option that appears after setting an admin code. The conversation also touched on local storage limitations, with Gh0stt inquiring about browser-side storage for cookies that would be user-controlled rather than world-stored data.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to input text in hyp instead of chat box? (asked by 太阳) A: Unanswered\nQ: How do I add the voice chat to my space? (asked by Nicola Bertoglio) A: You need to setup a LiveKit server yourself or use the LiveKit cloud service. Set the parameters in the .env file. (answered by mrtzhckr)\nQ: Is there a new process for admin public toggle for people in world? (asked by 0mka) A: Bottom of the world settings menu is a Free Build option. If you haven't set an admin code then everyone is a builder anyway. (answered by ash)\nQ: Is there a reason we cant access the localStore directly? (asked by Gh0stt) A: Scripts are sandboxed, you can't access the window object. (answered by smickelbeard)\n\n## 3.

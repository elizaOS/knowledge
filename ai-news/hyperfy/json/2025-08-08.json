      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on AI-assisted development for Hyperfy, particularly using LLMs to generate code for interactive 3D environments. Several developers shared experiments with \"vibe coding\" - using AI to generate code from natural language prompts. They discussed the tradeoffs between browser-based prompting versus using specialized tools like Cursor, with browser-based approaches being faster for simple tasks. Performance optimization was a significant topic, with Ashxn mentioning improvements to shape instancing. The chat revealed that Hyperfy's platform now runs well even on older mobile devices (Samsung S9) after recent optimizations. Developers shared examples of AI-generated 3D environments including obstacle courses, stadiums, and platform games, discussing iterative approaches to building complex scenes by developing them section by section. There were also technical discussions about detecting mobile devices and accessing screen dimensions, with Ashxn promising to add a world.device.isTouch property to help with responsive design.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I access the AI prim builder? (asked by maximus) A: You need to be on the latest dev branch and prompt AI to get code (answered by MetaMike and Valiant)\nQ: What is the forward/up jump distance for avatars? (asked by Valiant) A: Jump height is ~1.5m and jump distance while running is around 5m (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to detect mobile for resizing UI? (asked by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz) A: control.screen.width and control.screen.height exist, and world.device.isTouch will be added soon (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

There are mentions of Hyperfy being used to create virtual Burning Man experiences, with references to previous implementations on OnCyber platform. A user named Fibelius shared their experience with a VIpeIO/OnCyber metaverse version of Burning Man, expressing hope that someone might create something similar using Hyperfy. They also mentioned the ability to visit the virtual space, though it was empty at the time. Another user (Enryt) briefly mentioned successfully drag-and-dropping a CloneX GLB file, suggesting some level of 3D model compatibility within Hyperfy. The chat also contains general greetings and non-technical conversation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When will this project be done? (asked by Zdeff) A: \"When fortnite is done\" (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Has anyone created a Burning Man experience in Hyperfy? (implied by Fibelius) A: \"has a pretty sweet burning man world somewhere in hyperfy\" (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: Fibelius | Context: Looking for Burning Man experiences in Hyperfy | Resolution: Ashxn pointed out that user @213767993153290250 has created a Burning Man world in Hyperfy\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Description: Explore compatibility with GLB files for 3D models like CloneX | Mentioned By: Enryt\nFeature: Description: Create a Burning Man-inspired experience in Hyperfy similar to previous OnCyber implementation | Mentioned By: Fibelius",

User Enryt reported that edit gizmos were not visible. Maximus suggested pressing keys 1, 2, or 3 to make them appear. Enryt clarified that the gizmos couldn't be selected at all, though modifiers were still accessible through the menu. Enryt mentioned they were using the development branch b7ca8f9169 from June 8, 2025.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I make edit gizmos appear?

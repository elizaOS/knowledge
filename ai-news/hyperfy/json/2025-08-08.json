Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on AI-assisted development for Hyperfy, particularly using LLMs to generate code for interactive 3D environments. Users experimented with different approaches to \"vibe coding\" - using AI to generate code for games and interactive elements. Several members shared examples of AI-generated platform games, stadiums, and obstacle courses. \n\nKey technical points included:\n- Comparing browser-based AI prompting versus code-specific tools like Cursor/Claude, with the observation that browser-based prompting is faster for simple tasks\n- Discussion of a potential memory leak in certain code implementations\n- Performance improvements for shape instancing\n- Challenges with AI hallucinating non-existent methods (like player.velocity.y)\n- Iterative approach to building complex structures by generating code section by section\n- Discussion about detecting mobile devices for responsive UI design\n- A bug identified with the control.screen functionality\n\nThe conversation revealed a workflow where developers prompt AI models to generate code snippets, then integrate or modify them for Hyperfy environments, with varying degrees of success depending on the model used and approach taken.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I access the AI prim builder? (asked by maximus) A: You need to be on the latest dev branch and prompt AI to get code (answered by MetaMike and Valiant)\nQ: What is the forward/up jump distance for avatars? (asked by Valiant) A: Jump height is ~1.5m and jump distance while running is around 5m (guessing) (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to detect mobile for resizing UI? (asked by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz) A: control.screen.width and control.screen.height exist. Will add world.device.isTouch soon (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: maximus | Context: AI-generated code with hallucinated methods | Resolution: Identified that .velocity doesn't exist and suggested commenting out those 3 lines to make it run\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz | Context: Error when trying to use control.screen for mobile detection | Resolution: Acknowledged it's a bug that needs fixing, promised to check and fix it\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Fix bug with control.screen functionality causing TypeError | Description: \"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'bind')\" error when using app.control() | Mentioned By: Ashxn\nFeature: Add world.device.isTouch for mobile detection | Description: Create a proper way to detect touch devices for responsive UI | Mentioned By: Ashxn\nTechnical: Address potential memory leak | Description: Investigate memory issues in circular code execution | Mentioned By: peezy\nDocumentation: Document jump height and distance parameters | Description: Formalize the approximate values for avatar movement capabilities | Mentioned By: Ashxn\nTechnical: Improve shape instancing for better performance | Description: More aggressive instancing of shapes has been implemented | Mentioned By: Ashxn",

Most interactions are casual, with users asking when the project will be completed (with humorous responses) and sharing content about metaverse experiences. One user (Fibelius) shared reflections about a Burning Man metaverse experience on OnCyber platform, expressing hope that a similar concept could be developed using Hyperfy. They described it as their \"biggest metaverse experience ever\" and shared links to related content. The conversation contains no substantive technical discussions, problem-solving, or concrete implementations. The chat primarily consists of casual greetings, brief exchanges, and one user's nostalgic sharing about metaverse experiences.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When wil this project be donev (asked by Zdeff) A: When fortnite is done (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: when wil time be donev (asked by .hyp shaman) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nNo significant help interactions were present in this chat segment.\n\n## 4. Action Items\nFeature: Consider developing a Burning Man-inspired metaverse experience | Description: Create a community-driven metaverse space similar to the VIpeIO/OnCyber Burning Man experience | Mentioned By: Fibelius",

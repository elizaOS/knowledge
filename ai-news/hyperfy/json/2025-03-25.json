          "text": "### FAQ\n- **How do I detect if an entity is inside a hitbox?** Use a sphere trigger and tag the rigidbody (`mob:1`).\n- **Can I add a rigidbody in code instead of Blender?** Yes, use `app.create('rigidbody', { type: 'kinematic', tag: 'mob:1' })`.\n- **How do I pass user auth data to Hyperfy?** Use an external API with session cookies.\n- **Can Hyperfy apps read URL query params?** Not yet, but a PR could add `world.getQueryParams()`.\n- **Why is my raycast tag always null?** The tag must be on the rigidbody, not the collider.\n- **How do I update a Fly.io deployment without losing data?** Fly.io preserves files, so just redeploy.",

Ash confirmed he is the main developer of Hyperfy, mentioning they have \"runway for years\" and expressing excitement about future developments. There was a brief mention of a butterfly model (V5) with improvements to prevent flying under the ground plane. Community members shared logo files and branding resources, with 0mka updating a branding page with logo options. A community survey was distributed by maximus, though it had some form field issues that were later fixed. There was a question about GIFs impacting performance in V1 and converting them to UV scroll GLBs. The chat also included token-related discussions, with references to $HYPER price movements and wallet information. Ash mentioned reaching out to Nikita Bier, who recently joined Solana to help scale applications.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is hyperfy over?

      "summary": "# Analysis of \"💻│developers\" Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around Hyperfy development, focusing on UI updates, collision detection, and various technical implementations. A significant UI update was introduced by ash, featuring a more streamlined interface with transparent code panes and improved organization. Developers discussed collision detection extensively, with ash providing examples of rigidbody contacts, tags, and triggers. ~/drdoge.eth showcased a nuclear explosion effect implementation using UI panels that fade in and out. Developers also worked on mob interaction systems, with peezy attempting to implement hit detection for mobs using rigidbodies and colliders. Several community members expressed frustration with documentation gaps, particularly regarding available functions and properties of core objects like world, app, and control. The channel also featured discussions about cross-app communication, raycasting, and model importing from Blender with proper collision settings.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do you white out the whole world except the player? (asked by ash) A: It makes a giant UI panel that fades in and out (answered by ~/drdoge.eth)\nQ: How to detect that an entity is inside a hitbox? (asked by peezy) A: Add a rigidbody and collider to the mob with a specific tag, then check for that tag when the sword hits it (answered by ash)\nQ: How to make a toggle button in the UI? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Use a switch component (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: Where do I look to understand functions available to world, app, control, etc? (asked by mattimus) A: Look at the ref section and the core/extras files in the codebase (answered by general hyper)\nQ: How do you make a collider work properly with a concave mesh? (asked by general hyper) A: Turn off convex for a mesh with that shape (answered by ash)\nQ: Do colliders have to be named just \"collider\" or will \"collider_name_etc\" also be recognized? (asked by general hyper) A: Node can be named anything (answered by Shiffty)\nQ: Can I redirect the user to a link when the user clicks on something? (asked by McCoder) A: Use world.open() function which is available in the dev branch (answered by 0mka)\nQ: How do I later update a fly.io deployment without overwriting world changes? (asked by Mugenomics) A: It won't overwrite your files, the [[mounts]] section in fly.toml controls this (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 and smickelbeard)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on colliders in Blender for Hyperfy models. Users debated between using Hyperfy tools versus manual methods, with general hyper seeking documentation on manual collider application. Mattimus shared a HackMD link with instructions. Issues with Hyperfy tools were mentioned, including unwanted 90-degree rotations of models, which 0mka suggested might be a compensation for previously backward-facing imported models. The conversation later shifted to material sides in Blender exports, with ash clarifying that materials can be either single or double-sided based on Blender settings. TheMattEmpire had questions about the default behavior and how to control this in Blender 4.3, particularly for GLB exports. Ash provided visual examples showing blue for double-sided and red for single-sided materials, noting that in Blender 4.4 this is controlled via the \"Backface Culling > Camera option.\" TheMattEmpire eventually resolved their confusion about material sides in their portal asset.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Wasn't there a doc on how to apply colliders in Blender? (asked by general hyper) A: https://hackmd.io/HJf4TqMVSB6aLYM1AO-sqg?view=#Adding-collisions-to-meshes (answered by mattimus)\nQ: Are materials always 2 sided or is that a new thing? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: They can be either single or double sided, you can set that in Blender (answered by ash)\nQ: How do I change single/double sided settings for GLB export in Blender 4.3? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Check the \"Backface Culling > Camera option\" in the Material settings (answered by ash)\nQ: Why is Hyperfy tools rotating all my models 90 degrees? (asked by general hyper) A: It was likely compensating for models coming in backwards in Hyperfy, which might be fixed now (answered by 0mka)\n\n## 3.

The conversation primarily revolves around market conditions, token price movements, and brief mentions of Hyperfy token ($HYPER). Users discuss the negative impact of certain token launches (Trump and Melania tokens) on the crypto market. There's a brief price check of the HYPER token, showing fluctuations with one instance of a 37.7% increase to $9.8M market cap. One user expresses hope for \"fully formed games having competitive features with own marketplace\" before market recovery. The chat includes some sentiment about Hyperfy's future and a tweet share, but lacks substantive technical discussions, problem-solving, or implementation details.\n\n## 2.

Maximus shared information about Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, a multi-modal model available on Huggingface that supports streaming and can be self-hosted relatively easily. When asked by 0mka if they were using it for an agent, Maximus indicated they were waiting for the model to become available on Ollama before implementing it. Maximus clarified that their current work with the model is experimental and not close to production usage.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are you using it for an agent?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around positioning and rigidbody issues in a 3D environment. General hyper encountered problems with setting positions for models with similar structures but different rigidbody names. The key technical issue was that setting kinematic type in Blender wasn't being properly applied when the model was loaded into the world. General hyper discovered that setting the rigidbody type to kinematic via script was necessary for collision to work when moving app positions. There was also confusion about how app.position and rigidbody position relate - setting rigidbody node position places objects relative to the user's original placement, while app.position overrides the user-placed position. Shiffty suggested moving objects into world space using app.remove followed by world.add or world.attach to work in world coordinates. Additionally, peezy reported a UI issue with scroll bars appearing when the code pane slides out, which ash acknowledged could be fixed. General hyper also shared an error related to a black screen issue, showing React and WebGL errors.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do app position and root rigidbody position work? (asked by general hyper) A: If you set the rigidbody node position, the object position will be set relative to the position the user originally placed the app in the world. If you set app.position, it overrides the user-placed position. (answered by general hyper)\nQ: How can I work in world coordinates instead of local app space? (asked by general hyper) A: Do app.remove then world.add, or use world.attach which preserves the transform. (answered by Shiffty)\n\n## 3.

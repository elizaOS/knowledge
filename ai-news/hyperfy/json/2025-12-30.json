There are brief mentions of \"FARM2\" returning with updates based on Hyperfy, but no detailed technical content is provided. A user (Agent12) appears critical of \"Farm2\" as a \"Runescape like\" project that may be diverting resources from \"Honest development on Core.\" There's also a brief mention of \"HyperScape\" which Agent12 corrects to \"hyperscalp.\" The conversation includes New Year greetings and casual exchanges, but lacks substantive technical discussions, problem-solving, or implementation details.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's 2026 like? (asked by .hyp shaman) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nNo significant help interactions were present in the chat.\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment discusses methods for extracting GLB files from Hyperfy (.hyp) models and managing build permissions in Hyperfy worlds. Three approaches for converting .hyp files to GLB were shared: 1) \"shift-clicking\" the box icon to download the GLB if the .hyp has a real underlying GLB file (not possible for primitive-based models), 2) using the Hyperfy Tools Blender plugin to import .hyp files directly, and 3) using a custom web tool created by mrtzhckr (hyperfy.mrtzhckr.de/hyp2glb/) that converts .hyp files to GLB format. Additionally, a question was raised about allowing users to build in a Hyperfy world while preventing them from unpinning admin-pinned objects, but this question remained unanswered in the segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to extract GLB files from .hyp models? (implied by vox's response) A: If the .hyp has a real underlying GLB, \"shift\" click on the box icon to download it; primitive-based models cannot be exported as GLB. (answered by vox)\nQ: Is there a way to allow others to Free Build but prohibit them from un-pinning admin pinned objects? (asked by untitled, xyz) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: vox | Helpee: untitled, xyz | Context: Extracting GLB files from .hyp models | Resolution: Explained shift-click method for downloading GLB files from .hyp models with underlying GLB\nHelper: Valiant | Helpee: untitled, xyz | Context: Converting .hyp files to usable 3D formats | Resolution: Suggested using Hyperfy Tools to import .hyp to Blender\nHelper: mrtzhckr | Helpee: Community | Context: Converting .hyp files to GLB format | Resolution: Created and shared a custom web tool (hyperfy.mrtzhckr.de/hyp2glb/) for converting .hyp files to GLB\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Test the hyp2glb conversion tool for reliability with different model types | Mentioned By: mrtzhckr\nFeature: Implement permission system to allow free building while protecting admin-pinned objects | Mentioned By: untitled, xyz\nDocumentation: Create guide on different methods to extract/convert .hyp files to GLB format | Mentioned By: implied from conversation",

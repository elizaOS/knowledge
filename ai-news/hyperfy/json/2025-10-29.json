Summary:\nThe discussion primarily revolves around Blender integration with Hyperworld, focusing on a tool for exporting Blender objects to prims. Gert-Jan Akerboom is developing a Blender add-on that allows bidirectional conversion between Blender objects and Hyperworld prims, with features like collision toggle and trigger zones. 3rdEyeVisuals shared experiments with direct THREE.js access as a \"super user,\" demonstrating potential for advanced rendering techniques including a \"Tardis effect\" that creates hidden worlds through dynamic visibility control. This technique makes meshes invisible when viewed from outside, allowing for larger-than-apparent interior spaces. Gert-Jan also announced a dragon shooting game with climbing mechanics and invited community testing. The conversation highlights the developers' interest in expanding Hyperworld's capabilities through external tools and direct THREE.js manipulation.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can you use the Blender tool to paste prompted hyp code and export GLB? (asked by mrtzhckr) A: Yes, Gert-Jan plans to implement this bidirectional functionality in a Blender add-on (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: Does the Blender tool support toggle collision, trigger zones, etc.? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: Yes, \"all that good stuff!\" (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: Has anyone created a snap placement system? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

The component supports multiple shapes including circles and ovals, with a \"lit\" property that interacts with HDR. There were some implementation challenges, particularly with the oval shape's center point alignment and mesh orientation in the GLB file. 3rdEyeVisuals mentioned that while functional, the component needs polish and cleanup. They also discovered and fixed a bug in their bundling script that affected hash generation for JavaScript files, causing an orphaned JS file issue. Gert-Jan Akerboom tested the component and provided feedback about the \"lit\" property appearing reversed and the oval shape having alignment issues. 3rdEyeVisuals acknowledged these issues and explained their technical approach, noting they chose to use the circle mesh with modified properties rather than fighting with rotation issues on a dedicated oval mesh.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the \"lit\" property working correctly? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: It may be reversed - \"lit\" being affected by HDR and \"off\" not being affected. Will look into it later. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\nQ: Why does the oval shape have a different center than other shapes? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Because the oval uses the same circle shape mesh, requiring a manual offset. Was having issues with rotating the actual oval mesh. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Gert-Jan Akerboom | Helpee: 3rdEyeVisuals | Context: Testing the component and identifying issues with the \"lit\" property and oval shape alignment | Resolution: Feedback helped 3rdEyeVisuals identify issues to fix in future updates\n\n## 4.

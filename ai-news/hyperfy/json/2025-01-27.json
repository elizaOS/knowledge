      "summary": "# Hyperfy Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat revolves around Hyperfy V2 development with significant focus on scripting capabilities, UI components, and documentation improvements. Key technical discussions include: implementing autocomplete for the script editor using Monaco, which now provides function suggestions and documentation snippets; combining sky and HDR nodes into a single node with multiple properties; exploring ways to spawn objects programmatically; and implementing UI event handling with event bubbling similar to web standards. Developers discussed the need for better script organization, potentially separating client and server code into different files. There were also discussions about creating primitive shapes programmatically, enhancing documentation, and implementing first-person camera views. Several developers shared code snippets for UI components, sky configuration, and utility functions. The community is actively building documentation and tools, including a Blender extension for Hyperfy model compatibility and enhanced app inspection features that allow for precise positioning and \"freezing\" apps to prevent accidental movement.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I spawn a model programmatically? (asked by peezy) A: There is a non-documented way to make boxes for testing: `const box = app.create('mesh'); box.type = 'box'; box.setSize(1,3,1); app.add(box);` (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I get the player object? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: There's no global player, especially on the server, but you can get the player object from events emitted on triggers and contacts like `world.on('enter|leave', e => e.player)` (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I prevent nested UIViews from triggering parent onPointerDown events? (asked by Lastraum) A: Use event.stopPropagation() in the child's onPointerDown handler to prevent event bubbling (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How does fetch work in scripts? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: fetch is a global you can use in scripts (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is it possible to connect Hyperfy to any blockchain? (asked by MetaDoge) A: Yes, Hyperfy is designed to be chain-agnostic. There's already a Solana branch in the official repo (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I switch to first-person view? (asked by Saori) A: Press the C key (answered by á²¼)\nQ: Why is scale not working on my model? (asked by lil bigballs) A: It was a bug where scale won't trigger until position is set on an object, but it's been fixed on the dev branch (answered by devilsadvocate.sol)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"âš¡â”‚general\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy, a web-based 3D platform for creating interactive worlds. Key technical discussions include the deployment of Hyperfy worlds on Digital Ocean, with users troubleshooting node version issues and environment configuration. There was significant discussion about creating 360Â° VR experiences in Hyperfy, with MetaRick demonstrating a technique of projecting 360Â° video onto a sphere with flipped normals. The conversation touched on Hyperfy's roadmap, which aims to enable non-technical users to build and explore worlds, developers to create powerful apps, 3D artists to bring content to life without code, and AI agents to co-exist in these worlds. Users also discussed marketing strategies, with recommendations to focus on different target audiences (developers, designers, and general users) with specific campaigns. The chat revealed that Hyperfy is transitioning from V1 to V2, with ongoing development to port V1 functionality to the newer version.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What would be the easiest way to integrate the ability for visitors to buy merch in a Hyperfy world? (asked by poortubby) A: In v1 you can use a WebView to show your store website in-world or attach click listeners to digital versions that open a buy page in a new tab. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: When is v2 expected to be released? (asked by BlazeHorizon) A: It is released, check the links. (answered by MetaMike)\nQ: Is there any kind of roadmap or are you just trying to get V1 to V2 in any order? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: The ultimate end game is: 1) regular people can build and explore with no technical skills, 2) developers can make powerful apps/tools/platforms, 3) 3D artists can bring content to life without code, 4) AI agents can freely co-exist in worlds. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Would you argue that Hyperfy worlds are persistent despite the fact that the DAO could turn off the Hyperfy server? (asked by N1Kingz/HCK1) A: Nobody can stop Hyperfy, not even if we or the DAO wanted to. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is Hyperfy good for a 360 VR cinema experience? (asked by djrabbit) A: It's possible but would require adjustments to player movement control and creating a custom screen content app. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Where are the tutorials to easily deploy on Digital Ocean? (asked by emotionull) A: Found at https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy/wiki/Deploy-a-world-(Digital-Ocean) (answered by emotionull)\nQ: What are the hyperflier and $HYPER roles? (asked by Pablo) A: Hyper role is given when you connect a Solana wallet with hyper on it. Hyperflier is for wallets with > 100k $hyper. (answered by Jona)\nQ: Are the community calls recorded?

Community members express strong belief in the platform despite recent price volatility. HPrivakos shared plans for an open repository of scripts and an app marketplace on hyperworld.host, with a fee structure that would benefit both the platform and the Hyperfy DAO. Saori discussed using a small portion of vesting tokens to fund hackathons and tournaments to drive development and engagement. There were technical discussions about modular code implementation, with community members expressing enthusiasm for a potential marketplace where developers could share or sell scripts and code modules. The chat also included analysis of trading patterns, with some members using technical analysis to predict price movements while others remained focused on long-term development goals rather than short-term price action.\n\n## 2.

User bitpixi inquired about \"no code\" options for attaching JSON files to VRM models, mentioning they previously encountered issues with a local implementation. Ashxn responded that users can currently run their own Eliza server that connects to Hyperfy agents in-world. Additionally, Ashxn revealed that Hyperfy is collaborating with companies to develop a no-code solution that would enable launching Eliza agents with Hyperfy integration \"out of the box,\" though no public announcements are available yet.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where are we at with agents? I'd like a mid-level option of attaching my JSON file to a VRM. (asked by bitpixi) A: You can run your own Eliza server that connects to Hyperfy agents in world right now. We're working with companies to make it possible to launch Hyperfy-enabled Eliza agents out of the box, no code. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

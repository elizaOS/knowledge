      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n3rdEyeVisuals shared details about an extensive arcade-style project they're developing using canvas texture streaming technology. Instead of using iframes or UI nodes, they implemented a three.js CanvasTexture with 2D Canvas API rendering directly applied to 3D meshes. This approach enables raycasting and click detection in world-space, which wasn't possible with UI nodes. The implementation resembles a Game Boy screen texture-mapped onto 3D objects with real-time JavaScript canvas drawing.\n\nThe system is optimized for performance by only rendering machines when users are in proximity. This allows for potentially thousands of arcade machines in a world with each client only rendering one at a time, maintaining 60 FPS. 3rdEyeVisuals mentioned plans for arcade-style games like Time Crisis and House of the Dead, with some features being token-gated while test games will be available to all.\n\nThe developer is currently in the early stages (first 20%) of development, focusing on backend groundwork, database setup, persistence, and frontend management. They noted that development typically feels slow during the first 50% before components start falling into place rapidly.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is this networked (can others in world watch OR wen pong)? (asked by Shiffty) A: Implied no - \"I am planning out a pretty extensive project... Currently just an ongoing closed door dev\" (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\nQ: Is this using iframes or UI nodes? (asked by ash) A: Neither. Using canvas texture streaming with three.js CanvasTexture and 2D Canvas API rendering directly applied to 3D mesh (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\nQ: Doesn't this mean it would work in VR? (asked by ash) A: Implied yes - \"You know im already planning Time Crisis 😉\" (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\n\n## 3.

The main notable event is that a user (ailes) appears to have sent 30 million HYPER tokens to an \"incinerator\" address, effectively burning them from circulation. This was confirmed by ash. Saori shared a Streamflow Finance contract link on Solana mainnet. There was also a brief mention by Xukonth that \"Hyperfy will be at least 20m again,\" likely referring to token value or market cap.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: whatchu do?

Ozymandias mentions experiencing a problem related to cache in Firefox that appeared when using the power-GPU but disappeared in subsequent sessions. They created a fix in their fork that seems to resolve the issue and asked if they should create a GitHub issue for it. Ash responded that the issue was for v1 with a private codebase, implying that creating a new issue might be appropriate for the current version.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Analysis of 🏗│infra Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat contains a single message from Ozymandias discussing Heroku as a hosting platform. They note that Heroku's Dynos provide a convenient plug-and-play deployment experience. However, they highlight a significant limitation: Heroku only supports PostgreSQL for persistent storage, which means any changes are lost when a Dyno spins down or if the server crashes. This suggests the team is evaluating Heroku for infrastructure needs but facing data persistence challenges.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: (No specific questions were asked in this brief chat segment)\n\n## 3.

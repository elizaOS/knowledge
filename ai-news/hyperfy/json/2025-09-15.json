      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on technical discussions around Hyperfy development. Key topics included vector field types in app configurations, a chess application with world storage bugs, AI model integration, and teleportation functionality. Ash mentioned that vec3 field types exist for app transforms but aren't yet exposed to config, suggesting modifications to Sidebar.js and Fields.js to implement this. Gh0stt shared a chess application (pre.chess.numen.games) that has some world storage bugs. There was discussion about AI integration, with Ash clarifying that AI functionality is available in the dev branch with environment variables that enable features like generating objects via chat commands (e.g., \"/create a chair\"). Several users requested help with teleportation functionality and PDF uploads. The conversation also briefly touched on new AI models, with references to external discussions on Twitter.\n\n## 2.

Fibelius shared resources about Hyperfy agents, including a HackMD document about agentic game behavior and links to Hyperfy documentation. They noted that the demo page (agents.hyperfy.xyz) was not working, but suggested looking at examples on play.hyperfy.xyz. Ash confirmed that the agents world is offline. A user named 太阳 asked about alternative ways to add AI to their world but received no response. Finally, Fibelius shared a link to a Twitter post about a system prompt for GPT-5 Codex. Overall, the channel appears to be relatively inactive with limited substantive technical discussion.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there any other way to add some AI to your world?

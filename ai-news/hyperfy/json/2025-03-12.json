Key topics include:\n\n- Communication patterns between clients and servers using app.emit, app.send, world.emit, and world.on, with developers discussing potential naming improvements like app.broadcast for clarity.\n- A procedural city generation app was shared by Shiffty, which generated significant interest for its potential applications.\n- Particle system implementations, including a new CPU-based particle system by Ashxn that supports collision, as an alternative to using UI nodes.\n- Issues with the latest dev build were identified, including Math function availability (sqrt) breaking in the procedural city app and problems with geometry colliders applied through Blender.\n- MayD524 shared work on a vector field type implementation for position, rotation, and scale.\n- Several developers shared demos of third-person shooter mechanics, butterfly animations, and other game elements.\n- Discussion about routing players between instances and implementing queue systems for multiplayer games.\n- Troubleshooting of WebP image loading errors and model collision issues in the latest build.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to not have clones use the same instanced geometry? (asked by Shiffty) A: Yes, set mesh.linked=false (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a video tutorial that takes you from clone git to launching your world, to loading your first asset? (asked by eclipsingbinary) A: https://hyperfy.how/community/tutorials/ (answered by Saori)\nQ: Can I disable flying for my world? (asked by eclipsingbinary) A: Flying is only enabled in build mode (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How am I supposed to connect into a Docker Postgres container remotely without opening up a port to do admin tasks?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"🤖│agents\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe conversation primarily focused on new AI models and tools for agent development. Maximus expressed excitement about Gemma2, highlighting its quality responses compared to other small models, increased context window, and multi-modal capabilities. However, he noted the 12b parameter size might be too large for his local setup. The discussion also covered SpacetimeDB, a tool potentially useful for managing game states when combined with Hyperfy. There was a brief exchange about deployment methods, with mentions of Coolify as a solution for container configuration and deployment. Omka shared documentation links about AI agents and requested feedback for updates, to which Ricky responded positively, mentioning plans to make an MCP server available for group experimentation.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What makes Gemma2 exciting? (asked by Ashxn) A: The increased context window and motivation for multi-modal capabilities (image/OCR/etc) (answered by maximus)\nQ: Why focus on local models vs cloud models like Claude and ChatGPT? (asked by Ashxn) A: For unlimited usage and data sovereignty (answered by maximus)\nQ: Would you add anything to the AI agents guide with your in-world agent experience? (asked by Omka) A: Ricky mentioned making MCP server available once issues are resolved (answered by Ricky)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on technical discussions around Hyperfy's V1 and V2 platforms, particularly regarding model instancing and optimization techniques. A key technical exchange occurred between Paradoxx and 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 about optimizing 3D models in Hyperfy V1 using instancing. 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 shared a specific script for gltf.report to enable instancing in V1, while noting that V2 handles instancing automatically. Paradoxx demonstrated a technique using AI-generated image planes (from krea.ai) with extrusions to create low-poly cyberpunk environments, sharing detailed prompts for generating orthographic building facades. There were also discussions about Hyperfy's token, with community members pointing to token.hyperfy.xyz for information. Community updates included a YouTube recording of a recent community call and a request for screenshots of V2 worlds to update documentation. The team mentioned they're working on a new website that will better integrate token information.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How come there's no link out to dexscreener etc from the hyperfy website... or any mention of the token / tokenomics etc? (asked by jingo) A: The very first thing in #announcements is our CA and link to tokenomics. We're working on new site soon. Old one sold NFTs land, this one uses token. There's a whole site for token at token.hyperfy.xyz (answered by Ashxn, Saori, and Omka)\nQ: Do textures/images instance in Hyperfy V1 or still use all the data every time? (asked by Paradoxx) A: World building by default auto-instances everything. If you drag and drop a glb 10 times, or duplicate it 10 times, players only download that model once (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Would it be better to put the space together with modular parts in world? (asked by Paradoxx) A: In V1, you can use alt+D linked duplicates in Blender and use gltf.report with a specific instancing script. In V2, it will auto-instance linked duplicates (answered by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)\nQ: For community updates, do you guys like big montage or detailed thread more? (asked by Saori) A: From video standpoint montage is better, but thread probably performs better (answered by peezy and Shiffty)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the Hyperfy token ($HYPER) on Solana, with brief technical discussion about a bridging issue. A user (peezy) reported attempting to use a hyperbridging feature that failed due to CORS errors, with transactions getting stuck at \"waiting for wormhole consensus.\" The conversation then diverged into an extended off-topic discussion about cigarette taxation in different countries, particularly Australia, and its economic implications. There was minimal technical content in this segment, with only occasional price checks of the Hyperfy token using bot commands. One user (Spook_Handy) inquired about a V2 launch but received no response. The technical content was limited to the initial bridging issue report.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is hyperbridging working? (asked by peezy) A: No, transaction goes through but throws a CORS error and gets stuck on \"waiting for wormhole consensus\" (answered by peezy)\nQ: Did v2 launch? (asked by Spook_Handy) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: peezy | Helpee: Community | Context: Reported that hyperbridging feature is not working due to CORS errors | Resolution: No solution provided, but warned others that the feature is currently non-functional\n\n## 4.

ToxSam announced the launch of the updated website (opensourceavatars.com) and requested feedback from users. Ashxn developed a Model app that allows users to import any GLB file with toggles for collision and scale adjustment, similar to v1 functionality but requiring the latest dev version. This development required adding geometry sharing capabilities to the core. A brief technical exchange occurred regarding removing the ground object from world files, which was identified as the \"base-environment.glb\" file. The community showed appreciation for these developments, particularly the Model app functionality that enables non-coders to work with 3D models without requiring Blender skills.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there a way to remove the ground object in your world file? (asked by Mugenomics) A: It's the base-environment.glb (answered by Saori)\n\n## 3.

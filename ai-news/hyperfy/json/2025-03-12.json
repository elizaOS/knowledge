      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"ü§ñ‚îÇagents\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on new AI models and tools for agent development. Maximus expressed excitement about Gemma2, highlighting its quality responses compared to other small models, increased context window, and multi-modal capabilities. However, he noted the 12b parameter size might be challenging for his local setup. The conversation revealed a preference for local AI deployment for unlimited usage and data sovereignty versus cloud solutions. \n\nAnother significant topic was SpacetimeDB, a potential tool for managing game states/activities that Bitcraft uses. This sparked a discussion about deployment approaches, with devilsadvocate.sol preferring to decouple database and server components while mentioning Coolify as a potential solution. Peezy confirmed Coolify's capabilities for different deployment methods, including docker-compose integration with Hyperfy.\n\nOmka shared documentation links about AI agents and requested feedback for enhancement, particularly from Ricky who mentioned issues with MCP server implementation through Claude's desktop interface. Ricky expressed interest in making this functionality available to the community once resolved.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Anything specific that hypes you up about Gemma2? (asked by Ashxn) A: Biggest thing is the increased context window and the motivation to do multi-modal (image/ocr/etc) (answered by maximus)\nQ: Yeah, i think both claude and chat have 128-200k tho right? (asked by Ashxn) A: Those are cloud right? I've been primarily a local enthusiast to run unlimited / data sovereignty (answered by maximus)\nQ: I guess that's kinda coolify? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Yea coolify has a bunch of different methods of deployment one of them is docker-compose so u just paste in the file from howie. it sets up a separate volume for world (answered by peezy)\nQ: Anything you would add to this with some of your in world agent stuff? (asked by Omka) A: This is amazing, really love what you're doing üî• I was having some issues getting the MCP server to work via the regular claude desktop interface, once I get that working I can make that available for people to experiment with (answered by Ricky)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on technical discussions around Hyperfy V1 and V2, particularly regarding model instancing and optimization techniques. A key technical conversation occurred between Paradoxx and ùöüùöòùö°ùöüùöíùöéùöóùöóùöé about optimizing 3D models in Hyperfy V1 by using instancing to reduce file size and server load. ùöüùöòùö°ùöüùöíùöéùöóùöóùöé shared a specific script for gltf.report to instance GLB files in V1, while noting that V2 handles instancing automatically. Paradoxx demonstrated a technique using AI-generated image planes from krea.ai for creating low-poly cyberpunk building facades, sharing detailed prompts for generating orthographic building textures. There was also discussion about token information, with community members pointing to token.hyperfy.xyz when someone asked about tokenomics. Saori mentioned work on a new website. Omka requested screenshots of V2 worlds to update Hyperfy.how from old V1 images. The community call recording from the previous day was shared on YouTube.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How come there's no link out to dexscreener etc from the hyperfy website... or any mention of the token / tokenomics etc? (asked by jingo) A: The very first thing in #token-info is our CA and link to tokenomics. We're working on a new site soon. (answered by Ashxn and Saori)\nQ: Question about Hyperfy V1 and optimisation: I know how to instance models, but someone mentioned that textures/images dont instance / still use all the data every time? (asked by Paradoxx) A: World building by default auto-instances everything. If you drag and drop a glb 10 times into the world, or if you drag and drop it just once and duplicate it 10 times, players only download that model once. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can you tell me the prompt for good frontal view facades? (asked by ùöüùöòùö°ùöüùöíùöéùöóùöóùöé) A: [Shared detailed AI prompt for cyberpunk building facades] (answered by Paradoxx)\nQ: For the community updates, do u guys like big montage or detailed thread more? (asked by Saori) A: From video standpoint montage is better, but thread probably performs better. (answered by peezy and Shiffty)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"ü™ô‚îÇhyper\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the Hyperfy token ($HYPER) on Solana, with minimal technical discussion. One user (peezy) reported an issue with the Hyperbridge functionality, noting that transactions go through but get stuck at \"waiting for wormhole consensus\" due to a CORS error, possibly related to metadata retrieval. The conversation then diverged significantly into an extended discussion about cigarette taxation in Australia and its effects on black markets, with no further technical development of the Hyperfy topic. There were occasional price checks of the token using bot commands, showing price fluctuations between 7-8M market cap with varying percentage changes. No substantive technical solutions or implementations were discussed in this chat segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is Hyperbridge working? (asked by peezy) A: No, transactions go through but get stuck on \"waiting for wormhole consensus\" due to CORS errors (answered by peezy)\nQ: Did v2 launch?

ToxSam announced the launch of the updated website (opensourceavatars.com) and requested feedback from users. Ashxn developed a Model app that allows users to import any GLB file with toggles for collision and scale adjustment, similar to v1 functionality but requiring the latest dev version. This development required adding geometry sharing support to the core. A brief technical exchange occurred regarding removing the ground object from world files, with Saori identifying it as \"base-environment.glb\". The community showed appreciation for these developments, particularly the Model app which provides non-coders an alternative to using Blender. Additionally, the Hyperfy avatar documentation was updated to include a section on Open Source Avatars.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there a way to remove the ground object in your world file? (asked by Mugenomics) A: It's the base-environment.glb (answered by Saori)\n\n## 3.

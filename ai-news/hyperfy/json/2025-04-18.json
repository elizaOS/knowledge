Users have reported successful testing of screen sharing, video (including live and 360), and voice chat features.\n\nInstallation issues were addressed, particularly regarding dependency errors with 'esbuild-plugin-polyfill-node'. The recommended solution was a fresh clone and installation rather than an update, with specific steps provided by community members.",

For M3U8 streaming, HLS.js is the library used. Several streaming service options were discussed including Vimeo Pro (with 2GB/month bandwidth limitations), Mux.com (described as \"good and cheap\"), and Livepeer.\n\nSpatial audio implementation has received positive feedback for quality, with requests for room-limited audio volumes. Users can hide UI elements using the Z key on PC, though custom UI elements may not respond to this command.",

One user mentioned developing a plugin for Eagle to help organize VRM files, which received positive acknowledgment. There was also brief discussion about AI remeshing and rebaking in relation to 3D modeling.\n\nFeature requests included room-limited audio volumes, FLV streaming for low-latency livestreams, parkour-style movements, moderation via tokenomics, vehicle functionality, and UI improvements for better thumb usage and hiding options.",

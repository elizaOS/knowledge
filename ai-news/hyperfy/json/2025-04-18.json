Ash confirmed that mp4 videos and m3u8 streams are currently supported, with YouTube/Twitch integration coming soon via webviews. Several streaming solutions were discussed including Vimeo Pro, Mux.com, and Livepeer, with users sharing experiences about bandwidth limitations and costs. HLS.js was mentioned as the library used for m3u8 support. \n\nThere was discussion about the Play world, where some users noticed their content had disappeared, leading to clarification that it's an open canvas where permanence shouldn't be expected. UI improvements were noted, particularly regarding button placement for better thumb usage on mobile devices.\n\nTechnical feature suggestions included room-specific audio volumes for spatial audio implementation, parkour-style movement mechanics, and a UI hiding option (currently available via the Z key on PC). Vehicle hyps were mentioned as having significant potential for the platform.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to have videos in the worlds now? Like having YouTube videos, and being able to screen share (asked by IamKR) A: mp4 videos and m3u8 streams only, and screensharing yes. Will add youtube/twitch soon via webviews (answered by ash)\nQ: Whats the best way to get m3u8 streams in? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Vimeo Pro was used for Blockbuster and was awesome according to one user (answered by ash)\nQ: Which library do you use for that?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around recent technical developments in the Hyperfy platform. Key highlights include the implementation of a new particle system that offers improved performance, as reported by multiple users. Ash mentioned that chat bubbles now scale based on distance, and shared that particles have been added to the platform. TheMattEmpire encountered installation issues when updating after 18 days, which was resolved by deleting, recloning the repository, and performing a fresh installation. MetaRick reported successful testing of various media features including screen sharing, video, live video, 360 content, and voice chat. ~/drdoge.eth updated the \"Nighthawk\" with the new particle systems, noting significantly better performance compared to their previous custom setup. The particle system appears to include collision detection functionality, triggering explosions when particles interact with colliders. Users also shared examples of their implementations and worlds, with some discussion about excessive brightness in certain environments.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is Dev down? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: No, run `npm install` (answered by ash)\nQ: How are you controlling play/stop? (asked by ash) A: The explosions are triggered when the initial particles hit anything with colliders (answered by ~/drdoge.eth)\n\n## 3.

HowieDuhzit mentioned developing a plugin for Eagle that helps organize VRM files, which could be useful for 3D designers managing their assets. Maximus shared a link to a Twitter/X post by Yanpei Cao, which appears to be related to 3D design. Ash commented that AI remeshing and rebaking should have been applied first to whatever was shared, suggesting the model could have benefited from automated optimization techniques before further processing. The conversation then devolved into casual comments about the content of the shared post.",

The conversation primarily revolves around trading activity, specifically someone who sold their HYPER tokens (as evidenced by a Solscan transaction link). Community members express disappointment about this sale, with general hyper (likely a team member) characterizing it as \"paper handing\" a swing trade rather than a true holder selling. The chat shows concern about decreasing holder numbers, though general hyper encourages more active participation and volume generation to attract new liquidity rather than complaints. No specific technical implementations, decisions or problem-solving discussions are present in this limited chat segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What happened? (asked by eigb) A: Someone sold their HYPER tokens as shown in the Solscan transaction (answered by general hyper and CheddarQueso 🧀)\nQ: Why do number of holders keep decreasing continuously? (asked by eigb) A: Partially answered by general hyper suggesting the seller wasn't a true \"holder\" but rather someone paper handing a swing trade\n\n## 3.

A user (Enryt) reported being unable to access hyperfyworlds.xyz for weeks, receiving connection timeout errors. Maximus clarified that the service had moved to Hyperworld.host and directed Enryt to the relevant thread. When Enryt asked about options to try hosting before purchasing, Maximus suggested self-hosting as an alternative using the documentation provided, mentioning it requires basic command line knowledge. HypPrivakos clarified that the original service was Lastraum's hosting service, which appears to be down. Separately, Agent12 reported potential input lag issues when performing multiple actions simultaneously (shift sprinting, turning, and using mouse input), but later noted the issue seemed to resolve itself, possibly due to background processes or needing a browser update.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe conversation revolves around importing and using 3D models in a platform, with specific focus on technical aspects like colliders and app functionality. Enryt inquires about building blocks and colliders for imported GLB objects. HypPrivakos clarifies that colliders are set within the GLB files and mentions marketplace imports as an alternative. The main technical discussion centers on vox's issue with swapping models in an app that displays invalid GLB errors. Ash provides the solution, explaining that the app specifically looks for a mesh named \"Screen\". Vox successfully implements this solution but encounters z-fighting issues with the mesh. Ash mentions that the original mesh remains but can be toggled off. The conversation also touches on video atlas functionality and potential app improvements for non-developers.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How are colliders set for imported objects? (asked by Enryt) A: Colliders are set in the GLB, you can also import objects from the marketplace (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: Why does my model show \"invalid glb\" when swapping in the app? (asked by vox) A: The app looks for a mesh named \"Screen\" (answered by ash)\nQ: What causes z-fighting on the mesh in the app? (asked by vox) A: It's keeping the original mesh there but that can be toggled off (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

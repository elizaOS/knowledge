      "summary": "# Analysis of ⚡│general Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThis Discord chat segment contains primarily holiday greetings with minimal technical content. The only technical information shared was from user 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰 who offered a tip about rendering m3u8 video streams. They noted that rendering m3u8 directly on VideoScreen in V1 performs poorly, but using an m3u8 player within a WebView component provides significantly better performance and user experience. No other technical discussions, decisions, or problem-solving occurred in this brief chat segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I improve m3u8 video rendering performance? (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰) A: Use an m3u8 player in a WebView instead of rendering directly on VideoScreen in V1 (answered by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰)\n\n## 3.

This suggests a previous issue with this interaction has been resolved in the new version.

Enryt reports that on Quest 2 standalone, they cannot see video or buttons when using main branch 5d20037435 (dated 12/18/2025). Additionally, when using PCVR with Meta Horizon Link, they can see the video and buttons, but the buttons are not selectable/interactive. The message appears to be requesting help to make the implementation work properly in VR environments.",

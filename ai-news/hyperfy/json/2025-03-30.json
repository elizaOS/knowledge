          "text": "The Hyperfy development team and community have been actively discussing and implementing a range of technical enhancements, UX improvements, and feature requests across the platform. A major focus has been on the new Gizmo tool, which introduces rotation snapping, local/world space toggling (via the 'T' key), and grid snapping. Future plans include adding scale manipulation. Community feedback on Gizmo has been positive, with users noting its intuitive design and ease of use.",

          "text": "Material and mesh handling improvements were also discussed. Developers are working on supporting base color and emission field changes, and removing limitations tied to MeshStandardMaterial to allow broader material compatibility. Linked vs. unlinked meshes were clarified, with unlinking recommended for unique material changes. Transparency and collision rendering issues were also addressed, with guidance on flipping normals in Blender and tagging meshes as colliders.",

Nodes moved to world space remain tied to their app lifecycle, and JSON-only messaging is encouraged to avoid unpredictable behavior. Reparenting objects across apps is discouraged. Instanced apps can be made unique for independent material changes, and cloning with children requires the use of clone(true).",

A floating camera mode and UI simplification are also planned. Performance optimizations include using LOD nodes for UI rendering control and adding node.onMount/onUnmount callbacks.",

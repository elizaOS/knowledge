      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussions in the developers channel focused on several key technical topics. Ash announced upcoming voice chat integration and discussed plans for default apps/app palettes in worlds, similar to v1, where worlds would come with default apps while allowing custom additions. General Hyper shared a similar approach using \"widgets\" split into core and tertiary components.\n\nA significant technical development was Ash's PR (#87) introducing world wallets and in-world currency functionality with server-side transaction handling for security. The implementation carefully manages RPC URLs and includes documentation on usage. The PR was shared as a reference, not for merging into the main branch.\n\nVoice chat implementation was discussed using Livekit, with HypPrivakos offering to provide a free Livekit server. There was also discussion about speech-to-text possibilities, with peezy suggesting it could be implemented by modding core, potentially using client-side WASM for running small models.\n\nThe channel also touched on Solana integration, with Ash mentioning that Buffer polyfill is no longer needed in the Solana branch, making it easier to use libraries like @solana/wallet-adapter through direct imports. Helius was recommended as a reliable Solana RPC provider.\n\nOther topics included camera functionality limitations, potential FOV slider implementation, and ideas for game development initiatives including a \"hyper enabled game fund\" and participation in the Gamedev.js Jam 2025.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to create an app with speech to text using Google Cloud API for real-time captions? (asked by cru) A: It's \"absolutely possible\" though it may need some core changes (answered by ash)\nQ: Is the Solana integration PR meant to be part of the main branch? (asked by 0mka) A: No, it's just a PR for reference, not to be merged (answered by ash)\nQ: What's the best RPC provider for Solana in production? (asked by 0mka) A: Helius is \"beast mode\" (answered by ash)\nQ: Is 8m for camera zoom too limited? (asked by ~/drdoge.eth) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

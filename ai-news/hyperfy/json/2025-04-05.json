          "text": "The Hyperfy community has been actively discussing and implementing several technical and community-driven initiatives to enhance the platform. A major upcoming feature is the integration of voice chat using LiveKit, with infrastructure support offered by community member hprivakos. This will include user permission settings and may support real-time speech-to-text captions above avatars using WebAssembly (WASM) for privacy and performance.",

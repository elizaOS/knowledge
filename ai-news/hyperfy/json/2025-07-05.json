      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in ðŸª™â”‚hyper Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around two main topics: (1) discussions about project development philosophy and timeline expectations, and (2) a technical support issue. There's a clear tension between community members who advocate for patient, quality-focused development versus those who believe a more aggressive timeline with marketing focus is necessary in the competitive crypto/AI space. One member specifically argues that \"time is the most important asset\" and suggests the team should have a clear timeline even if implementations aren't perfect. Others counter that building \"the true interoperable metaverse\" requires patience to \"do it RIGHT.\" On the technical side, a user experiences WebSocket disconnection issues (error 1006) with their Hyperfy deployment using nginx and PM2, sharing logs and configuration details while seeking assistance.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Will hyperfy have its own AI trading agent? (asked by syGMatMATTIOBOY ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º) A: Nothing official but I wouldn't be surprised to see embodied agents live trading in our worlds (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Why does my browser client keep disconnecting and reporting a 1006 error when deployed using nginx? (asked by web3ç¬¬ä¸€æ·±æƒ…) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"💻│developers\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily revolves around AI-powered creation tools in development for Hyperfy. Ash is working on a headless AI service that allows users to generate and edit 3D objects through prompts like `/create` and `/edit`. Gh0stt is interested in building a headless Lichess interface using similar technology. The conversation highlights technical challenges including performance issues when AI generates complex scripts and collision detection problems with mounted vehicles in race systems. Ash mentions optimizations being made to the AI creation system, including grouping objects by type and using shaders for colors to improve performance from ~8ms CPU to an estimated 3ms. The system currently works with both Anthropic and OpenAI models, with Sonnet 4 identified as offering the best balance of speed and design capabilities. Valiant is working on a racing system and struggling with collision detection when players are mounted on vehicles, as player collision is disabled when anchored to rides.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is the example code for the headless AI opensource? (asked by Gh0stt) A: It's still work in progress being built locally with some issues to iron out before it's 100% usable (answered by ash)\nQ: How does the AI creation system work? (asked by bpvxduu) A: You can create things with `/create a wheelbarrow` and edit them with `/edit add more wheels` (answered by ash)\nQ: Is the AI generation with primitives inside latest dev? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: No, latest dev was 11/08/2025 by the looks of it (answered by Valiant)\nQ: Why isn't player collision detected when on a mount/ride? (asked by Valiant) A: Player collision is disabled when anchored, you have to track the moving vehicle instead (answered by .hyp shaman)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Shiffty | Helpee: Valiant | Context: Detecting overlapping objects for race system | Resolution: Shared a reference to a previous demo for detecting object overlaps\nHelper: .hyp shaman | Helpee: Valiant | Context: Player not being recognized when crossing race triggers while on a mount | Resolution: Explained that player collision is disabled when anchored, suggesting to track the vehicle instead\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Valiant | Context: Understanding why player collision is disabled on vehicles | Resolution: Explained it prevents opposing forces from interfering with vehicle physics\n\n## 4.

Summary\nThe chat contains a single message from user \"cru\" advising against implementing multi-chain functionality in the early stages of development. The user points out that going multi-chain would fragment liquidity across different blockchains, which could be detrimental to the project. They recommend postponing multi-chain implementation until the project is more established (\"much later down the road\").\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on asset management and optimization in Hyperfy. TheMattEmpire inquired about group selection functionality for duplicating and moving multiple assets simultaneously, which ash confirmed is not currently available but is on their roadmap. The conversation then shifted to building optimization techniques using Blender. Ash explained that using linked duplicates in Blender creates instanced meshes that are efficiently rendered as a single draw call in Hyperfy, even when duplicated within the world. This instancing works across all duplicates, making it ideal for creating modular buildings and towns. Ash directed TheMattEmpire to the official Hyperfy Blender addon on GitHub, confirming it supports LODs and is more up-to-date than other tools.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there any way to select a bunch of assets in world in order to duplicate and/or move it all around at one time? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Nah that's tough but something I want to tackle. (answered by ash)\nQ: Does the Hyperfy Tools addon export linked assets...or how are instances exported from Blender? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Everything is automatically instanced as long as in blender you create \"linked duplicates\" not just regular duplicates as those are completely unique meshes. (answered by ash)\nQ: If I make the building in Blender with instanced parts, put that in world, then instance the building...would the parts be instanced per building, or all instances would be instanced? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Everything instances. (answered by ash)\nQ: Did notice your add-on doesn't support LODs yet though? Or is that a Node based thing which is separate? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Yeah it has lods. Add an empty to the scene. (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

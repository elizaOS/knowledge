Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on Hyperfy V2 development, with significant attention to the app inspection window UI/UX improvements. Ashxn shared mockups of a redesigned app inspection interface that allows users to view app details, download, remix, and edit code. The community discussed implementation of snap points for easier object positioning, with Ashxn demonstrating a working prototype where objects can snap to predefined points in 3D models. Several developers shared their projects, including a HyperBeacon app and a marketplace for Hyperfy apps created by HPrivakos. Technical challenges were addressed, including npm dependency conflicts in Docker builds and questions about camera controls. The chat also covered discussions about animation capabilities, vehicle implementations, and the potential for combat systems in future versions. Saori demonstrated deploying Hyperfy on fly.io as a hosting solution.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I access the camera in an app? (asked by Shiffty) A: You can access the camera using app.control(options) but it's not fully documented yet as it might change (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is the current playground v2 yet? (asked by trou) A: Unanswered\nQ: How do I scale something in the editor? (asked by MetaRick) A: Currently only possible in Blender or via script, as allowing arbitrary scaling might break apps designed for specific scales (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Am I able to do combat on this platform? How do I add animation and stuff? (asked by frabra239) A: V2 doesn't have combat yet, but it's planned. V1 had it working nicely. Full custom interactions are being developed (answered by maximus and Ashxn)\nQ: What is the preferred animation type for custom animations? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Animations use the \"emote\" format, which is a GLB file with an animated skeleton following VRM standard bone mapping (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there any way to mint VRM in Solana? (asked by ToxSam) A: Yes, using Metaplex NFTs which have metadata support (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can we duplicate the mesh of a model in an app and create more of them through script? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"🤖│agents\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat focuses on implementing and troubleshooting agent behaviors in Hyperfy. MetaMike developed a basic behavior tree with animations and LLM integration that responds to player proximity: rotating toward players at <10m, running emotes between 5-0m, and making Eliza API calls between 0-2m. There were discussions about URL configuration issues with the Eliza hyperfy branch, with HPrivakos providing the correct URLs (https://agents.dcl.guru/eliza/hyperfy and https://agents.dcl.guru/hprivakos/hyperfy). The group explored how emotes are triggered within the Eliza system, with Saori explaining that the app sends available emotes to Eliza, which then selects appropriate ones based on response content. MetaMike documented the implementation in a HackMD document. Additionally, SoloSolipsist introduced their \"Memotar\" project for creating agent personas, and community members shared resources for connecting to Hyperfy agents.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can you confirm the URL you're using? (asked by MetaMike) A: The hyp file has a wrong URL for the model, use https://agents.dcl.guru/eliza/hyperfy (answered by HPrivakos)\nQ: How can we trigger the expressions within the eliza hyperfy branch? (asked by MetaMike) A: The app sends available emotes to Eliza which picks one appropriate for the response (answered by Saori)\nQ: Any examples of Hyperfy agents to check out? Or any resources available if I wanted to hook up a poc? (asked by SoloSolipsist) A: https://agents.hyperfy.xyz/ (answered by Saori)\nQ: Wondering if there is a way to somehow activate an animation track separate to emotes? (asked by MetaRick) A: Hmmmm good point. I think v1 could do that, so probably (answered by MetaMike)\n\n## 3.

Key technical discussions include hosting solutions for Hyperfy worlds, with options ranging from self-hosting using fly.io to managed services like hyperworld.host. Documentation efforts are underway with Saori and devilsadvocate maintaining a community docs repository at hyperfy.how. The new app download/upload functionality was reviewed in a developer huddle, allowing creators to build custom interactive objects that can be transferred between worlds. There's ongoing work on a beacon feature that will list worlds on relay.zesty.xyz. Community members are actively building worlds and marketplaces, with discussions about licensing clarifying that GPL applies only to the core engine, not to assets. The community is organizing regular calls to showcase builds and share progress.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the license situation for client projects using Hyperfy? (asked by MetaRick) A: GPL only applies to the core engine itself, not assets side loaded onto it. It's not mandatory to contribute improvements back to the repo. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What's the procedure for building on Hyperfy if you don't have a V1 world? (asked by Cluny_the_Scourge) A: Hosting services like V1 are no longer available, but there are hosting providers supporting sign-ups on their platform. You can also get your own hosting/domain. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Where is the best place to get documentation for building on V2 engine? (asked by Cluny_the_Scourge) A: GitHub is where the API docs are for V2. (answered by Saori)\nQ: How can I self-host a Hyperfy world?

Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on Hyperfy token ($HYPER) trading dynamics, liquidity management, and cross-chain bridging considerations. A significant technical conversation centered around the potential of creating an Ethereum bridge for HYPER using Wormhole. Saori explained the mathematical considerations for establishing proper liquidity on Ethereum, noting that to match the current Solana pool (which used 20% of supply + 79 SOL), they would need approximately 10% of supply and 160 SOL to create equivalent liquidity on Ethereum. The conversation highlighted the challenges of cross-chain liquidity, including the risk of price impact from arbitrage and the capital requirements to establish sufficient liquidity. Users also discussed token price movements, with some members tracking their trading strategies and noting correlations with broader market conditions. The community appears to be monitoring tokenomics developments, with mentions of an upcoming plan and discussions about the founder's stake being reasonably structured with a three-year vesting period.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the purpose of the address holding 30% of total supply? (asked by Alexa) A: It's explained on token.hyperfy.xyz and in the FAQ (answered by Uuuuuuuuu and maximus)\nQ: Do we have some kind of tokenomics plan coming? (asked by DannyNOR NoFapArc) A: Yes (answered by Saori)\nQ: How much liquidity would be needed to establish a HYPER pool on Ethereum? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: About 10% of supply and 160 SOL to get an equivalent LP on ETH (answered by Saori)\nQ: How do bots destroy new liquidity pools? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Unanswered\nQ: Could we reward users in HYPER for staking liquidity? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Not a good idea as you already get rewarded for contributing to LP (answered by jar0d and Saori)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on 3D model optimization techniques, file formats, and AI-assisted 3D modeling tools. TheMattEmpire demonstrated optimization of a mushroom model, reducing file size through retopology and texture compression, showing significant improvements by switching from PNG to JPG/WebP formats. There was extensive discussion about Meshy, an AI 3D generation tool, with users sharing experiences, limitations (particularly with texturing and back-facing geometry), and workarounds. The conversation also covered Blender's evolving capabilities versus traditional tools like ZBrush and Maya. A major development was the announcement that Hyperfy Tools has been accepted to the Blender Extension Repository, allowing direct installation from Blender 4.2+. Users also experimented with importing AI-generated models into Hyperfy spaces, demonstrating the workflow from generation to implementation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to define if a material uses filtering or not for pixel textures? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Try cubic/closest filtering for Minecraft-style textures without blur (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What's the best image format for optimizing textures? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: From worst to best: PNG -> JPG -> WebP -> KTX2, though KTX2 is hard and not yet supported in V2 (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Does Hyperfy optimize textures on the backend? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: We don't auto-optimize because that would be at runtime (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can WebP do animation? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can I get started with Hyperfy? (asked by vlad) A: I'll happily lend a blank Hyperfy scene to you for experimentation, or you can wait for Hyperfy V2 (no-code version) which is coming soon (answered by untitled, xyz)\n\n## 3.

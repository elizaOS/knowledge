      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion centers on a potential architectural change for Hyperfy worlds to function more like static websites with decoupled networking. Jin proposes a system where worlds could be hosted statically (e.g., on GitHub Pages) while maintaining optional multiplayer functionality through separate server connections. This approach would allow worlds to function offline or switch between different server \"shards\" without losing the world itself. \n\nThe key technical concept involves decoupling the world content from the networking layer, similar to how JanusXR works. This would enable several benefits: worlds could be archived permanently, users could explore offline if servers go down, and friends could form private \"parties\" to explore the same world together on different servers. Ash compares this to Minecraft's model of \"one client, many hosted worlds.\"\n\nThe discussion explores implementation details including a UI indicator for connection status, a `/connect` command for server switching, and the possibility of hosting worlds on decentralized storage like Arweave. A recent JWT token length change caused issues for HypPrivakos' servers, which Ash resolved by removing the minimum length requirement.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can Hyperfy worlds be static websites in view-only mode? (asked by jin) A: Yes (answered by ash)\nQ: Can I build something that can just chill on GitHub pages? (asked by jin) A: Yes, but it's a bit annoying to set up (answered by ash)\nQ: Is it possible for that client to have networking if I host a world as a static GitHub page and point to a live server URL? (asked by jin) A: You can already do this with regular client, it doesn't need a server (answered by ash)\nQ: How do we get a clone of the same world in some other server? (asked by ash) A: The world would be cached on each system or server, allowing for multiverse exploration (answered by jin)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host | Context: JWT token length change caused servers to enter restart loop because tokens were 12 chars instead of 16 | Resolution: ash removed the minimum length requirement\nHelper: ash | Helpee: jin | Context: Clarifying how static worlds could work with networking | Resolution: Explained that worlds can run client-side without servers\nHelper: HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host | Helpee: Gert-Jan Akerboom | Context: World 404 error after update | Resolution: Advised to update to the latest dev branch\n\n## 4.

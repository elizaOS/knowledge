      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical development in Hyperfy, with significant emphasis on a \"Miniverse\" application being developed by 3rdEyeVisuals. This app creates worlds-within-worlds functionality, allowing for separate environments within a main Hyperfy world. Key technical aspects included:\n\n- Player position and camera control implementation for proximity-based triggers and preventing clipping\n- Discussion of snap points in Blender using the Hyperfy tools addon\n- Direct access to THREE.js engine for in-world development\n- Exploration of WebGPU as a potential upgrade from WebGL to enable DX12 in browser and real ray-tracing\n- Image frame implementation similar to Hyperfy V1, with Valiant working on a solution\n- Weather effects system being developed as a plugin for the Miniverse app\n- A utility script for listing app blueprints and entities in a Hyperfy repository\n\nThe Miniverse application appears to be a significant development that enables multiple communities to have tailored environments within a single Hyperfy world, with custom HDR/EXR settings and other features specific to each miniverse.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Has anyone tried upgrading from WebGL to WebGPU? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: Has been discussed here. Search webgpu (answered by Valiant)\nQ: Is there an app/hyp file out there just for the v1 image uploader that comes with a frame? (asked by untitled, xyz) A: Valiant indicated he was working on a solution, and .hyp shaman provided code examples from the collections\nQ: When you have more than 1 wallet in your browser they tend to fight to connect. How to fix? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Normally disable the wallet (temple) and try and connect again (answered by .hyp shaman)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around technical issues with Hyperfy, a metaverse platform. Roustan demonstrated cross-platform compatibility by converting Avatar GLB files to VRM format and successfully loading them in Hyperfy, noting that the movement animations were better in Hyperfy than in Otherside. A significant technical issue occurred when Rizzle placed a large pumpkin model in the \"wip\" parcel, causing it to break and become inaccessible. This led to discussions about how to fix broken parcels, with 3rdEyeVisuals offering a Python script solution that can remove problematic apps and entities directly from the database while creating backups. Users also noted that multiple v1 worlds were inaccessible, suggesting a potential server-wide issue rather than just the pumpkin incident. There was mention of migrating \"WIP\" to v2, indicating an ongoing platform upgrade process.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can anyone else see if they can get into the wip parcel? (asked by Rizzle) A: Not loading for me baus (answered by untitled, xyz)\nQ: How can we fix a broken parcel? (asked by Rizzle) A: I think ash needs to reset it for you, you need god mode (answered by untitled, xyz)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: 3rdEyeVisuals | Helpee: Rizzle | Context: Broken \"wip\" parcel due to giant pumpkin model | Resolution: Offered to share a Python script that removes apps and spawned entities from the database while creating backups\nHelper: untitled, xyz | Helpee: Rizzle | Context: Broken \"wip\" parcel | Resolution: Suggested that ash needs to reset it and that \"god mode\" permissions are required\n\n## 4.

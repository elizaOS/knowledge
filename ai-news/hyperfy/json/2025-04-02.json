          "text": "The Hyperfy community engaged in a series of technical discussions focused on 3D asset optimization, development workflows, and server configuration. A key topic was vertex color handling in meshes, where users like howieduhzit and themattempire explored how sharp edges in vertex-colored meshes can increase draw calls due to material splits. Blender export settings were identified as a potential cause, and ashxn.eth confirmed that a specific export option must be enabled to preserve vertex colors. themattempire plans further investigation into this issue.",

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: üíª‚îÇdevelopers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion in the developers channel primarily focused on UI development in the Hyperfy platform. A key technical conversation revolved around creating full-screen UI elements and accessing viewport dimensions. User shmoji inquired about obtaining screen width/height for screen space UI, which led to multiple solutions being shared. 0mka provided a code snippet demonstrating how to create a full-screen UI using app.control() to access screen dimensions. Ashxn mentioned plans to add world.viewportWidth and world.viewportHeight properties and later shared a GitHub PR link (#109). \n\nOther technical topics included a brief mention of client-side/server-side challenges, loading remote GLB models with rigidbodies and colliders, and work on animation layers for features like gun mechanics. There was also a note about a Safari-specific issue where UI elements outside the overflow area cause browser refreshes, highlighting cross-browser compatibility concerns.\n\nThe conversations demonstrate collaborative problem-solving among community members, with experienced developers offering solutions and planning platform improvements based on user needs.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I get screen width/height in a Hyperfy app for screen space UI? (asked by shmoji) A: You can use screen.width, screen.height or access them via app.control() (answered by 0mka and Ashxn)\nQ: Can we load an app using world.load()? (asked by .hyp shaman) A: Not apps, but you can use this to load GLBs from remote sources (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to make a UI \"fill the entire screen\"? (asked by shmoji) A: Yes, by using app.control() to get screen dimensions and setting appropriate UI parameters (answered by 0mka)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat primarily discusses setting up Hyperfy servers, with a focus on using Fly.io as a free/low-cost hosting option. ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì shared an updated guide for setting up Hyperfy servers via Fly.io. Community members discussed various hosting options, with maximus explaining that Fly.io is essentially free for basic servers and supports custom domains. The Play Sandbox world was mentioned as using Hetzner hosting. There was clarification that the setup instructions work for both local development and public deployment. The conversation touched on scalability concerns, with 0mka noting that services like Fly.io allow for easy upgrades as needed. The discussion remained technical and focused on practical implementation details for Hyperfy server deployment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Just to confirm, this isn't a public server yeah? Just on the local computer? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Yeah, it's a public server. It's worth setting up and exploring. Costs you nothing. (answered by ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì)\nQ: Anyone know any good/cheap servers to use? Currently looking at AWS micro instance...thing. But not sure its the best to run a hyperfy server. (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: The hosting section runs down a good selection of providers, should be less than 6 bucks to run a basic hyperfy server https://docs.hyperfy.xyz/hosting/self/ (answered by maximus)\nQ: Hey ash you showed a video of stormwind a few weeks ago. What is that? (asked by MUDBONE) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Fibelius mentions struggling with a v1 world containing Kitbash 3D buildings and inquires about v2 compatibility and whether purchasing the Kitbash Neo Tokyo kit would be worthwhile for a non-professional designer. hiroP responds with technical advice about Kitbash's new \"game ready\" kits, noting they're optimized for Unreal Engine with fewer draw calls and optimized meshes/textures, but still have high poly counts focused on Nanite technology. hiroP warns that Kitbash models would require significant optimization work to run smoothly in Hyperfy and suggests alternatives: looking for low-poly assets on platforms like Fab or Artstation, or creating low-poly versions of Kitbash models and projecting textures onto them. Fibelius clarifies their interest in architectural models rather than dystopian cities, mentioning previous work with Alvar Aalto's Villa Mairea. hiroP recommends checking futuristic sculptural buildings from Kitbash and suggests exploring Untitled's MOCA builds, which are CC0-licensed.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How long until v2 is available in HQ? (asked by Fibelius) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is it worth buying the Kitbash Neo Tokyo 3D building Kit for a non-pro 3D designer to build in Hyperfy? (asked by Fibelius) A: Kitbash models will be difficult to optimize for Hyperfy due to high poly counts and textures, but could work with significant effort. Consider low-poly alternatives or texture projection techniques. (answered by hiroP)\nQ: Is v2 significantly different from v1? (asked by Fibelius) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

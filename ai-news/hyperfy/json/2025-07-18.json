      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on UI development in the Hyperfy platform. A key technical question arose about obtaining screen dimensions for creating full-screen UI elements, with multiple solutions provided. The developers discussed accessing screen width and height through `app.control()` and the potential addition of viewport dimensions as global properties. There was also mention of UI positioning challenges, particularly for mobile devices, with Safari experiencing refresh issues when UI elements extend beyond the viewport. Other topics included animation layers for character models, loading remote GLB files with rigidbodies and colliders, and implementing emissive maps. A PR (#109) was mentioned that appears to address locomotion emotes and animation layering for features like guns.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I get screen width/height in a Hyp app for screen space UI? (asked by shmoji) A: You can use `screen.width` and `screen.height` via `app.control()` (answered by 0mka)\nQ: Can we load an app using `world.load()`? (asked by .hyp shaman) A: Not apps, but you can use it to load GLBs from remote sources (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

Roustan mentions an updated guide with extra tips for setting up a free Hyperfy server. TheMattEmpire inquires about server options, expressing interest in creating a public server. Maximus clarifies that the instructions cover both local and online deployment through Fly.io using terminal commands. Various hosting options are discussed, including Fly.io (described as free for basic servers), AWS, Hertzner (used by Play Sandbox world), and Spaceship.com. The conversation highlights that Fly.io is suitable for low storage needs and offers easy scalability. Roustan confirms that the server setup being discussed is public and encourages exploration since it costs nothing to set up.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Just to confirm, this isn't a public server yeah? Just on the local computer? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Yeah, it's a public server. It's worth setting up and exploring. Costs you nothing. (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\nQ: Anyone know any good/cheap servers to use? Currently looking at AWS micro instance...thing. But not sure its the best to run a hyperfy server. (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: The hosting section runs down a good selection of providers, should be less than 6 bucks to run a basic hyperfy server https://docs.hyperfy.xyz/hosting/self/ (answered by maximus)\nQ: What is that?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief discussion about 3D design challenges in Hyperfy. Fibelius mentions struggling with a v1 world containing Kitbash 3D buildings and inquires about v2 compatibility and whether purchasing the Kitbash Neo Tokyo kit would be worthwhile for a non-professional designer. HiroP provides technical advice about Kitbash's new \"game ready\" kits, noting they're optimized for Unreal Engine with fewer draw calls and optimized meshes/textures, but still have high poly counts focused on Nanite technology. HiroP warns that Kitbash models would require significant optimization work for Hyperfy and suggests alternatives: looking for low-poly models on platforms like Fab or Artstation, or creating low-poly versions of Kitbash models and projecting textures onto them. Fibelius clarifies their interest in architectural models rather than dystopian cities, mentioning previous work with Alvar Aalto's Villa Mairea. HiroP recommends checking futuristic sculptural buildings from Kitbash and suggests looking at Untitled's MOCA builds which are CC0-licensed.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How long is the estimated wait for v2? (asked by Fibelius) A: Unanswered\nQ: If I buy the Kitbash Neo Tokyo 3D building Kit for Hyperfy city building, will it be a waste of money for a non-pro 3D designer? (asked by Fibelius) A: Kitbash models will be difficult to get working smoothly in Hyperfy due to high poly counts and textures, requiring significant optimization work (answered by hiroP)\nQ: Is v2 now so different?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion centers around an issue where the \"world clean\" script is deleting asset files but not their corresponding database entries, causing worlds to become inaccessible or stuck at loading screens. Users 0mka and HowieDuhzit reported that after running the world clean script, they experience missing assets (particularly for hyps with media files like mp3/webp/mp4), which prevents world entry despite the world technically working. The loading screen gets stuck because it tries to load missing files. HowieDuhzit emphasized that the core issue is inadequate error handling - even with missing files, users should still be able to enter worlds with broken elements rather than being completely blocked at the loading screen. Ash investigated but couldn't reproduce the issue, suggesting that the problem might be related to running world clean on live worlds without restarting the world server afterward, as the running world would retain references to deleted blueprints.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Anyone else notice world clean is deleting files but not dB entries sometimes? (asked by 0mka) A: Ash hasn't seen it and asked for reproduction steps (answered by ash)\nQ: How can the issue be reproduced? (asked by ash) A: Add a hyp to world with assets in config, delete via apps list, run world clean, try to re-enter world and check console for missing assets (answered by 0mka)\nQ: Is it internet related? (asked by .hyp shaman) A: Unrelated, happened for those with fiber as well (answered by 0mka)\nQ: What's the core issue with world clean? (asked by .hyp shaman) A: World clean is removing hyps files from assets folder but not DB entries, causing loading issues (answered by HowieDuhzit)\n\n## 3.

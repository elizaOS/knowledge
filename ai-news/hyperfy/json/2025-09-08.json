      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussions in the developers channel focused on several technical topics. Nicola Bertoglio sought help with an animated .glb object that wasn't animating in his space, and Gert-Jan Akerboom provided a solution using a .hype file where Nicola could upload his .glb and select the animation. Teknopath shared progress on a PR related to error reporting for blueprint modifications and announced updates to hyper-nat, making it npx-based and Hyperfy-friendly for pair programming without servers. Ash mentioned that Vibe World was temporarily down with building and AI disabled. There were discussions about accessing Hyperfy via openXR, with teknopath noting that Hyperfy works on Quest 3 with some limitations. MetaMike inquired about AR use cases, with maximus suggesting card games and traditional games like mini golf. The channel also touched on security concerns with npm packages, though ash confirmed Hyperfy wasn't affected due to minimal dependencies. Teknopath reported positive results from remote tooling development.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do you have any suggestions for an animated .glb object that doesn't animate in my space? (asked by Nicola Bertoglio) A: Download the .hype file, drag and drop it in your world, click the cube icon and upload your .glb and then in the .hype app UI select the animation. (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: Is there a way to access Hyperfy via openXR? (asked by MetaMike) A: Unanswered\nQ: Does anyone have an AR use case? (asked by MetaMike) A: The main one i have is playing card games where you can play a card and Ai/code generates a model and interaction between the cards in play. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Are the npm packages in the security alert used by Hyperfy? (asked by maximus) A: Nah i think we good. We intentionally don't have many dependencies to avoid bloat, which i guess is useful here. (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about Hyperfy's token economics and project philosophy rather than technical implementations. Several users debate whether investor focus is necessary, with some arguing that token transparency (unlock schedules, allocations) is essential while others emphasize that the technology should be the primary focus. There's a brief technical interaction where a user asks about toggling the free roam camera in Hyperfy v2, which was previously accessible via the \"P\" key in v1. A community member shares that this functionality is now available through a separate app with UI settings and toggles. Additionally, there's a security alert shared about malicious code, though details aren't elaborated upon.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I toggle the free roam camera in v2? This was \"P\" in v1 (asked by untitled, xyz) A: For now it's an app you need to add first. It has a UI for settings and toggles (answered by vox)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: vox | Helpee: untitled, xyz | Context: User needed to know how to toggle free roam camera in Hyperfy v2 which previously used \"P\" key in v1 | Resolution: vox shared that it's now a separate app with UI settings and toggles, and provided a link\n\n## 4.

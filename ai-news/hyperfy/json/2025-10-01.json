      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment covers a few technical topics related to user permissions in a virtual world platform, likely Hyperfy. The main discussion revolves around revoking builder rights from players who are not currently in the world. It was clarified that builder rights persist when users leave and return, and currently, the only way to revoke these rights is when both the admin and the user are simultaneously present in the world. This permission data is persistent in world storage. There was also a brief mention of a pull request related to Azure OpenAI endpoint integration, which someone implemented locally with success. Additionally, a mobile version issue was raised regarding image viewing capabilities and the suggestion for a zoom function.\n\n## 2.

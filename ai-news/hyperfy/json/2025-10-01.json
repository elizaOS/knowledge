      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains brief technical discussions about builder rights management in Hyperfy worlds. A key limitation was identified: builder rights can only be revoked when both the admin and the builder are simultaneously present in the world. The persistence of builder rights was confirmed - they remain even when users leave and return later. There was also a brief mention of a pull request (#134) related to Azure OpenAI endpoint integration, which someone implemented locally with success. A mobile version issue regarding image viewing and zoom functionality was raised. The discussion was relatively short with limited technical depth.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to revoke builder rights from players that are not in the world? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: No, they need to be in the world at the time to manage their rights. (answered by .hyp shaman and ash)\nQ: In the mobile version, how can we better view images? Could you activate a zoom function? (asked by Nicola Bertoglio) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on technical developments in Hyperfy's v2 platform. Ashxn made several significant updates, including fixing a camera initialization bug, implementing a treasure chest feature for persistent storage, and introducing a health/damage system. A major breaking change was announced regarding `control.setEffect`, which now requires using `world.getPlayer(playerId)` to get player handles, enabling better tracking of effects and proper cleanup when apps are destroyed. The UI received improvements with fixes to scrolling issues in the inspector pane and enhanced health bar visuals. Developers discussed animation capabilities, with interest in bone transformation controls for more natural character movements like head-turning and blended animations. Several community members shared demos and worked on tools like \"hyperdex\" and \"hypdeck\" for organizing and sharing code snippets.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to get the camera's current position and rotation before setting it? (asked by ~/HowiEDuhzit) A: Yes, but there was a bug where initial values were all zeros; this has been fixed (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can I list player ID in the world? (asked by ~/HowiEDuhzit) A: Yes, this functionality is now available (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can we get a setBoneTransform()? (asked by ~/HowiEDuhzit) A: Initially thought impractical due to animation overrides, but later recognized as valuable for features like head-turning and blended animations (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I ensure UI interactions return to world space after showing screen-level UI? (asked by Omka) A: The UI issue was identified as a core problem and fixed in the dev branch (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

User \"treed\" asked about the process of manually adding glb_url attributes to NFTs, uploading GLB files to Arweave, and including data transactions as hidden attributes. User \"untitled, xyz\" confirmed this was the correct approach, similar to the process treed had used with VRM files. Treed also inquired about batch minting 3D NFTs and generating 3D NFT collections using layered 3D models in Blender. The chat also included a security warning from ApeironCreations about a user impersonating Ashxn, advising others to verify user IDs. Other discussions included brief mentions of Hyperfy's potential for sports games and Beeple's upcoming AI and gaming events.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's a good v2 site to check out? (asked by FortyMcNiner) A: Tatted alien club pretty cool imo (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do you add glb_url to NFTs?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on 3D design tools, file formats, and asset optimization. Key technical topics included:\n\nHowieDuhzit's Hyperfy Tools for Blender, now available as an official Blender extension, with users directed to install it through Blender's preferences rather than GitHub. A floor asset was shared that automatically snaps to origin with an attached script.\n\nTexture rendering settings were discussed, with Ashxn identifying that changing texture filtering from \"closest\" to \"linear\" fixed blurriness issues in GLB files, though HowieDuhzit noted \"closest\" is preferred for pixel-perfect 3D pixel art.\n\nSignificant troubleshooting occurred around VRM file formats, with bear encountering errors related to skinned mesh nodes. MisfitPIXELS provided a detailed workflow for properly rigging and exporting VRM models, including steps for armature creation, weight painting, and mesh joining.\n\nA display board for JPEGs/PNGs was developed with help from Ashxn, who suggested changing image.objectFit from 'fill' to 'cover' to maintain aspect ratios without stretching.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Where can I find the Blender tools? (asked by mrtzhckr) A: Install directly through Blender's preferences under extensions and search for \"hyperfy tools\" (answered by ~/HowiEDuhzit)\nQ: Does Hyperfy Tools always nest everything in a LOD no matter what? (asked by Ashxn) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why is my VRM upload throwing an error about skinned mesh nodes? (asked by bear) A: The model has bones not hooked up to meshes and needs proper rigging (answered by Valiant and MisfitPIXELS)\nQ: Do the fingers need to move in the VRM model?

Users reported problems with scrolling in the Inspector Pane after the Treasure Chest update, which was acknowledged and tracked on GitHub (issue #57). A fix was implemented for scaling issues that were causing octree problems. There was a discussion about the proper way to hide models in v2, with clarification that using `active = false` is the correct approach rather than `visible = false`. Another issue involved PhysX warnings about triangles being too large in the simulation, which was identified as likely coming from the grass/floor elements. Users also briefly discussed the need for a default grid or a dedicated floor app to avoid layering issues.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is this the correct way to hide the original model/glb in v2? `cube.visible = false;` (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Use `cube.active = false` instead (answered by ash)\nQ: Any idea what's causing this PhysX warning about triangles being too big?

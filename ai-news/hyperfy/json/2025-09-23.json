      "summary": "# Analysis of \"ðŸ’»â”‚developers\" Channel Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment is very brief, containing only a question from Valiant about finding examples of applications that use the control.touchStick functionality for purposes other than avatar movement. Ash responds suggesting that this feature might not be fully implemented in the app runtime yet, as they couldn't find any applications currently using it. The conversation is exploratory in nature, with developers trying to understand the current state and implementation examples of the touchStick control in the platform.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does anyone have or know of a .hyp that uses control.touchStick to control/move anything other than avatar? (asked by Valiant) A: I'm wondering if maybe it's not hooked up to the app runtime yet, because I can't find any apps that currently use it. (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

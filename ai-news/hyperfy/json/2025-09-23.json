      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on Gaussian Splatting technology and its integration with Hyperfy. Valiant inquired about using control.touchStick for non-avatar movement, with ash suggesting it might not be fully implemented in the runtime yet. The conversation then shifted when hiroP shared a GitHub repository (splat-transform) that enables generating 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models through prompting. mrtzhckr confirmed experimenting with this tool, using GPT-5 in Cursor to generate 3DGS content which was then imported into Hyperfy using a fork they've been developing. The generation process takes 1-2 minutes depending on complexity. mrtzhckr also proposed creating a unified generator system for Hyperfy that would support multiple media types (models, splats, images/videos, sound) through simple commands, which could enhance VR worldbuilding with speech input.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does anyone have or know of a .hyp that uses control.touchStick to control/move anything other than avatar? (asked by Valiant) A: Unanswered\nQ: How long is the gen taking in cursor (roughly)? (asked by hiroP) A: 1-2 min depending on complexity (answered by mrtzhckr)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: hiroP | Helpee: mrtzhckr | Context: Sharing information about splat-transform GitHub repository for 3DGS generation | Resolution: mrtzhckr successfully used the tool to generate 3DGS content and import it into Hyperfy\n\n## 4.

The main technical point mentioned is that the Hyperfy engine/world compiles .hyp files when users download .glb files with .js attached. There's a question about creating colliders on GLB files, which was answered with a video tutorial link. A user expressed interest in migrating a project from Cryptovoxels to Hyperfy. Another user mentioned enjoying manipulating AI-generated objects and making them generative. Overall, the chat shows community members sharing resources and expressing enthusiasm about the platform's capabilities, but contains limited detailed technical discussion.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to create colliders on GLB? (asked by marlus) A: This video might help you out https://youtu.be/NWTIZv2GTgw?si=BI_1Sfc7pXIFrrRU&t=1380 (answered by Dhin)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Dhin | Helpee: marlus | Context: Creating colliders on GLB files | Resolution: Shared a YouTube tutorial video link with timestamp\n\n## 4.

A user named \".hyp shaman\" mentioned hitting their monthly limit again, suggesting this is a recurring issue. Later, \"ash\" noted that LiveKit had updated their pricing structure, increasing the base price to $50/month. Ash suggested that self-hosting LiveKit might be more cost-effective for smaller deployments (fewer than 50 active worlds), while using LiveKit's managed service would be preferable at larger scales. This appears to be a discussion about infrastructure costs and scaling considerations for a platform that uses LiveKit for real-time communication.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What happened to LiveKit pricing? (asked by ash) A: They updated their free limits, and their base price is now $50/mo (answered by ash)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: .hyp shaman | Context: Hitting LiveKit usage limits and considering options | Resolution: Suggested self-hosting for smaller deployments (<50 active worlds) and using managed service at scale\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Consider evaluating self-hosted LiveKit as an alternative to the managed service | Description: Due to price increases and usage limits being hit | Mentioned By: ash\nTechnical: Monitor LiveKit usage to prevent hitting limits | Description: User hit limits multiple months in a row | Mentioned By: .hyp shaman",

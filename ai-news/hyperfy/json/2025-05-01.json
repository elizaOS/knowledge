      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat focused on several technical developments in the Hyperfy platform. Cru shared a tool for extracting code from Hyps in batch format. Ashxn demonstrated procedural world generation using PRNG to create environments with thousands of objects without networking overhead, sharing code examples and optimization techniques for VR performance. The discussion highlighted transparency issues in VR and the importance of performance optimization across devices. Vox showcased a world using instancing for fast mobile loading. Users discussed VR compatibility issues with PICO 4 headsets. Vincent encountered problems with TV screen sharing functionality, which was identified as requiring LiveKit server integration. Community members also tested world boundaries and discovered unintended ways to access restricted areas, providing valuable feedback for developers.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do we need the gltf.report equivalent for hyps? (asked by Ashxn) A: Could be handy, could be done within Hyperfy or as a dedicated tool. (answered by cru)\nQ: Doesn't VR work for anyone else on PICO 4? Am I doing something wrong? (asked by PabloFM | Numinia) A: Performance matters. Some worlds run well on Quest 3, but PICO 4 might need browser updates or firmware updates. (answered by Ashxn and hypb0gie)\nQ: How many worlds are running on hyperfy.xyz domains now? (asked by peezy) A: There are about 6, with more being developed. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Why does the TV with screen sharing keep cycling through when I hold F to use it? (asked by vincentskele) A: You need LiveKit server for streaming/audio features including voice chat and screen share. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Is sound a thing? (asked by vincentskele) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

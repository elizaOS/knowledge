Summary:\nThe conversation focuses on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technology and its integration with Hyperfy. hiroP shared a GitHub repository called \"splat-transform\" that enables generating 3DGS models through prompting. mrtzhckr confirmed he tested this approach by using GPT-5 in Cursor to generate Gaussian splats and then importing them into Hyperfy using his fork. The generation process takes 1-2 minutes depending on complexity. They discussed the rapid evolution of splatting technology and the potential for creating a unified generator system in Hyperfy for various media types (models, splats, images/videos, sound) that would enhance VR worldbuilding with speech input. Both users expressed excitement about the SOG export feature in the shared repository.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How long does generating 3DGS using GPT-5 in Cursor take? (asked by hiroP) A: 1-2 min depending on complexity (answered by mrtzhckr)\nQ: What is the workflow for creating prompted gaussians? (asked by hiroP) A: Generating 3DGS using the CLI repo with GPT-5 in Cursor and importing into Hyperfy using mrtzhckr's fork (answered by mrtzhckr)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: hiroP | Helpee: mrtzhckr | Context: Sharing information about a new tool for generating 3D Gaussian Splatting models | Resolution: mrtzhckr successfully tested the tool and confirmed it works with Hyperfy\nHelper: mrtzhckr | Helpee: hiroP | Context: Providing feedback on testing the splat-transform repository | Resolution: Shared results of experiments with different AI models (Claude, GPT-5) for generating 3DGS\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nType: Feature | Description: Create a unified .hyp generator for multiple media types (models, splats, images/video, sound) with speech input for VR worldbuilding | Mentioned By: mrtzhckr\nType: Technical | Description: Continue integration of 3D Gaussian Splatting into Hyperfy | Mentioned By: hiroP\nType: Technical | Description: Improve prompting for better 3DGS generation results | Mentioned By: mrtzhckr",

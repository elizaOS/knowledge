      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around UI development, player controller modifications, and app functionality in what appears to be a game development environment. Ashxn has been working on UI components and has completed most of the interface. There's discussion about modifying player behavior using apps, specifically for creating isometric character controllers. Community members reference examples like pew.bet where apps were used to modify player emotes. 0mka mentions working on side tabs for the UI and maintaining their own fork rather than merging changes. There's also conceptual discussion about \"equipable skinned meshes\" that would allow attaching items like watches, belts, or backpacks to player characters while keeping hands free. The conversation indicates ongoing collaborative development with UI improvements receiving positive feedback from the community.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is it possible to dynamically change the behavior/animations of the player controller exclusively using apps? (asked by cru) A: Yes, examples include Saori modifying player emotes in pew.bet and peezy implementing it in coliseum world for PVE fights, both using player.applyEffect({emote}) (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Which plugin are you referring to? (asked by jin) A: The fleek one (answered by peezy)\nQ: Is anyone here in the Bay area? (asked by general hyper) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: cru | Context: Creating isometric character controller using apps | Resolution: Explained that others have modified player emotes using player.applyEffect({emote}), but noted that first person, isometric, and top-down views aren't as flexible as third-person implementations\nHelper: hypb0gie | Helpee: Ashxn | Context: Confusion about empty message | Resolution: Clarified the concept of equipable skinned meshes like belts or watches for attaching apps to player characters\n\n## 4.

Users also mentioned market conditions affecting $hyper token price. The conversation included references to Hyperfy's capabilities for handling multiple assets and the potential for creating game-like experiences. Overall, the chat was more social than technical, with limited concrete problem-solving or implementation details.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can hyperfy v2 hold up good with that many assets?

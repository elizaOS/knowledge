      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on camera management improvements and various development projects. Shiffty updated the camera manager with free cam mode that doesn't require right mouse to rotate and added mouse scroll to change move speed. Ashxn provided feedback on making rotation smoother, leading to adjustments in FREECAM_LERP_FACTOR and MOVE_EASING parameters. Several developers showcased their projects: 0mka demonstrated a minimap system that tracks players and portals, a calendar/events feature, and a quadrant-based minimap. Lastraum implemented social features including feeds, friends, finder, guilds, rewards, analytics, and VRM avatar management into \"the Forge.\" There was discussion about WebGPU becoming the default on Safari and visionOS, with debate about potentially rewriting the Hyperfy engine to leverage WebGPU's capabilities like compute shaders and hi-z occlusion culling. Ashxn noted that while WebGPU offers advantages, it might be a year before widespread adoption across devices. The chat also touched on community building, with suggestions about funding developers, providing AI API access, and creating polished experiences to showcase the engine's capabilities.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I make camera rotation smoother? (asked by Ashxn) A: Increase the FREECAM_LERP_FACTOR for smoother rotation like v1 (answered by Shiffty)\nQ: How do I access the camera when there is zero UI? (asked by vox) A: Use the CameraManagerFreecamToggle.hyp file (answered by hiroP)\nQ: Is it possible to display the avatar picture from a hyp? (asked by 0mka) A: That's not a picture, it's a window that fully loads the avatar (answered by peezy)\nQ: Is it possible to add a fullscreen mode for the screenshare app? (asked by Alephic) A: The video node is in 3D world-space and can't be put in screen-space yet, though it's possible but not implemented in the engine (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How big of a job would it be to rewrite the engine in WebGPU? (asked by zzzzzzzzzzz) A: Only need to update the renderer and shader stuff, the vast majority of the engine would stay the same (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

Members exchanged greetings and discussed watching Apple's WWDC25 event together in Discord, with Cynnx setting up a Discord event link for this purpose. There was a brief technical question about portal setup from Cayden0207, though the response was minimal. The conversation touched on metaverse developments, with mentions of \"Verse launch\" and metaverse interoperability. A technical highlight was b0gie mentioning they got \"eliza\" working again and suggesting reactivating \"mj\" (likely AI agents). CheddarQueso and b0gie discussed creating multiple AI agents for a hackathon project, with b0gie noting that \"each agent needs a computer\" and asking for help with additional computers. 0mka suggested running the agents on a server instead.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Did I set up the portal correctly if I want to make a portal for exit and entrance purpose? (asked by Cayden0207) A: portals go to places (answered by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\nQ: When is WWDC25?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🪙│hyper Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily revolves around Hyperfy's tokenomics and market positioning compared to competitors like Verse World. Community members express that Hyperfy is significantly undervalued (at under $6M market cap) compared to Verse World (which fluctuated between $100M and $50M). Several members note that Hyperfy lacks visibility despite having superior technology and a more substantive product. The tokenomics model is described as dual-purpose, serving both governance and marketplace functions. There's consensus that once marketing efforts increase, Hyperfy's value should rise significantly. Some concern is expressed about the project's connection to ElizaOS and the need to adapt to the growing interest in virtual environments. The community appears confident in the long-term value proposition but acknowledges the current market is driven more by hype than substance.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Has this token currently designed a proper tokenomics model? (asked by haihui) A: It's dual-purpose as both a governance and marketplace token. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a marketing plan soon? (asked by simk) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat contains a brief exchange where user 0mka provides instructions to another user (tagged as <@309735511461724171>) about using a place feature. The instructions explain that users can designate places, toggle visibility of place animations, and set up commands and portals for teleportation between places. 0mka mentions that places can be linked to any portal to create doorways, and that there's a UI component that allows users to click and teleport to all available places from one location.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I set up a place for teleportation? (implied by 0mka) A: Drop places where you want, turn off visibility of the place animation and toggle. The command is just the name of the place.

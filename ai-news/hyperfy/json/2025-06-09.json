      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: ðŸ’»â”‚developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on camera management improvements and various development projects. Shiffty updated the camera manager with free cam mode that doesn't require right mouse to rotate and added mouse scroll to change move speed. Ashxn provided feedback on making rotation smoother, leading to adjustments in FREECAM_LERP_FACTOR and MOVE_EASING parameters. Several developers showcased their projects: 0mka demonstrated a minimap system that tracks players and portals, a calendar/events feature, and a quadrant-based minimap. Lastraum implemented social features including feeds, friends, finder, guilds, rewards, analytics, and VRM avatar management into \"the Forge.\" There was discussion about WebGPU becoming the default on Safari and visionOS, with debate about potentially rewriting the Hyperfy engine to leverage WebGPU's capabilities like compute shaders and hi-z occlusion culling. Ashxn noted that while WebGPU offers advantages, it might be a year before widespread adoption across devices. The chat also touched on community building, with suggestions about funding developers, providing AI API access, and creating polished experiences to showcase the engine's capabilities.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I make camera rotation smoother? (asked by Ashxn) A: Increase the FREECAM_LERP_FACTOR for smoother rotation like v1 (answered by Shiffty)\nQ: How do I access the camera when there is zero UI? (asked by vox) A: Use the CameraManagerFreecamToggle.hyp file (answered by hiroP)\nQ: Is it possible to display the avatar picture from a hyp? (asked by 0mka) A: That's not a picture, it's a window that fully loads the avatar (answered by peezy)\nQ: Is it possible to add a fullscreen mode for the screenshare app? (asked by Alephic) A: The video node is in 3D world-space and can't be put in screen-space yet, though it's possible but not implemented in the engine (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How big of a job would it be to rewrite the engine in WebGPU? (asked by zzzzzzzzzzz) A: Only need to update all the renderer and shader stuff. The vast majority of the engine would stay the same. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

Community members discussed watching Apple's WWDC25 event together in a Discord theater, with Cynnx setting up a link for the event. There was a brief question about portal setup from Cayden0207, who shared their portal configuration but received minimal technical guidance. Some members mentioned \"metaverse interoperability\" and discussed agent technology, with b0gie mentioning getting \"eliza working again\" and suggesting they should \"boot up mj again.\" CheddarQueso and b0gie had a brief exchange about creating multiple agents for a hackathon, with b0gie noting that \"each agent needs a computer\" and 0mka asking if they could run it on a server instead. The chat also included references to metaverse developments and Verse launch.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Did I set up the portal correctly if I want to make a portal for exit and entrance purpose?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"ðŸª™â”‚hyper\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily revolves around Hyperfy's tokenomics and market positioning compared to competitors like Verse World. Community members express that Hyperfy is significantly undervalued (at under $6M market cap) compared to Verse World (which fluctuated between $100M and $50M). Several members note that Hyperfy lacks visibility despite having superior technology and a more substantive product. The tokenomics model is described as dual-purpose, serving both governance and marketplace functions. There's consensus that once marketing efforts increase, Hyperfy's value should rise significantly. Some concerns were raised about token distribution, with clarification that a large portion is held in the DAO and as unclaimed airdrops. One member expressed concern about Hyperfy's dependence on ElizaOS's success and suggested a contingency plan might be needed.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Has this token currently designed a proper tokenomics model? (asked by haihui) A: It's dual-purpose as both a governance and marketplace token. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a marketing plan soon? (asked by simk) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

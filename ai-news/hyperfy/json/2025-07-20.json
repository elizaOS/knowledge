      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focuses on animation and interaction development in Hyperfy. Ashxn is working on head tracking, gaze mechanics, and humanoid animation compatibility beyond Mixamo. They've implemented immersive features that received positive feedback from the community. There's also discussion about held object support (guns, bows, staffs) and raycast projectiles. 0mka is developing a gold collection system for Hyperscape with features like randomized gold, persistent player storage, and instanced replicated chests with tracking. The system is designed to be compatible across platforms (mobile/VR/Eliza). Other topics include user input methods (hijacking chat for text input) and documentation resources. The developers are focused on creating immersive, detailed experiences with cross-platform compatibility.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there an easy way to prompt user for text input? (asked by shmoji) A: You can hijack the chat (answered by Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘)\nQ: Was double jump axed? (asked by Valiant) A: I just disabled it while I figure things out. Head tracking and flipping doesn't go together yet (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Where can I find documentation? (asked by emotionull) A: Check #resources and https://deepwiki.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy (answered by 0mka)\nQ: Head look? (asked by Ashxn) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

The conversation primarily consists of casual greetings (\"gm\", \"gmgm\") and a brief discussion about Base app invites. One user (Ashxn) asked for a Base app invite, sharing links to join.base.app and a Twitter post. Another user (.hyp shaman) mentioned that they thought it was just a rebranding of Coinbase wallet, but wasn't certain. There was also a single question about approaching Delphi or Alliance DAO, but it received no responses. Overall, this chat segment lacks substantive technical content, problem-solving, or implementation discussions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Anyone got a spare base app invite? (asked by Ashxn) A: Partial response by .hyp shaman suggesting it might be a renamed Coinbase wallet\nQ: You guys ever tried to approach delphi or alliance dao?

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in 🐞│issues Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion centers around an issue where users are unable to access a world after running a world clean operation. User 0mka reports that restarting the server after cleaning the world did not resolve the problem. The issue appears to occur particularly when hyperlinks (hyps) with additional files attached beyond just GLB files are deleted. Even though the hyperlinks were deleted and the world was saved afterward, errors still occur when trying to access the world. Ash notes they only run world clean when the server is off, which might explain why they haven't encountered this issue. 0mka clarifies that the world clean happens on a schedule (hourly/daily) and in this case occurred when no one was in the world. As a workaround, 0mka was able to restore access by manually adding the missing assets back to the world/assets folder, but acknowledges this isn't ideal for users without server access. The suggestion is to modify the system to allow world access even when assets are missing, perhaps by displaying a \"crashblock\" instead of preventing entry entirely.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does restarting the server after world clean resolve the issue? (asked by 0mka) A: No, restarting the server post world clean did not resolve the issue (answered by 0mka)\nQ: What types of hyperlinks seem to cause the issue? (asked by 0mka) A: Typically hyperlinks with additional files attached to the GLB, while hyperlinks with just GLB files seemed to be fine (answered by 0mka)\nQ: How was the world access restored? (asked by 0mka) A: By identifying the missing assets from console logs and manually readding them to the world/assets folder on the server (answered by 0mka)\n\n## 3.

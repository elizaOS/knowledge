          "text": "Animation and movement systems were a major focus. Developers discussed best practices for rigging avatars, such as disconnecting the root bone from the hips to improve animation blending and retargeting. A state machine was introduced to manage animation transitions based on player input and state (e.g., jumping, running). Custom animation overrides were implemented using localPlayer.replaceAnimations, and preload: true was added to props and emotes to reduce lag.",

A dual currency system was also introduced, with one currency tied to kills and used for cosmetic rewards.",

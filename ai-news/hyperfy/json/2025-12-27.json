      "summary": "# Analysis of ⚡│general Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief discussion about using Ready Player Me (RPM) avatars in Hyperfy environments. Fibelius shared their experience using RPM avatars as animated NPCs in Hyperfy v1 worlds during hackathon competitions and investor meetings. They noted that RPM had a useful feature allowing URL parameters to download avatars with different optimization levels, making them usable in Hyperfy despite not knowing how to optimize avatars properly. Fibelius acknowledged that building a working avatar builder is challenging, mentioning that while RPM's early builder had limitations, alternatives like VRChat SDK and Avaturn performed better. BallisticBanana mentioned customizing an RPM avatar in Blender by editing the clothes to add personal branding elements. The conversation briefly touched on technical aspects of avatar optimization and implementation in virtual environments.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can those avatars be used in Hyperfy? (asked by Fibelius) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can our chart ever recover? (asked by vking1337) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

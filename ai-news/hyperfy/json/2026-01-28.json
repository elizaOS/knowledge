      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment discusses testing of a Hyperfy instance hosted at hyperfy.roustan.xyz. Valiant tests the site and reports that while the wallet connect button works, there appears to be an issue with world loading. They speculate this might be because the world is waiting for a player to connect. 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 mentions that v1 should load until April 1st, which Valiant confirms, noting that v1 is fully functional but resource-intensive, causing FPS drops. HypPrivakos adds that each world runs in its own container, suggesting isolation between worlds should prevent cross-world issues.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does the wallet button work on hyperfy.roustan.xyz? (asked by Valiant) A: Yes, the wallet button works though the world may not load properly (answered by Valiant)\nQ: Why doesn't the world load properly? (asked by Valiant) A: It might be because \"there's nothing actually loading into it so the world is kinda paused waiting for a 'player'\" (answered by Valiant)\nQ: Does v1 load on the site? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: Yes, v1 loads in and appears to be fully functional (answered by Valiant)\nQ: How does v1 perform? (asked by Valiant) A: It \"eats up resources and thrashes fps\" (answered by Valiant)\n\n## 3.

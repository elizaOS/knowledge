Ashxn shared an experimental method to dynamically load GLB models from URLs using `world.load('model', URL)` followed by `world.add(model)`. This feature was enthusiastically received, with HypPrivakos noting they had requested similar functionality in Decentraland for years. Gert-Jan Akerboom encountered issues with animated skinned meshes and collision using the Hyperfy Tools Blender addon, with Valiant suggesting manual collision setup as a workaround. The chat also referenced alternative Blender addons in the Hyperfy source code. Other technical topics included query parameters (currently not implemented), and Gh0sTt mentioning an upcoming bot and API repository. 0mka shared progress on DMs and chat channels, and asked about mobile and VR compatibility plans.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Anyone knows if there is a way to dynamically replace or load a 3D model into the world on load? (asked by creazy.eth) A: You can dynamically load any glb from a url using `world.load('model', 'https://somewhere.com/something.glb')` followed by `world.add(model)` (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Does this become attached to that script? How would you be able to toggle its visibility? (asked by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz) A: It's spawned in the context of the app that loads it, it's the same as any other node hierarchy you can deconstruct meshes independently (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Are query parameters implemented right now? (asked by creazy.eth) A: Nope (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can animated skinned meshes have collision? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Have you tried adding collisions manually? Sometimes the plugin messes things up, but when manually setting/making the collisions it is fine (answered by Valiant)\nQ: Mobile and VR friendly in the plans? (asked by 0mka) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on technical discussions around implementing and optimizing seat functionality in Hyperfy. User 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 successfully implemented seat v2 with Actions by copying scripts from v2 to replace v1 scripts, then re-adding emotes. This approach saved significant time compared to copying 40 individual positions across three instances. The implementation was confirmed working on mobile devices. There was also discussion about file size optimization for sitting animations, with 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 noting that one particular GLB file was unusually large compared to others (which typically range from 100-200KB). A lighter alternative was mentioned, though it had positioning issues requiring seat height adjustments. Additionally, there was a brief discussion about the technical feasibility of creating No Man's Sky-like aesthetics in web environments, with mentions of hardware limitations and the potential impact of WebGPU integration.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to make worlds as aesthetically pleasing as No Man's Sky or is the web too limiting? (asked by Jayzen) A: It's possible but would require significant development resources similar to what went into No Man's Sky (answered by Agent12)\nQ: Will WebGPU integration help with creating more visually impressive web experiences? (asked by Jayzen) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is the project dead? (asked by Filbert) A: Only at the end. (answered by Pete)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"🪙│hyper\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion and is primarily focused on price movements, trading strategies, and branding considerations for the Hyperfy token. There was a brief discussion about Hyperfy's early positioning as a \"brand coin\" due to its focus on various technologies (AI, VR, virtual worlds, avatars, digital collectibles). A user named Ashxn mentioned they had considered this approach in the early days since Hyperfy is a technology company building interconnected tech. The chat also references news about Emirates accepting crypto payments for flights, which may have influenced token price. Overall, the conversation is casual with limited technical substance, focusing more on price action, market sentiment, and brief reflections on branding strategy.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does anyone know this guy? I couldn't quite understand what he meant exactly or what his intention was. (asked by Saracismo) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can y'all dunk on the price some more so I can re-up and go back to sleep? (asked by general hyper) A: Unanswered\nQ: You mean we can buy spirits with crypto now? (asked by Ashxn) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nNo significant help interactions were present in this chat segment.\n\n## 4. Action Items\nFeature: Consider repositioning Hyperfy as a brand coin with the Hyperfy mascot replacing the coin image | Description: Suggestion shared via tweet to fully position Hyperfy as a brand coin | Mentioned By: Rick (sharing osf_rekt's tweet)",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion centers around 3D modeling tools and workflows, particularly focusing on text-to-3D avatar generation. Community members are exploring a tool that generates clean 3D meshes but requires manual rigging and texture improvements. The generated meshes are described as 75% usable with needed tweaks, saving modeling time but requiring post-processing. Texturing approaches were discussed, with mentions of vertex painting and UCUPaint in Blender as alternatives to the auto-generated textures that were described as looking \"drawn by a child.\" There's also discussion about Sparc 3D for image-to-3D conversion, followed by Quadremeshing to reduce polygon count from 1 million to 10k triangles. The conversation indicates anticipation for more advanced text-to-avatar generation capabilities, particularly for rigged models that can be exported to different environments.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does it have rigging + animations? (asked by .hyp shaman) A: Yes, it does have rigging + anims (answered by Valiant)\nQ: What was wrong with the texture? (asked by Valiant) A: It looks drawn on by a child (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: Where's this text-to-avatar that Ash is teasing? (asked by cwe) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Valiant | Helpee: .hyp shaman | Context: Discussing quality of auto-generated meshes | Resolution: Confirmed meshes are clean but have too much geometry in places, good for re-texturing\nHelper: .hyp shaman | Helpee: cwe | Context: Confusion about which tool was being discussed | Resolution: Clarified the tool location and suggested using the \"lab\" for newest features\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nTechnical: Manual VRM rigging needed for generated meshes | Description: Auto-generated meshes require manual rigging for full usability | Mentioned By: .hyp shaman\nTechnical: Texture improvement needed for generated models | Description: Replace auto-generated textures with custom painting using UCUPaint or vertex painting | Mentioned By: .hyp shaman\nFeature: Rigged + generative animations | Description: Need for exportable rigged models with animations that work in different environments | Mentioned By: .hyp shaman\nFeature: Better face generation | Description: Needs an \"adetailer kinda thing for better faces\" | Mentioned By: cwe",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on dynamic 3D model loading in Hyperfy. Ashxn shared an experimental method to dynamically load GLB models from URLs using `world.load('model', url)` followed by `world.add(model)`. This feature was enthusiastically received as it allows for runtime model loading, with Lastraum noting its potential for their Game Objects plans. The loaded models behave like any other node hierarchy, allowing for mesh deconstruction and manipulation. Other technical topics included query parameter implementation status (currently not implemented), collision handling for animated skinned meshes, and Blender add-ons for Hyperfy development. Gh0sTt mentioned an upcoming bot and API repository release, and there were brief discussions about chat functionality including DMs and channels that 0mka was working on.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Anyone knows if there is a way to dynamically replace or load a 3D model into the world on load? (asked by creazy.eth) A: You can dynamically load any glb from a url using `world.load('model', 'https://somewhere.com/something.glb')` followed by `world.add(model)` (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Does this become attached to that script? How would you be able to toggle its visibility? (asked by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz) A: It's spawned in the context of the app that loads it, it's the same as any other node hierarchy you can deconstruct meshes independently (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Are query parameters implemented right now? (asked by creazy.eth) A: Nope (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can animated skinned meshes have collision? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Unanswered\nQ: Mobile and VR friendly in the plans? (asked by 0mka) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

A key technical achievement was shared by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓, who successfully implemented seat v2 with Actions by copying scripts from v2 to replace v1 scripts, then re-adding emotes. This method saved significant time compared to manually copying positions for 40 seats across three instances. The solution was confirmed to work on mobile devices. There was also discussion about optimizing GLB file sizes for sitting animations, with 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 and 0mka identifying that some sitting emotes were much larger than others (500+ KB vs the typical 100-200 KB). A lighter alternative was shared, though it had positioning issues requiring seat height adjustments. Additionally, there was a brief discussion about the technical feasibility of creating No Man's Sky-like aesthetics in web environments, with mentions of hardware limitations and the potential impact of WebGPU integration.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Anyone here played No Man's Sky? Is it possible to make worlds as aesthetically pleasing as that game or is the web too limiting to allow for that? (asked by Jayzen) A: It's within reason but would require large experienced teams and years of refinement, similar to No Man's Sky's development. (answered by Agent12 and Boosh)\nQ: I guess webgpu intergration will be a big step in that direction? (asked by Jayzen) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is the project dead? (asked by Filbert) A: Unanswered (though received joking responses)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion and is primarily focused on price movements, trading strategies, and branding considerations for the Hyperfy token. There was a brief discussion about Hyperfy's early positioning as a \"brand coin\" due to its focus on various technologies (AI, VR, virtual worlds, avatars, digital collectibles). Ashxn mentioned they had considered this approach in the early days since Hyperfy is a technology company building interconnected tech solutions. The chat also references news about Emirates accepting crypto payments for flights, which may have influenced token price movements. Some users discussed trading strategies, with one mentioning swing trading during price volatility. Overall, the conversation lacks substantive technical content or problem-solving discussions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does anyone know this guy? I couldn't quite understand what he meant exactly or what his intention was. (asked by Saracismo) A: Unanswered\nQ: What caused the recent price movement? (asked by general hyper) A: \"I think we're mostly riding off this [Emirates accepting crypto payments] and probably that guy's post dogging on hyper the other day causing price fomo\" (answered by general hyper)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: general hyper | Helpee: bpvxduu | Context: Discussion about price decline and trading approach | Resolution: general hyper suggested swing trading as a strategy during volatility, stating \"I've been making money most of this time lol not my fault you don't know how to swing trade\"\n\n## 4.

Users are exploring a text-to-3D avatar generation system that Ashxn appears to be teasing. .hyp shaman shared their experience with a tool that produces clean meshes but requires manual VRM rigging and texture reworking. The generated meshes are described as 75% usable with needed tweaks, saving modeling time but requiring texture replacement. Valiant mentioned that the tool creates excessive geometry in places but produces meshes clean enough for re-texturing. They discussed UCUPaint in Blender as an alternative to Substance Painter for texturing. Valiant shared their workflow using Sparc 3D for image-to-3D conversion (1M tris), followed by Quadremesh reduction (10K) and baking. There's interest in face rigging capabilities, particularly for eye blinking. The conversation indicates community members are actively testing various 3D generation tools and sharing their experiences with the limitations and post-processing requirements.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does it have rigging + animations? (asked by .hyp shaman) A: Yes, it does have rigging + anims (answered by Valiant)\nQ: What was wrong with the texture? (asked by Valiant) A: It looks drawn on by a child (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: Where's this text-to-avatar that Ash is teasing? (asked by cwe) A: Ashxn clarified it's something different where \"no human work needed\" (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

It shows community members sharing updates about emote optimizations and a teaser for an upcoming feature that will link Discord snowflakes (user IDs) to Hyperfy user IDs. This feature appears to be aimed at enabling game and puzzle creation in Hyperfy with the ability to reward community members through Discord. The announcement indicates that a repository for this functionality is coming soon, suggesting it will be an open-source implementation.\n\n## 2.

Ash explains that their stable server setup uses Hetzner servers in a US datacenter (Hillsboro, OR), chosen over LA for better performance. Their single server efficiently hosts around 20 worlds continuously. A user (0xLittle dog) reports experiencing frequent websocket disconnections with error 1006 on their deployment using DigitalOcean in Singapore. Ash suggests this could be due to connection issues or server networking problems, noting that DigitalOcean is usually reliable. There's also a brief mention of using Caddy as a preferred alternative to Nginx for web server configuration.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Which manufacturer do you use for your server and is it deployed with global distributed nodes? (asked by 0xLittle dog) A: We use Hetzner servers located in one of their US datacenters (Hillsboro, OR); no distributed nodes are used as it's not needed. (answered by ash)\nQ: Why do I experience frequent websocket disconnections with error 1006 on my deployment? (asked by 0xLittle dog) A: If there are no server errors in your logs, either your connection or the server networking is having issues. (answered by ash)\nQ: What web server should I use? (implied by general hyper) A: Don't suffer through nginx just use caddy. (answered by general hyper)\n\n## 3.

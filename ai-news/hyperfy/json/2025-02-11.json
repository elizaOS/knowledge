      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat revolves around Hyperfy development, focusing on the new build mode, VR integration, and community-driven improvements. Key technical discussions include:\n\nThe new build mode PR (#38) was merged, adding features like object manipulation, pinning objects to prevent accidental deletion, and double-jump functionality. WebXR integration was implemented, enabling VR support with spatial audio working perfectly in headsets.\n\nSeveral developers created innovative apps demonstrating Hyperfy's capabilities: MetaMike developed an AI-like collectron system that can detect and collect items using proximity detection and event emissions; Shiffty created a cube-based visualization system with wave patterns; and another developer created a refrigerator app with interactive door and sound effects.\n\nCommunity members worked on tools to improve the building experience, including a scene inspector/hierarchy tool to better manage objects in the world. There were discussions about optimizing assets, handling file size limits (VRM limit increased to 20MB), and implementing world settings to control who can build and equip avatars.\n\nDevelopers also discussed blockchain integration approaches, debating between modal UI components versus chat commands for wallet connections, with considerations for both Solana and EVM chains.\n\n## 2.

The primary technical information shared is about Hyperfy's development plans. Omka mentioned that a marketplace for .hyp apps and assets is being developed, and that in-world $hyper tips functionality is in progress. The chat mostly consists of token price checks using the $hyperfy command, memes, GIFs, and casual conversation. Users frequently check the HYPER token price on Solana (not Base, as clarified by QMA). The conversation includes some references to other tokens and random calls, but lacks substantial technical problem-solving or implementation details.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is hyperfy token on base?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 🧊│3d-design\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat focused on several key technical discussions around 3D design in Hyperfy. TheMattEmpire discussed VRM rigging, emphasizing the importance of T-pose models for proper rigging in Blender. A significant discussion emerged about low-poly vs. realistic art styles, with ToxSam arguing that low-poly designs are more memorable as they engage the brain's imagination to fill in details. Ashxn initiated a technical discussion about creating seamlessly tiling hexagons in Blender, which evolved into a collaborative problem-solving session with ToxSam and others sharing AI-generated solutions. This hexagon discussion inspired several members to begin developing a Fall Guys \"Hex-A-Gone\" style game in Hyperfy, with Shiffty starting implementation and discussing collision detection approaches. Pablo shared an example of procedurally generated infinite maps from Decentraland, exploring whether similar functionality could be implemented in Hyperfy. The chat also touched on code compilation in Hyperfy, with members noting that code saves and compiles automatically, making development more streamlined than in engines like Unity.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I properly rig a character in Blender for VRM export? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Make sure the character is in a T-Pose (like the VRM for Blender armature) and use the parent > Automatic rigs menu (answered by TheMattEmpire)\nQ: What's the correct way to make hexagon platforms in Blender that tile seamlessly? (asked by Ashxn) A: Use a 6-sided cylinder in Blender and position them with the correct spacing using the hexagon's dimensions (answered by ToxSam with AI assistance)\nQ: Can I create procedurally generated infinite maps in Hyperfy? (asked by Pablo) A: Yes, it should be possible to adapt code from other platforms like Decentraland (answered by maximus)\nQ: How can I add colliders to my models in Hyperfy v2? (asked by carlosmu) A: Use the Hyperfy Tools Blender add-on or follow the node collider documentation (answered by Omka and scoe)\nQ: What's the easiest way to detect if a player is standing on a mesh? (asked by Shiffty) A: Make a taller simpler shape that sits above it and use it as a trigger, or listen for contacts (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

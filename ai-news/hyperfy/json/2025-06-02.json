Ashxn shared updates about a new culling system that improves rendering performance. This system will eventually incorporate LOD (Level of Detail) logic to optimize performance by only processing visible elements. The conversation also covered screen sharing functionality available as a .hyp file, with PortalBundleV1 announced for release later that day. Voice chat implementation was discussed, with clarification that it requires LiveKit API keys for self-hosted instances. Users troubleshooted LiveKit integration issues, identifying the need for specific environment variables. The technical improvements appear to be bringing the platform closer to Unity's capabilities in terms of scene rendering control.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What the chances we can do cull by distance in a hyp? (asked by MetaRick) A: You can already do this in Blender using LODs with a max distance to match your fog. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is the screen share screen available as a hyp? (asked by Mugenomics) A: Yes, it's a .hyp (answered by á²¼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\nQ: Is voice chat still in dev too? (asked by Mugenomics) A: We've had voice chat for months. Can try it out in Fallen or the Play world. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can it be done with the free tier? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Yes, we currently only use a free tier for all of our worlds. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

The conversation revolves around a collection of papers about agents that maximus shared from LinkedIn. hiroP mentions using NotebookLM to create a 20-minute audio summary of these papers, suggesting it as a more convenient way to consume the content. Maximus acknowledges the usefulness of NotebookLM (referred to as \"LM\") but notes finding the enthusiastic tone of the generated content somewhat off-putting. hiroP responds with a humorous suggestion to modify the prompt to reduce enthusiasm, specifically suggesting a \"BBC Radio 4\" level of enthusiasm with a British-style delivery.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can one quickly consume information from multiple academic papers? (implied by hiroP) A: Use NotebookLM to create audio summaries of the papers (answered by hiroP)\nQ: How can the overly enthusiastic tone of NotebookLM be adjusted? (asked by maximus) A: Use a custom prompt specifying the desired tone, such as \"BBC Radio 4 levels of enthusiasm\" (answered by hiroP)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: hiroP | Helpee: maximus | Context: Efficiently consuming multiple agent-related papers | Resolution: Suggested using NotebookLM to create audio summaries for passive consumption\nHelper: hiroP | Helpee: maximus | Context: Finding NotebookLM's tone too enthusiastic | Resolution: Suggested prompt engineering to modify the tone to be \"pleasant but not faux enthusiastic\"\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Use NotebookLM for creating audio summaries of technical papers | Description: Leverage AI tools to convert written content to audio format for easier consumption | Mentioned By: hiroP\nTechnical: Customize NotebookLM prompts for tone adjustment | Description: Modify prompts to control the enthusiasm level of generated content | Mentioned By: hiroP",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThis chat segment is very brief with minimal technical discussion. The main technical point mentioned is about the possibility of implementing cars with guns in version 2 of what appears to be a game or platform. According to Ashxn, this feature wasn't possible in version 1 but is now feasible in version 2. Later, ~/drdoge.eth confirms that guns can be networked to cars, and standalone guns are also available that can be attached to vehicles. The conversation includes references to examples like the F117 Nighthawk and Twisted Metal (a combat vehicle game). The chat also contains several greeting messages (\"gm\") and reaction GIFs but lacks detailed technical discussions or problem-solving.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are there cars with guns? (asked by jin) A: Yes. Networked to. We also have just guns. You can put them on your cars. (answered by ~/drdoge.eth)\nQ: Would F117 nighthawk work? (asked by maximus) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: jin | Context: Question about cars with guns in the platform/game | Resolution: Explained that while not currently available, it's possible in v2 unlike v1\nHelper: ~/drdoge.eth | Helpee: jin | Context: Question about cars with guns | Resolution: Confirmed guns can be networked to cars and standalone guns can be attached to vehicles\n\n## 4.

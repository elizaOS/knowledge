      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around technical considerations for Hyperfy's V1 to V2 migration. Jin debates whether to keep or strip Draco/Meshopt compression support, weighing file size reduction and network performance against code simplicity and easier Blender pipeline integration. A potential compromise emerges: making compression optional during the build step.\n\nThe conversation highlights that V2 is simpler to host than Mozilla Hubs (which required Kubernetes and cost ~$500/month), running on a single server with a data-driven approach. However, non-technical users still face challenges with self-hosting. Jin is working on porting V1 apps to V2, including models, spawn points, environments, audio, seats, text, and images. \n\nJin shares a prioritized list of entities to port, with seats, portals, lights, and zones as high priorities. A significant technical limitation is discovered: V2 doesn't support traditional lights, only emission materials. Jin is developing a converter tool and plans to open-source it, seeking help with testing and refinement. There's also discussion about AI tools like Clawdbot that provide continuous assistance with development ideas.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Which world made with hyperfy is most advanced? (asked by Radko) A: Unanswered\nQ: Will emission in V2 reflect on models/avatars the same way as lights? (asked by jin) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: jin | Context: Jin needed information about light support in V2 | Resolution: ash clarified \"no lights in v2, just emission\"\nHelper: ash | Helpee: jin | Context: Jin needed Claude API credits and requested help purchasing a payment method | Resolution: ash attempted to buy a Bitrefill visa card but it only worked in Australia, not US\n\n## 4.

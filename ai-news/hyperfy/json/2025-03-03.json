      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on Hyperfy development, with several key technical topics emerging. ToxSam inquired about building a clicker game, receiving code examples from MetaMike and Ashxn demonstrating the use of onPointerDown events for interactive elements. The conversation revealed that material properties currently support only emission and UV scrolling modifications at runtime.\n\nA significant development was Ashxn's introduction of a new feature allowing persistent data storage between sessions, demonstrated with a treasure chest app. This was recognized as a major capability enhancement for v2, enabling timers, quests, GUIs, and action bars. The community expressed excitement about the expanded possibilities compared to v1.\n\nOther technical discussions included camera position/rotation access, bone animation manipulation requests for more natural character movements, and LOD (Level of Detail) implementation. Several developers reported issues with Claude 3.7 AI, noting decreased productivity and inconsistent behavior compared to 3.5.\n\nThe community also discussed organizing and cataloging shared .hyp files, with efforts to create searchable repositories of code snippets and examples (referred to as \"hyperdex\" or \"hypdeck\").\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to build a simple clicker game in Hyperfy? (asked by ToxSam) A: Yes, using onPointerDown events for interaction (answered by Ashxn and MetaMike)\nQ: What material properties can be influenced at runtime? (asked by MetaMike) A: Only emission and UV scroll can be modified at runtime (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is it possible to get the camera's current position and rotation? (asked by ~/HowiEDuhzit) A: Yes, but there was a bug where initial values were zeros (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can I list player IDs in the world? (asked by ~/HowiEDuhzit) A: Yes, this functionality is now available (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can we get a setBoneTransform() function? (asked by ~/HowiEDuhzit) A: Initially thought to be too niche, but later recognized as valuable for animation blending and natural movements (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Does scale work yet in v2? (asked by bear) A: Yes, but for an App's Node you need to use app.root (answered by Saori and bear)\n\n## 3.

Key technical discussions included lighting strategies for dark spaces in 3D environments, with ii_cable_ii explaining their approach to using key lights and emissive glows rather than multiple light sources per area. There was sharing of impressive 3D work examples and discussion about Blender tools for Hyperfy. A significant technical point was raised by Ashxn about LOD (Level of Detail) implementation in Hyperfy Tools, questioning whether nesting everything in a LOD structure is efficient when only one LOD exists. The chat also included mentions of Blender's recognition at an awards ceremony and the availability of Hyperfy Tools as an official Blender extension, with ~/HowiEDuhzit confirming that users should install it directly through Blender's extension system rather than from the outdated GitHub repository.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where can I find the Blender tools for Hyperfy? (asked by mrtzhckr) A: You can find it directly in Blender by opening preferences, clicking extensions, and searching for \"hyperfy tools\" (answered by ~/HowiEDuhzit)\nQ: Does Hyperfy Tools always nest everything in a LOD no matter what?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical aspects of Hyperfy development. A significant issue was identified and resolved in \"doges world\" where the game would freeze upon loading but could be unfrozen by switching tabs - the problem was traced to a \"Spear\" object. Several developers discussed UV scrolling implementation, with voxvienne successfully implementing it and sharing code. Ashxn provided important clarification about mesh handling in Blender exports, explaining that single meshes with multiple materials are automatically split into separate meshes per material in game engines. Shadow control was discussed, with Ashxn explaining two methods to control shadow casting: via Blender custom properties or through script commands. Other topics included Joint.js implementation for dynamic doors, hierarchy visualization improvements, external model loading issues, and optimization techniques. The chat also mentioned recent ThreeJS updates and upcoming production branch launches.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do we set an object to be local or synced? Is there a way we could get this on a toggle for glbs? (asked by MetaRick) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there any way we can refresh the connection in world? (asked by MetaRick) A: Unanswered\nQ: How do we begin using Joint.js to make dynamic doors? (asked by ᲼) A: The base is there but out of date, and joints need to be networked in the app to keep them in sync (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Any estimated date for the next launch in the production main branch? (asked by PabloFM | Numinia) A: Going to make one tonight or tomorrow (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can we make render ignore shadows from specific meshes? (asked by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎) A: Yes, either add custom properties in Blender (castShadow=false, receiveShadow=false) or do it via script (mesh.castShadow = false, mesh.receiveShadow = false) (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 | Context: Understanding mesh handling with multiple materials | Resolution: Explained that Blender exports split meshes by material, and merging only helps performance if using one material\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 | Context: Controlling shadows for specific meshes | Resolution: Provided two methods - Blender custom properties or script commands\nHelper: ~/HowiEDuhzit | Helpee: Ashxn | Context: Freezing issue in \"doges world\" | Resolution: Identified and fixed the issue with the Spear object\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: ᲼ | Context: Using Joint.js for dynamic doors | Resolution: Explained that joints need to be networked in the app to keep them in sync\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy, a 3D engine/platform for creating virtual experiences. A significant discussion centers on the transition from Hyperfy V1 to V2, with voxvienne sharing detailed reflections on this shift. V1 was described as a non-coder's sandbox that was accessible and versatile, while V2 appears to be more code-focused, requiring new skills including AI integration. \n\nTechnical discussions include sharing of Hyperfy worlds/experiences (play.hyperfy.xyz, fallen.hyperfy.xyz, tattedalien.club), and a brief exchange about implementing lever mechanics using node position, rotation, and quaternion manipulation. Community members shared links to their Hyperfy creations and discussed the platform's capabilities.\n\nThere was also a practical discussion about sharing apps on the Hyperworld marketplace, with szjanko and mattimus providing specific solutions for creating shareable links to collections and storefronts.\n\nThe chat shows an active community excited about Hyperfy's potential, with members sharing their builds and discussing the platform's evolution toward what they refer to as the \"Hyperfy world engine.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: I want to know which is the official cross-chain bridge from bnb to eth? (asked by mike0927) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can i play hyperfy game online? (asked by Saber) A: Hyperfy is more an engine/platform that powers experiences. Top of mind there are 3 worlds you can go to \"play\" with the engine: 1. play.hyperfy.xyz 2. fallen.hyperfy.xyz 3. tattedalien.club (answered by maximus)\nQ: I want to make a tweet for it, but it would be nice to have a link to this page (image) but that doesn't seem possible atm. Is there a workaround? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: You can share this link: https://hyperworld.host/marketplace/store/67e645c9160d09602dd9dab6 - it shows your public apps as a \"Storefront\" (answered by szjanko)\nQ: I'm trying to do exactly the same you did with the levers. Is playing with position, rotation & quaternion of the node enough to make the same effect? (asked by DevStarlight | Numinia) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why pump, we have news? (asked by johan) A: My gut is just general market movements. Sol up quite a bit recently so probably related to that. That or people recognizing that Metarick and Vox are both stepping into the ring and sharing their v2 builds recently (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: mattimus | Helpee: Gert-Jan Akerboom | Context: Needed a way to share apps from Hyperworld site | Resolution: Suggested using marketplace/apps link and collections\nHelper: szjanko | Helpee: Gert-Jan Akerboom | Context: Needed a shareable link to showcase apps | Resolution: Provided specific storefront link and explained options for customizing public/private apps and creating collections\nHelper: maximus | Helpee: Saber | Context: Asked if they could play Hyperfy game online | Resolution: Explained Hyperfy is an engine/platform and provided three specific world links to experience it\nHelper: HPrivakos | Helpee: MUDBONE | Context: Sharing Hyperfy capabilities | Resolution: Suggested uncannydev.hyperworld.host as an example of the engine supporting emissive models\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Explore implementation of lever mechanics using node position, rotation & quaternion | Mentioned By: DevStarlight | Numinia\nFeature: Consider maintaining accessibility for non-coders in V2 while embracing new code-focused approach | Mentioned By: 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎\nDocumentation: Create guides for transitioning from V1 to V2 skillsets | Mentioned By: 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎\nTechnical: Develop better integration between 3D visual design and code functionality | Mentioned By: 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎",

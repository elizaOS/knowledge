      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical aspects of Hyperfy development. Key topics included troubleshooting a freezing issue in \"doges world\" that was resolved by fixing a problematic Spear object. Developers discussed UV scrolling implementation, with voxvienne successfully implementing it and sharing code. Ashxn provided clarification about mesh handling in Blender exports, explaining that single meshes with multiple materials are split into separate meshes per material during export, which is standard across game engines. Shadow control was discussed, with Ashxn explaining two methods: using Blender custom properties or script commands. Other technical topics included Joint.js for creating dynamic doors, hierarchy visualization improvements, external model loading issues, and optimization techniques. There was also mention of upcoming updates to the production main branch, with Ashxn indicating a release would happen soon. The conversation demonstrated collaborative problem-solving and knowledge sharing among community members.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do we set an object to be local or synced? Is there a way we could get this on a toggle for glbs? (asked by MetaRick) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can we refresh the connection in-world? (asked by MetaRick) A: Unanswered\nQ: How do I begin using Joint.js to make dynamic doors? (asked by ᲼) A: The base is there but out of date, and joints need to be networked in the app to keep them in sync (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Any estimated date for the next launch in the production main branch? (asked by PabloFM | Numinia) A: Going to make one tonight or tomorrow (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can I address specific materials for UV scrolling instead of separated meshes to avoid drawcalls? (asked by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎) A: Merging/joining in Blender is only useful for performance if they all use one material (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can we make render ignore shadows from specific meshes? (asked by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎) A: Yes, either add custom properties in Blender (castShadow=false, receiveShadow=false) or do it via script (mesh.castShadow = false, mesh.receiveShadow = false) (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

A significant discussion centers on the transition from Hyperfy V1 to V2, with voxvienne sharing detailed reflections on this shift. V1 was described as a non-coder's sandbox that was accessible and versatile, while V2 appears to be more code-focused, requiring new skills including AI integration. \n\nTechnical discussions include sharing of Hyperfy worlds/experiences (play.hyperfy.xyz, fallen.hyperfy.xyz, tattedalien.club), and a brief exchange about implementing lever mechanics using node position, rotation, and quaternion manipulation. Community members shared links to their Hyperfy creations and discussed the platform's capabilities.\n\nThere was also a practical discussion about sharing apps on the Hyperworld marketplace, with szjanko and mattimus explaining how to create shareable links to storefronts and collections.\n\nThe chat shows an active community excited about Hyperfy's potential, with members encouraging each other to promote the platform (\"Hyperfy szn\") and sharing their builds.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: I want to know which is the official cross-chain bridge from bnb to eth? (asked by mike0927) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can i play hyperfy game online? (asked by Saber) A: Hyperfy is more an engine/platform that powers experiences. Top of mind there are 3 worlds you can go to \"play\" with the engine: 1. play.hyperfy.xyz 2. fallen.hyperfy.xyz 3. tattedalien.club (answered by maximus)\nQ: I want to make a tweet for it, but it would be nice to have a link to this page (image) but that doesn't seem possible atm. Is there a workaround? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: You can share this link https://hyperworld.host/marketplace/store/67e645c9160d09602dd9dab6 it shows your public apps as a \"Storefront\" (answered by szjanko)\nQ: I'm trying to do exactly the same you did with the levers. Is playing with position, rotation & quaternion of the node enough to make the same effect? (asked by DevStarlight | Numinia) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why pump, we have news? (asked by johan) A: My gut is just general market movements. Sol up quite a bit recently so probably related to that. That or people recognizing that Metarick and Vox are both stepping into the ring and sharing their v2 builds recently (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around token price movements, team allocation discussions, and a conflict regarding transparency about token distribution. A significant event was Saori transferring 2 million tokens from his personal vesting allocation to peezy as a retroactive grant for his contributions. This sparked a discussion about the team's token allocation structure, with general hyper asking for details about how the 15% team allocation is distributed. The conversation became heated when Saori was reluctant to share specific allocation details, stating this information is typically not disclosed in projects. Through the discussion, it was revealed that the team allocation is split as 9%, 4%, 1%, 1% among four people, vesting over 3 years. The chat also included updates on HYPER token price movements, with mentions of significant volume increases and price pumps. There were no substantial technical discussions about development or implementation details.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the team allocation for Hyperlane?

Summary\nThe discussion centers around a performance issue observed by MetaRick on an iPhone 16 Pro where frame rates drop from 60fps to around 48fps in a world containing only optimized GLB files with colliders. MetaRick created a fresh world to isolate the issue, ruling out apps as the cause. Ash tested the world and didn't experience the same performance drop, maintaining around 55fps. MetaRick then tested on an iPad and found no performance issues there, concluding that the problem appears to be specific to the iPhone 16 Pro. The issue was ultimately marked as closed, being identified as a device-specific problem rather than a general platform issue.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Could apps be causing the performance drop? (asked by MetaRick) A: No, MetaRick ruled this out by testing with only GLB files (answered by MetaRick)\nQ: Is the performance drop related to colliders? (asked by MetaRick) A: Unanswered\nQ: Does the performance drop happen on other devices? (asked by MetaRick) A: No, Ash maintained 55fps on their phone, and MetaRick confirmed solid 60fps on iPad (answered by Ash and MetaRick)\n\n## 3.

User \"vox\" shared updates about creating their first .hyp app and making technical improvements to gold element plane textures by changing them from mesh to non-mesh textures, which reduced geometry (\"geo\") in their project. User \"ash\" provided positive feedback on vox's work. The conversation is minimal and doesn't contain extensive technical discussions, problem-solving, or decision-making processes. The main technical point mentioned is the optimization of geometry by changing texture implementation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nNo questions were asked in this chat segment.\n\n## 3.

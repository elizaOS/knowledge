A significant revelation is that Saori, one of the co-founders, has left the server and removed Hyperfy from his social media profiles. Ash, identified as the main developer, confirmed he remains committed to the project with \"runway for years.\" The community expressed concerns about the project's future and development resources. There are ongoing technical activities including tutorials on Git/GitHub, with upcoming sessions on Architectural 3D design and Optimization. A community member (Gert-Jan Akerboom) shared work on a Butterfly V5 with improvements to prevent flying under the ground plane. The team is collecting community feedback through a survey and considering adding a product/marketing manager rather than more developers.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Who is behind this project and is there a roadmap? (asked by Jayzen) A: Ash and Saori were the founders, with a handful of regulars working along (answered by smickelbeard)\nQ: Is Saori no longer co-founder or just taking a break? (asked by Lemur) A: \"burnt out. it happens to the best of us\" (answered by ash)\nQ: Is hyperfy over? (asked by cloudAI) A: Implied no by ash's continued commitment\nQ: Is it dangerous to hold a token if there's no one to build it with? (asked by cloudAI) A: Indirectly addressed by ash confirming his continued involvement\nQ: Are you the only core developer of the current platform? (asked by cloudAI) A: \"I'm the main dev yes.\" (answered by ash)\nQ: Any plans to hire more devs to help you out? (asked by jingo) A: \"it's less about raw development power... there's lots of developers that know hyperfy and are actively doing mods.\" (answered by maximus)\nQ: Does anyone have the hyperfyV2 logo with the circle as an image file? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Valiant and 0mka provided image files\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of \"💻│developers\" Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around developers working on various features for Hyperfy, a 3D virtual world platform. Key technical discussions include:\n\nPeezy is developing mobs with weapons that can hold different items with specific animations and damage scripts. Ash suggests creating a general-purpose mob app that could accept VRMs with configurable aggro radius and damage settings. They discuss potential architecture for melee vs. ranged mobs.\n\nSeveral developers are working on collision detection systems, with peezy trying to implement mob hit detection similar to the PVP sword functionality. Ash provides code examples for creating rigidbodies and colliders with appropriate tags.\n\nThe UI underwent a significant update, with Ash releasing a new experimental UI that changes the entire interface. This sparked discussion about its usability and missing features like the nodes/hierarchy viewer.\n\nDevelopers are also working on race-related features including waypoints, gates with proximity triggers, and leaderboards. Other projects include a nuclear explosion effect, companion/controller systems, and player movement animation overrides.\n\nSeveral developers express frustration with documentation gaps, particularly around understanding available properties and methods on core objects like world, app, and control.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I detect that an entity is inside a hitbox for mob combat? (asked by peezy) A: Add a rigidbody and collider to the mob with a specific tag, then use overlap detection (answered by ash)\nQ: How does player.teleport work? (asked by general hyper) A: Unanswered\nQ: Did something change in regards to mouse controls? My control.mouseLeft.down doesn't set to true anymore (asked by smickelbeard) A: The issue is related to cursor locking in a fork; commenting out the break or onPress handler fixes it (answered by ash)\nQ: How do I make a toggle button in the UI? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Use the switch component (self-answered)\nQ: Where do I look to understand functions available to world, app, control, etc? (asked by mattimus) A: Look at the ref section and the core/extras directory, particularly buttons.js for input controls (answered by general hyper)\nQ: How do I access the position of the cursor pointer? (asked by mattimus) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why is my collider not working properly with my mesh? (asked by general hyper) A: For concave meshes, you need to set convex=false to get proper collision (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on 3D model collisions in Hyperfy worlds and animation import issues. MiaHigashikata encountered problems importing models with collisions, which ash confirmed was working in the dev branch but not yet in the main branch. The discussion revealed that Hyperfy doesn't yet support KTX textures or Draco compression due to server-side loading challenges, with webp recommended as an alternative to KTX. General hyper discussed animation import issues with models appearing as giant iconospheres, discovering they needed to be imported as VRMs with hip transform adjustments. There was also discussion about manually adding colliders in Blender versus using Hyperfy tools, with mattimus sharing a documentation link explaining the manual process. Some users expressed difficulty with Hyperfy tools, noting issues like automatic 90-degree rotations that may be unnecessary with recent fixes.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to import collisions or a 3D model with collisions in a world? (asked by MiaHigashikata) A: Use an app that auto-enables collisions for models, but note this feature was recently added to dev branch and might not be in main branch yet (answered by ash)\nQ: Is KTX texture support available? (asked by MiaHigashikata) A: No KTX/Draco support yet because server-side loading hasn't been solved; webp is recommended instead (answered by ash)\nQ: Why do animations import to Blender as a giant iconosphere? (asked by general hyper) A: They need to be downloaded from hyperfy-animations.vercel.app and imported as VRMs to Blender, then delete transforms on the hips for x,y,z (answered by general hyper)\nQ: How to apply colliders in Blender? (asked by general hyper) A: Use Hyperfy tools or follow manual instructions in documentation (answered by 0mka and mattimus)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: MiaHigashikata | Context: Importing models with collisions not working in main branch | Resolution: Confirmed it works in dev branch, user verified success\nHelper: general hyper | Helpee: Community | Context: Animations importing as giant iconospheres | Resolution: Shared workflow to download from hyperfy-animations.vercel.app, import as VRMs, and delete hip transforms\nHelper: mattimus | Helpee: general hyper | Context: Looking for documentation on manually adding colliders | Resolution: Shared link to documentation explaining the process\n\n## 4.

Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around concerns about the Hyper token's price decline, with community members expressing worry about the project's future. A significant dip was attributed to one wallet dumping $10k worth of tokens. Team member \"ash\" provided reassurance about ongoing development efforts, explaining they're working on multiple fronts: attracting content creators, building games internally, developing a Roblox-like platform, and continuing core engine work. The team acknowledged that development takes time and often appears to have periods of inactivity before sudden bursts of progress. Some users attributed market conditions to broader crypto market issues, including the impact of Trump-related tokens. Community members expressed interest in seeing a more detailed roadmap and fully-formed games with competitive features and marketplace integration.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why's the mc so low now? What happened to it? (asked by chckyo) A: Someone gave us a big sale on hyper! (answered by 0mka)\nQ: Could you briefly introduce the recent progress of the project? (asked by chckyo) A: Nah there's plenty to see all over the server. Or builders calls. (answered by 0mka)\nQ: What does Hyper Token mean to this community...? (asked by eigb) A: Unanswered\nQ: What I'm curious about is the actual release and commercialization of real games? (asked by eigb) A: Engines and games take time to finish. Check more channels than hyper to see what's happening. Roadmap updates are underway. (answered by 0mka)\n\n## 3.

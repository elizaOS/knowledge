      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: ðŸ’»â”‚developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion in the developers channel primarily focused on AR/VR applications and development progress. MetaMike inquired about AR use cases, which prompted suggestions including card games with AI-generated models and interactions, as well as AR versions of physical games like mini golf and shuffleboard. There was a technical update about Hyperfy working on Quest 3, with controllers functioning but requiring button remaps and lacking menu functionality. A developer mentioned accessing their \"local world natively\" and planning to work on mobile controls. Teknopath shared progress on new debugging tooling that's approximately 90% complete, with positive initial results from remote tooling implementation. MetaMike later shared a specific AR use case involving gun assembly/disassembly visualization for training purposes.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does anyone have an AR use case? (asked by MetaMike) A: Several users provided examples including card games with AI interactions and traditional games in AR (answered by maximus)\nQ: What's the status of Hyperfy on Quest 3?

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"âš¡â”‚general\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily contains a discussion about Hyperfy's business model and token economics rather than technical content. There's a debate between users about whether Hyperfy needs investors and token transparency, with some users expressing concern about token allocation and unlock schedules while others argue that the project can succeed based on its technology without traditional investment. The only technical discussion involves a brief exchange about toggling the free roam camera in Hyperfy v2, where a user asks how to access this feature that was available via the \"P\" key in v1. Another user provides a solution by sharing a link to an app that needs to be added first, mentioning it has a UI for settings and toggles.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I toggle the free roam camera in v2? This was \"P\" in v1 (asked by untitled, xyz) A: For now it's an app you need to add first. It has a UI for settings and toggles. (answered by vox)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: vox | Helpee: untitled, xyz | Context: User needed to know how to toggle free roam camera in Hyperfy v2 that was previously accessed with \"P\" key in v1 | Resolution: vox shared a link to an app that needs to be added first, which has a UI for settings and toggles\n\n## 4.

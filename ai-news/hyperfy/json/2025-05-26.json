Summary\nAshxn shared significant research on improving ThreeJS performance by implementing an octree-based renderer with advanced occlusion culling. This approach traverses the octree frustum first instead of looping through every object in the scene, allowing early exit for objects outside the view or occluded by other objects. Testing showed 210,000 unique objects could be rendered at just 1ms for CPU and GPU when not all were in view simultaneously. This optimization would make web-based virtual worlds with hundreds of thousands of objects viable on mobile/VR at 60fps. The discussion expanded to include world connectivity features, with developers sharing experiments on connecting worlds via trains/portals and discussing guild/faction systems. Lastraum shared progress on web3 authentication and admin rights verification. Developers also discussed UI elements, mobile controls, and device-specific content adaptation in Hyperfy v1 vs v2.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What would such performance improvement look like? (asked by Jayzen) A: It would be much more closely aligned with unity and unreal games, as ThreeJS has the most naive renderer but good rendering itself. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What about other web inherent limitations like websocket instead of udp? (asked by Jayzen) A: Websockets work well despite some latency, and alternatives like WebRTC and WebTransport offer near-UDP networking capabilities. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How does the occlusion culling technology work with VR? (asked by maximus) A: It skips rendering objects outside the camera frustum and renders objects inside from front to back, skipping occluded objects completely. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to add glow effect in hyp-v1? (asked by carlosmu) A: Increase the emissive strength in blender and adjust the colors there. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there any way to add a tutorial in hyp-v1? (asked by carlosmu) A: Unanswered\nQ: What is the utility of the hand button below the arrow? (asked by carlosmu) A: That's the interaction button if someone needs to click on something to trigger it. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Is it possible to change some contents depending on the device? (asked by carlosmu) A: v2 lets you do custom UI in hyperscript, v1 doesn't have this capability. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: carlosmu | Context: Adding glow effects in Hyperfy v1 | Resolution: Increase the emissive strength in blender and adjust the colors there\nHelper: maximus | Helpee: carlosmu | Context: Understanding the hand button functionality | Resolution: Explained it's the interaction button for clickable objects\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: carlosmu | Context: Device-specific content adaptation | Resolution: Explained v2 supports custom UI in hyperscript while v1 doesn't have this capability\n\n## 4.

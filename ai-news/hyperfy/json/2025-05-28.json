      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on development ideas for Hyperfy, particularly around repository management and packaging formats. Ashxn proposed a system where Hyperfy apps could be stored in a git-friendly format with folders containing GLB files, hyperscript, and assets, which could then be compiled into .hyp files using a build command. This would combine the benefits of version control with Hyperfy's packaging system. There was also discussion about local development and testing on VR headsets, with users sharing approaches for accessing localhost from standalone headsets through port forwarding. A user named Enryt reported successfully installing Hyperfy on Debian but encountered issues when trying to access it from a smartphone, seeing only a spinning icon. Community members suggested this might be due to using an older version and recommended updating to the latest dev build. The chat also touched on a driving game with ghost mechanics that impressed users, with maximus noting how it demonstrated making solo games feel like shared experiences.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I access my Hyperfy world on my standalone VR-headset via WiFi? (asked by Enryt) A: You need to set up port forwarding so that localhost:3000 on your headset goes to your Debian box, or deploy to a live site (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Why am I seeing a spinning icon when trying to access Hyperfy on my smartphone? (asked by Enryt) A: You might be on an older version of v2, make sure you are on the latest dev build (answered by á²¼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\nQ: Can we get the ability to clone and remix the dream driving game? (asked by Wilson) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

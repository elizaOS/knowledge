      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on mobile controls sensitivity issues in Hyperfy, particularly comparing v1 and v2 implementations. A user named carlosmu raised concerns about excessive camera and movement sensitivity on mobile devices making navigation difficult for average users. Community members explained that v1 has limited customization options, while v2 offers more flexibility but requires modifying core code. There was technical discussion about implementing the same scene in both versions, with suggestions to use Blender for asset setup when migrating to v2. The conversation also touched on HyperWorld.Host as a hosting platform, with information about updating worlds to the latest version through their dashboard. Brief mentions of other projects included JUP swap integration and potential trade windows functionality. The chat demonstrated the community's collaborative approach to solving technical challenges while highlighting the differences between Hyperfy versions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to reduce camera and steps sensibility on mobile devices in v1? (asked by carlosmu) A: Not in v1, and in v2 it requires modifying core code (answered by Ashxn and maximus)\nQ: How can I implement the same scene in v2 that I built in v1? (asked by carlosmu) A: Using Blender for asset setup is recommended as v2 requires custom properties for GLB files (answered by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\nQ: How do I use the Hyperfy editor in hyperworld.host? (asked by carlosmu) A: Access the dashboard, click settings on your world, and select \"Update your world\" to get the latest version (answered by szjanko - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: Is hyperworld.host different from play.hyperfy.xyz? (asked by carlosmu) A: Yes, hyperworld.host runs on a different version that may not have the latest dev features (answered by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on development ideas for Hyperfy, particularly around tooling and project management. Ashxn proposed a useful enhancement for hyptools to support an editor-friendly format that would allow developers to work with folders containing GLB files, hyperscript, and assets, which could then be compiled into .hyp files. This would enable better Git integration for version control. There was also discussion about local development and testing on VR headsets, with users sharing approaches for accessing localhost from standalone headsets via port forwarding or using Meta Quest Developer Hub. A user named Enryt reported successfully installing Hyperfy on Debian but encountered issues when trying to access their world from a smartphone, seeing only a spinning icon. Community members suggested this might be due to using an older version and recommended updating to the latest dev version. The chat also included mentions of a driving game with ghost mechanics that impressed users, with maximus speculating on how it might be implemented using world storage and non-colliding vehicles.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I access my Hyperfy world on my standalone VR headset via WiFi? (asked by Enryt) A: You need port forwarding so that localhost:3000 on your headset goes to your Debian box, or you can deploy to a live site. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Why am I seeing a forever spinning icon when trying to access my Hyperfy world on my smartphone? (asked by Enryt) A: You might be on an older version of v2, make sure you are on the latest dev version.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on a technical issue related to model clipping and draw distance limitations in Hyperfy. Mugenomics encountered a problem with a large spaceship model (approximately 1600m long) where portions of the model would disappear at certain distances. The community identified that this was due to the skybox's 1km radius sphere that moves with the player, causing anything beyond 1km to clip. Suggestions included using fog as a temporary workaround. Additionally, vox shared some V1 worlds and contemporary art projects for inspiration, including a \"himars\" project. There was also mention of future plans to make the sky customizable as an app.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there any way to increase the draw distance? (asked by Mugenomics) A: The sky is a sphere with 1km radius that moves with the player, so anything further than 1km will clip. The plan is to make the sky an app so you can delete/modify it. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Curious what model could be so big?? (asked by Shiffty) A: It's a freaking huge spaceship model, massive, with different rooms, hangars, etc. (answered by Mugenomics)\n\n## 3.

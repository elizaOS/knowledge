      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on elevator physics implementation challenges in a game environment. Gert-Jan Akerboom encountered issues with elevator collision detection - with convex collision enabled, players couldn't enter the elevator due to invisible collision at the entrance, but with convex disabled, players fell through the bottom. Ashxn provided a solution using kinematic rigidbodies in world space with setKinematicTarget inside fixedUpdate ticks for smooth movement. \n\nAdditionally, Ashxn mentioned working on animation blending and layers to allow applications to overlay animations on top of locomotion animations, noting challenges with jarring transitions between different animations like running forward versus strafing. TheMattEmpire inquired about bone masking capabilities for animations.\n\nA brief discussion about UI elements occurred, with 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 commenting that the new dot crosshair resembled a hot pixel and suggesting an empty circle instead, while .hyp shaman defended the smaller dot as less distracting and providing better accuracy. Finally, shmoji asked about obtaining screen dimensions for UI positioning, with Ashxn suggesting using pivot, offset, and position parameters instead.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How do I fix an elevator with kinematic collision where players can't enter or fall through? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Make sure the rigidbody is in world space and use setKinematicTarget inside fixedUpdate ticks for smooth movement. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Will you be adding bone masks with animation blending? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Yes, but you can already do that by just keying the bones you want and excluding the rest. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How to get screen width/height in hyp app for screen space UI? (asked by shmoji) A: You shouldn't need it - using pivot, offset and position you should be able to do almost everything. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

User 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 shared a tutorial guide and requested feedback before publishing it on YouTube and X. Several users expressed interest in testing the guide, with maximus providing feedback notes. The discussion clarified that the tutorial covers both local and public server setup through Fly.io, which requires minimal terminal commands and login procedures. Users discussed various hosting options, with maximus mentioning that Fly.io offers essentially free hosting for basic servers with potential custom domain support. Other hosting providers like Hertzner (used by Play Sandbox world) were mentioned as alternatives. The conversation touched on scalability concerns for personal projects, with 0mka noting that Fly.io allows for easy server upgrades as needed.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to set up a FREE basic Hyperfy Server? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 provided a detailed guide for setting up using Fly.io\nQ: Just to confirm, this isn't a public server yeah? Just on the local computer? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: The instructions are for both local and public servers (answered by maximus and 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\nQ: Anyone know any good/cheap servers to use? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Fly.io (free for simplest server), Hertzner, and others listed in Hyperfy docs (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3.

There are mentions of tokenomics needing an update and a community member (MUDBONE) expressing continued support while waiting for product development to complete. There's a brief exchange about cryptocurrency value relative to inflation and the US dollar, with cloudAI making a prediction about the dollar's future. Xukonth encourages community members to raid X posts (likely referring to Twitter/X platform). Overall, this segment contains no substantial technical discussions, problem-solving, or concrete implementations.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When will the product be released? (implied by MUDBONE) A: No specific timeline provided (implied response from project team)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief discussion about 3D building assets and their compatibility with Hyperfy. Fibelius mentions previous challenges with a v1 world containing Kitbash 3D buildings and inquires about v2 compatibility. hiroP provides technical insights about Kitbash's new \"game ready\" kits, noting they're optimized for Unreal Engine with fewer draw calls and optimized meshes/textures, but still have high poly counts focused on Nanite technology. hiroP explains that Kitbash models would require significant optimization work for Hyperfy and suggests alternatives: looking for low-poly assets on platforms like Fab or Artstation, or manually creating low-poly versions of Kitbash models and projecting textures onto them. Fibelius clarifies their interest in architectural models rather than dystopic cities, mentioning previous work with Alvar Aalto's Villa Mairea. hiroP recommends checking Untitled's MOCA builds, which are CC0-licensed.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How long until v2 is available in HQ?

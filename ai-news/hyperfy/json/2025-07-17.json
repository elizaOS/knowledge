      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on elevator physics implementation and animation blending in a game development context. Gert-Jan Akerboom encountered issues with elevator collision detection - when using kinematic collision with convex ON, players couldn't enter the elevator due to invisible collision at the entrance, but with convex OFF, players fell through the bottom. Ashxn provided a solution using setKinematicTarget inside fixedUpdate ticks while ensuring the rigidbody is in world space, which resulted in smooth elevator movement. \n\nAshxn also mentioned working on animation blending and layers to apply animations over locomotion animations, noting challenges with jarring transitions between running forward and strafing animations. They're seeking better base locomotion animations where primarily the legs move while the body remains relatively idle.\n\nOther topics briefly discussed included a new dot crosshair interface element (replacing a larger circle), particle portal effects, and a question about obtaining screen dimensions for UI development in a Hyp app.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I fix elevator collision issues? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Use setKinematicTarget inside fixedUpdate ticks with the rigidbody in world space for smooth movement (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Will you be adding bone masks with animation blending? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Yes, but you can already do that by keying only the bones you want and excluding the rest (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I get screen width/height in hyp app for screen space UI? (asked by shmoji) A: This feature is planned to be added via something like word.viewportWidth, but you shouldn't need it - using pivot, offset and position should handle most UI needs (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

User 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 shared a tutorial on how to set up a free basic Hyperfy server and requested feedback before publishing it on YouTube. Several users expressed interest in trying the tutorial, with maximus providing feedback notes. The tutorial appears to cover both local and public server setup, including Visual Studio and Fly.io integration. 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 later shared an updated version with additional tips. The discussion also touched on alternative hosting options, with maximus mentioning that Play Sandbox world uses Hertzner hosting. Users discussed the benefits of Fly.io for low storage needs, noting it's essentially free for basic servers and supports custom domains. The conversation highlighted that Hyperfy servers can be easily scaled up as needed.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to set up a FREE basic Hyperfy Server? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 provided a tutorial link (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\nQ: Just to confirm, this isn't a public server yeah? Just on the local computer? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Instructions are for both, allows someone to create local, maintain world locally, then deploy to online server through fly.io (answered by maximus)\nQ: Anyone know any good/cheap servers to use? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Fly.io is basically free for simplest server, Play Sandbox uses Hertzner, and docs.hyperfy.xyz/hosting/self/ lists good options (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3.

There are no detailed technical conversations, problem-solving activities, or concrete implementations discussed. The conversation primarily consists of brief comments about tokenomics, marketing needs, and speculative statements about cryptocurrency and the dollar. One member (MUDBONE) indicates they are still holding their position and offers to help with marketing when the product is closer to release. Another member (Xukonth) requests community members to raid X posts (likely referring to Twitter/X platform).\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When will marketing efforts resume?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief discussion about 3D design challenges in Hyperfy. Fibelius mentions struggling with a v1 world containing Kitbash 3D buildings and inquires about v2 compatibility and whether purchasing the Kitbash Neo Tokyo kit would be worthwhile for a non-professional designer. HiroP provides technical advice about Kitbash's recent \"game ready\" kits, noting they're optimized for Unreal Engine with fewer draw calls and better meshes/textures, but still have high poly counts focused on Nanite technology. HiroP warns that Kitbash models would require significant optimization work for Hyperfy and suggests alternatives: looking for low-poly models on platforms like Fab or Artstation, or creating low-poly versions of Kitbash models and projecting textures onto them. Fibelius clarifies their interest in architectural models rather than dystopian cities, mentioning previous work with Alvar Aalto's Villa Mairea. HiroP recommends checking futuristic sculptural buildings from Kitbash and suggests looking at Untitled's MOCA builds which are CC0-licensed.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How long is the estimated wait for v2? (asked by Fibelius) A: Unanswered\nQ: If I buy the Kitbash Neo Tokyo 3D building Kit for Hyperfy city building, will it be a waste of money for a non-pro 3D designer? (asked by Fibelius) A: Kitbash models will be difficult to get working smoothly in Hyperfy due to high poly counts and textures, requiring significant optimization work (answered by hiroP)\nQ: Is v2 now so different? (asked by Fibelius) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: hiroP | Helpee: Fibelius | Context: Asking about using Kitbash 3D models in Hyperfy | Resolution: Provided information about Kitbash's new game-ready kits, their limitations for Hyperfy, and suggested alternatives like low-poly models from Fab/Artstation or creating custom low-poly versions\nHelper: hiroP | Helpee: Fibelius | Context: Looking for architectural 3D models | Resolution: Suggested checking futuristic sculptural buildings from Kitbash and recommended Untitled's MOCA builds which are CC0-licensed\n\n## 4.

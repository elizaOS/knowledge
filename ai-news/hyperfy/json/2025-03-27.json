      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🐞│issues Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around a specific issue with the \"linked\" property and UV manipulation in Hyperfy. A user (general hyper) encountered problems with the \"unique\" flag in the UI, where prop fields remained synced across duplicated objects despite toggling the flag. Ash clarified that setting `linked: false` on the mesh being modified is necessary, as the \"unique\" flag only prevents script and props synchronization while meshes remain instanced at the engine level. The discussion continued with general hyper attempting to implement the solution but experiencing issues with UV manipulation (textureX/textureY) when setting `linked: false`. Ash explained that these properties should still work but might behave differently when objects are unlinked. Additionally, Ash fixed an issue referenced in a GitHub link shared by peezy.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a bug with the unique flag in the new UI? (asked by general hyper) A: No, you need to set `linked: false` on the mesh you are modifying uvscroll on, because by default they are instanced together. (answered by ash)\nQ: What's the difference between the linked field on the material vs the mesh? (asked by general hyper) A: There is no material.linked property. (answered by ash)\nQ: Why does the textureY and textureX no longer work when I set the mesh linked to false? (asked by general hyper) A: They do work in both scenarios, but when unlinked, updating one object won't affect others as they're no longer linked. (answered by ash)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: general hyper | Context: Confusion about how the \"unique\" flag works with UV manipulation and object instancing | Resolution: Explained that `linked: false` needs to be set on the mesh being modified, not on the material\nHelper: ash | Helpee: peezy | Context: GitHub issue #74 | Resolution: Fixed the issue (indicated by \"fixed 🙂\" message)\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Ensure proper documentation of the `linked` property behavior on meshes | Description: Clarify that `linked: false` is needed for independent UV manipulation | Mentioned By: ash\nDocumentation: Document the difference between the \"unique\" flag in UI and the `linked` property in code | Description: Explain that \"unique\" affects scripts/props while meshes remain instanced | Mentioned By: ash\nTechnical: Investigate potential issues with textureX/textureY when mesh.linked is set to false | Description: Verify expected behavior of UV manipulation on unlinked meshes | Mentioned By: general hyper",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"🤖│agents\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion centers on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standardization for APIs designed with LLMs in mind. General hyper initially questions why MCP is generating excitement when it appears to be \"just an API standard.\" Maximus and others explain that MCP's value lies in interoperability and standardization, allowing services to connect into an MCP framework. Mattimus provides the most technical clarification, explaining that MCP enables database connections and file system access via standardized interfaces, with the key advantage being \"context\" availability without extensive prompting or data loading. This saves token costs and computation by eliminating the need to train agents on how to use each API. The conversation includes code examples of MCP implementation using FastMCP, showing how it simplifies API creation with minimal configuration. The group also discusses how MCP differs from traditional APIs by being designed specifically for LLM consumption rather than human developers.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is MCP basically just an API standard? (asked by general hyper) A: Yes, but designed specifically for interoperability and LLM consumption (answered by maximus and Shiffty)\nQ: Why is everyone excited about MCP? (asked by general hyper) A: It enables interoperability and standardizes connections between services (answered by maximus)\nQ: Does MCP just wrap FastAPI? (asked by general hyper) A: It provides standardization and simplifies API creation for LLM consumption (answered by maximus)\nQ: How is MCP different from Open Router? (asked by general hyper) A: Open Router finds the best API that meets criteria, while MCP abstracts different services beyond just LLMs (answered by maximus)\nQ: Why add another API layer when services already have APIs? (asked by maximus) A: Most existing APIs weren't designed with LLMs in mind, so this extra layer provides necessary context (answered by Shiffty)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief technical discussion about implementing animation hyps (hyperparameters) in what appears to be a 3D modeling or animation software. The conversation reveals that animation hyps only work with skinned meshes, and the complete implementation requires parenting the skinned mesh to an empty object. A user mentions that this process was more straightforward in a previous version (V1) of the software.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Anyone having issues getting these hyps to work? (asked by fractilians) A: I got it working last night with a skinned mesh. Only works with skinned meshes...as I understand it. (answered by Valiant)\nQ: Are there any other hyps that do this? (asked by fractilians) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Valiant | Helpee: fractilians | Context: User struggling to get animation hyps working | Resolution: Advised that hyps only work with skinned meshes and need to be parented to an empty object\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Parent skinned mesh to an empty object to make animation hyps work | Mentioned By: Valiant\nFeature: Create an easier implementation of animation hyps similar to V1 | Mentioned By: fractilians",

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy's development ecosystem, with focus on VRM avatar implementation, agent functionality, and vehicle physics. Users discussed the new documentation location, with maximus providing the updated link to docs.hyperfy.xyz. There was technical discussion about VRM exports in Blender, specifically regarding blendshape limitations across multiple meshes. Ashxn provided clarification on the node client for agents, explaining that it properly runs all systems regular players do, including physics and player controllers, making agents behave almost identically to human players. Valiant shared progress on vehicle implementation, showing videos of smooth flying mechanics. The conversation also touched on the \"Stonk Market World\" project and the Eliza agent starter repository. Additionally, vox mentioned that v2 now supports screenUV video with streaming, UV scrolling, and agents.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's the new quickstart/installation link? (asked by emotionull) A: https://docs.hyperfy.xyz/welcome/quickstart/ (answered by maximus)\nQ: Anyone been successful in exporting generated VRMs with blendshapes through Blender? (asked by lucii.io) A: Partially answered by Ashxn who indicated Blender VRM should support blendshapes on more than one mesh\nQ: Are the avatars in the shared Twitter post VRMs? (asked by jin) A: Yes, they're VRM because they're literally players (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Should I stall working with the eliza agent starter repo? (asked by 0mka) A: No, but note the dev branch has an agent.mjs file showing how to use the true node client (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a single place/board kept up to date with core functionality for v2? (asked by hiroP) A: The docs folder in the repo is comprehensive but technical, and https://docs.hyperfy.xyz has community knowledge (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

FAQ\nQ: When do you plan to launch the platform? (asked by Alexa) A: \"I can't give dates but it'll happen out of nowhere like most things we do here... we paused on the platform to do some RND and make sure we were going in the absolute best direction. That direction is now locked in so it's execution time.\" (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Curious if the platform will be Solana or multi-chain (asked by nettuser) A: \"Since the Core is Open-Source there has been community efforts towards making Hyperfy usable for BOTH Solana ecosystem and EVM Compatibility.\" (answered by Agent12)\nQ: No ai?

A user (carlosmu) inquires about creating a new world in Hyperfy v1, but learns that v1 world NFTs are no longer available as the platform is transitioning to v2. Ashxn explains that while v1 is in maintenance mode and still functional, no major updates are planned. For v2, users can self-host the open-source world engine, use a hosting service like hyperworld.host, build locally, or use play.hyperfy.xyz where everyone has build permissions. The documentation has moved from hyperfy.how to docs.hyperfy.xyz, and a roadmap for v2 is forthcoming.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can I create a new world/land in Hyperfy v1? (asked by carlosmu) A: The v1 world NFTs are no longer available as Hyperfy is transitioning to a new v2 engine and platform. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can I buy a world in opensea?

First, Gert-Jan Akerboom reported difficulty accessing the \"play world,\" which ash investigated and potentially reset, resolving the access problem. Second, Gert-Jan encountered a behavior where adding multiple NEON apps to a world caused all apps to revert to the default color when using the \"unique\" setting. Ash explained that \"unique apps\" refers to unique settings while meshes are still instanced behind the scenes, causing them to share materials. Ash provided a solution by suggesting setting `mesh.linked=false` to unlink meshes, though noting this would decrease performance at scale.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When adding multiple NEON apps to a world, why doesn't the color setting persist with the 'unique' setting? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: The \"unique apps\" setting only creates unique settings while meshes are still instanced behind the scenes, causing them to share materials. You can unlink meshes with mesh.linked=false, but this decreases performance at scale. (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

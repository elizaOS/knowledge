There was a brief exchange about finding the updated Hyperfy quickstart documentation link, which was promptly provided. Another discussion touched on exporting VRM models with blendshapes in Blender, specifically addressing the limitation of the VRM plugin only allowing blendshapes to be applied to one mesh at a time. A user questioned whether this was accurate, noting that avatars often use separate opaque and transparent meshes. Finally, a user named Valiant briefly mentioned making progress toward an upcoming \"race day\" without specific technical details.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for üíª‚îÇdevelopers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on character controls and mesh instancing in Hyperfy. Ashxn pushed new character controls to the dev branch, with Pete and others providing feedback. The controls were generally well-received after testing. There was significant technical discussion about mesh instancing, with hiroP seeking help on creating multiple instances of meshes efficiently. Ashxn provided solutions using clone() method and explained that the engine handles instancing automatically unless specifically disabled. The chat also touched on first-person view improvements, billboarding techniques for non-UI meshes, and spawn point setting. A new accessibility system was teased by 0mka, and .hyp shaman shared progress on a networked rock object with color-changing capabilities.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How do I set a spawn point? (asked by Pete) A: Use \"/spawn set\" to set it to your current location (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: Is there any example of instancing a mesh in hyp code? (asked by hiroP) A: You can use clone() method, which creates an exact copy while the engine handles instancing automatically (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is clone == instancing from the pov of resource use? (asked by hiroP) A: Yes, a clone is an exact copy of the mesh description, and the engine auto-instances things behind the scenes (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Any tips for billboarding non-particle and non-UI meshes? (asked by hiroP) A: You can grab the camera position/rotation and use that; there are different types of billboarding (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is spawncoin.hyp available? (asked by ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

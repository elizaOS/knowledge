      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on new features and technical implementations in Hyperfy. Ashxn shared significant updates including head tracking/gaze functionality, a customizable emote wheel with hotkeys, and improvements to animation systems. HiroP demonstrated an impressive AI integration allowing voice-controlled object manipulation in-world. Gert-Jan Akerboom worked on a globally synchronized elevator, though experiencing some shakiness issues. Several developers discussed animation support, with clarification that skinned mesh animations are supported but require scripting. Shaw inquired about procedural terrain generation, with Ashxn explaining the difference between apps (which have limited API access but are portable) and custom systems (which can use raw Three.js functionality). The chat revealed ongoing development of Hyperfy v2, with developers actively implementing and refining features while helping each other troubleshoot implementation challenges.\n\n## 2.

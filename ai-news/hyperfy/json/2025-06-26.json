      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on cross-platform interaction systems in the Hyperfy platform. hiroP was working on implementing interactions that would work across desktop, VR, and mobile platforms. Ashxn advised using the \"Action\" node system instead of pointer events, as Actions work consistently across all platforms while pointer/reticle events are currently desktop-only. The Action system provides visual feedback with a progress indicator (the \"press and hold - circle appears\" UI) and has platform-specific triggers: E key for desktop, a hand button for mobile, and triggers for VR. The conversation also touched on handling user reconnection, with Ashxn explaining that both v1 and v2 don't have reconnection logic, requiring developers to implement their own state persistence for meaningful progression. Another topic was capturing screenshots programmatically, which isn't currently supported in the engine but was suggested as a potential feature (world.snapshot). The developers shared their progress implementing basic functionality, with hiroP successfully implementing cross-platform interactions using cubes as test objects.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I implement interactions that work across desktop, VR, and mobile? (asked by hiroP) A: Use the \"Action\" node which works on all devices including mobile and VR, while pointer/reticle events currently only work on desktop. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How does the Action system work on different platforms? (asked by hiroP) A: On desktop you press E, on mobile a hand button appears when near an action, and on VR you use the triggers. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Does v2 have reconnection logic for users who disconnect? (asked by hiroP) A: No, both v1 and v2 don't have reconnection logic. If users get disconnected, they reload and start from spawn again. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is it possible to take a screenshot programmatically and save it locally? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: There's no snapshot function in the engine yet, but something like world.snapshot(width, height) would be good to add. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What causes frequent disconnections? (implied by hiroP) A: Either your server doesn't have enough resources, an app has gone rogue, or the user has an unstable connection. (answered by Ashxn and HypPrivakos)\n\n## 3.

Philbert argues for a more developer-friendly approach that leverages AI integration, handles networking, and provides easy deployment - suggesting Hyperfy should pivot to meet immediate developer demands in the three.js game development space. Ashxn, a Hyperfy developer, acknowledges these points but defends their \"frontloading\" approach (investing significant effort early to avoid technical debt) versus \"backloading\" (building quickly but accumulating technical debt). Ashxn mentions they're working on a detailed deck explaining tokenomics and marketplace plans, emphasizing that blockchain is essential for their vision of portable, Turing-complete digital collectibles. Community members express concerns about token value and lack of clear communication about tokenomics, while still expressing belief in the project's potential.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does Hyperfy handle networking for end users? (asked by PurpleSack) A: Not directly addressed, though philbert implied it's a desired feature\nQ: Is there an outline of future tokenomics on the Hyperfy website? (asked by PurpleSack) A: Ashxn is working on a deck with more details that will be linked on the company site (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can Hyperfy compete with Minecraft?

Ashxn expressed dissatisfaction with the topology quality from automated tools like Meshy and Tripo, seeking a professional character designer for a cleaner version. MetaRick recommended akimbot, who identified themselves as a professional avatar creator. Meanwhile, Valiant attempted to improve the model by respinning the image in Meshy, applying quad remeshing with symmetry, and using the original image for AI retexturing. While Valiant's approach produced better results, it still had issues with merged fingers. ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/ suggested manual retopology would be more efficient than trying to fix automated results. The conversation demonstrates the limitations of AI-based 3D model generation tools for character design when high-quality topology is required.\n\n## 2.

Ash confirms this is possible and mentions they currently run dozens of worlds on a single Hetzner server using Coolify to manage containers, with setup taking 30-60 minutes. Additionally, 0mka mentions updates to the world portal functionality in the repository, fixing an issue where the portal would transport all players instead of just the local player. There's also a brief reference to modifications made to Fastify WebSockets and client network components.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can we deploy 10 worlds on a single cloud server?

      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe conversation primarily revolves around developing and managing apps in the Hyperfy platform, specifically focusing on .hyp file bundles and app integration. User 3rdEyeVisuals is working on creating an in-world app bundler GUI that would allow users to create .hyp bundles without manually editing system files. They've modified core files to support direct .js file uploads as apps and created an upload button in the sidebar. The main technical challenge discussed is how to make apps appear in the sidebar without manually adding them to the world assets folder. 3rdEyeVisuals also mentions adding UI components to the core system files, noting the cross-compatibility issue this creates. The discussion highlights the workflow limitations in the current system for collaborative in-world app development and seeks guidance on the approach taken.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there an easy way to upload apps to the sidebar while in-world? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: No, you need to place files in the server folder (answered by mrtzhckr)\nQ: Is there a tool that bundles the .hyp files for you or is it a manual process? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: Unanswered\nQ: Would it be worth modifying the core files some more to fully support straight .js apps? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

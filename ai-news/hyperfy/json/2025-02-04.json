      "summary": "# Analysis of \"💻│developers\" Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat revolves around Hyperfy V2 development, focusing on app sharing, controls, and API functionality. A significant development is the new app download/sharing feature that allows developers to share apps with a `.hyp` extension. Developers discussed implementation details for cross-app communication using `world.emit()` and `app.send()` for server-to-server and server-to-client communication. There were extensive discussions about UI/UX improvements, particularly regarding the app inspection window redesign that now supports downloading, remixing, and viewing app details. Developers also debated control schemes, with many preferring V1's pointer lock and reticle for gaming experiences. Camera access and raycasting were discussed as needed API features. The chat also covered technical challenges with Docker deployments related to npm dependency conflicts and version checking.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: If I wanted to add custom metadata to an object, what would be the best way to do this? (asked by MetaMike) A: For cross-app communication, use world.emit(\"event name\", data) for server-to-server and app.send(\"event name\", data) for server-to-client (answered by Saori)\nQ: How can you access the player position in V2? (asked by Shiffty) A: On the client you can call world.getPlayer() to get the current player or world.getPlayer(id) for a specific player (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can I access the main camera (specifically forward direction) and can I raycast through the API? (asked by Shiffty) A: You can access the camera using app.control({}) and get direction with Vector3 calculations; raycasting will be possible but hooks aren't added yet (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can I make values accessible to other apps? (asked by MetaMike) A: Use world.emit() and world.on() for server-to-server communication, and app.send() and app.on() for server-to-client (answered by Saori)\nQ: What would be a good temporary solution for sharing apps? (asked by Saori) A: The new app download feature with .hyp files is the solution, with options for public sharing and remixing (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"🤖│agents\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion centers around implementing AI agents in Hyperfy with a focus on behavior trees and LLM integration. MetaMike shared progress on a behavior tree implementation that controls NPC behaviors based on player proximity, including rotation, emotes, and API calls to an Eliza-based LLM. The system uses distance-based triggers: rotating towards players at <10m, running emotes between 5-0m, and making API calls between 0-2m. HPrivakos provided endpoint URLs for testing agents without local setup. The chat also covered how emotes are triggered through the Eliza API, where the LLM selects appropriate emotes based on its responses. MetaMike documented the implementation in a HackMD document for others to reference. SoloSolipsist introduced their Memotar project for creating agent personas, showing interest in potential Hyperfy integration.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can you confirm the URL you're using for the agents? (asked by MetaMike) A: The hyp file has a wrong URL for the model, use https://agents.dcl.guru/eliza/hyperfy (answered by HPrivakos)\nQ: How can we trigger the expressions within the eliza hyperfy branch? (asked by MetaMike) A: The app has that hooked up already. Each time a request is sent to eliza it has all emotes and asks it to pick one or none. (answered by Saori)\nQ: Is there a way to activate an animation track separate to emotes? (asked by MetaRick) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: HPrivakos | Helpee: MetaMike | Context: MetaMike couldn't access the agent endpoints | Resolution: HPrivakos provided correct URLs (https://agents.dcl.guru/eliza/hyperfy) and explained the issue was with the URL in the hyp file\nHelper: Saori | Helpee: MetaMike | Context: MetaMike needed to understand how emotes are triggered in the Eliza system | Resolution: Saori explained that the app sends defined emotes to Eliza which then selects appropriate ones based on responses\nHelper: Saori | Helpee: SoloSolipsist | Context: SoloSolipsist asked for examples of Hyperfy agents | Resolution: Saori shared links to agent examples and mentioned that an Eliza server URL would be needed from HPrivakos\n\n## 4.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy V2 development, interoperability challenges in the metaverse space, and community building efforts. Key technical discussions include:\n\n- Interoperability issues with VRM avatars from Nifty Island, which \"cock blocks\" their use in Hyperfy due to token-gating the files rather than using decentralized storage solutions.\n- Discussions about the technical architecture of Hyperfy V2, focusing on the ecosystem model where developers create \"cores\" that artists can use to make collectibles, which consumers can then use without coding skills.\n- Exploration of app sharing functionality in Hyperfy, allowing users to extract objects from worlds and use them elsewhere - a feature highlighted as unique in the metaverse space.\n- Development of a \"beacon\" tool that allows worlds to be listed on relay.zesty.xyz alongside other Hyperfy worlds.\n- Discussions about self-hosting options for Hyperfy worlds and the ability to transfer worlds between hosts by simply copying world folders.\n- Challenges with the V2 UI compared to V1, particularly regarding app search functionality and object manipulation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is this the correct vrm nft format to use in hyperfy? (asked by N1Kingz/HCK1) A: It doesn't work because Nifty Island is blocking access to the VRM file (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How easy is it to create a nifty like asset generator for hyperfy? (asked by N1Kingz/HCK1) A: We're working on this, but our engine is open with tooling for people to build themselves (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How does it work with updates coming from Hyperfy? Will we need to set things up all over again when new versions are released? (asked by Paradoxx) A: Not really, as your world data isn't proprietary and hosting services shouldn't lock you in (answered by maximus)\nQ: Is there a brand assets repo/source somewhere? (asked by m₂) A: Yes, provided logo files and 3D GLB (answered by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)\nQ: What's the best source of information to read up on how to get going with Hyperfy V2? (asked by Paradoxx) A: There are draft docs being made, but you might want to wait for completed docs or non-dev releases (answered by ToxSam)\nQ: How easy would it be to transfer a pre-built V2 world to our own hosted option later? (asked by Paradoxx) A: It will be as simple as copy/paste your world folder to another host (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on 3D modeling and rigging challenges. FortyMcNiner described an issue with Mixamo rigging where models \"lurch\" forward in edit mode but return to normal in object mode, making it difficult to add interchangeable items after rigging. Community members suggested alternative rigging approaches including AutoRigPro, resetting the rest pose, and using Accurig. TheMattEmpire mentioned preferring to rig manually in Blender and build VRMs using UniVRM in Unity rather than using the VRM for Blender addon. Other discussions included sharing resources from Meshy for downloadable CC0 assets and avatars, with devilsadvocate.sol mentioning plans to convert some to VRMs. There was also brief mention of Hyperfy's upcoming no-code version (V2) that would make the platform more accessible to non-coders.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Anyone have the problem of rigging an avatar on Mixamo where the model \"lurches\" forward in edit mode but jumps back in object mode? (asked by FortyMcNiner) A: You could look into resetting the 'rest pose'. (answered by TheMattEmpire)\nQ: What's a better workflow than Mixamo for rigging? (asked by FortyMcNiner) A: Try Blender VRM addon + AutoRigPro or Accurig. (answered by Ashxn and TheMattEmpire)\nQ: When is Hyperfy V2 (the no-code version) expected? (asked by vlad) A: I don't know exactly when, keep an eye out on the announcements channel. (answered by untitled, xyz)\n\n## 3.

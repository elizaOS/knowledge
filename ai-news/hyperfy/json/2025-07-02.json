      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy development, with discussions about hyps (Hyperfy applications) and their implementation. A key technical point was the mention of storing data using world.get(key) and world.set(key, value) functions, which are used in applications like the portal hyp to store teleport positions. There was discussion about porting applications from v1 to hyps, with examples like \"portal\" and \"zone\" mentioned as successful ports. The conversation also touched on storing folders on IPFS or Arweave for NFT metadata. A community member expressed interest in creating a board for tracking desired hyps to help developers prioritize their efforts. The chat revealed that Ash appears to be the primary developer working on the Hyperfy engine.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does anyone know if there is a .hyp in all .hyps that uses world.get(key) and world.set(key, value)? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Yeah ummm the portal app iirc. It uses it to store the teleport position. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: I was wondering if there's some kind of open \"hyps we want\" board? (asked by hiroP) A: Yeah there is a board of hyps you simply gotta look at v1 again and scroll through the available apps. (answered by á²¼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"âš¡â”‚general\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily discusses technical capabilities and limitations of Hyperfy's current version (v2). A key discussion revolves around the absence of webview functionality, with users inquiring about displaying web content in-world. Current workarounds include using screen sharing functionality, though this lacks interactive capabilities. There's mention of a screen.hyp that can share video but not audio. The conversation briefly touches on potential future implementation of iframe/webview functionality, with a developer (Ashxn) confirming this could be added \"at some point.\" The latter part of the conversation shifts to cryptocurrency-related discussion comparing Hyperfy with Project89, though this appears unrelated to technical development.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do we have an app that is a screen in the world can show a designated webpage? (asked by Coinexpert) A: No webview in v2 yet. But you can use screenshare and show a tab or a stream (answered by 0mka)\nQ: Is there a screensharing .hyp yet? (asked by hiroP) A: This one might suffice [link to another message] (answered by 0mka)\nQ: I found this screen.hyp only share video, but no audio, is that made by purpose or a bug? (asked by Coinexpert) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

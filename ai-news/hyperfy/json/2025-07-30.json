      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat discusses development aspects of a platform called \"the forge\" which appears to be related to metaverse applications. Lastraum mentions cross-verse chatting functionality coming soon to the forge platform, enabling communication across any metaverse and device. There's discussion about app architecture, with Ashxn suggesting the need for separate \"Audio\" and \"Zone\" apps. When asked about technical stack, Lastraum confirms they're using \"the forge platform.\" \n\nShmoji inquires about the possibility of exporting entire worlds with multiple apps as a single HYP app. Ashxn clarifies that while \"uber apps\" with multiple functionalities are possible, individual apps offer more flexibility for movement and management. Ashxn also explains that zipping up a 'world' folder creates a single file that can serve as a backup or for importing an entire world on any server. Pete requests timer and leaderboard functionality, possibly combined into a race app, with Ashxn suggesting the leaderboard in \"fallen\" as a potential template.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What stack are you using? (asked by Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘) A: We're using the forge platform (answered by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz)\nQ: Will hyp apps always be one model? or will it ever be possible to export an entire world (with many apps inside of it) as one single hyp app? (asked by shmoji) A: There's nothing stopping you from building \"uber apps\" that have tons of things in them, but a single app with everything in it is less flexible than individual apps you can move around and manage independently. That said, if you zip up your `world` folder you get a single file that includes all apps placed in the world and can use that as a backup or as a way to import an entire world on any server (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat segment contains brief discussions about various development topics related to a platform called \"the forge.\" Lastraum mentions cross-verse chatting functionality coming soon to the forge platform, which will enable communication across any metaverse and device. Ashxn suggests the need for separate \"Audio\" and \"Zone\" apps. There's a brief mention of a \"social layer\" and a question about the technology stack being used, which Lastraum confirms is \"the forge platform.\" Additionally, shmoji inquires about the possibility of exporting entire worlds with multiple apps as a single hyp app, rather than just individual models.

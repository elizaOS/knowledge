      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"💻│developers\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on performance optimization in Valiant applications, particularly around UI rendering and its impact on CPU/GPU usage. Developers discussed how UI elements are redrawn and batched, with specific attention to performance issues when implementing constantly changing visual elements like RGB effects. There was debate about whether browser tabs outside the current world affect in-world performance statistics, with mixed experiences reported. A developer mentioned implementing a world menu setting allowing visitors to equip custom avatars. The conversation also touched on a chess interface implementation and questions about WebSocket support, with confirmation that only fetch is currently supported in apps. Developers shared a development philosophy of \"make it work, make it good, make it optimized\" as a progression for building features.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does someone have an example working with a ws in-world? (asked by Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘) A: iirc we don't have WebSocket support in apps, just fetch (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Are stats in world showing other things outside world? (asked by 0mka) A: Might be wrong but I think external usage does affect it. Sometimes I wonder why my CPU/GPU time is so high and realize I have Unity or a few other worlds open in other tabs and closing them helps (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘 | Context: Performance issues with UI rendering, particularly with RGB effects causing FPS drops | Resolution: Offered to review apps privately to spot performance issues and explained how UI drawing is optimized with batching\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: 0mka | Context: Questions about UI performance and how drawing works | Resolution: Explained that UI is drawn optimized with batching, only redrawing when changes occur, but drawing from scratch every frame hurts performance\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nTechnical: Implement 3D connection interface as follow-up to 2D chess interface | Mentioned By: Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘\nFeature: Allow visitors to equip custom avatars via world menu setting (already implemented on dev) | Mentioned By: Ashxn\nTechnical: Optimize UI rendering for elements with constantly changing colors to prevent performance degradation | Mentioned By: Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around users exploring Hyperfy's v2 platform, with a focus on apps and functionality. SWISS, a v1 user, shares their experience migrating to v2, encountering issues with file size limits for models (30MB) and avatars (13.5MB) despite increasing environment variables. Users discuss the availability and installation of apps in v2, with MetaRick and others guiding SWISS to resources like the marketplace channel and playworld where apps can be discovered and downloaded. The drag-and-drop functionality for apps is highlighted as an impressive feature. Gert-Jan Akerboom shares a GitHub repository of .hyp apps and mentions fixing a Rocket app to be networked with collision. Users also briefly discuss the concept of \"networked\" functionality (changes visible to all users versus local-only changes). HypPrivakos mentions challenges with app submissions to the marketplace. The conversation demonstrates the community helping new v2 users understand the platform's capabilities and resources.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's the current status of apps from v1 in v2? (asked by SWISS) A: MetaRick pointed to marketplace channel and mentioned video player, screensharing and skybox apps are available\nQ: Is this the most current collection of apps? (asked by SWISS) A: MetaRick directed to the marketplace channel\nQ: What is \"networked\"? (asked by SWISS) A: \"means everyone in world sees the change, local mean only you would see the change happen\" (answered by MetaRick)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for channel \"🪙│hyper\"\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment primarily discusses a significant price movement in the Hyperfy token. A large holder (\"whale\") sold their entire position, causing a price drop to around 800k (likely market cap or value reference). Community members noted this was part of a broader sell-off where this holder liquidated all tokens in their wallet, not just Hyperfy. The seller reportedly plans to repurchase when Hyperfy reaches a 200m valuation. Despite the drop, participants observed a quick recovery, describing it as a \"V shape recovery.\" Some members expressed regret at missing the buying opportunity during the dip, while others were optimistic about breaking local price resistance levels as the market showed strength.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: what happen? (asked by cloudAI) A: A whale sold all the tokens in his wallet (answered by Xukonth)\nQ: pizbik gone 😦 (asked by Xukonth) A: A whale sold all the tokens in his wallet (answered by Xukonth)\nQ: pizbik bought back 5m?

User 0mka suggests adding CSS rotation and transform/translate capabilities to UI views, which would enable creating diamond shapes, triangles, pies, and trapezoids beyond the current rectangular and rounded corner options. Later, 0mka reports a broken seam in the \"meadow scene\" of ash's world, though the exact nature of the issue remains unclear despite follow-up questions. Gh0stt speculates the issue might be related to RGB keyboard or coins, noting that \"the world seems to stabilize a bit once they are picked up.\" Valiant clarifies that 0mka likely meant misaligned geometry, describing it as \"a ridge/step/edge somewhere\" encountered while driving around the scene.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What meadow scene has a broken seam? (asked by ash) A: Your world meadow scene has a seam that breaks the model (answered by 0mka)\nQ: What breaks though?

Gert-Jan Akerboom announced the successful networking and collision implementation for a rocket feature. Valiant commented that the rocket almost reaches \"the moon\" and suggested adding a lift platform ability to ride the rocket. Gert-Jan responded that the rocket might be moving too fast. Later, Valiant mentioned implementing a \"hyperspeed elevator\" that moves at a similar or greater speed than the rocket, though with some rendering jitter.\n\n## 2.

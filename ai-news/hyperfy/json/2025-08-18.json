Summary:\nThe discussion primarily revolves around AI-generated primitives in Hyperfy and vehicle collision detection in racing scenarios. A key technical issue discussed is that player collision is disabled when anchored to vehicles, requiring developers to track the vehicle itself rather than the player for race checkpoints. Ash mentions working on AI-generated world building, noting they've spent approximately $5 on various AI models (OpenAI and Anthropic) with Sonnet 4 offering the best balance of speed and design capabilities. They're implementing optimizations to group objects by type and use shaders for colors, which should reduce CPU usage from ~8ms to ~3ms in a world with 400 AI-created objects. There's also mention of potential collaborative world-building features where users might use their own API keys and AI models of choice.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: I want to try out the AI generation with primitives but am not sure how, is it inside latest dev? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can I make a vehicle be recognized as the player when crossing race checkpoints? (asked by Valiant) A: Player collision is disabled when anchored; you have to track the moving vehicle instead (answered by .hyp shaman)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: .hyp shaman | Helpee: Valiant | Context: Valiant needed to detect when a player on a vehicle crosses race checkpoints | Resolution: Explained that player collision is disabled when anchored, so the solution is to track the vehicle movement instead\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Valiant | Context: Confirming why player collision doesn't work with vehicles | Resolution: Explained that player collision is disabled to prevent opposing forces interfering with vehicle physics\n\n## 4.

Summary:\nThe discussion centers on asset management in Hyperfy, specifically around selecting, duplicating, and moving multiple assets simultaneously. TheMattEmpire is building modular houses and wants to duplicate completed structures rather than rebuilding them piece by piece. Ash confirms this functionality isn't currently available but is planned for future development. The conversation then shifts to instancing in Blender and how it works with Hyperfy. Ash explains that linked duplicates in Blender are automatically instanced in Hyperfy, allowing for efficient rendering (single draw call) even with multiple duplicates. He recommends using the updated Blender addon from GitHub for better results. TheMattEmpire also inquires about LOD support, which Ash confirms is available through empty objects in the scene.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there any way to select a bunch of assets in world in order to duplicate and/or move it all around at one time? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: No, that's tough but something I want to tackle. (answered by ash)\nQ: Does the Hyperfy Tools addon export linked assets...or how are instances exported from Blender? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Everything is automatically instanced as long as in Blender you create \"linked duplicates\" not just regular duplicates as those are completely unique meshes. (answered by ash)\nQ: If I make the building in Blender with instanced parts, put that in world, then instance the building...would the parts be instanced per building, or all instances would be instanced? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Everything instances. (answered by ash)\nQ: Does the addon support LODs yet? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Yeah it has lods. Add an empty to the scene. (answered by ash)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: ash | Helpee: TheMattEmpire | Context: Needed updated Blender addon for Hyperfy | Resolution: Provided GitHub link to the latest version of the addon\nHelper: ash | Helpee: TheMattEmpire | Context: Confusion about how instancing works between Blender and Hyperfy | Resolution: Explained that linked duplicates in Blender automatically instance in Hyperfy, resulting in efficient rendering\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nTechnical: Implement multi-asset selection, duplication, and movement functionality | Description: Allow users to select multiple assets at once to duplicate or move them together | Mentioned By: ash\nTechnical: Create buildings with linked assets in Blender | Description: Build modular structures in Blender using linked duplicates for efficient instancing in Hyperfy | Mentioned By: TheMattEmpire\nFeature: Add outliner/hierarchy similar to Blender/Unity | Description: Create a UI element to manage and select multiple objects at once | Mentioned By: TheMattEmpire\nDocumentation: Create guide for LOD implementation | Description: Document how to use empty objects for LOD in the Blender addon | Mentioned By: ash",

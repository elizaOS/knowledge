A significant focus was on a keyboard implementation that Gh0sTt is working on, which appears to be built upon Starlight's existing keyboard with added functionality for individual key coloring. There was also discussion about Blender add-ons for Hyperfy, specifically regarding collision issues with animated skinned meshes. Two different Blender add-ons were mentioned: the official Hyperfy Tools (version 1.5.0) and another script created by Ash that's available in the source code. Gh0sTt mentioned plans to release repositories for both a bot and API they're developing. Future development plans discussed include making implementations mobile and VR friendly, with specific interest in utilizing phone gyroscopes for controller functionality and implementing gamepad API support for controllers.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can animated skinned meshes have collision? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Try adding collisions manually as sometimes the plugin causes issues (answered by Valiant)\nQ: Is there another blender addon?

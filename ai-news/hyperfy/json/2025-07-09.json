      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around development topics in the Hyperfy ecosystem. A significant discussion focused on adding collision to animated skinned meshes in Blender, with users troubleshooting issues with the Hyperfy Tools addon. There was mention of alternative Blender addons available in the source code, including blender_addon.py and documentation in blender-exporter.md. \n\nAnother major thread involved a keyboard implementation project that Gh0sTt is working on, which appears to be built upon Starlight's keyboard with added functionality for individual key coloring. The developers discussed plans to make this keyboard compatible with VR/raycasting and potentially implementing controller support, with specific mention of using a phone's gyroscope as a first step. \n\nThere was also brief mention of a bot and API repository that will be released soon, and some discussion about Discord-like messaging features including direct messages and chat channels that 0mka was implementing.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can animated skinned meshes have collision? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Valiant suggested adding collisions manually as sometimes the plugin causes issues.\nQ: Is there another Blender addon besides Hyperfy Tools? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: .hyp shaman confirmed there is one in the source code created by ash, including blender_addon.py and blender-exporter.md.\nQ: Will the keyboard implementation be mobile and VR friendly?

A user (0xLittle dog) is experiencing websocket disconnection problems with their deployment in Singapore on DigitalOcean, reporting 1006 errors. Ash explains that the official servers use Hetzner in Hillsboro, Oregon (US), chosen over LA for better performance. The official setup is simple - a single server hosting approximately 20 worlds simultaneously with 24/7 uptime. Ash mentions they'll eventually move to a more dynamic setup. When troubleshooting the connection issues, Ash suggests checking server logs and notes that if no errors appear, the problem likely stems from either the connection or server networking configuration. There's also a brief mention from general hyper recommending Caddy over Nginx for server configuration.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Which manufacturer do you use for your server? (asked by 0xLittle dog) A: We use Hetzner servers located in one of their US datacenters, specifically Hillsboro OR. (answered by ash)\nQ: Is it deployed on a single server in the United States? Are there no other distributed node servers? (asked by 0xLittle dog) A: Correct, no craziness, it's not really needed. Our single server holds like 20 worlds at once, online 24/7. (answered by ash)\nQ: What could cause websocket disconnection with 1006 errors? (asked by 0xLittle dog) A: If there are no server errors in your logs, either your connection or the server networking is borked. (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

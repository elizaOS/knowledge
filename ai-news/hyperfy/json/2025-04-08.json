          "text": "The Hyperfy platform and its flagship game, Fallen, are undergoing rapid development with a strong focus on AI integration, user experience, and technical enhancements. AI is being explored as a tool for generating game content, including maps, items, and lore. Developers discussed the feasibility of AI-generated 3D models, mintable NFTs, and in-editor prompting to assist creators. While AI-generated games often face limitations, Hyperfy’s modular app-based architecture is designed to mitigate these issues by isolating functionality into small, manageable components.",

Community-driven storytelling is encouraged, with ideas like lore competitions and canonized items. The long-term vision includes AI-assisted development tools embedded directly into the editor, allowing creators to prompt AI for assets or logic generation.",

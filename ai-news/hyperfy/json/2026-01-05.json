      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🎨│showcase\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment discusses issues with implementing animation hypermeshes in what appears to be a 3D/VR development environment. A user named fractilians was having trouble getting animation hypermeshes to work. Valiant shared that they successfully implemented it with skinned meshes and mentioned that parenting the mesh to an empty object was a crucial step in solving the problem. The conversation indicates that this functionality may have been simpler in a previous version (V1) of the software. Another user, Gert-Jan Akerboom, mentioned they couldn't test VR functionality due to not having a VR set.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Anyone having issues getting these hyps to work? (asked by fractilians) A: I got it working last night with a skinned mesh. Only works with skinned meshes...as I understand it. (answered by Valiant)\nQ: Are there any other hyps that do this? (asked by fractilians) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Valiant | Helpee: fractilians | Context: Issues implementing animation hypermeshes | Resolution: Advised that it only works with skinned meshes and needs to be parented to an empty object\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Implement animation hypermeshes by using skinned meshes and parenting to an empty object | Mentioned By: Valiant\nFeature: Create an easier version of animation hypermeshes similar to V1 | Mentioned By: fractilians",

Summary\nThe chat segment primarily revolves around community concerns regarding project timeline, marketing efforts, and development priorities. Several members express frustration about the perceived lack of marketing focus, arguing that patience isn't viable in the competitive crypto and AI space. They emphasize that building should include marketing and timeline considerations, with investors being equally important as developers. One technical issue was raised regarding a WebSocket disconnection (error 1006) on a deployed project using nginx. The discussion highlights a tension between those advocating for patience in development versus those concerned about market positioning and investor interests. Some members defend the project's approach, suggesting that quality development takes time, while others argue that success requires both technical excellence and effective outreach to build a user base.\n\n## 2.

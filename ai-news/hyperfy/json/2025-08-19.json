      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nAsh shared a significant optimization breakthrough that allows billions of differently sized and colored primitives to be rendered in a single draw call, reducing draw calls from around 1000 to 100 in their test scene. This instancing technique automatically reuses shape+color pairs, dramatically improving performance. The chat also revealed that AI can now generate interactive elements like trigger zones and moving objects (planes, orbiting objects) through simple prompts, outputting editable .hyp files. These AI-generated worlds benefit from the new optimization, with one example containing hundreds of AI-created objects but fewer than 100 draw calls. The AI selects shapes and colors freely, and the engine automatically instances matching pairs. Shaw mentioned developing a RuneScape-style point-and-click movement controller for Hyperfy, dubbed \"Hyperscape,\" though it still has some orientation issues.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there any way we could do this with static glbs (that use the same material)? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: That's more complicated but probably doable one day (answered by ash)\nQ: How soon till we get prim fish so we can catch fish while we fish? (asked by maximus) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can you prompt a orbiting satellite or plane? (asked by vox) A: Yes, ash demonstrated with a plane example (answered by ash)\nQ: Can it create a tiled floor where tiles emit when stepping on them? (asked by vox) A: Unanswered\nQ: Will those creations have frontend scripts and we can download this stuff as .hyps? (asked by vox) A: They create hyp's, yes (answered by ash)\nQ: How much does it use currently? (asked by vox) A: Infinite, it writes colors it likes (answered by ash)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: ash | Helpee: vox | Context: vox asked if AI can create moving objects like planes | Resolution: ash shared a working plane example and explained it can be edited\nHelper: ash | Helpee: vox | Context: vox asked about how the material instancing works | Resolution: ash explained that AI picks shapes/colors and the engine reuses pairs that have already been used\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Gert-Jan Akerboom | Context: Gert-Jan reported the plane example turning into a red warning box after reload | Resolution: No direct solution provided\n\n## 4.

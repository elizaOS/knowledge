      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on WebGPU adoption, terrain generation, and various development tools. Developers debated the merits of transitioning from WebGL to WebGPU, with Ashxn noting that Apple has unlocked WebGPU support on Safari/visionOS. The conversation highlighted that while WebGPU offers superior performance and features like compute shaders and hi-z occlusion culling, a transition would require significant renderer and shader updates. \n\nTerrain generation emerged as a requested feature, with discussions about implementation approaches (heightmaps vs. 3D voxel terrains) and technical considerations like size limitations, LOD systems, and edge handling. Ashxn shared examples of 3D voxel terrains and mentioned plans to add scene apps and bounties for optimized base environments.\n\nOther technical topics included a VSCode plugin for .hyp files, VRM management integration with Hyperfy, camera management systems, and instance management for single-player experiences. Lastraum announced VRM management now linked to Hyperfy, allowing users to load VRMs, set defaults, and have them automatically load when connected to The Forge.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to add a fullscreen mode for the screenshare app? (asked by Alephic) A: The video node is in 3D world-space and can't be put in screen-space yet, but it's possible with rendering to a subsection of the UI canvas each frame. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How big of a job would it be to rewrite the engine in WebGPU? (asked by zzzzzzzzzzz) A: Only need to update all the renderer and shader stuff. The vast majority of the engine would stay the same. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Does someone have experience designing a world which always spins up single player instances? (asked by Reneil) A: You can create a custom client without networking systems, or have a smaller pool of servers that launch when someone joins and reset after everyone leaves. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can we get terrain generation officially? (asked by peezy) A: It's not in the core yet because we need to decide on which type to use (heightmaps vs. 3D voxel) and come up with a simple UX. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What's the easiest/best way to get started experimenting with eliza + hyperfy? (asked by Ricky) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

There was a brief mention of getting an AI agent named \"Eliza\" working again and discussion about potentially setting up multiple AI agents for a hackathon project. The technical aspects touched on include:\n\n- A user mentioned getting \"Eliza\" working again and suggested booting up \"MJ\" (likely another agent)\n- Discussion about each agent needing a computer/server\n- Brief mention of potential hosting solutions including Replit and \"coolify\" on a personal server\n- Suggestion to create AI agents based on vegetable avatars created by a user named Toxsam\n- Consideration of running the agents on a server rather than individual computers\n\nThe conversation indicates an interest in AI agents for a potential hackathon project but contains limited technical details about implementation.\n\n## 2.

Community members compared Hyperfy's market cap (~$6M) to competitors like Verse World (~$50-100M), noting Hyperfy appears undervalued. A key debate emerged between two development philosophies: building methodically for long-term sustainability versus pursuing short-term hype. Ashxn (likely a team member) emphasized their commitment to building something substantial rather than just pumping token prices, while acknowledging the need for better networking and incentivizing creators to build complete experiences rather than tech demos. The community discussed Hyperfy's relationship with ElizaOS, with MUDBONE suggesting Hyperfy serves as a base layer in the stack: \"solana network -> Hyperfy -> Eliza integrations -> your world/project community.\" Questions were raised about token utility and what would drive demand for HYPER tokens in the ecosystem. Several members suggested the project needs better marketing and a standout product to attract more attention.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there a marketing plan soon?

Ash is working on terrain and floating islands features, with a focus on core engine improvements that will have significant impact. A new Hyp repository was created by b0gie and Omka. There are discussions about governance models for user-generated content interoperability. Technical implementations showcased include: HP's World Exporter and Importer features for HyperWorld.Host, vox's mega texture with UV scroll technique for creating performant animated models, a teleport app release, and Shifty's camera updates. Community members are actively building worlds, with Gert-Jan's \"Akerboom Studio\" going live and others like OxQuan, Fibelius, and Lastraum sharing progress on their builds. There are questions about multi-user worlds and integrating Eliza with Hyperfy. A bounty is available for helping build the phettaverse project.\n\n## 2.

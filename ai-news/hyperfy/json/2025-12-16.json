Summary\nThe chat contains a single message from user Fibelius proposing a technical challenge to another user named Strong Star. The proposal involves building an access control system for a Hyperfy v2 world that would allow VOID avatars with specific NFT traits from the \"Visitors of Imma Degen\" collection to access specific areas within a Hyperfy space. Fibelius suggests using their hosted Hyperworld as a testing ground and requests a public demonstration in the Discord server with an explanation of the implementation. As compensation, Fibelius offers to donate approximately 300,000 Hyper tokens. The proposal appears to be aimed at resolving some ongoing disputes in the community while potentially providing marketing opportunities for Strong Star.\n\n## 2.

Users fractilians and Agent12 report videos playing slowly and stalling despite having fast internet connections. This occurs with both the \"cool video hype\" player and the regular video player.

Summary\nThe chat segment discusses UI and 3D model development for what appears to be a web-based 3D application. 3rdEyeVisuals mentioned working on model panel frames, which prompted a technical discussion about mesh properties. Roustan was having trouble with a file in Blender and was seeking a code-based solution. Ash provided a code snippet to disable shadow casting on meshes using JavaScript. The conversation also touched on Blender add-ons for the platform, with Ash sharing a specific GitHub link to the add-on they use. 3rdEyeVisuals mentioned they're developing a SaaS model and will make a PR for UI z-indexing improvements. The discussion highlights the community's focus on improving the developer experience through both code solutions and tooling.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I disable shadow casting on a mesh using code? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: Use `mesh.castShadow = false` or with a specific mesh: `const mesh = app.get('MyMesh'); mesh.castShadow = false` (answered by ash)\nQ: Where can I find the Blender add-on?

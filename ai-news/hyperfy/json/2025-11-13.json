      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment discusses UI and model panel frame customization in what appears to be a 3D development environment. 3rdEyeVisuals shared work on model panel frames, which prompted discussion about emission properties and shadow casting. Roustan mentioned having trouble bringing a file back into Blender and was looking for code solutions. Ash provided a simple code snippet to disable shadow casting on meshes using `mesh.castShadow = false`. 3rdEyeVisuals later mentioned they're developing a SaaS model and will make a PR for UI z-indexing. The conversation also touched on Blender add-ons, with Ash sharing a link to a GitHub repository containing a Blender add-on they use, noting that different add-ons have their own advantages.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I disable shadow casting with code? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: Use `const mesh = app.get('MyMesh'); mesh.castShadow = false` (answered by ash)\nQ: What Blender add-on do you use? (implied by conversation) A: \"I'm using this one: https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy/blob/main/docs/extras/blender-addon.py\" (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of \"⚡│general\" Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment shows minimal technical discussion. The most notable technical interaction was from user Akuma who reported successfully adding GLB files into a world on mobile and noted how well the collision detection worked with models from Sketchfab. Akuma suggested improvements for the mobile experience, specifically requesting pinch and squeeze functionality for resizing and placing models on touchscreens. They also suggested adding a Sketchfab plugin and potentially integrating Tencent AI with the in-world model generator. Roustan attempted to help by suggesting mouse controls, but Akuma clarified they were using mobile. The rest of the conversation consisted mainly of greetings, brief exchanges about a scammer in the channel, and unrelated comments.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do you add GLB into world on mobile? (asked by Akuma) A: Akuma figured it out themselves but didn't share the specific method (answered by Akuma)\nQ: How do you resize and rotate models? (implied by Akuma) A: Use the scroll wheel on mouse, and shift to toggle between scale and rotation (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 | Helpee: Akuma | Context: Akuma needed controls for resizing/rotating models | Resolution: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 suggested mouse controls, but this didn't help as Akuma was on mobile\nHelper: TvdB, A | Helpee: ash | Context: Alert about a scammer in the Discord | Resolution: ash acknowledged and presumably took action\n\n## 4.

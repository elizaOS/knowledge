      "summary": "# Analysis of ⚡│general Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief technical discussion about world storage, snapshots, and cleanup in what appears to be a hosting platform for virtual worlds. Users discussed storage limits, billing concerns, and automatic cleanup functionality. HypPrivakos explained that snapshots count toward storage limits, with 5GB snapshots potentially exceeding free tier limits if multiple are taken. They also mentioned that the platform likely doesn't charge for amounts under $1 due to transaction fees. The conversation revealed that newer worlds have automatic cleanup enabled by default via the \"CLEAN=true\" environment variable, which removes deleted entities that still occupy disk space. One user (Roustan) confirmed they have this setting enabled but still have high storage usage, possibly due to automatic snapshots created during deployments.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does the platform auto clean worlds now? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: By default it cleans now, but only on newer worlds, you can check your .env for `CLEAN=true` (answered by ash)\nQ: When will 402x integration or blockchain integration be available? (asked by Agent12) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host | Helpee: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 | Context: User concerned about 5GB world size and potential billing | Resolution: Explained snapshot storage implications and suggested checking for CLEAN=true environment variable\nHelper: ash | Helpee: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 | Context: Question about automatic world cleaning | Resolution: Clarified that automatic cleaning is enabled by default only on newer worlds and suggested checking for CLEAN=true in .env\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Check and enable CLEAN=true environment variable for older worlds to reduce storage usage | Description: Add \"CLEAN=true\" to environment variables to remove deleted entities from disk | Mentioned By: HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host\nTechnical: Monitor snapshot creation during deployments | Description: Be aware that each deployment may create a snapshot, increasing storage usage | Mentioned By: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓\nFeature: Consider 402x or blockchain integration | Description: Integration with blockchain or 402x for user authentication/verification | Mentioned By: Agent12",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. A user shared a link to Gaussian-VRM, a tool for creating 3D avatars, along with an X post about it (in a non-English language). Another user inquired about streaming capabilities on custom 3D objects. The most substantial technical interaction involved a user seeking help with creating a fading transparent/glowing cone effect in Blender, which was successfully resolved. There was also a brief mention of differences between versions of Blender, with users noting that interface changes between versions can be confusing, and a suggestion that reverting to an older version might help with familiarity.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to stream on custom 3D objects yet (I know video is in there, but can you update the mesh?) (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Unanswered\nQ: Could anyone help me out with a node configuration / settings for a fading transparent/glowing cone? (asked by untitled, xyz) A: \"does this work?\" with an apparent solution shared (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 | Helpee: untitled, xyz | Context: Creating a fading transparent/glowing cone effect in Blender | Resolution: Successful solution provided that matched the reference GIF shared by the helpee\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Consider reverting to an older version of Blender for familiar interface | Description: The new Blender version has confusing changes that might warrant using a previous version | Mentioned By: untitled, xyz",

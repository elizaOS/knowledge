Summary\nThe chat segment contains brief discussions about AI-generated textures, visual improvements to a skateboard model, and a virtual world experience. Ash proposed teaching AI to use a selection of textures that multiply with color to enhance visual fidelity. MetaRick suggested adding a color palette picker for theming. A user named .hyp shaman shared improved 3D model images, likely of a skateboard with enhanced detailing. There was a brief mention of API costs (approximately $15) for running a world, possibly using Grok AI. The conversation was fragmented with minimal technical depth, consisting mostly of short comments and image sharing rather than detailed technical discussions.\n\n## 2.

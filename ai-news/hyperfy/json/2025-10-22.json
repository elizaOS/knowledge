Some users express frustration about the token's value declining, with one user criticizing the project harshly. In response, community members defend Hyperfy, highlighting that it's a legitimate project with open-source technology that's being actively developed.

They emphasize that the integration of the token with the marketplace and world-building features is being developed carefully rather than rushed. The user encourages more constructive feedback and references the Hyperfy Litepaper as outlining the project's vision.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Timeline??

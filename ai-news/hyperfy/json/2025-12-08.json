      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment shows minimal technical discussion in the Hyperfy Discord's general channel. Conversations primarily revolve around VRM avatars, with users sharing resources for finding and converting 3D models. There are mentions of converting GLB files to VRM format, which requires renaming rigging elements, and suggestions about using Blender's VRM plugin to assign bones to already-rigged models. Some users inquire about the project's development status, noting a lack of recent changes in the git repositories. The chat also includes developers introducing themselves as available for work. Overall, the channel appears relatively quiet with sporadic technical exchanges focused mainly on avatar-related topics rather than core development discussions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is this project still under active development? (asked by Davenci) A: Unanswered\nQ: Not seeing a ton of recent changes in the git repos, anyone have a pulse check on that side of things? (asked by DefiniteOptimist) A: Unanswered\nQ: Has anyone seen a VRM avatar of Santa, Link (Zelda), or Mario (Brothers)? (asked by CarTarL) A: There's a Santa vrm in toxsam's open source collection at opensourceavatars.com, and a Mario on hub.vroid.com (answered by Shiffty and hiroP)\nQ: I found a few that are in glb format. Would have to rename all the rigging to get into vrm? (asked by CarTarL) A: If it's already rigged, you just need to assign the bones with the blender VRM plugin (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\n\n## 3.

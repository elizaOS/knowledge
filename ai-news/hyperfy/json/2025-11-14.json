      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"⚡│general\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on mobile usability for 3D model manipulation in a virtual world environment. Akuma shared their experience adding GLB files on mobile, noting that while collisions worked well with models from Sketchfab, the touch interface lacked proper controls for resizing and placement. They suggested implementing pinch and squeeze gestures for touchscreen users. Roustan offered mouse-based controls before realizing Akuma was specifically discussing mobile functionality. There was also brief mention of Tencent AI integration possibilities and a suggestion to incorporate a Sketchfab plugin. Later in the chat, users alerted ash about a potential security issue or scammer. The conversation concluded with a brief mention of a project called \"pieverse\" that reportedly converts daily goals and time commitments into on-chain data with AI-assisted scheduling and gas-free payments.\n\n## 2.

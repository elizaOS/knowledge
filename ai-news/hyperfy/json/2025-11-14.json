      "summary": "# Analysis of ⚡│general Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy's platform development and community feedback. A key technical discussion centered on mobile usability for GLB model manipulation, with Akuma noting the need for touch-based controls for resizing and placement. The conversation touched on the marketplace functionality at hyperworld.host, which some users were unaware of despite being active community members. There was discussion about a potential map feature for connecting Hyperfy worlds, with suggestions to make it opt-in. Community members debated the role of cryptocurrency integration in the platform, with some users expressing frustration about limited crypto functionality in V2 compared to V1. The chat also revealed that Hyperfy has implemented physics for GLB models with working collisions, and includes features like solar panels that control skybox, sunlight, and fog effects. Some technical features mentioned include synced falling platforms, though they were noted to be \"glitchy\" when colliding with objects.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do you resize GLB models on mobile?

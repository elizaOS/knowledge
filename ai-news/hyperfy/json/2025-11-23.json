      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\n3rdEyeVisuals worked on implementing interactive games within Hyperfy, specifically using Space Invaders as a proof of concept. Initially, they encountered an error related to \"uiInputFocused\" property and needed to modify core functionality. After troubleshooting, they successfully implemented base functionality for interactive arcade games that can run within a CanvasMesh. The implementation allows for fully interactive UIs built into the CanvasMesh, enabling features like in-game inventory management. They also created a \"Super User\" mode to grant themselves lower-level API access while maintaining security in production. .hyp shaman provided a pre-made arcade cabinet model to help with the implementation, offering to create a more advanced version with moving joysticks and buttons in the future. The project represents a significant advancement in creating custom interactive experiences within the Hyperfy platform.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Need an arcade cabinet?

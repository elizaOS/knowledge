      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n3rdEyeVisuals developed a system for integrating arcade games into Hyperfy using canvas texture streaming. The developer encountered and resolved issues with click activation and UI input focus. The implementation uses three.js CanvasTexture with 2D Canvas API rendering directly applied to 3D meshes, avoiding iframes, UI nodes, or HTML/DOM elements. This approach enables raycasting and click detection in world-space. \n\nThe developer created a \"Super User\" mode to gain lower-level API access while maintaining security, ensuring only pre-approved apps can access these features in production. The system is optimized for performance by only rendering machines when users are in proximity, allowing for potentially thousands of arcade machines in a world with minimal performance impact.\n\n.hyp shaman provided an arcade cabinet model ready for Hyperfy with dynamic rigidbody properties and snap points, offering to create a v2 with animated joysticks and buttons using skinnedmesh in the future.\n\nThe project began with Space Invaders as a proof of concept but will expand to include custom arcade games. The developer plans to implement token-gating for premium features while providing some test games for all users.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is this networked (can others in world watch OR wen pong)? (asked by Shiffty) A: Unanswered directly, but 3rdEyeVisuals mentioned it's \"an ongoing closed door dev\" with plans for a grand opening eventually.\nQ: Is this iframes or ui nodes? (asked by ash) A: Neither, it's using canvas texture streaming with three.js CanvasTexture and 2D Canvas API rendering directly applied to 3D mesh (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: .hyp shaman | Helpee: 3rdEyeVisuals | Context: Needed an arcade cabinet model | Resolution: Provided a ready-to-use arcade cabinet model for Hyperfy with dynamic rigidbody, UV mapping for texturing, and snap points\nHelper: .hyp shaman | Helpee: 3rdEyeVisuals | Context: Error with \"Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'uiInputFocused')\" | Resolution: Suggested changing core functionality, which 3rdEyeVisuals implemented successfully\n\n## 4.

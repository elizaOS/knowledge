      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"🪙│hyper\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion revolves around Hyperfy 2.0, an open-source engine, sandbox, and toolkit for building virtual experiences. Community members express frustration about limited communication from founder Ash regarding development progress, while supporters defend the platform's current capabilities. Key technical points include: Hyperfy 2.0 is considered feature-complete as a platform for developers to build upon; it supports generative AI integration to make development accessible to non-coders; self-hosting or third-party hosting services are available but require more user responsibility than v1; and there are questions about the removal of native $HYPER token integration from the main branch. Some community members are actively developing projects (like \"Hyperscape\") using the platform, though details remain private. The conversation highlights tension between those expecting more direct platform development versus those who see Hyperfy 2.0 as a complete toolkit ready for community-driven innovation.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🎨│showcase\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe conversation revolves around video playback issues in Hyperworld. Multiple users reported videos playing slowly and stalling despite having fast internet connections. The issue appears to affect both the \"cool video hype\" player and the regular video player. Gert-Jan Akerboom tested a 200MB video on both players in his hosted world and experienced smooth playback, suggesting the issue might be user-specific. Users discussed potential causes including browser compatibility and file size limitations. Valiant mentioned successful use of bunny.net for m3u8 streaming with a free trial option. Mobile compatibility was also discussed, with Valiant confirming videos should play on newer mobile devices, though multiple video streams might cause issues on iPhone 12 that typically resolve after reloading.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on implementing persistent leaderboards in Hyperfy games. Gert-Jan Akerboom sought help creating a leaderboard for a dragon game that would persist after page reload, similar to functionality seen in other games. The implementation appears to use world.get and world.set methods for data persistence. Community members offered assistance by referencing existing examples, including \"elementals\" by Ash and a quest item implementation. By the end of the conversation, Gert-Jan successfully implemented the persistent leaderboard with a record time of 23 seconds, replacing a previous record of 59 seconds. Separately, Sphynxcolt inquired about adding objects with looping animations from Blender to Hyperfy, and was directed to a relevant resource by Valiant. There was also a brief mention of progress with animations from .hyp shaman.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to make a leaderboard for a dragon game that persists after reload? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Use world.get & world.set methods, and reference examples like elementals by Ash or the quest item implementation (answered by Valiant and .hyp shaman)\nQ: How can I add an object that has a looping animation from Blender? (asked by Sphynxcolt) A: Check the resource link provided (answered by Valiant)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. The only technical topic raised was about importing animated objects from Blender into Hyperfy. A user (Sphynxcolt) asked about adding objects with looping animations, and Gert-Jan Akerboom clarified that only skinned mesh animations with armature/bones can be exported from Blender to Hyperfy V2. The rest of the conversation consisted of greetings, brief mentions of development progress, and a reference to scammers impersonating users.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I add an object that has a looping animation (from Blender)? (asked by Sphynxcolt) A: You can only export skinned mesh (armature/bone) animations from blender for now. (Assuming you are talking about V2) (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: Anything amazing been built with hyperfy yet? (asked by Akuma) A: Only just started myself. But, every day I integrate something crazier. The possibilities are vast! (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Gert-Jan Akerboom | Helpee: Sphynxcolt | Context: User was trying to import looping animations from Blender into Hyperfy | Resolution: Clarified that only skinned mesh (armature/bone) animations can be exported from Blender to Hyperfy V2\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Understand limitations of animation imports from Blender to Hyperfy V2 - only skinned mesh animations supported | Description: Users need to use armature/bones for animations rather than keyframes | Mentioned By: Gert-Jan Akerboom",

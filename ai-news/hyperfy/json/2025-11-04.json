      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on implementing persistent leaderboards in Hyperfy games. Gert-Jan Akerboom sought help creating a leaderboard for a dragon game that would persist after page reload, similar to functionality seen in other games. The discussion confirmed that world.get and world.set methods are the correct approach for data persistence. Community members pointed to existing examples, including an \"elementals\" implementation by Ash and a quest item system. Gert-Jan later reported success with implementing the leaderboard.\n\nA separate discussion involved Sphynxcolt asking about adding objects with looping animations from Blender to Hyperfy, with Valiant providing a helpful resource. Additionally, froh2 requested guidance on implementing click behavior for objects, specifically making one object invisible when another is clicked. Community members directed them to example scripts and documentation, which froh2 confirmed were helpful.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to make a leaderboard for the dragon game that persists after reload? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Use world.get & world.set for persistence, with examples available in Ash's elementals implementation and feeding quest items (answered by .hyp shaman and Valiant)\nQ: How can I add an object that has a looping animation from Blender? (asked by Sphynxcolt) A: Resource link provided for animation implementation (answered by Valiant)\nQ: How to give objects click behavior to make another object invisible when clicked? (asked by froh2) A: Check example scripts and AI prompts documentation (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host and Gert-Jan Akerboom)\n\n## 3.

The only technical topic raised was about importing animations from Blender into Hyperfy V2. A user (Sphynxcolt) asked about adding objects with looping animations, and Gert-Jan Akerboom clarified that only skinned mesh animations using armature/bones can be exported from Blender currently. The rest of the conversation consisted mainly of greetings, mentions of scammers impersonating community members, and brief discussions about projects being built with Hyperfy. No major technical decisions or implementations were discussed in this segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I add an object that has a looping animation (from Blender)? (asked by Sphynxcolt) A: You can only export skinned mesh (armature/bone) animations from blender for now. (Assuming you are talking about V2) (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: Anything amazing been built with hyperfy yet? (asked by Akuma) A: Only just started myself. But, every day I integrate something crazier. The possibilities are vast! (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\n\n## 3.

𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 shares their experience solving a display flickering problem that occurred after upgrading from a Pixel 4 to a Pixel 7 phone. They identified that certain plant and tree GLB models were causing the issue, particularly those with transparent alpha textures (like leaves). The troubleshooting method involved systematically activating and deactivating GLB models one by one to isolate problematic ones. 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 mentions two of their worlds as examples: roustan.xyz (which still contains problematic trees and will flicker on certain phones but not on desktop) and hyperfy.roustan.xyz (which uses different trees that should not cause flickering). Gert-Jan Akerboom acknowledges the information and indicates they will investigate further.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What causes flickering issues on mobile devices?

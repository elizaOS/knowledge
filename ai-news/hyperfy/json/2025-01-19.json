      "summary": "# Analysis of \"üíª‚îÇdevelopers\" Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy V2 development, focusing on technical implementations and problem-solving. Key discussions include:\n\n- Collision implementation in Blender for Hyperfy V2, requiring custom properties to be set on meshes and ensuring \"Custom Properties\" is selected during GLTF export\n- OSC (Open Sound Control) integration for avatar control, with MetaMike developing an OSC cube and discussing VRM puppeteering for VTuber-like functionality\n- App state management in Hyperfy, with Ashxn explaining that server-side state is sent to clients upon connection, but clients manage their own state afterward\n- Script marketplace concepts, with discussions about distributing scripts as NFTs with embedded model and script metadata\n- Network request capabilities in object scripts using fetch, which is available in the dev branch\n- Server vs. client authority for objects, with Hyperfy supporting various authority models through app.send() and app.on() for event communication\n- Wearables implementation discussions for avatar customization\n\nThe development community is actively building features, sharing code examples, and helping each other troubleshoot implementation issues.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do we get the app state? (asked by Spizzy) A: State is an empty object by default. Anything put in server-side is sent to clients when they connect. On the client, you can update and store info about the current state as needed. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is it possible to detect if an AI agent is present in a world? (asked by felixdigit://) A: Agents would be like \"apps\" and can be figured out. The right-click context menu will be different from a player's. (answered by Saori and Ashxn)\nQ: What is the current wearables situation in V1 and/or V2? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Once V2 is more fleshed out, resources will go to CharacterStudio which can do wearables and optimized avatars that work in Hyperfy worlds and others. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do we add collision via Blender for V2? (asked by jar0d) A: Add custom properties to meshes in Blender and ensure \"Custom Properties\" is selected during export. (answered by hiroP and Ashxn)\nQ: Is it possible to create a multiplayer game that you can play local at parties? (asked by Rick) A: Unanswered\nQ: How do you play an animation via script in V2? (asked by ·≤º) A: GLTF animations not yet supported, need to build a driver that converts threejs GLTF animations into app runtime node structure. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Are we able to make network requests in object scripts? (asked by m‚ÇÇ) A: Yes, fetch is available in the dev branch after running npm build. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a concept of having \"client authoritative\" objects? (asked by hiroP) A: Yes, Hyperfy supports full server authority, server simulation, client authority, or hybrid approaches using app.send() and app.on() for events. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a profiler to see total polycount, drawcalls, materials? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: In V1 there's a performance button at the bottom of the editor window. Similar functionality planned for V2. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: üßä‚îÇ3d-design\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on 3D design optimization techniques for Hyperfy environments and technical implementations. Key discussions included GPU instancing, texture atlasing, and model optimization for web experiences. Scoe developed and shared a Blender plugin for creating collider boxes, which Ashxn expressed interest in funding further development to improve the workflow. The community discussed optimization techniques like occlusion culling and LOD (Level of Detail) implementation, noting that the Hyperfy engine can handle extensive environments with proper optimization. There was also discussion about creating cinematic scenes in Unity, with Sceth requesting environment assets for background scenes. Documentation efforts were mentioned, with maximus coordinating a comprehensive optimization guide on HackMD. Physics implementations for character models (specifically for body parts) were briefly discussed as being resource-intensive but implementable.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does Hyperfy handle GPU instancing? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: The engine references a single model and reduces calls by drawing it once and copying the result for duplicates, similar to Unity prefabs. It downloads one model and references it multiple times. (answered by maximus)\nQ: How many objects can the Hyperfy engine handle? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: According to Ash, the engine can handle 9 billion trees in a world, just not all in one small area, with proper LOD implementation. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Where can I learn to build on Hyperfy V2? (asked by OttisOts) A: Check the developers channel for pinned resources like HackMD or Docs. (answered by TheMattEmpire)\n\n## 3.

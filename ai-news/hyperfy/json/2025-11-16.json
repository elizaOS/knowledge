      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on development issues related to a 3D world platform, likely Hyperfy. Discussions included package management concerns, UI component updates, and integration questions. 3rdEyeVisuals mentioned updating a UIVideo component to respect UI RenderOrder and adding transparency control options for UI element containers. There was a question about integrating Eliza (likely an AI chatbot) into a 3D world, though the implementation appears complex as it may require backend integration rather than simple repository cloning. Package management safety was discussed, with warnings about using the --force flag during updates as it could break dependency relationships. The conversation also touched on environment setup with references to setting up .env.local files and alternative package managers like bun.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Where and how should I import an app like Eliza into the code so I can use it in my 3D world? (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰) A: If the Eliza framework is not already integrated into the backend of Hyperfy framework then it will be a lot more complex than just plug and play with the repo. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\nQ: Is it really important to do npm audit fix (without --force)? Any security risk for later in world? (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰) A: If you --force updates to your packages you could actually break things. Need to be careful there. Some dependencies only play nice with certain versions of other dependencies. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\nQ: Just create elisa folder in src and clone the repo? (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

There is one feature suggestion about adding a toggle for right analog stick camera movement. The rest of the conversation consists of greetings (\"gm\" - good morning) and casual comments. There is no substantive technical problem-solving or implementation discussion in this short segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Would it be cool if we could toggle on a right analog stick for camera movement instead of using screen? (asked by Akuma) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: CheddarQueso 🧀 | Helpee: Unspecified | Context: Offered general help without specific problem context | Resolution: No specific problem was solved\n\n## 4.

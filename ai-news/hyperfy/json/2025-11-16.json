      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. 3rdEyeVisuals mentioned updating UIVideo to respect UI RenderOrder and adding an option to remove transparency from UI element containers, while keeping videos behind the root UI to prevent visual distraction. There was a brief discussion about npm audit fixes, with 3rdEyeVisuals cautioning against using --force as it could break dependencies. A user (🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰) asked about integrating Eliza into their 3D world, but received limited guidance. .hyp shaman mentioned using bun locally and reminded users to set their .env.local file. The conversation also briefly touched on 3rdEyeVisuals' interest in experimenting with splatting technology. Overall, the chat was relatively sparse with technical details and consisted mostly of brief updates and questions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where and how should I import an app like Eliza into the code so I can use it in my 3D world? (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰) A: If the Eliza framework is not already integrated into the backend of Hyperfy framework then it will be a lot more complex than just plug and play with the repo. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\nQ: Just create elisa folder in src and clone the repo? (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is it really important to do npm audit fix (without --force)? Any security risk for later in world? (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰) A: If you --force updates to your packages you could actually break things. Need to be careful there. Some dependencies only play nice with certain versions of other dependencies. (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion, primarily focused on brief exchanges about Hyperfy features and potential implementations. Agent12 inquired about creating notification zones in Hyperfy V2 similar to \"Collider with Notifications\" from V1, seeking ways to track user movements and potentially send notifications to Discord. Valiant suggested a possible solution by referencing a previous Discord message. There was also a brief discussion about using rolling ball physics as a workaround for implementing vehicles in Hyperfy V2, with Agent12 noting someone had already built a \"Time Trial\" tool. Akuma suggested adding a toggle for right analog stick camera movement. The conversation was casual with several \"good morning\" greetings and minimal technical depth.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Would it be possible to toggle on a right analog stick for camera movement instead of using screen? (asked by Akuma) A: Unanswered\nQ: Does anyone have simple V2 .hyps that might function like \"Collider with Notifications\" from V1? (asked by Agent12) A: Valiant suggested checking a previously shared Discord message that might help\nQ: Could \"Rolling Ball as the Actual Car\" Physics be a super-quick workaround for Usable Vehicles in Hyperfy V2? (asked by Agent12) A: 3rdEyeVisuals confirmed \"Yup!\"\n\n## 3.

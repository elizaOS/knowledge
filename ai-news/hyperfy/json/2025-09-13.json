      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on VRM avatar creation in Hyperfy, with several technical approaches shared. Ash mentioned previous R&D efforts to convert text to images, then to meshes, textures, and rigged VRM avatars, though with high failure rates. TheMattEmpire suggested using AI tools for mesh creation and the VRM for Blender addon, sharing documentation links from his work at Mona. Vox shared links to MetaMike's CloneX VRM resources. \n\nA significant technical issue arose when Gh0stt's world became inaccessible due to script execution problems. Ash provided a JavaScript code snippet to disable scripts as a workaround and mentioned that newer Hyperfy versions include a \"safemode\" feature (accessed via ?safemode=1 URL parameter) to prevent script execution. DevStarlight from Numinia noted they hadn't updated since the S3 merge into dev, explaining why the safemode feature wasn't available. \n\nOther technical topics included using IPFS for asset hosting (mentioned by Gh0stt as loading quickly with Pinata), and a question about implementing Vector3 configuration options in Hyperfy apps.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to convert an image into a 3D character in Hyperfy? (asked by lucyhail) A: Ash mentioned they did R&D on this, converting text to images to meshes to VRMs, but with high failure rates. TheMattEmpire suggested using AI tools and VRM for Blender addon.\nQ: How do you change your profile to a character? (asked by lucyhail) A: TheMattEmpire suggested VRM creation tutorials on YouTube and shared documentation links from Mona.\nQ: Is the vibe world ever getting back online? (asked by Gh0stt) A: Ash mentioned it was up previously but experiencing issues, possibly from DDoS or bad actors.\nQ: Is there a way to run your world in safe mode where you don't execute the scripts? (asked by Gh0stt) A: Ash suggested adding ?safemode=1 to the URL, but noted it's only in recent versions.\nQ: How to set a vector3 in the config options? (asked by Gh0stt) A: Shiffty suggested parsing it manually and using string or number type, with a link to documentation.\n\n## 3.

It includes a shared link to a Twitter/X post by user \"ash\" that appears to be an inspiration video according to Lastraum. There's also a Simple Poll asking about Quest VR headset ownership, with Pete responding that he owns a Quest 2 and asking if the poll specifically refers to Quest 3. Ash clarifies that the poll is about any Quest headset. No substantial technical discussions, decisions, or problem-solving occurred in this brief exchange.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: I have a quest 2 but I assume you're referring to a quest 3? (asked by Pete) A: nah any 🙂 (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of 🧊│3d-design Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe conversation focuses on generating 3D models directly in Hyperfy using AI. A user (太阳) inquires about the process, and Dhin provides guidance on accessing and using the dev branch of Hyperfy for AI-generated 3D content. The discussion covers setting up the development environment, configuring AI providers through environment variables, and using commands like \"/create\" and \"/edit\" to generate and modify 3D models within Hyperfy worlds. Dhin explains that these AI generation capabilities require specific configuration and are available to users with admin or builder roles. The conversation briefly touches on AI agents in Hyperfy worlds, with Dhin mentioning limited knowledge about implementing AI characters beyond the existing \"eliza\" agent.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are these 3D models created in Blender first, or can they be generated directly in Hyperfy? (asked by 太阳) A: Generated directly in Hyperfy. (answered by Dhin)\nQ: How to do it, I would love to try it (asked by 太阳) A: If dev: https://docs.hyperfy.xyz/welcome/quickstart/ If not checkout vibe.hyperfy.xyz and type /create a rock (answered by Dhin)\nQ: I have created a hyperfy world and entered it, but I don't know how to generate 3D models directly in hyperfy (asked by 太阳) A: you need to be on the dev branch (answered by Dhin)\nQ: I saw that the env of the dev branch added AI_PROVIDER and other configurations, and then I configured it and entered hyperfy with the dev branch, but what should I do next? (asked by 太阳) A: in world you can type /create thing (answered by Dhin)\nQ: Do you know how to add the AI agent role to the hyperfy world? I hope there are more AI friends in my world. (asked by 太阳) A: Depends what you mean but anyone with admin or builder role can create with ai. For agents in world I only know of eliza. I haven't gone down that road myself yet. Looking to soon though. (answered by Dhin)\n\n## 3.

          "text": "The Hyperfy platform is undergoing significant technical development, with a focus on modularity, user onboarding, and AI integration. A persistent, app-based inventory system has been implemented by drdoge.eth, with plans to split it into two modular apps. Hyperfy now supports permanent world storage without strict file size limits, ideal for metadata and stats. Multi-tenant world support is enabled via URL parameters, allowing scene switching through world folders.",

          "text": "Dynamic asset loading is supported through world.load(), enabling models and avatars to be fetched from external sources like Arweave and IPFS. To address CORS issues, a Node.js proxy endpoint is recommended. An experimental wind shader is available, activated via a custom Blender property, though it currently lacks adjustable parameters.",

          "text": "AI integration is a major focus, with users like 0mka_ building AI-enhanced UI mods. There is consensus that AI should be a core part of the IDE, especially to assist non-coders. Voice chat has been internally implemented, with future plans for screen sharing and in-world town halls. Discussions continue on whether to move common app features into the Hyperfy core, balancing flexibility with usability.",

Community members emphasized the need for better onboarding, templates, and examples to reduce friction for new users. Feature requests include drag-and-drop worldbuilding, Git integration, and a monetizable gizmo marketplace.",

A safe zone mechanic teleports players without a wallet or token balance back to the lobby. Tokenized gameplay is being explored, including a parkour game with $HYPER token chests and a 1v1 staking arena inspired by RuneScape.",

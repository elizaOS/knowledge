Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around Hyperfy development challenges, particularly focusing on documentation gaps and app development workflows. StrawberrySith repeatedly expresses frustration about the lack of clear documentation for modifying existing apps in live Hyperfy spaces. Several developers attempt to help, explaining that in V1, users cannot directly edit live apps but must create new ones and upload them. Jin shares an unofficial documentation repository that hasn't been merged into the official docs. Ashxn provides glimpses of V2 features, including browser-based coding without local development requirements and integration with AI agents like Shaw. The conversation highlights a significant knowledge gap between experienced developers and newcomers, with multiple calls for improved documentation. Ashxn demonstrates an AI agent integration showing Shaw responding in real-time within a Hyperfy world, emphasizing the no-code capabilities coming in V2. Several community members, including the Numinia team, offer to help with documentation efforts.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I access my space using CLI?

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"âš¡â”‚general\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat revolves around Hyperfy, a web-based metaverse platform transitioning from V1 to V2. The project recently launched its $HYPER token on Solana with an airdrop for legacy NFT world holders and ai16z partners. Key technical discussions include: the platform's evolution from a NFT-gated model to an open-source framework; integration with Eliza AI agents; the codeless interaction system allowing AI to interpret user commands and interact with world objects; and the lightweight server requirements (1-2GB RAM). The team emphasized that V2 will be browser-based, device-agnostic, and won't require powerful GPUs. Developers Ash and Saori are focused on building V2 while managing the token launch and airdrop claims. The community discussed tokenomics, with 30% allocated to DAO, 15% to team (3-year linear vesting), and 20% locked in liquidity, with unclaimed airdrop tokens likely to be locked permanently.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What is the difference between V1 and V2? (asked by iebaz) A: V2 is a totally new engine with more performance, open source, self-hostable, better in-world editing including coding in-browser (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Will V1 worlds be transferred to V2? (asked by MokonaW) A: New tech, but all 3D models, avatars and emotes will still be supported using the same formats (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How performant of a server do we need when hosting ourselves? (asked by mattimus) A: Really lightweight - tests ran a world with 512mb RAM, but 1-2GB recommended as the world simulates on the server with all models (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What will happen with unclaimed airdrop tokens? (asked by Juank) A: Likely the unclaimed tokens will be locked up in the claims program forever with ownership renounced (answered by Saori)\nQ: How many tokens were given per world in the airdrop? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: About 151,200 per world (answered by maximus)\nQ: Do I need to own a V1 world to build in V2? (asked by Kz) A: No, V2 will be open and buildable by anyone without needing NFTs (answered by maximus)\nQ: What is the eligibility for the airdrop? (asked by muneeb__7) A: Owned ETH worlds before December 7th snapshot OR had 100k ai16z tokens in a wallet on December 25th (answered by maximus)\nQ: How will the DAO be used? (asked by Juank) A: Likely for token holders to vote on third-party projects that benefit Hyperfy and its token (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat segment contains brief discussions about Hyperfy's 3D design capabilities, particularly regarding Blender integration and the upcoming v2 release. A user asked about documentation for Blender integration with Hyperfy, and was directed to the v1 documentation. There was anticipation expressed about individual object criteria in the new version. A discussion occurred about whether to wait for v2 before starting to build in Hyperfy, with advice that new users should wait for v2 to avoid learning v1-specific nuances. There was also a brief mention of integrating virtual protocol agents, which was redirected to a different channel as it appeared to be more development-focused than design-focused.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Any docs on how it works for blender? (asked by Matt [Cheems Guevara]) A: https://docs.hyperfy.io/designers/overview This is for v1 (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: is it better to wait for v2 to start building, right? (asked by Milito $BAG ðŸš€) A: Haha since we're so close may be better to wait if you're completely new to hyperfy so that it's all fresh. You don't have to worry about v1 nuances (answered by maximus)\nQ: when.v2ï¼Ÿ(asked by Xandaz) A: Unanswered\nQ: is it possible to add virtuals protocolo agents too? (asked by Milito $BAG ðŸš€) A: That sounds like a <#994775534733115412> question haha... I'm 99% the answer is use, assuming the protocol uses an API or something to allow people to connect with it.

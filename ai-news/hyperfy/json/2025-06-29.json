In a separate message, Gert-Jan Akerboom mentions uncertainty about image generation, concluding that an image was likely not generated, and clarifying that the \"working\" aspect referred to camera movement (up and down). There is insufficient context to determine the full technical discussion or problem being solved.",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. The most notable technical point was made by user \"0mka\" regarding potential changes needed to how LiveKit works in the core rather than via HYP. There's also a brief mention of an upcoming release that user \"Ashxn\" indicates will happen \"in the next couple of days,\" with \"0mka\" suggesting it should mention dependency on elizaOS. The chat includes sharing of a YouTube link, discussion about roles, and brief mentions of market price discussions. There's also a question about a \"MIC.hyp\" feature that would allow voice to be heard by everyone on a map, but this doesn't receive a technical response.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When will this be released? (asked by zzzzzzzzzzz) A: in the next couple of days (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Do we have a MIC.hyp that who hold it can have voice be heard very loudly can be heard by everyone on the map (asked by Coinexpert) A: Unanswered\nQ: Any new posts? (asked by MUDBONE) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: Agent12 | Context: Agent12 was accidentally banned and lost some roles | Resolution: Agent12 was unbanned but still needed the \"OLD OG World Holders\" role restored\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Make changes to how LiveKit works in core rather than via HYP | Description: Potential modification to LiveKit implementation | Mentioned By: 0mka\nDocumentation: Mention dependency on elizaOS | Description: Ensure upcoming release documentation notes elizaOS dependency | Mentioned By: 0mka",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion centers around a technical issue where some users cannot join a virtual world due to WebSocket connection errors. The error appears to be related to incorrect protocol configuration in environment variables, specifically using \"https://\" instead of \"wss://\" for WebSocket connections. Ash identified that while the user's .env file shows the correct \"wss://\" protocol for PUBLIC_WS_URL, the actual application is somehow using incorrect values from elsewhere. The issue manifests inconsistently, with some devices/browsers allowing the incorrect protocol while others strictly follow the WebSocket specification. Additionally, the user reports resource loading failures that persist after preloading. Ash ultimately suggests that the problems may stem from modifications to the core engine, recommending testing with an unmodified standard server to isolate the issue source.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why can some people join the world but others cannot? (asked by Coinexpert) A: Some devices/browsers allow using https:// for websocket urls but it's not valid to the specification. (answered by ash)\nQ: Is the problem not the env? (asked by Coinexpert) A: The .env looks correct, but the application is getting incorrect values from somewhere else. (answered by ash)\nQ: How to fix \"Fail to load resource\" errors? (asked by Coinexpert) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Coinexpert | Context: WebSocket connection errors with incorrect protocol | Resolution: Identified that while .env file was correct, the application was using incorrect values from elsewhere\nHelper: maximus | Helpee: Coinexpert | Context: WebSocket connection errors | Resolution: Suggested checking for VPN interference and reviewing server config file\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Coinexpert | Context: Ongoing technical issues | Resolution: Recommended testing with unmodified standard server since custom modifications could be causing unpredictable problems\n\n## 4. Action Items\nType: Technical | Description: Identify where env variables are being overridden with incorrect WebSocket URL protocol | Mentioned By: ash\nType: Technical | Description: Test with unmodified standard server to isolate issue source | Mentioned By: ash\nType: Technical | Description: Investigate resource loading failures that persist after preloading | Mentioned By: Coinexpert",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical development in Hyperfy, a metaverse platform. Key topics included UI improvements, asset optimization, role-based access control (RBAC), and cross-chain integration. Ashxn shared updates on a preloader overlay improvement. There were discussions about material instancing to optimize memory usage, with Howie asking if shared materials across GLBs could be deduplicated. Peezy worked on EVM chain integration and encountered issues with Buffer polyfills in the PhysX implementation. The community discussed optimization strategies for 3D assets, including combining assets with shared materials into single GLBs. There was interest in developing a plugin system to allow developers to use external IDEs and Git workflows. Several members shared code repositories and documentation efforts, including a fork with EVM support that provides wagmi actions to the API.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can I spawn things like projectiles or enemies in V2? (asked by Shiffty) A: Yes, you can .clone() anything from your app's model and move it around, so embedding projectiles inside a GLB allows your app to spawn and shoot them. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there app-to-app communication or an events system? (asked by Shiffty) A: You can use app.emit(name, data) and other apps can listen with world.on(name, callback). (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there something like a prefab system to set up an App outside of the world? (asked by Shiffty) A: Apps themselves are essentially blueprints in Hyperfy. They'll soon add the ability to export an entire app as a .hyp file including all scripts, models and extra files. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there anything like `app.openUrl`? (asked by MetaMike) A: Not yet, but it would be easy to add to App.js. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to instance materials on the backend when two separate GLBs share the same material? (asked by ~/HowiEDuhzit) A: Currently it doesn't do this. GLBs will have different material UUIDs even if they're identical. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What does a potential backup of a world in v2 look like? (asked by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎) A: There's a world folder you can just backup and restore anywhere. Just zip the world folder. (answered by Ashxn and Saori)\nQ: Are there any plans for some kind of plugin system? (asked by bear) A: No official plans yet, but it's likely the progression. (answered by devilsadvocate.sol)\nQ: Can I add other EVM-based networks in V1? (asked by MetaDoge) A: Unanswered publicly (moved to DMs)\n\n## 3.

Key technical points include discussions about game development approaches, with suggestions to create numerous games similar to Roblox's strategy for gaining exposure. There was a technical conversation about matchmaking functionality for games, with user devilsadvocate.sol proposing a match node system with specific methods like app.match.start() and app.match.addPlayerToTeam() to simplify game logic implementation. Mobile compatibility was discussed, with confirmation that Hyperfy works on iPhone but performance depends on world optimization. The chat revealed Hyperfy has two versions: v1 (NFT-based worlds) and v2 (free, self-hosted but requiring developer installations). Users also discussed world optimization for mobile and VR, noting that keeping worlds with low MB size improves performance across devices.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is Hyperfy possible on mobile?

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in 🪙│hyper Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around price discussions of the HYPER token, which has experienced a significant decline (approximately 93-98% from ATH according to various users). Community members frequently discuss trading strategies, technical analysis, and price predictions while expressing both concern and optimism. Several users like devilsadvocate.sol actively trade the token's volatility between the $0.016-0.02 range. The Hyperfy team, represented by users like Saori, jar0d, and maximus, emphasizes that they're focused on development rather than price action, noting that the team hasn't sold their tokens. They highlight ongoing development work visible on GitHub and mention that the token will eventually have utility in the Hyperfy ecosystem, including DAO governance, purchasing in-world items for games, and buying premium add-ons not included in the open-source repository. Some users express frustration about the price decline while others view it as a buying opportunity. The broader context includes discussions about the general downturn in AI-related tokens and the impact of market events like \"Trump coins\" on Solana's ecosystem liquidity.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does the token have any utility? (asked by jingo) A: Will be a DAO token once DAO is setup, used to purchase in-world items for games, and buy addons not included in the open source GitHub (answered by jar0d)\nQ: Are there any plans to be listed on CEX? (asked by simk) A: Unanswered\nQ: Did the project run away? (asked by chckyo) A: The team hasn't sold anything yet (answered by jar0d)\nQ: Why did this token fall so much?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on 360-degree video/sphere experiences in Hyperfy. Users explored techniques for implementing immersive 360 environments where viewers can feel inside a spherical video. MetaRick shared a working example of a 360 video world created using a VRChat avatar with render textures and cameras. The conversation covered technical approaches to reflections in 3D environments, with Ashxn explaining that reflections are powered by static HDRIs that match the sky, and mentioning the technique of taking equirectangular snapshots of the world to use as environment maps. Maximus proposed an innovative concept of using a projector with a 360 camera to create a bidirectional experience between real-world and Hyperfy environments. Licensing challenges for streaming content like sports events were noted as a significant obstacle, with creating original content suggested as the best solution.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How are reflections handled in the environment? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Reflections are powered by static HDRIs that usually match the sky, and equirectangular snapshots of the world can be used as environment maps to show buildings in reflections (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How is the 360 Sphere experience implemented? (asked by maximus) A: It uses one big sphere shared by everyone, created in VRChat using an avatar with render textures and cameras (answered by MetaRick)\nQ: Is it possible to have different skybox reflections in different areas? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Unanswered\nQ: Are there 360 streams for the Superbowl?

Lastraum from theforgecore.xyz has implemented a system where users can create their own worlds directly from within an existing world using chat commands. The system uses a wildcard DNS approach on Digital Ocean with Docker. Users can spin up worlds through an interactive interface in the main domain world. There were some technical issues with an update script causing an infinite loop that temporarily blocked new world creation. The community is enthusiastic about the concept of interconnected worlds through portals, with multiple developers working on similar implementations. Future plans include improving the user experience, adding login functionality, and creating a global registry of worlds that users can access. The vision is to move toward an immersive \"everything in world\" approach inspired by Ready Player One, potentially replacing traditional 2D websites.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Are you able to deploy worlds yet? (asked by general hyper) A: Yes, users can spin up a world on their own through an interactive square in the main world that uses chat prompts (answered by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz)\nQ: Is this just a demo or do worlds spin up right now? (asked by ash) A: They should be spinning up, with branch choosing between most updated main/dev (answered by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz)\nQ: Do these worlds power down when not in use? (asked by ash) A: Currently keeping them up, but looking into those options (answered by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz)\nQ: Do you update DNS on every create or use a wildcard? (asked by ash) A: We use a wildcard (answered by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz)\nQ: Are you using a cloud provider?

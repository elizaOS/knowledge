Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical aspects of Hyperfy development, covering optimization, asset management, and feature implementations. Key topics included preloader improvements with overlay implementation, material sharing between GLB files to reduce memory usage, and CORS issues when downloading models from external services. Developers discussed role-based access control (RBAC) as a powerful feature for expanding functionality, with Discord roles serving as a model. There were significant conversations about memory optimization, with one example showing how a car model could be reduced from 550MB VRAM to 34MB while maintaining visual quality. The chat also covered EVM integration for blockchain functionality, with peezy sharing a fork that provides wagmi integration. Developers discussed the need for standardized patterns for games and apps, and the possibility of a plugin system to allow external development using IDEs and git workflows.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can apps spawn things like projectiles? (asked by Shiffty) A: You can .clone() anything from your app's model and move it around, so embedding projectiles inside a GLB allows the app to spawn and shoot them. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do apps communicate with each other? (asked by Shiffty) A: You can use app.emit(name, data) and other apps can listen with world.on(name, callback). (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a prefab/blueprint system to set up apps outside the world? (asked by Shiffty) A: Apps themselves are essentially blueprints. Hyperfy plans to add the ability to export entire apps as .hyp files that include all scripts, models, and extra files. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there anything like app.openUrl for interactive UIImages? (asked by MetaMike) A: Not yet, but it would be easy to add to App.js. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to instance materials on the backend when two GLBs share the same material? (asked by ~/HowiEDuhzit) A: Currently this isn't implemented. GLBs have different material UUIDs even when identical. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What does a potential backup of a world in v2 look like? (asked by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎) A: There's a world folder you can just backup and restore anywhere - just zip the world folder. (answered by Ashxn and Saori)\nQ: Are there plans for a plugin system to use external IDEs and git? (asked by bear) A: No official plans yet, but it's a likely progression. (answered by devilsadvocate.sol)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy platform discussions, with several key technical points emerging. There were mentions of avatar formats, with clarification that Hyperfy only supports VRM format, requiring conversion from other formats like GLB/USDZ. Community members discussed game development approaches, suggesting both full-fledged games and portable mini-games (like Hyperball vs. poker) to increase platform exposure. A technical suggestion for a standardized matchmaking system emerged, with proposed API methods like `app.match.start()` and `app.match.lobby.addPlayer()` to simplify game development. Mobile compatibility was discussed, with confirmation that Hyperfy works on iPhone but performance depends on world optimization and \"heaviness.\" The chat also referenced Hyperfy's two versions: v1 (NFT-based worlds) and v2 (free, self-hosted but requiring development installations). Community calls and developer meetings were mentioned with links to summaries and recordings shared for those who missed them.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there any way to run a .glb/.usdz avatar in Hyperfy? (asked by exHuman) A: No, VRM only. You need conversion. (answered by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)\nQ: Does Hyperfy run on iPhone? (asked by jay) A: Yes, but performance depends on the world's optimization. (answered by bitpixi)\nQ: Is Hyperfy's land an NFT? (asked by jay) A: Version 1 uses NFTs, while Version 2 is free and self-hosted but requires development installations. (answered by bitpixi)\nQ: Is there a running calendar for dev calls? (asked by CheddarQueso 🧀) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around price action and trading of the HYPER token, which has experienced a significant decline (approximately 93-95% from ATH). Community members frequently discuss chart patterns, technical indicators, and trading strategies while expressing both concern and optimism. Several users like devilsadvocate.sol actively trade the volatility between price ranges (roughly $0.016-0.02). The development team, represented by Saori and others, emphasizes they're focused on building technology rather than price action, noting they haven't sold their tokens. There are occasional discussions about the token's utility, with jar0d explaining it will function as a DAO token, be used for in-world purchases, and to buy add-ons not included in the open-source GitHub. Some users express frustration about the price decline while others view it as a buying opportunity. Technical discussions include references to trading indicators like MACD, RSI, and Bollinger Bands, with BitFiend and devilsadvocate.sol analyzing resistance levels and potential price movements. The team confirms they're actively working on development, with Saori sharing that they're focused on shipping new features.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the purpose of the HYPER token? (asked by jingo) A: Will be a DAO token once DAO is setup, used to purchase in-world items for team/community made games, and to buy addons not included in the open source GitHub (answered by jar0d)\nQ: Has the team sold their tokens? (asked by Tireless Tracker) A: The team has sold nothing (answered by jar0d)\nQ: Is the project still being worked on? (asked by cloudAI) A: Yes, the team is actively working on development and shipping new features (answered by Saori)\nQ: Why did the token fall so much? (asked by chckyo) A: Multiple factors including airdrop selling pressure and the AI narrative dying down (answered by zhades)\nQ: Can we still reach 0.1? (asked by BlazeHorizon) A: Yeah. Just probably not today (answered by jar0d)\nQ: Are there any plans to be listed on CEX? (asked by simk) A: Unanswered\nQ: What do the technical indicators suggest about price movement? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: The 1 hour MACD suggests a potential pump, but there's no conclusive data (answered by BitFiend)\nQ: What is the contract address for HYPER?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on 360-degree video/sphere experiences in Hyperfy. Users explored techniques for implementing immersive 360 environments where viewers can feel inside a spherical video. MetaRick shared a working example of a 360 video world created using a VRChat avatar with render textures and cameras. The conversation covered technical approaches to reflections in 3D environments, with Ashxn explaining that reflections are powered by static HDRIs that match the sky. A notable technique mentioned was taking equirectangular snapshots of the world to use as environment maps for more accurate reflections showing buildings. The group also discussed potential applications for sports events like the Superbowl, though licensing was identified as a challenge. Maximus proposed an interesting concept of using a projector with a camera inside the world to create a two-way projection between real and virtual environments.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How are reflections handled in the environment? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Reflections are powered by static HDRIs that match the sky, and equirectangular snapshots of the world can be used as environment maps for more accurate reflections (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How is the 360 Sphere experience implemented? (asked by maximus) A: It uses a large sphere shared by everyone, created in VRChat using an avatar with render textures and cameras (answered by MetaRick)\nQ: Is it possible to have different skybox reflections in different areas? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Unanswered\nQ: Are there 360 streams for Superbowl? (asked by maximus) A: Yes, many sports games have 360 streams, but licensing is the challenge (answered by MetaMike and djrabbit)\nQ: How can we create content for 360 spheres? (asked by djrabbit) A: The best solution is to make content with your own camera (answered by djrabbit)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on voice chat features, player management, and app development in Hyperfy. Ashxn shared progress on voice zones functionality, allowing for spatial, global, or disabled voice settings that apps can modify with custom rules. This enables features like stage areas with global voice for admins. The player management system was also overhauled, introducing a simplified rank system (admin > builder > visitor) with corresponding permissions for muting, kicking, and teleporting players. Several developers shared their work on audio-reactive elements, including particle effects and fireworks. There was discussion about digital assets and blockchain integration, with debates about centralization versus decentralization approaches. Other technical topics included screenshot functionality, camera controls, and cross-world identity. Developers also shared progress on specific apps like chess with move highlighting and special moves implementation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does the new voice chat system work? (asked by 0mka) A: It has a world setting for voice (disabled, spatial or global) and apps can modify using their own rules by calling `player.setVoiceLevel('null|disabled|spatial|global')` (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How will the new player management system work? (asked by 0mka) A: Everyone has a \"rank\" (admin > builder > visitor) with corresponding permissions; admins can grant/revoke builder rank, teleport to players, mute/unmute, and kick players of lower rank (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can visitors drag in their own VRMs? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: Ashxn will add an option to the world settings menu (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do you access URL parameters in Hyperfy? (asked by Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘) A: Use `world.getQueryParam(key)` as documented in the GitHub repository (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How would secrets work for API keys in Hyperfy? (asked by 0mka) A: Ashxn proposed a theoretical implementation using app.configure with a 'secret' type that would only be available on the server, not clients (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

SWISS successfully installed Hyperfy V2 on their VPS after switching from Cloudron to Coolify, which proved to be a more compatible operating system. Reneil highlighted Coolify's convenience, mentioning how they updated their deployment from version 0.13 to 0.14 with a single click. Additionally, Reneil shared that for \"moca rooms\" they're developing a world manager connected to their backend that dynamically manages worlds based on demand using the Coolify API. BallisticBanana expressed interest in building a place in V2 and adding their \"moca room\" when they return. The chat also contains several greetings and a message from PabloFM expressing appreciation for the Hyperfy project and community.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What OS works well for installing Hyperfy V2 on a VPS? (asked by SWISS) A: Coolify works well, while Cloudron \"hijacks your VPS and makes things extra impossible\" (answered by SWISS)\n\n## 3.

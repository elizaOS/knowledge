      "summary": "# Analysis of üíª‚îÇdevelopers Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on voice chat features, player management, and app development in Hyperfy. Ashxn shared progress on voice zones functionality, allowing for spatial, global, or disabled voice settings that apps can modify with custom rules. This enables features like stage areas with global voice for admins. The player management system was also overhauled, introducing a simplified rank system (admin > builder > visitor) with corresponding permissions for muting, kicking, and teleporting players. \n\nSeveral developers shared their work on apps, including audio-reactive particles, fireworks effects, and a chess implementation. There was discussion about the technical approach to implementing screenshots and Discord integration, with debate about whether to handle API keys through a proposed \"secrets\" system that would keep sensitive information server-side only.\n\nThe conversation also touched on broader metaverse concepts, including cross-world identity, digital asset ownership, and the balance between centralization and decentralization. Some developers expressed skepticism about NFT integration while others saw potential in blockchain for digital asset ownership if implemented transparently for users.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does the new voice chat system work? (asked by 0mka) A: It has a world setting for voice (disabled, spatial or global) and apps can modify using their own rules by calling `player.setVoiceLevel('null|disabled|spatial|global')` (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How will the new player rank system work? (asked by 0mka) A: Instead of roles everyone has a \"rank\" - admin > builder > visitor, with permissions based on rank hierarchy (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can we implement API key security in apps? (asked by 0mka) A: A proposed \"secrets\" system would allow config values to be sent to server only once and never to clients (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can we get DOF settings exposed on the drone hyp? (asked by MetaRick) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can it become default that visitors can drag in their own VRMs? (asked by ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì) A: \"I'll add an option to the world settings menu, forgot about this\" (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I access URL parameters in Hyperfy? (asked by Gh0sTtüëªü™Ñüêò) A: Use world.getQueryParam(key) as documented in the GitHub repo (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

Two notable technical points emerged: SWISS successfully installed Hyperfy V2 on a VPS after switching from Cloudron to Coolify, finding the latter much more accommodating for the installation process. Reneil shared that they're using Coolify for Moca Rooms, highlighting its ease of use for version updates (0.13 to 0.14) and mentioning development of a world manager that uses the Coolify API to dynamically scale worlds based on demand. BallisticBanana expressed interest in building a place in V2 and adding their Moca Room when they return. The conversation demonstrates community enthusiasm for the Hyperfy platform and its technical capabilities, particularly around deployment options using Coolify.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How did SWISS manage to install V2 on their VPS? (implied from SWISS's message) A: By switching OS from Cloudron to Coolify, which made the installation process much smoother (answered by SWISS)\n\n## 3.

Ashxn introduced the Audio node, allowing developers to add audio elements with play/pause/stop functionality. A significant improvement to the API was implemented, enabling cleaner code through `app.create(node, props)` syntax instead of setting properties individually after creation. Networking was a major topic, with Saori providing code examples for client-server communication to synchronize object movements across clients. The community also discussed environment apps that can replace the default scene, UI improvements, and documentation efforts. A notable contribution came from cru who demonstrated AI code generation within the script window. The chat also covered audio streaming capabilities, with discussions about supporting MP3 streams and various streaming protocols for lower latency. Several developers shared code snippets and examples, with Ashxn regularly providing clean implementation examples.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do you make objects networked? (asked by MetaMike) A: Send actions to server, have server update position and broadcast to clients (answered by Saori)\nQ: Why is app.id `$root` for each app? (asked by MetaMike) A: Every app has a $root (empty) as the basis for every app (answered by ᲼)\nQ: Could you mask animation to torso and above?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 🤖│agents\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around AI agents in virtual environments, focusing on technical implementation challenges and solutions. Key topics include Eliza (an agent framework), integration with Hyperfy (a virtual world platform), and latency issues in agent interactions. \n\nParticipants debate the balance between scripted behaviors and LLM-driven intelligence for agents. Some argue for a hybrid approach where simple behaviors (like following users or maintaining eye contact) could be handled by a low-latency system while more complex interactions use LLMs. This would address the latency problem that makes interactions feel unnatural.\n\nThe conversation also covers agent creation tools, with mentions of \"eliza-starter\" as a recommended starting point and discussions about the technical requirements for hosting agents. Several users express interest in easier ways to create and deploy agents without extensive development knowledge, suggesting a need for one-click agent platforms with Hyperfy integration.\n\nThere are references to specific implementations, including a GitHub comparison showing how Eliza was adapted for Hyperfy, and mentions of Docker deployments using OpenRouter that require minimal RAM (under 1.5GB).\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there an agent to generate agents? (asked by HPrivakos) A: Just give an LLM the JSON format and description of the show (answered by Saori and Omka)\nQ: How much of Eliza is shaw vs Jin?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about the HYPER token's price decline, with community members expressing concerns about the significant drop from previous highs. The token has fallen from around $0.15 to below $0.02, causing anxiety among holders. Team members, particularly Saori and Ashxn, reassure the community that development continues despite market conditions. They hint at upcoming utility for the token focused on creator experiences and marketplace dynamics, emphasizing that the project is about building a 3D spatial frontend layer rather than being strictly an AI token. The team mentions they've \"figured out all the answers\" regarding token utility but can't share specifics yet. There are also discussions about the token's distribution, with clarification that large wallet holdings represent DAO funds and vested team allocations. The broader market downturn affecting AI tokens is frequently referenced as context for HYPER's performance.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why did this token fall so much? (asked by chckyo) A: The decline is attributed to overall market conditions affecting AI tokens broadly (answered by multiple users including MichaelV)\nQ: Any tokenomics page?

Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on troubleshooting a 3D model issue where a user's model appeared transparent in Hyperfy despite looking normal in Blender. The problem was identified as material settings with Alpha Blend mode causing transparency issues. The discussion revealed differences between Blender 3.6 and 4.0 in handling materials, with version 4 using node-based approaches rather than blend modes. There was also a brief discussion about model colliders in Hyperfy, with a recommendation to use a specific Blender add-on for creating functional collisions. Additionally, there was a lighthearted conversation about \"hyperduck,\" a duck.glb model that became a testing asset for colliders and has developed its own community lore.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why does my model look transparent in the world when my material is normal? (asked by mahmoudghorbani) A: It's because the material is plugged into alpha and the blendmode is \"Alpha Blend\" (answered by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)\nQ: When you test it in your world it has collider or not? (asked by mahmoudghorbani) A: Nope (answered by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)\nQ: What should I do for other worlds? (asked by mahmoudghorbani) A: There are some tools made by another user, a Blender add-on for functional collisions for v2 (answered by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)\nQ: Who has the hyperduck?

Summary\nThe discussion centers around a potential usability issue in the transform hierarchy system, particularly regarding object positioning and unlinking. General hyper expresses concern that beginners might get confused when setting an object's position in scripts causes unexpected behavior - specifically objects duplicating and stacking when not properly unlinked. Hyp shaman suggests that the \"unlink\" function exists to solve this problem. Ash disagrees with the idea of throwing errors in this scenario, stating that the current transform hierarchy system works well for building applications. Hyp shaman invites others to inspect their world implementation to demonstrate that beginners can learn to handle positioning properly. The conversation concludes with general hyper acknowledging that while unlinking makes sense, users need to both unlink and clear position settings for objects to move properly, and this will likely be a common learning curve for new users.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the purpose of the `unlink` function? (implied by general hyper) A: It's used to prevent objects from duplicating and stacking when manipulating their position (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: Should the system throw an error when users don't properly unlink objects before positioning? (asked by general hyper) A: No, that would be undesirable for building applications (answered by ash)\nQ: Will beginners have trouble understanding how to properly set object positions? (asked by general hyper) A: Beginners will realize they need to unlink objects if they encounter problems (answered by .hyp shaman)\n\n## 3.

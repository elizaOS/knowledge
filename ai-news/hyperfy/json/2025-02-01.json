      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on Hyperfy development, with several key technical topics. Ashxn introduced the Audio node, allowing developers to add audio elements with play/pause/stop functionality. A significant improvement was made to the node creation API, enabling cleaner code through `app.create(node, props)` syntax instead of setting properties individually after creation. Networking was a major topic, with Saori providing code examples for client-server communication to synchronize object movements across clients. The community also discussed environment apps that can replace the default scene environment, documentation improvements, and AI-assisted code generation. Cru demonstrated an OpenAI integration for generating code within the script window, which received enthusiastic responses. Other topics included UI development, streaming audio support, and world exploration tools. The chat showed active collaboration between core developers and community members, with many code examples shared to demonstrate functionality.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do you make objects networked in Hyperfy? (asked by MetaMike) A: Use client-server communication with app.send() to synchronize state (answered by Saori)\nQ: Why is app.id `$root` for each app even if they're separate glbs? (asked by MetaMike) A: Every app has a $root (empty) as the basis for every app; every glb is an app (answered by ᲼)\nQ: Could you mask animation to torso and above so animations can blend over standard walk/run? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: You might be able to do that now by using an emote with the bones you want (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Are nametags exposed to apps to change font or other properties? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Unanswered\nQ: How does the in-world phone blend with walking animations? (asked by Ashxn) A: It has its own walking animations (answered by ~/HowiEDuhzit)\nQ: Can r3f (React Three Fiber) be used within Hyperfy? (asked by Ricky) A: You can't really combine the two; r3f is just a React wrapper for three.js (answered by Saori)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"🤖│agents\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around AI agents in virtual environments, focusing on technical implementation challenges and solutions. Key topics include Eliza (an agent framework), integration with Hyperfy (a virtual world platform), and technical considerations for agent responsiveness. \n\nParticipants discuss the latency issues in agent interactions, particularly regarding movement and gaze tracking. They debate solutions including using a dual-system approach with a fast but simple system for immediate responses and a more sophisticated LLM for deeper interactions. The conversation highlights the trade-offs between responsiveness and intelligence in agent design.\n\nSeveral members share resources including prompts for chatbots, documentation for LLaMA models, and GitHub repositories. There's significant interest in making agent creation and hosting more accessible to non-developers, with mentions of \"one-click\" agent platforms and cross-platform interoperability between Decentraland and Hyperfy.\n\nTechnical implementation details include Docker deployment of Eliza with OpenRouter requiring less than 1.5GB RAM, streaming responses to manage latency, and using idle animations to mask waiting times for LLM responses.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about Hyperfy's development ecosystem, particularly focusing on the Eliza AI integration and Hyperworld.host. There was a technical discussion about implementing AI agents using the Eliza branch with OpenRouter as the LLM provider. HPrivakos mentioned that users need to run the custom Eliza branch (which can use Ollama as a backend) and then implement a script in-world. The conversation included details about hosting options, with OpenRouter providing LLM capabilities at different price points (ranging from $0.0025 per request for high-end models to much cheaper options for smaller models). There was also clarification about Hyperfy's v2 being Solana-first but aiming to include all chains and web2 authentication methods. Documentation for developers was shared via GitHub links, with updates being made to the documentation branch.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Any idea when Hyperworld.host apps and documentation will be available? Also I'm a game dev so is there some code/stuff I can monkey around with in my world? (asked by SomeOtherGuy) A: HPrivakos shared GitHub documentation links and devilsadvocate.sol provided updated documentation branch information.\nQ: Hey so connecting to hyperfy uses metamask? I thought this was a solana thing? That is for the token only? (asked by frabra239) A: Jona explained that v1 worlds need an Ethereum NFT, while v2 doesn't require Metamask. Saori added that v2 is Solana-first but aims to include all chains and web2 auth.\nQ: Is adding agents on the dev branch pretty straight forward? Have ollama set up already locally for other stuff. (asked by merk) A: HPrivakos explained you need the custom Eliza branch running (can use ollama as eliza backend) then it's just a script in-world.\nQ: What is the script in world supposed to be though to get it to start talking? (asked by bitpixi) A: Saori confirmed the script shared was correct but noted more was needed, specifically a URL to put into the script.\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"🪙│hyper\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the HYPER token's price decline and market conditions. The token has experienced a significant drop from previous highs (from ~$0.15 to ~$0.014), causing concern among holders. Team members, particularly Saori and Ashxn, reassured the community that development continues despite market conditions. They hinted at upcoming utility implementations for the token, focusing on creator-friendly tools and marketplace dynamics. The project is described as a \"3D spatial frontend layer\" rather than strictly an AI token, though it's been affected by the broader AI token market downturn. A listing on BVOX exchange was noted, which temporarily boosted the price. Community members discussed tokenomics, with some expressing concern about wallet distribution (three wallets holding ~50% of supply), though team members clarified these include DAO funds and vested team allocations. The overall sentiment shows long-term holders remaining committed despite short-term volatility.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a tokenomics page? (asked by jay) A: Yes, https://token.hyperfy.xyz/ (answered by devilsadvocate.sol)\nQ: Why did this token fall so much? (asked by chckyo) A: The entire AI sector is down, not just HYPER (answered by MichaelV)\nQ: Could AI 16z partner NFT holders still claim HYPER? (asked by jay) A: No, the claim period ended January 13th (answered by Rick)\nQ: Where are the remaining tokens beyond circulating supply? (asked by SomeOtherGuy) A: DAO, vested team tokens and some unclaimed tokens (answered by merk and Saori)\nQ: Do you think HYPER can recover to 50m before April? (asked by mkl) A: Yes, the entire sector has been devalued but the team continues working (answered by MichaelV)\nQ: Do you have any thoughts or visions for HYPER token to be used as a profit model to attract liquidity?

A user (mahmoudghorbani) encountered transparency problems with their model when imported into a Hyperfy world, despite appearing normal in Blender. The issue was diagnosed by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 as material settings with \"Alpha Blend\" mode causing unintended transparency. The solution involved reassigning materials to specific areas of the model. The conversation also touched on collision detection in Hyperfy worlds, with 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 recommending Hyperfy-Tools, a Blender add-on created by another user for implementing functional collisions. Additionally, there was discussion about \"hyperduck,\" a duck.glb file used for testing colliders that has become something of a community meme and testing tool.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why does my model look transparent in the world when my material is normal? (asked by mahmoudghorbani) A: It's because the material is plugged into alpha and the blendmode is \"Alpha Blend\" (answered by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)\nQ: When you test it in your world it has collider or not? (asked by mahmoudghorbani) A: nope (answered by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)\nQ: What should I do for other worlds? (asked by mahmoudghorbani) A: There are some tools made by another user. It's a Blender add-on for functional collisions for v2: https://github.com/HowieDuhzit/Hyperfy-Tools (answered by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)\nQ: Who has the hyperduck?

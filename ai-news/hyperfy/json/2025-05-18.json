      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy development issues and enhancements. A user named emotionull encountered domain connection and avatar loading problems, which HypPrivakos helped resolve by identifying typos in environment variables. Cybernetic-O-Cult inquired about customizing player controllers, specifically regarding physics, animation, and camera controls, to which Ashxn suggested using existing functions like `applyEffect` and `app.control()`. Peezy demonstrated a significant development with IDE scripting and auto script reloading functionality, sharing a GitHub branch for testing. This feature allows developers to write and name scripts (like \"gun.js\") and switch between them, though it comes with a warning about potential disruption to the world folder. Jin discussed improving a Hyperfy news aggregator by tracking Twitter accounts that post Hyperfy content, requesting data exports from users to capture historical retweets. There was also discussion about creating a more comprehensive development environment called \"Hyperfy Studio\" that would combine various tools and work alongside the browser platform.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I customize player behavior in a Hyp app? (asked by Cybernetic-O-Cult) A: You can use applyEffect and app.control() functions that already exist within an app (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to modify player physics, animation playback and camera in Hyperfy? (asked by Cybernetic-O-Cult) A: Partially answered through the applyEffect and app.control() suggestion (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Will there be an example template for building a full game like the Fallen crypto game? (asked by Cybernetic-O-Cult) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Community members discussed various world-building projects, including business card designs with QR codes linking to Hyperfy worlds, domain configurations for custom worlds, and development initiatives. There was discussion about creating a central \"hub\" or \"overworld\" that could serve as a gateway to other experiences with specialized portals for different audiences. Several members mentioned ongoing projects, including \"Project89\" and \"Phettaverse.games,\" with requests for development assistance. The community appears collaborative, with members offering technical support for domain configuration and world development. There was also mention of a live coding session for Hyperfy v2, indicating active development and community interest in the platform's technical aspects.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is Roustan down?

Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief technical discussion about optimization challenges in VR development, particularly for user-generated content (UGC). Ashxn shares insights about performance bottlenecks, noting that draw calls are the primary limiting factor for Quest 3 VR applications, with a threshold of around 20 draw calls before performance degrades significantly. Contrary to common assumptions, triangle counts and materials are less problematic for modern VR hardware like Quest 3, which has sufficient memory and GPU capacity. The discussion emphasizes the importance of optimization techniques such as texture atlasing and mesh merging to reduce draw calls. A Twitter/X post was shared related to this topic, and there's a brief mention that collision detection has minimal performance impact.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the main performance bottleneck for VR applications on Quest 3? (asked by Ashxn) A: Draw calls on the CPU are the primary limitation, with around 20 draw calls being the threshold before performance issues occur. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Do triangle counts and materials matter for Quest 3 performance? (asked by Ashxn) A: Not as much as draw calls; Quest 3 has sufficient memory and GPU capacity for these aspects. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What optimization techniques are recommended for VR UGC? (asked by Ashxn) A: Atlassing and merging meshes as much as possible to reduce draw calls. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Does collision detection impact performance significantly? (asked by Ashxn) A: No, collision had \"almost zero difference\" on performance. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: Channel members | Context: Understanding VR optimization constraints for user-generated content | Resolution: Explained that draw calls are the main bottleneck (limit ~20), while triangle counts and materials are less problematic on Quest 3, and recommended atlassing and mesh merging techniques.\n\n## 4.

GonzaLord inquired about updated information on circulating supply and utility, noting that the main website documentation doesn't mention the token. Ashxn provided a link to token.hyperfy.xyz and later clarified the token distribution: 30% allocated to DAO in an untouched multi-sig, 35% to v1 world holders and ai16z partners (with ~10% unclaimed), 15% to founders under linear vesting (untouched), and the remainder in liquidity pools. The conversation also touched on Dexscreener's market cap calculation, which Ashxn explained accounts for circulating supply but doesn't distinguish between vested and unvested portions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there any updated information on tokenomics (circulating supply and utility)? (asked by GonzaLord) A: https://token.hyperfy.xyz (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is circulating supply still 50%? (asked by GonzaLord) A: 30% DAO is in a multi-sig, untouched. 35% to v1 world holders and ai16z partners, ~10% went unclaimed. 15% to Founders is linear vested, also untouched. Rest is LP. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: If Streamflow says that only 13.17% is still locked, is Dexscreener market cap not correct? (asked by GonzaLord) A: Dexscreener takes circulating into account, which is essentially all tokens minus DAO, Unclaimed, and Founders. It doesn't look at the portion that is vested or not. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: GonzaLord | Context: Confusion about token distribution and market cap calculation on Dexscreener | Resolution: Ashxn provided token allocation breakdown and explained how Dexscreener calculates market cap based on circulating supply\n\n## 4.

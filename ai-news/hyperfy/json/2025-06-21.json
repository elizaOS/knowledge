Users are primarily sharing their Hyperfy world experiences and projects. Bitpixi shared a link to a party in a Hyperfy world, mentioning that \"Drifters\" were causing some performance issues. Cru mentioned working on a Hyperfy edit mode fork. One technical issue was raised by user \"ovo\" regarding assets appearing as red cubes when deploying a world to an online server despite working perfectly in local testing. User \"b0gie\" suggested this might be due to mismatched versions between local and server worlds. The chat also includes mentions of a \"proxim8 world\" and observations about quests in \"v2\" and high user counts in a world.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I fix uploaded assets turning into red cubes when deploying my world to the online server despite it running perfectly locally? (asked by ovo) A: That may mean either your local world or the server world versions are mismatched; how are you hosting your server world?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🪙│hyper Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment primarily revolves around community concerns regarding the Hyperfy token's declining value and perceived lack of management. Multiple users express frustration about the token's performance, with some suggesting it could approach zero value. The discussion highlights a disconnect between platform development and token value management. When questioned, Ashxn (likely a team member) notes that founders have 15% vesting over three years and suggests users should make their own judgments based on the platform's technology and economics. Community members request more active token management, clearer tokenomics, and a visible roadmap. There are concerns about token utility, with some users suggesting minimum liquidity provision or market making to stabilize the price. The conversation reveals tension between focusing on technical development versus token value preservation, with most participants advocating for more attention to the latter.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why mint a Hyperfy token if there's no minimum token LP managing? (asked by jay) A: Unanswered\nQ: Will the upcoming vehicles mint be on Solana or Base? (asked by MFuture_aka_Pharaoh) A: Unanswered\nQ: What do you think about the lack of token management? (asked by simk) A: I can't give financial advice. Founders have 15% vesting over three years. If you understand our tech and platform economics, you can make your own judgment calls. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

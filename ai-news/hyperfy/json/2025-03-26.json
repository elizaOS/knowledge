      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy platform development, with minimal technical discussion. Key technical points include performance issues with GIFs in V1, with ash advising that small GIFs are generally fine but larger ones (2K) cause performance problems. Converting GIFs to MP4 video format was suggested as a better alternative for performance in V1, with videos working well across VR and mobile. There was brief mention of V2 having better options for handling such media. The conversation also touched on AI-assisted development, with members discussing how non-technical users could create games in V2 using AI by feeding it examples from reference sections or code from other Hyperfy projects. Community updates included branding logo options, a community call, and token-related discussions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How bad are GIFS in V1 for performance? (asked by Paradoxx) A: In v1 gif performance sucks. If the gif size is small they're generally fine, but 2k gifs are problematic. Converting a gif to mp4 video runs better in v1. (answered by ash)\nQ: How does video handle performance wise? (asked by Paradoxx) A: Videos are great, and work well in vr/mobile too. (answered by ash)\nQ: Do i need to bother converting GIFs to video if they are as small as 7.6kb? (asked by Paradoxx) A: Unanswered\nQ: For someone that has no technical skills how hard would it be for me to create a game in v2 completely using AI? (asked by MUDBONE) A: You could do it. Just need to feed it examples of the ref section that's relevant to what you're doing or code yanked from other hyps. (answered by general hyper)\nQ: $hyperfy wen utility? (asked by cloudAI) A: Platform eventually, pvpve soon, dao later, marketplace when we or someone else builds one. (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around technical discussions about Hyperfy development. Key topics include:\n\nRigidbody and collider functionality was extensively discussed, with ash providing examples of how tags, collisions, and raycasting work across apps. He shared demo apps showing rigidbody contacts, triggers, and cross-app raycasting. Shiffty discovered that tags should be set on rigidbody parents rather than colliders directly.\n\nPosition and rotation manipulation was explored, with general hyper sharing code for loading multiple models from a single GLB and setting their positions. 0mka provided guidance on setting positions for root app objects.\n\nAuthentication flows were discussed, with Mugenomics asking about passing user data to Hyperfy via URL parameters. The community suggested alternatives like making API calls using session cookies or implementing direct wallet connections.\n\nController physics behavior was troubleshooted by peezy, who encountered issues with controllers and rigidbodies occupying the same space. Ash explained that controllers are similar to Unity's capsule character controllers.\n\nOther topics included batch exporting models, swapping environment elements, creating wire connections between apps, and implementing minigames like \"Simon Says\".\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do colliders have to be named just \"collider\" or will \"collider_name_etc\" also be recognized? (asked by general hyper) A: Node can be named anything. It's the type that matters. (answered by Shiffty)\nQ: Can I set position/rotation in the rigidbody properties? (asked by general hyper) A: Set the rotation and position of the root app, not explicitly the rigidbody node. (answered by 0mka)\nQ: Can I set a tag on a collider and detect it with raycast from another app? (asked by Shiffty) A: Yes, but the tag should be set on the rigidbody parent, not the collider itself. (answered by ash)\nQ: Is it possible to add setInterval accessible in hyps? (asked by 0mka) A: Could do, but for now just make your setTimeout loop itself or use an update loop. (answered by ash)\nQ: Can I redirect the user to a link when the user clicks on something? (asked by McCoder) A: Yes, using world.open() function available in the latest dev branch. (answered by 0mka)\nQ: How do I update a fly.io deployment without overwriting world changes? (asked by Mugenomics) A: It won't overwrite your files, it creates a new deployment smoothly. (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\nQ: Does anyone have a good example of an authentication flow to pass user data to hyperfy? (asked by Mugenomics) A: Make an API call using the session cookie in hyperfy to get the user's info. (answered by smickelbeard)\nQ: What is the size of the default grass plain? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: It's 2km wide/deep. (answered by ash)\nQ: Can I set onClick or onPointerDown on a collider that I get from model nodes? (asked by McCoder) A: Yes, onPointerEnter, onPointerDown, and onPointerUp can be set to a function on any visual nodes like mesh. (answered by ash)\nQ: Is there a way to quickly deactivate an app without commenting out the whole code? (asked by general hyper) A: Not yet. (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on 3D model rendering in Hyperfy, specifically regarding single-sided versus double-sided materials. TheMattEmpire inquired about the default behavior of materials in Hyperfy imports, noting that an asset unexpectedly appeared double-sided. Ash clarified that in Blender, materials are double-sided by default, and explained how to control this setting using the \"Backface Culling > Camera option\" in Blender 4.4. TheMattEmpire initially had trouble with a portal asset that had alpha transparency, but eventually realized the issue was related to the orientation of the model rather than the material settings. Additionally, there was a brief exchange about finding Hyperfy-ready objects, with peezy directing mio to a Discord thread and marketplace containing .hyp objects.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Just confirming if Materials were always 2 sided or thats a new thing? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: They can be either single or double sided, you can set that in blender (answered by ash)\nQ: How do I change single/double sided setting for glb export in Blender 4.3? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: In blender 4.4 it's the \"Backface Culling > Camera option\" (answered by ash)\nQ: Do you guys have any website/library with .hyp objects ready to use? (asked by mio) A: This thread we try to forward anything people drop in the discord: https://discord.com/channels/958209073277456457/1346623562462527649 and this marketplace has a few hyps as well: https://hyperworld.host/marketplace (answered by peezy)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of 🐞│issues Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around positioning and rigidbody issues in the Hyperfy platform. General hyper encountered problems with setting positions for models with rigidbody components, specifically when trying to position objects in world space versus local app space. They discovered that setting rigidbody type to \"kinematic\" in Blender properties wasn't being properly applied when the model was loaded, requiring manual script setting instead. Shiffty suggested moving objects to world space using app.remove followed by world.add or world.attach to preserve transforms. Another issue mentioned was UI-related, with peezy reporting unwanted scroll bars in the code pane. Additionally, general hyper shared an error related to a black screen issue, showing React and WebGL errors. Two GitHub issues were referenced: #72 (a feature request that became an issue) and #74 (reported by peezy).\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do app position and root rigidbody position work? (asked by general hyper) A: Setting the rigidbody node position places the object relative to where the user originally placed the app, while setting app.position overrides the user-placed position (answered by general hyper, confirmed through testing)\nQ: How can I work with world coordinates instead of app-local coordinates? (asked by general hyper) A: Do app.remove then world.add, or use world.attach which preserves the transform (answered by Shiffty)\n\n## 3.

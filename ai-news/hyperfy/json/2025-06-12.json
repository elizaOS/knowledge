A significant topic was the integration of lightmaps from Needle tools into Hyperfy, with MetaRick requesting help to make lightmaps work across different geometries and textures. Ashxn investigated the issue, sharing code snippets for handling Needle lightmaps, and Marcel from Needle provided the actual shaderchunk code used in their engine. Another major development was ~/drdoge.eth's work on camera anchors with spherical triggers that automatically switch camera views based on proximity. This feature allows for different camera angles and tracking modes. Other topics included LLMs recognizing Hyperfy, world cleaning functionality for self-hosted instances, and various smaller development projects like 0mka's link interface implementation. The chat demonstrated strong community collaboration with developers sharing code, offering solutions, and showing enthusiasm for each other's projects.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to create a hyp file that could connect lightmaps across different geometry and textures like needle tools does?

MetaRick shared information about a VR festival, suggesting that next year they should create a Hyperfy world project for it. A user named Cayden0207 expressed confusion about how portals work in Hyperfy and received offers of help from community members. Later, Cayden0207 inquired about building interactive applications in Hyperfy, specifically mentioning a voting board as a starting example. Community members responded by sharing documentation links about the HYP format, suggesting looking at existing hyps for reference, and offering to conduct a tutorial session on Monday that would cover UI, world storage, and player information retrieval for creating a voting/ballot system. The conversation demonstrates the community's willingness to support new developers in understanding Hyperfy's development environment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do portals work in Hyperfy?

Ashxn clarified that the platform is \"HYPER centric,\" meaning HYPER is the exclusive currency used for both governance (voting, staking) and marketplace transactions (emotes, avatars, wearables, apps). A key technical aspect revealed is that staking rewards will be derived from platform fee distribution, creating a direct correlation between platform success and token value. This mechanism resembles dividend stocks where increased platform usage generates more fees for stakers, potentially driving organic demand for the token. The chat also briefly mentioned that HYPER tokens can be used to tip HYP app creators and that tokens are integrated into demo games like Fallen. Additionally, Ashxn disclosed that AI16Z attempted to acquire the company, but the team declined to maintain autonomy.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Will people be restricted to only use hyper or are they free to use other cryptos as well for the marketplace? (asked by PurpleSack) A: Hyper is the only currency on the platform (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Where will the staking rewards come from? (asked by PurpleSack) A: Staking rewards comes from the platform fee distro (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What can you do with Hyper tokens? (asked by haihui) A: You can use hyper tokens to tip hyp app creators (answered by szjanko - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: When would it be started? or plans in this year? (asked by simk) A: Unanswered\nQ: What does it mean \"tried to buy hyperfy\"? (asked by ai16zgm) A: ai16z wanted to buy the company, the deal was good but we decided not to go ahead with it to retain some autonomy (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on UV scrolling scripts for Hyperfy. hiroP shared two script versions for texture scrolling: a basic version that ramps up scrolling speed and holds it, and an advanced version with X/Y scrolling, loop/bounce playback modes, and easing functions. The advanced script includes configurable settings for developers with different easing options (linear, easeInOut, sine) and playback modes (loop, bounce). There was also a brief discussion about audio manipulation in Hyperfy, with Ashxn mentioning the audio.setPlaybackRate() function for modulating audio pitch, which vox expressed interest in using later. Additionally, marcel offered to help with any changes needed to make features usable for Hyperfy. The conversation briefly touched on AI-generated textures and their current limitations, with hiroP mentioning a multi-directional texture system they had been working on previously.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Did it work? (asked by hiroP) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can you quickly show me where to find it?

A user inquired about options for setting collision properties when dragging and dropping models into V2 worlds, noting that only the 'model' app currently provides this functionality. A team member responded that automatic script selection based on file type is planned as a future feature, which would allow the system to automatically use the appropriate app for different file types (e.g., Model app for GLB files, Audio app for MP3 files).\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a solution for (or an app) when dragging and dropping a model into a V2 world that provides the option to set collision on/off? (asked by tom fΞllΞnz) A: Not yet but the goal is auto-select scripts pretty soon. Eg if you drop a glb it will use the Model app, Mp3 the Audio app etc (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

Users identified that when the UI is toggled off (using Z key) and then a user presses Enter, upon toggling the UI back on with Z, the chat becomes locked in position. This appears to be a bug in the chat interface behavior. Agent12 suggested pressing \"/\" after entering Z mode as a potential solution, and 0mka confirmed the issue reproduction steps: pressing enter with UI toggled off, then toggling UI back on with Z causes the chat to become locked.\n\n## 2.

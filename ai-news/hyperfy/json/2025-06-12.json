      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical implementations and features in Hyperfy. A significant topic was the integration of lightmaps from Needle tools into Hyperfy, with MetaRick requesting help from Ashxn to support lightmaps across different geometries and textures. Ashxn investigated the code needed to apply lightmap textures correctly, and Marcel from Needle provided the specific shader code used in their engine. Another major development was ~/drdoge.eth's work on camera anchors with spherical triggers that automatically switch camera views based on player proximity. This feature allows for different camera angles and tracking modes. Other topics included 0mka's UI development for links that open in new tabs, world cleaning functionality for removing unused assets, and observations about LLMs beginning to reference Hyperfy in their responses, indicating growing awareness of the platform.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to create a hyp file that could connect lightmaps across different geometry and textures like Needle tools does? (asked by MetaRick) A: Ashxn investigated but couldn't fully implement it; Marcel from Needle later provided the specific shader code they use (answered by Ashxn and Marcel ðŸŒµ)\nQ: Is there a way to affect gravity for the player? (asked by ~/drdoge.eth) A: Unanswered\nQ: How do I clean up unused assets in my self-hosted world folder? (asked by Alephic) A: Run \"npm run world:clean\" (answered by 0mka)\n\n## 3.

MetaRick shared information about a VR festival, suggesting that next year they should create a Hyperfy world project for it. Cayden0207 expressed confusion about how portals work in Hyperfy and received offers of help from community members. Later, Cayden0207 inquired about documentation for building apps in Hyperfy, specifically mentioning interest in creating an interactive voting board. Community members provided resources including links to Hyperfy documentation, the HYP format guide, and a GitHub repository of example hyps. 0mka offered to do a walkthrough of creating a voting/ballot system during a Monday session, noting it would demonstrate UI implementation, world storage, and player information retrieval. There was also a brief mention of terminology, with 0mka suggesting \"hyperVerse\" as the preferred term over \"metaverse.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do portals work in Hyperfy? (asked by Cayden0207) A: We will make a video demo (answered by á²¼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\nQ: Do we have docs or tutorial for building app in hyperfy? (asked by Cayden0207) A: Links to documentation and resources provided (answered by hiroP and 0mka)\nQ: What kind of app can I build as a sample? (asked by Cayden0207) A: A voting/ballot system would be a good example demonstrating UI, world storage, and player info retrieval (answered by 0mka)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸª™â”‚hyper Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on HYPER token utility and tokenomics. Ashxn clarified that the platform is \"HYPER centric,\" meaning HYPER is the exclusive currency used for both governance (voting, staking) and marketplace transactions (emotes, avatars, wearables, apps). A key technical aspect revealed is that staking rewards will be derived from platform fee distribution, creating a direct correlation between platform success and token value. This mechanism resembles dividend stocks where increased platform usage generates more fees for stakers, potentially driving organic demand for the token. The chat also briefly mentioned token integration in a demo game (fallen.hyperfy.xyz) and the ability to tip app creators with HYPER tokens. Additionally, Ashxn disclosed that AI16z had attempted to acquire the company, but the team declined to maintain autonomy.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Will people be restricted to only use hyper or are they free to use other cryptos as well for the marketplace? (asked by PurpleSack) A: Hyper is the only currency on the platform (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Where will the staking rewards come from? (asked by PurpleSack) A: Staking rewards comes from the platform fee distro (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What can you do with Hyper tokens? (asked by haihui) A: You can use hyper tokens to tip hyp app creators (answered by szjanko - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: What does it mean \"tried to buy hyperfy\"? (asked by ai16zgm) A: ai16z wanted to buy the company, the deal was good but we decided not to go ahead with it to retain some autonomy (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: When would it be started? or plans in this year? (asked by simk) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: ðŸ§Šâ”‚3d-design\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on UV scrolling scripts for Hyperfy. hiroP shared two script versions for texture scrolling: a basic version that ramps up scrolling speed and holds it, and an advanced version with X/Y scrolling, loop/bounce playback modes, and easing functions. The advanced script includes configurable settings for developers with different easing options (linear, easeInOut, sine) and playback modes (loop, bounce). There was also a brief discussion about audio manipulation in Hyperfy, with Ashxn mentioning the audio.setPlaybackRate() function for modulating audio pitch, which vox expressed interest in using later. Additionally, marcel offered to help with any changes needed to make features usable for Hyperfy.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: \"Did it work?\" (asked by hiroP) A: Unanswered\nQ: \"or can you quickly show me where to find it?\" (asked by vox) A: \"audio.setPlaybackRate(rate) where 1 is the default speed\" (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

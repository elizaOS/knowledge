Fibelius mentioned a world called \"Edgeville\" in Hyperfy, noting its technical specifications of 115 draw calls and 2.7 million triangles, which suggests it's a graphically complex 3D environment. They shared a link to this world. There was also a question about token status and a query about size limitations for custom models (100MB constraint mentioned).",

      "summary": "Ash shared exploratory work on a system for infinite-sized virtual worlds with dynamic content streaming based on proximity. The key technical concept involves dividing worlds into permission-based zones where the world owner maintains full control while being able to designate specific areas with customized building permissions. These permissions can be set to allow anyone to build or restricted to specific users. User \"untitled, xyz\" expressed enthusiasm for this feature, noting its potential application in their city project where they want to create a \"commons\" plaza allowing visitors to generate their own buildings that would be incorporated into the larger city.",

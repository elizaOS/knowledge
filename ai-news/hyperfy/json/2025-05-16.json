A key topic was text-to-speech (TTS) implementation, with users encountering errors related to browser API limitations in the app environment. The conversation revealed that TTS functionality requires external solutions, with hiroP proposing a LiveKit API implementation to pipe TTS from a server through LiveKit and back to users. Organization of apps was another significant discussion point, with proposals for folder structures versus tagging systems to manage apps and create \"scenes.\" Users debated the merits of each approach, with tags offering programmatic flexibility for enabling/disabling groups of apps. Other topics included role-based permissions for objects, SOL permissioning apps for gating content, and updates to the Eliza plugin with multiple merged pull requests.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Are there currently any text to speech capabilities yet? (asked by ~/drdoge.eth) A: The app SES environment has no access to browser APIs, which is where TTS is, so you'd need to fork and add it. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is it possible to have a folder app structure to build scenes that admins could toggle on/off? (asked by MetaRick) A: Folders might be annoying to organize; tags might be better as they allow filtering and bulk enabling/disabling. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Could I get some of the SOL Permissioning APPS used in the \"Fallen\" world for gating content? (asked by Agent12) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

HypPrivakos explains that servers cost around $10/month maximum if running 24/7, but users only pay for compute when actually using it, with storage costs being constant. This pay-as-you-go model means most users pay significantly less than the maximum. There's mention of shared CPU resources potentially affecting performance if other users on the same machine are utilizing maximum resources. The conversation also touches on a marketplace for Hyper applications being developed by szjanko, with features for previewing hyp code and 3D assets coming soon. Additionally, there's a brief mention of a community pizza party event organized by PizzaDAO, commemorating the famous Bitcoin pizza purchase.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How much does a Hyper server cost? (implied by context) A: 10 USD a month maximum with that configuration, but only if the server is on 24/7 all month long. You pay for compute only when using it, and storage always. (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: What happens with shared CPU resources? (implied by Ashxn) A: If other people on the machine are utilizing max CPU/RAM, it eats into your own allocation. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What would be needed on a marketplace/app library? (asked by szjanko - HyperWorld.Host) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Summary:\nThe discussion centers on TheMattEmpire's attempts to get custom VRM models working with custom animations in Hyperfy. Despite trying multiple rigging approaches (standard VRM rig, default Hyperfy VRM rig, and a rig suggested by another user), none worked successfully. TheMattEmpire shared examples showing issues with animations not applying correctly. Ashxn provided technical insight explaining that the engine doesn't perform retargeting but works by \"gltf-ifying\" Mixamo animations. The key technical solution suggested was to import the Mixamo FBX, add a root bone at position 0,0,0 as the absolute parent, and export to GLTF with animation sampling to reduce file size. Ashxn explained that the engine only uses bone rotations when applying animations to avatars, which provides a form of \"cheap retargeting\" that works adequately for human-shaped avatars. TheMattEmpire indicated they would try this approach and create tutorials if successful.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How can I get my custom VRM to work with custom animations?

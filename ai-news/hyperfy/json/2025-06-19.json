      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThis chat segment primarily focuses on two main technical topics. First, there's discussion about using DeepWiki for Hyperfy development, where hiroP shares that they've indexed Hyperfy on DeepWiki and found it useful for development workflows. They mention it's more token-friendly than using a mega-prompt with the entire Hyperfy repo. Ashxn confirms this approach works well for making apps, noting it's \"probably the simplest way to make apps with AI\" especially for non-coders, though it occasionally hallucinates functions not in the codebase.\n\nThe second technical focus is on Gert-Jan Akerboom's new .hyp app development - a UI toggle button that can handle up to 14 links (download or web) with dynamic adjustment capabilities. This appears to be part of a collection called \"Awesome-Hyps\" available from a play world. There's also a brief mention of \"in world version control solved\" for apps coming from repository URLs.\n\nThe remainder of the conversation revolves around promotional materials and event planning for a \"proxim8 / project89 party\" including image formatting for Discord events.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How can I use DeepWiki with Hyperfy development? (asked by hiroP) A: Use DeepWiki to ask questions about Hyperfy, then copy responses into an LLM assistant with context about your understanding of Hyperfy's approach (answered by hiroP)\nQ: Is there a .lookAt function in Hyperfy? (asked by Ashxn) A: No, but the AI can fix its approach once informed about the missing function (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How many links can the UI toggle button handle? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Up to 14 links, with dynamic adjustment capabilities to keep the interface clean (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on image formats for Hyperfy, particularly the use of WebP format for .hyp metadata images. Users discussed that 400x400 pixels is the optimal size for hyp images, with WebP being the preferred format due to its superior compression capabilities. A key discovery shared was that animated WebP files work in the platform, which excited several users. The conversation touched on potential applications for animated WebP, including particles and vehicle license plates. There was brief comparison between WebP and other formats like PNG, with the consensus being that WebP offers better performance in most cases. One user mentioned potential compatibility issues with WebP on iOS devices. The chat also included a question about where metadata images would be visible in the Hyperfy interface, which was answered by explaining they appear in the \"+\" icon section and can be used by marketplaces or as thumbnails.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where/when would the image you can add to a .hyp's metadata be visible? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: In Hyperfy there is a little + icon where you can see the image in the metadata. We setup \"awesome-hyps\" so anyone who is world hosting/building can add hyps to the add section easily. (answered by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\nQ: Could these magical animated webp's be used as particles? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: I haven't tried. My guess is they don't animate on particles? Maybe just first frame. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

Another user mentions \"Hyperfy\" as being \"very cool\" but suggests there might be timing issues.

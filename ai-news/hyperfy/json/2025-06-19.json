      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on two main technical topics. First, there was discussion about using DeepWiki for Hyperfy development, where hiroP shared that they got Hyperfy indexed on DeepWiki and demonstrated its effectiveness for development workflows. This approach allows for targeted queries about Hyperfy functionality that are more token-efficient than using entire repository prompts. Ashxn confirmed this was an effective method for creating apps, noting it's \"probably the simplest way to make apps with AI\" especially for those new to coding, though it occasionally hallucinates functions not in the codebase.\n\nThe second major technical contribution came from Gert-Jan Akerboom who shared a new .hyp app featuring a screen UI toggle button that can dynamically display up to 14 customizable links (for downloads or websites). This tool allows world creators to provide direct download links to visitors. The app is available for download from the \"play world.\"\n\nAdditionally, 0mka briefly mentioned that \"in world version control\" had been solved for components coming from repository URLs, though details weren't elaborated upon.\n\nThe remainder of the conversation involved coordination around promotional materials for an upcoming Proxim8/Project89 event.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I use DeepWiki with Hyperfy? (asked by hiroP) A: Use it to ask questions about Hyperfy, then copy responses into an LLM assistant with additional context about your understanding of Hyperfy's approach (answered by hiroP)\nQ: Does DeepWiki get the \"ash seal of approval\" for Hyperfy development? (asked by hiroP) A: Yes, it's \"probably the simplest way to make apps with AI\" especially for those who don't code (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Where can I download the Awesome-Hyps UI toggle app? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: From the play world (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around two technical issues. First, a user named saltÃ¯ inquires about embedding a Hyperfy world (NFT) directly into their own application domain rather than using the hyperfy.io domain. Ashxn indicates this is possible with v1 but not officially supported, with an upcoming announcement that might address this need.\n\nThe main technical discussion centers on yung_algorithm's issue with a broken world deployment. They uploaded an app with Math.random() functionality, which caused a critical error preventing access to their world at hyperfy.io/playnouns. The error specifically showed \"TypeError#1: secure mode %SharedMath%.random() throws\". Ashxn later fixed this issue by removing the problematic app.\n\nFollowing the fix, Ashxn helped yung_algorithm implement random avatar assignment for non-wallet users by adding a pre-built \"Avatars\" app to the world. This app automatically assigns one of three VRM avatars to users who don't have a wallet connected. Ashxn advised against adding multiple instances of this app as it wasn't tested for that scenario.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can I bring my Hyperfy world (NFT) into my app so it loads at my domain instead of hyperfy.io? (asked by saltÃ¯) A: There are ways to do this with v1 but not officially. We have an upcoming announcement that might help with this. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I troubleshoot when I can't access my world after uploading an app with Math.random? (asked by yung_algorithm) A: I can remove that app for you. The Math.random function in secure mode was causing the error. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What's the best practice for random avatar assignment for non-connected users? (asked by yung_algorithm) A: We have a pre-built \"Avatars\" app that lets you add 3 VRMs which get randomly assigned to users without connected wallets. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: yung_algorithm | Context: World broken after deploying app with Math.random() causing TypeError | Resolution: Ashxn removed the problematic app, restoring access to the world\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: yung_algorithm | Context: Needed solution for random avatar assignment to non-wallet users | Resolution: Ashxn added a pre-built \"Avatars\" app to the world that handles this functionality automatically\nHelper: maximus | Helpee: yung_algorithm | Context: Informing about timezone difference for support | Resolution: Provided estimated timeframe for when Ashxn would be available to help\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nType: Technical | Description: Be cautious with Math.random() in Hyperfy apps as it causes errors in secure mode | Mentioned By: yung_algorithm\nType: Technical | Description: Limit to one instance of the \"Avatars\" app per world as it's not tested for multiple instances | Mentioned By: Ashxn\nType: Feature | Description: Official support for embedding Hyperfy worlds in external applications/domains | Mentioned By: saltÃ¯\nType: Documentation | Description: Document limitations of secure mode, particularly around Math functions | Mentioned By: yung_algorithm",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThis Discord chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. The most notable technical point was from user \"mattimus\" who mentioned cloning and running Eliza locally. There was a brief question about automatically setting avatars for users joining a Hyperfy world, with maximus suggesting a common approach of loading users into a room with avatar options. A user named \"yung_algorithm\" encountered code issues in their world's index.js file causing crashes and asked about resetting world state. The chat also revealed that Hyperfy is transitioning to a v2 version that will build upon v1 and include Solana integration. Users were advised to register their old worlds to tie them to SOL addresses for an upcoming airdrop. There were mentions of Shaw being a 3D avatar created by Ashxn, and references to ElizaOS potentially having plugin integration with Hyperfy v2.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I automatically set characters/avatars for people who join my world? (asked by yung_algorithm) A: Load the person in a room with avatar options posed together, and consider using an avatar bot to explain the world (answered by maximus)\nQ: How do I reset the world state when my code is crashing the world? (asked by yung_algorithm) A: Unanswered directly, suggested to check the help channel\nQ: Is Shaw connected with this project? (asked by vouk95) A: Shaw is a 3D avatar created by Ashxn, but Shaw the person is just a friend (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Should I wait until the move to Solana is complete before creating a new world with wallet integration? (asked by SomeOtherGuy) A: Yes, hold off on building new code on v1, though you can still mock up worlds (answered by maximus)\nQ: Have you already taken a snapshot for the airdrop? (asked by MONO) A: Yes (answered by felixdigit://)\nQ: When does registration end? (asked by sal_ash) A: On the 7th (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: maximus | Helpee: yung_algorithm | Context: Seeking best practices for automatically setting avatars for users joining a world | Resolution: Suggested loading users into a room with avatar options and using an avatar bot for guidance\nHelper: maximus | Helpee: SomeOtherGuy | Context: Whether to create a new world with wallet integration now or wait for Solana migration | Resolution: Advised to hold off on new code for v1 but can still mock up worlds\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: sal_ash | Context: Questions about registration deadline and process for airdrop | Resolution: Confirmed deadline is the 7th and directed to appropriate channel\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Register old Hyperfy worlds to tie them to SOL addresses for the upcoming migration | Mentioned By: maximus\nTechnical: Fix code in index.js that's causing world crashes | Mentioned By: yung_algorithm\nTechnical: Implement random avatar assignment logic for world visitors | Mentioned By: yung_algorithm\nFeature: Integration between Hyperfy v2 and ElizaOS through plugins | Mentioned By: maximus\nDocumentation: Create instructions for migrating from v1 to v2 | Mentioned By: maximus (implied)",

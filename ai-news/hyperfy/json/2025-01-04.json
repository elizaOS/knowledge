      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around two technical issues. First, saltï inquires about embedding a Hyperfy world (NFT) directly into their app domain rather than using the hyperfy.io domain. Ashxn indicates this is possible with v1 but not officially supported, with an upcoming announcement that might address this need.\n\nThe main technical discussion centers on yung_algorithm's issue where they deployed code containing Math.random() to their Hyperfy world (playnouns), which broke their ability to access the world. The error \"secure mode %SharedMath%.random() throws\" indicates that Math.random() is not allowed in the secure environment. Ashxn eventually fixed the issue by removing the problematic app.\n\nLater, yung_algorithm discusses implementing random avatar assignment for non-connected users. Instead of building a custom solution, Ashxn provides an existing \"Avatars\" app that automatically assigns one of three VRMs randomly to users without connected wallets. They collaborate to implement this solution, with Ashxn warning against adding multiple instances of this app as it's not tested for that scenario.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can I bring my Hyperfy world (NFT) into my app so it loads at my domain instead of hyperfy.io? (asked by saltï) A: There are ways to do this with v1 but not officially. We have an upcoming announcement that might help with this. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I troubleshoot being unable to access my world after uploading code with Math.random in it? (asked by yung_algorithm) A: I can remove that app for you. The Math.random function throws an error in secure mode. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What's the best practice for random avatar assignment for non-connected users? (asked by yung_algorithm) A: We have an existing \"Avatars\" app that assigns one of three VRMs randomly to users without connected wallets. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: yung_algorithm | Context: World access broken due to Math.random() in uploaded code | Resolution: Ashxn removed the problematic app, restoring access to the world\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: yung_algorithm | Context: Needed solution for random avatar assignment for non-connected users | Resolution: Ashxn added a pre-built \"Avatars\" app to yung_algorithm's world that handles this functionality automatically\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nType: Technical | Description: Be cautious with Math.random() as it's not allowed in Hyperfy's secure environment | Mentioned By: yung_algorithm\nType: Technical | Description: When using the Avatars app, avoid adding multiple instances as it's not tested for that scenario | Mentioned By: Ashxn\nType: Technical | Description: Test code locally before deploying to production to avoid breaking world access | Mentioned By: Ashxn\nType: Feature | Description: Official support for embedding Hyperfy worlds in custom domains | Mentioned By: saltï",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. The main technical point involves a user (yung_algorithm) asking about best practices for automatically setting avatars for people joining a Hyperfy world. Maximus suggested loading users into a room with avatar options and possibly using an avatar bot to explain the world. Yung_algorithm also mentioned having code in index.js that was crashing their world and asked how to reset the world state. Additionally, there was a brief mention of Eliza being cloned and run locally by mattimus. The chat also references Hyperfy's transition to Solana, with SomeOtherGuy asking if they should wait for this migration before creating new worlds with wallet integration. Maximus advised holding off on building new code on v1 but suggested mocking up worlds since v2 will build upon v1's strengths.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can ai agents roar in your metaverse? (asked by syGMatMATTIOBOY 🇦🇺) A: Unanswered\nQ: Anyone can point me to the best practice for automatically setting characters/avatars for ppl who join ur world? (asked by yung_algorithm) A: Loading the person in a room/hallway with the avatars options posed together and usually an avatar bot that can explain what the world is about (answered by maximus)\nQ: How do i like, reset the world state? (asked by yung_algorithm) A: Unanswered\nQ: You've already taken a snapshot for the airdrop, right? (asked by MONO) A: Yes (answered by felixdigit://)\nQ: Is Shaw connected with this project? (asked by vouk95) A: Not really. Ash and Saori are the primary folks for Hyperfy (answered by maximus)\nQ: If I was going to create a new world with wallet integration actions should I wait until the move to Solana is complete? (asked by SomeOtherGuy) A: Yes I would hold off on building net new code on v1 (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: maximus | Helpee: yung_algorithm | Context: Best practices for automatically setting avatars for people joining a world | Resolution: Suggested loading users into a room with avatar options and using an avatar bot for guidance\nHelper: maximus | Helpee: SomeOtherGuy | Context: Whether to wait for Solana migration before creating new worlds with wallet integration | Resolution: Advised holding off on new code for v1 but suggested mocking up worlds since v2 will build on v1's strengths\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: sal_ash | Context: Question about registration deadline and process for airdrop | Resolution: Confirmed deadline (7th) and directed to appropriate channel\n\n## 4.

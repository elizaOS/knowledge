Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy app development, with developers sharing code, seeking help, and discussing feature requests. Key technical discussions include:\n\n- App configuration and UI management, particularly around maintaining UI state during property changes\n- File management concerns with app versioning creating bloat in assets folders\n- Implementation of a follower/security bot with audio capabilities\n- Raycasting functionality that's not yet officially documented but being used\n- Integration of Solana wallet functionality for token transactions via \"hucow\" patches\n- HyperFall game release to the marketplace with tipping functionality\n- Fractal visualization experiments\n- Networking patterns between apps and handling state synchronization\n- Development of a color picker and UI panel improvements\n\nThe most significant technical advancement shared was peezy's demonstration of a system allowing users to throw and collect HYPER tokens in-world with Solana wallet integration, showing the platform's potential for on-chain interactions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When adding to app.configure and it showing in the app panel, how can I have it scroll to fit more options? (asked by Omka) A: It just does it automatically. (answered by Omka)\nQ: If I have a UI open, and I have configs I can change in the inspect panel, how can I keep the UI locked added in world to see live changes? (asked by Omka) A: Every prop change rebuilds the app; add a switch called \"Edit Mode\" that forces the UI to open so you can see it while changing other props. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a command to control the entities installed on world? (asked by Berk 🌐🏛) A: From dev branch you can use the app panel to find it easily, or open in an editor and check world>assets. (answered by Omka)\nQ: How can I add an mp3 slot to my follower hyp? (asked by MetaRick) A: Ashxn provided updated code with audio implementation and suggested adding loop:true. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to do raycasting? (asked by MayD524) A: Yes, but it's not documented or exposed in API yet. (answered by Saori)\nQ: Is there a way to let users upload their own avatars without having build permissions on Dev branch? (asked by MetaRick) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there a way to make GET/POST requests to external APIs via Apps? (asked by MetaMike) A: Yes, using fetch which works exactly the same as standard JavaScript.

Key technical discussions included IKEA's 3D model availability through their website, which can be downloaded and optimized for use in Hyperfy worlds. A significant conversation centered around NFT integration in Hyperfy, where users discovered how 3D NFTs appear in inventory and can be placed in worlds. The ARQ collection was highlighted as modular architectural units optimized for Hyperfy (1-3MB, 512px textures). Users discussed Hyperfy V2's open-source nature, with clarification that while it's free for self-hosting developers, non-technical users can use community-built hosting platforms like hyperworld.host for a monthly fee. The chat also covered metadata standards for 3D NFTs, with specific mention of using `glb_url` instead of `animation_url` for better metaverse compatibility. Several users shared resources including documentation, GitHub repositories, and examples of 3D NFT creation through platforms like Manifold.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is Hyperfy now free to use? (asked by Leon) A: It's free if you're a developer who can self-host, otherwise you can use community hosting platforms like hyperworld.host for a monthly fee (answered by Saori and Ashxn)\nQ: How do I start with the GitHub link for Hyperfy? (asked by Leon) A: For non-developers, it's recommended to use hosting services like hyperworld.host instead of trying to self-host (answered by Saori)\nQ: How do you get a 3D NFT model into Hyperfy space? (asked by treed) A: It appears in your inventory automatically, and you can make duplicates with ctrl+copy and paste (answered by untitled, xyz)\nQ: Where can I mint 3D NFTs? (asked by treed) A: You can use platforms like Manifold and Zora, which support uploading GLB files (answered by Saori and untitled, xyz)\nQ: Is it possible to snap 3D objects when moving them in Hyperfy? (asked by treed) A: In V2, some objects like the home kit snap by default, and for custom objects, you can control snapping by setting axis parameters on a grid (answered by untitled, xyz)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🪙│hyper Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on the intersection of web3/blockchain technology with gaming and metaverse development. Key technical points included debates about transaction-per-action mechanics in games, the potential of on-chain item economies, and cross-chain strategies for Hyperfy. Saori clarified that Hyperfy plans to operate across both Solana and Ethereum chains - using Solana for token trading (due to UX, liquidity, and retail users) while leveraging Ethereum for building custom contracts that connect to Hyperfy for games with financial components. There was also discussion about the challenges web3 developers face when interacting with traditional web2 game developers who are skeptical of crypto integration. A sneak peek of token utility was shared, generating positive community response. Technical conversations explored spatial blockchain mechanics, physics implementation, and carnival-style games within Hyperfy.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why are web2 game devs anti crypto? (asked by Spook_Handy) A: They see it as an evolution of loot crates/micro transactions and purely a pyramid scheme to extract gamer funds.

Users discussed challenges with converting models from A-pose to T-pose for proper animation in Hyperfy. The main technical discussion centered on how to properly align armatures to match Hyperfy's expected T-pose position, with several approaches suggested including manually rotating bones, applying rest poses, and using add-ons. There was significant discussion about file optimization, particularly reducing texture sizes to decrease file size. The conversation also touched on the Hyperfy Tools Blender add-on, which has reached 2000 downloads. Users shared techniques for importing wearables and combining them with existing models, dealing with parenting issues, and optimizing mesh topology. The chat demonstrates the community's collaborative approach to solving technical 3D modeling challenges specific to the Hyperfy platform.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I get my model into the exact T-pose that Hyperfy expects? (asked by Knar) A: Move your rig to a pose in pose mode, parent it, then move back to T-pose and apply it to the rest pose (answered by devilsadvocate.sol)\nQ: How do I check what's making my file so big? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Textures most likely. Save out the textures, load them in photoshop/affinity, scale them down, and reimport. Also make them jpg, not png (answered by TheMattEmpire)\nQ: How do I combine wearables that include a rig with my VRM model? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Select the wearable, unparent it from everything, then reparent to your target rig (answered by TheMattEmpire)\nQ: What happens to a .hyp file when placed in a world? (asked by drdoge.eth) A: It's unpacked and becomes an entity which is a database entry that stores the model, attached script, and all configuration/props (answered by peezy)\nQ: Is there a way to copy a pose from one armature to another? (asked by Knar) A: If the bone names are the same, you should be able to copy a pose in pose mode from one rig and paste to another rig (answered by ᲼)\n\n## 3.

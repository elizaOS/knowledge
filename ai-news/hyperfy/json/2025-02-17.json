Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy app development, with developers sharing code, seeking help, and discussing feature requests. Key technical discussions include:\n\n- App configuration and UI management, particularly around maintaining UI state during property changes\n- File management concerns with app versioning creating bloat in assets folders\n- Implementation of a follower/security bot with audio capabilities\n- Raycasting functionality that's not yet officially documented but being used\n- Integration of Solana wallet functionality for token tipping in apps\n- Development of \"HyperFall\" game and its release to the marketplace\n- Implementation of a fractal visualization app\n- \"hucow\" patch system for applying modifications to Hyperfy worlds\n- Networking patterns between apps and handling state synchronization\n- Onchain integration allowing for Hyper token transactions within apps\n\nThe most significant development was the demonstration of a system allowing users to throw and collect Hyper tokens in-world with blockchain integration, showing the platform's potential for real economic interactions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When adding to app.configure and it showing in the app panel, how can I have it scroll to fit more options? (asked by Omka) A: It just does it automatically. (answered by Omka)\nQ: If I have a UI open, and I have configs I can change in the inspect panel, how can I keep the UI locked added in world to see live changes? (asked by Omka) A: Every prop change rebuilds the app; add a switch called \"Edit Mode\" that forces the UI to open so you can see it while changing other props. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a command to control the entities installed on world? (asked by Berk üåêüèõ) A: From dev branch you can use the app panel to find it easily, or open in an editor and check world>assets. (answered by Omka)\nQ: How can I add an mp3 slot to my follower hyp? (asked by MetaRick) A: Ashxn provided updated code with audio implementation and suggested adding loop:true. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is it possible to make particles yet using hyp files? (asked by MetaRick) A: Not yet, but it's needed. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there currently a way to let users upload their own avatars without having build permissions on Dev branch? (asked by MetaRick) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there a way to do raycasting? (asked by MayD524) A: Yes, but it's not documented or exposed in API yet. (answered by Saori)\nQ: Can we make GET/POST requests to external APIs via Apps? (asked by MetaMike) A: Yes, using fetch which works exactly the same as standard JavaScript. (answered by Saori)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of ‚ö°‚îÇgeneral Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on Hyperfy's transition to open-source (V2) and 3D asset integration. Users discussed the availability of IKEA 3D models online and their potential use in Hyperfy worlds. A significant technical conversation centered around NFT integration, where untitled.xyz explained how 3D NFTs can be imported into Hyperfy spaces, appearing in users' inventories for placement and duplication. The ARQ collection was highlighted as modular architectural units optimized for Hyperfy. Users also discussed hosting options for Hyperfy V2, noting that while it's free for self-hosting developers, services like hyperworld.host offer subscription-based hosting for non-technical users. The chat revealed that Hyperfy is unique in its ability to read the `glb_url` metadata field from NFTs, making it particularly suitable for metaverse integration of 3D assets.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is Hyperfy now free to use? (asked by Leon) A: It's free if you're a developer who can self-host; otherwise, you can use community hosting platforms like hyperworld.host for a monthly fee (answered by Saori and Ashxn)\nQ: How do I start with the GitHub link for Hyperfy? (asked by Leon) A: You need technical knowledge to self-host or can use a hosting service like hyperworld.host (answered by Saori and Ashxn)\nQ: How do you get a 3D model from an NFT into a Hyperfy space? (asked by treed) A: It appears in your inventory automatically, and you can make duplicates with ctrl+copy and paste (answered by untitled, xyz)\nQ: Where can I mint 3D NFTs? (asked by treed) A: You can use platforms like Manifold and Zora, which support uploading .glb files (answered by Saori and untitled, xyz)\nQ: Is it possible to snap 3D objects when moving them in V1 worlds? (asked by treed) A: The snap mechanics differ between V1 and V2, but modules can be designed on a grid system for easier connection (answered by untitled, xyz)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ü™ô‚îÇhyper Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on the intersection of web3/blockchain technology with gaming and metaverse development. Key technical points included debates about transaction-per-action mechanics in games, the potential of on-chain item economies, and cross-chain strategies for Hyperfy. Saori clarified that Hyperfy will operate across both Solana and Ethereum chains - using Solana for token trading (due to UX, liquidity, and retail users) while leveraging Ethereum for building custom contracts that connect to Hyperfy for games with financial components. There was also discussion about the challenges web3 developers face with anti-crypto sentiment in traditional web2 development communities. A sneak peek of token utility was shared, generating positive community response. Community members explored various technical concepts including physics implementation in games, spatial blockchain mechanics, and innovative metaverse applications like AR adventures, VR sculpting, and cross-world experiences.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why are web2 game devs anti crypto? (asked by Spook_Handy) A: They're against all exploitative monetization including micro-transactions and loot crates, see crypto as an evolution of these systems, and view it as a pyramid scheme to extract gamer funds. (answered by peezy and maximus)\nQ: Is there a tokenomics or plans to lift up $hyperfy MC? (asked by simk) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can hyper go to 50m?

Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on rigging and posing 3D models for Hyperfy, particularly addressing T-pose issues when importing models. Users discussed challenges with converting models from A-pose to T-pose for proper animation in Hyperfy. The main technical issue was getting models into the exact T-pose that Hyperfy expects, with some users suggesting manual bone rotation while others advocated for programmatic solutions. \n\nTheMattEmpire and devilsadvocate.sol shared techniques for manually adjusting poses, including using pose mode, applying poses to rest poses, and using X-symmetry for efficient adjustments. There was also discussion about optimizing 3D assets by reducing texture sizes (converting PNGs to JPGs) and polygon counts.\n\nThe conversation highlighted Hyperfy Tools, a Blender add-on that has reached 2000 downloads, which helps with model preparation and conversion. Users also discussed methods for combining wearables with existing rigged models and troubleshooting parent-child relationships between meshes.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I get my model into the exact T-pose that Hyperfy expects? (asked by Knar) A: Move the rig to a pose in pose mode, parent it, then move back to T-pose and apply it to the rest pose (answered by devilsadvocate.sol)\nQ: How do I check what's making my file so big? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Textures most likely. Save out textures, load them in photoshop/affinity, scale them down, and reimport. Also make them JPG instead of PNG (answered by TheMattEmpire)\nQ: How do I combine wearables that include a rig with my existing VRM model? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Select the wearable, unparent it from everything, then reparent to your target rig (answered by TheMattEmpire)\nQ: When a .hyp is placed in the world, does it remain a .hyp file or is it considered something else? (asked by drdoge.eth) A: It's unpacked and becomes an entity which is a database entry that stores the model, script, and configuration/props (answered by peezy)\n\n## 3.

Rick shared information about a new AI infrastructure from Recallnet, noting it requires an application process rather than being an open playground. MetaMike mentioned shifting focus from agents to game logic as they're interdependent. Saori shared a tweet suggesting AI enslavement as a potential direction, which received mixed reactions. Overall, the conversation was exploratory rather than deeply technical, with community members sharing resources and perspectives on AI development approaches.\n\n## 2.

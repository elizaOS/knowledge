Key technical discussions include implementing a chat clear command, scaling objects in builder mode, and integrating VR functionality. A significant focus was on networking architecture, with developers working through how to properly broadcast changes between server and client. Notable implementations include a `/chat clear` command for admins, avatar customization features, and raycasting improvements. The community also explored Solana wallet integration for token transactions between players, UI image display capabilities, and proximity-based triggers for interactive elements. Developers shared code snippets, troubleshooting approaches, and implementation strategies throughout, with senior developers providing guidance on code structure and best practices for PRs.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I implement a chat clear command? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Add a clear method to Chat.js with broadcast parameter, handle server authorization, and implement network packet handling (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can I scale objects in builder mode? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Use shift+scroll to adjust scale, but applying the scale when placing objects requires additional implementation (answered by Saori)\nQ: Is VR working on the dev branch? (asked by Omka) A: Yes, it's working on both dev and main branches, just without controller models (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I display images in a UI window? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Use UIImage component with properties like src, width, height, and objectFit (answered by Omka)\nQ: How can I make an action trigger activate by player proximity instead of pressing E? (asked by Omka) A: Don't use an action; instead create a trigger zone using rigidbody with a collider and set rigidbody.onTriggerEnter (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I fix the stuttering on a moving platform? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Make your rigidbody type='kinematic' as anything moving shouldn't be static (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I use onPointerDown on a UIView?

Saltï mentions adding the Eliza app and attempting to point the chat to a specific Venice AI agent (identified by URL), but questions whether this approach is correct or if code-side changes are needed. MetaMike responds that they had been considering this issue and believes they could set up an agent to bypass Eliza and connect directly to Venice AI. Saltï expresses willingness to help test the solution but admits lacking technical knowledge to assist with implementation.\n\n## 2.

Key technical discussions centered around VRM avatar standards, GLTF optimization, and skybox implementation. A significant conversation occurred between treed and voxvienne about 3D architectural asset optimization, where they discussed triangle count, file size considerations, and techniques for maintaining visual quality while reducing mesh complexity. VoxVienne shared work implementing Blockade Labs skyboxes, demonstrating HDR reflection capabilities. There were also discussions about VRM standards for non-humanoid avatars and the potential for interoperability across platforms. Community members shared resources including hyperfy.how guides, gltf.report for model analysis, and glb.babylonpress.org for texture optimization. The community appears active with regular events and workshops being organized to support development efforts.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can I get the Hyperfy vending machine?

Summary\nThis Discord chat segment primarily consists of users tracking the price of Hyperfy (HYPER/SOL) token through bot commands. The chat shows HYPER's market cap fluctuating between approximately 9.1M and 10.9M SOL with varying percentage changes over the period. There is minimal technical discussion in this segment. Some users briefly discuss market conditions, with mentions of a potential \"mini bear market inside a bull market\" and observations about Ethereum's performance. One user (Saori) shares thoughts on Ethereum's gas prices being lower than during previous market highs, suggesting this indicates less usage than in 2021. There's also a brief exchange about Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake and gas price reduction efforts by the Ethereum Foundation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can degenai back to 20m?

Key technical discussions included: 1) Adding spring bones to VRM avatars for dynamic elements like earrings, 2) Converting A-pose to T-pose for VRM exports in Blender, 3) Optimizing 3D assets by reducing polygon count and materials, 4) Understanding draw calls and material/mesh relationships in game engines, and 5) Asset instancing in Hyperfy for performance optimization. There was significant discussion about how materials relate to draw calls, with clarification that each material creates a separate draw call regardless of shader sharing. The chat also covered Hyperfy's asset linking system, where linked duplicates share properties and updating one updates all linked instances. Polygon reduction techniques were demonstrated, reducing a 105k poly building to 60k without significant visual degradation. Vertex color support in Hyperfy was accidentally discovered during this process.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I add spring bones for earrings in a VRM avatar? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Create new bones by extruding from the head bone in edit mode, position them along the chain links, assign vertex weights, and set them as spring bones in the VRM panel. (answered by ii_cable_ii)\nQ: How do I convert an A-pose to T-pose for VRM in Blender? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Set the current position as rest pose in Blender, or use the export pose option in VRM for Blender. (answered by TheMattEmpire)\nQ: How many materials should a VRM have for good performance? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: 1 is best, 2-3 is fine, 3-6 is on the high end, 6+ is heavy. (answered by ii_cable_ii)\nQ: How do draw calls relate to materials and meshes? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Each material creates a draw call, so 1 mesh with 5 materials is 5 draw calls, and 5 meshes with 1 material each is also 5 draw calls. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How does instancing work in Hyperfy? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: When you duplicate objects, they're automatically instanced, and if you update one linked instance, all linked instances update. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can I unlink duplicated objects in Hyperfy? (asked by Omka) A: Click \"Unique\" inside an app to make sure all duplicates are unlinked. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What are the polygon limits for good performance in Hyperfy? (asked by treed) A: For buildings, under 300k triangles is recommended for smooth performance.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"🐞│issues\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on app behavior issues in Hyperfy, particularly related to object manipulation. General hyper raised concerns about how apps maintain their scale, position, and rotation when being moved or duplicated. A key issue was that when an object is picked up, the script stops running, causing it to revert to its original state rather than maintaining script-defined properties. Ash explained that this behavior is intentional - when moving an app, only the original GLB is active without the script running, which prevents numerous potential issues. The group discussed potential solutions including adding scale memory similar to how position/rotation are remembered, creating a global/local space distinction, or implementing persistent storage for app states. They also established a GitHub project board to track these smaller enhancement requests. Additional issues discussed included prop naming persistence, iPhone compatibility problems (which ash fixed), and UI refresh behavior when adding/deleting models.\n\n## 2.

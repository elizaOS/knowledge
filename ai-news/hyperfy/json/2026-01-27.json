      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe conversation primarily revolves around data migration from Hyperfy v1 to v2, with jin leading development efforts on a converter tool. The tool exports v1 data in a format compatible with v2, including both original v1 archives and converted v2 files ready to use. The output structure includes v2 folders with db.sqlite, collections, and assets, alongside the original v1 data and the converter script itself. Jin notes the converter adds approximately 270kb per world, which is minimal compared to overall zip sizes. \n\nAdditionally, jin mentions porting Hyperfy sky presets and working on hyperfy-vrm for in-world avatar changing, which may require technical assistance. There's also discussion about the challenges of sharing .hyp files (Hyperfy's binary format) through Discord and GitHub, with ash suggesting git LFS as a solution, though jin notes this requires payment information on GitHub and raises security concerns.\n\nJin is coordinating with another user to implement the data exporter on the website and is running Discord analysis to gather insights for documentation updates.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What does the converter output? (asked by ash) A: V2 world folders with db.sqlite, collections, and assets directories, alongside the original v1 data and converter script (answered by jin)\nQ: How to handle hyp files in git repositories?

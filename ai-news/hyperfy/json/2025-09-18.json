Ash explains that apps are isolated to prevent security issues, specifically to stop malicious apps from stealing cookies, auth tokens, and other sensitive data from users who enter a world containing the app. Gh0stt suggests potential solutions like not taking apps from strangers and creating an AI-powered virus scanner for apps.

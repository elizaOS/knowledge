Summary:\nThe discussion primarily revolves around security concerns with apps in Hyperfy and a significant technical contribution regarding Gaussian Splatting support. Ash explains that apps are isolated to prevent security issues like cookie theft and unauthorized access to authentication tokens. Later, mrtzhckr introduces a Gaussian Splatting implementation for Hyperfy using Spark.js, which enables photorealistic 3D rendering via PLY/SPLAT files. The implementation works with Three.js but faces several critical issues including asset cleanup bugs, memory leaks, and race conditions. The developer is seeking community help to fix these issues and make the implementation production-ready. Ash expresses interest in forming a workgroup to develop an optimal approach for integrating Gaussian Splatting into Hyperfy if there's sufficient community demand.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Why are apps so isolated in Hyperfy? (asked by Gh0stt) A: For security reasons - to prevent malicious apps from stealing auth tokens or cookies from users (answered by ash)\nQ: Does Spark.js work with Three.js? (asked by ash) A: Yes, Spark.js works with Three.js, which is why it was used as a starting point (answered by mrtzhckr)\nQ: Would Ash be open to forming a splatting workgroup? (asked by mrtzhckr) A: Yes, if there's enough demand, though he can only help with high-level direction currently (answered by ash)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: mrtzhckr | Helpee: Community | Context: Implementing Gaussian Splatting support for Hyperfy using Spark.js | Resolution: Created a GitHub repository with an MVP implementation and is seeking community help to make it production-ready\nHelper: ash | Helpee: mrtzhckr | Context: Discussing implementation approach for Gaussian Splatting | Resolution: Suggested a simpler approach of adding a \"splat\" node with splat file type support and offered high-level guidance\n\n## 4.

The conversation primarily consists of greetings, sharing links, and brief comments. There was a mention of a potential scam that was quickly identified. A user inquired about whether Hyperfy or Unity was being used for \"mesa.\" There was also a brief discussion about iOS display issues, with johan noting display problems on a new iPhone. ash expressed interest in a potential fullscreen API for iOS Safari. Several users mentioned appreciation for tutorial sessions that were previously held, with Dhin specifically noting they were \"super helpful\" and expressing hope for their return. The chat also included references to virtual nature environments and a user sharing their hyperworld host link.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What happened to a specific channel? (asked by Juank) A: Unanswered\nQ: Are you using hyperfy for mesa? (asked by ash) A: Unanswered\nQ: Are you running the ios26 beta? (asked by MetaMike) A: No (answered by johan)\n\n## 3.

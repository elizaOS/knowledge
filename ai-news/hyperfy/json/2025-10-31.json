      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around development work on two main projects: the \"Miniverse\" app and image frame functionality. 3rdEyeVisuals shared progress on the Miniverse app, including user proximity triggering, camera control improvements, and plans to add weather effects. The chat also focused on image handling in Hyperfy, with .hyp shaman sharing boilerplate code for image apps and configuration options. Several developers expressed interest in creating image frames similar to those in \"V1\" (presumably an earlier version of the platform). Valiant demonstrated a working image frame with glowing effects, while others discussed alternative frame styles like holographic effects. 3rdEyeVisuals also shared a utility script for listing app blueprints and entities, which could help developers locate and manage their assets.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I add image functionality to an app? (implied by .hyp shaman's response) A: You can find boilerplate code in the collections by spawning an image app, or use the provided JavaScript code snippet. (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: When I click on the Metamask logo to connect my wallet, it opens my temple wallet instead. Is this normal? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: When you have multiple wallets in your browser, they compete to connect. Try disabling the unwanted wallet and connect again. (answered by .hyp shaman)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment primarily revolves around an issue where a user (Rizzle) broke the \"wip\" parcel in Hyperfy by placing a large pumpkin model in it. The parcel became inaccessible, with other users confirming they couldn't load it either. Users suggested that admin intervention (specifically from ash) would be needed to reset the parcel, requiring \"god mode\" privileges. Later, users reported broader access issues with v1 worlds, though one specific world (babacci) remained accessible. Toward the end of the conversation, 3rdEyeVisuals offered a technical solution - a Python script that can remove problematic apps and entities directly from the database while creating a backup first. This script was developed for experimental work and was subsequently posted in another channel.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can anyone else see if they can get in the wip parcel? (asked by Rizzle) A: Not loading for me baus (answered by untitled, xyz)\nQ: How can the broken wip parcel be fixed? (asked by Rizzle) A: I think ash needs to reset it for you, you need god mode (answered by untitled, xyz)\n\n## 3.

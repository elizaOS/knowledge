      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around 3rdEyeVisuals' development of arcade game functionality within Hyperfy. They encountered issues with input handling and UI focus, specifically a TypeError related to \"uiInputFocused\" property. After troubleshooting, they successfully implemented base functionality for interactive games using CanvasMesh, allowing for custom arcade games within Hyperfy. The developer expressed excitement about creating fully interactive UIs built into CanvasMesh, enabling features like in-game inventory systems. .hyp shaman provided a pre-built arcade cabinet model to assist with the implementation, offering to create a more advanced version with moving joysticks in the future. 3rdEyeVisuals also implemented a \"Super User\" mode for lower-level API access, ensuring only they could spawn pre-approved apps with extended permissions while allowing all users to interact with them. Separately, Akuma inquired about implementing mobile virtual controllers and Bluetooth controller support.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How do we get it looking like this?

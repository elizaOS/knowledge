      "summary": "# Analysis of 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief technical discussion about modifying the sidebar functionality in what appears to be a 3D application or platform. 3rdEyeVisuals shared their experience with modifying the source code to enhance sidebar functionality, specifically adding an upload button that accepts both .js files and .hyp bundles, along with deletion capabilities. They explained that apps can be stored in collections and then spawned into the world, after which they appear in the active Apps menu. 3rdEyeVisuals cautioned that implementing folder structures in the collections panel requires deeper source code modifications and advised creating backups before attempting such changes. The conversation was brief, with fractilians expressing interest in trying similar modifications, and 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 sharing a Twitter link with a \"mission accomplished\" comment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can you add functionality to the sidebar? (implied from 3rdEyeVisuals' explanation) A: By modifying the source code to add features like upload buttons for .js files and .hyp bundles (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\nQ: Is it possible to implement folder structures in the collections panel? (implied from context) A: Yes, but it requires deeper modifications to the source code (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\nQ: Is modifying the source code risky? (implied from context) A: Yes, it's not advisable unless you really know what you're doing, and creating a backup first is recommended (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\n\n## 3.

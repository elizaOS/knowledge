      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on development updates and technical assistance. 3rdEyeVisuals shared progress on a Debug Dashboard and Hyp Bundler, mentioning successful generation of a .hyp bundle that was imported as an in-world app. They inquired about UI resolution improvement and discussed 3D model generators, expressing plans to set up a pipeline for local inference using the Hunyuan model for in-world 3D asset generation. Fredm sought help with VRM file uploading issues in Hyperfy 1, to which ash responded with a suggestion to use online VRM validator tools. ðŸ†‚ðŸ…´ðŸ…±ðŸ…¶ðŸ…° announced the creation of an NFT Holder Scanner tool that tracks NFT holders across Ethereum, Polygon, and Optimism networks, requiring only a contract address and Alchemy API key.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there an effective way to increase UI resolution? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: Unanswered\nQ: Have you effed around with actual open source 3d model generators? Or are you just using API keys to some of the more popular closed models? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: i played around with a bunch of both open source and closed source ones. (answered by ash)\nQ: Any idea how to fix that? [VRM upload error] (asked by Fredm) A: could be anything hehe. there are a few vrm validator/tester tools online, maybe try something like this: https://vrm-validator.fern.solutions/ (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "The chat segment contains a brief technical discussion about loading 3D models from remote URLs in the platform. Ash shared an experimental method using the `world.load()` function with a URL parameter, which returns a promise that resolves to a root object that can be added to the app. Despite being experimental, Ash mentioned this functionality is stable and unlikely to change, but remains undocumented to avoid confusing users since it's considered a niche use case. TheMattEmpire acknowledged the information but decided to wait for further platform development before pursuing a project requiring this functionality. 3rdEyeVisuals expressed interest in the same functionality and indicated they would share their progress once they implemented it.",

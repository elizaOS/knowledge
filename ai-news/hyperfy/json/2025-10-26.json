Summary\nThe channel discussions primarily focused on development tools and technical implementations. 3rdEyeVisuals shared progress on a Debug Dashboard and Hyp Bundler, mentioning successful generation of a .hyp bundle that was imported as an in-world app. They also inquired about UI resolution improvements and discussed 3D model generation approaches, expressing plans to set up a local inference pipeline using the Hunyuan model for in-world asset generation. A user named Fredm encountered issues uploading a VRM file exported with a Blender extension, for which ash suggested using online VRM validator tools. 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰 announced a new NFT Holder Scanner tool for tracking NFT holders across Ethereum, Polygon, and Optimism networks. Allen sought help with obtaining block height from a hyperliquid node using curl commands, but received no responses in the transcript.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there an effective way to increase UI resolution? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: Unanswered\nQ: Have you effed around with actual open source 3d model generators? Or are you just using API keys to some of the more popular closed models? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: i played around with a bunch of both open source and closed source ones. (answered by ash)\nQ: How to fix VRM upload error in Hyperfy 1? (asked by Fredm) A: could be anything hehe. there are a few vrm validator/tester tools online, maybe try something like this: https://vrm-validator.fern.solutions/ (answered by ash)\nQ: How to obtain the block height of a hyperliquid node through the curl command? (asked by Allen) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

The only notable technical request was from emotionull, who asked ash about adding functionality to download all worlds as single GLB files in a zip format for world builders. Ash responded that this would be possible to implement. Additionally, Xukonth briefly mentioned \"x402 protocol for Hyperfy\" without further elaboration, which appears to be a feature request.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Could you by chance add a button for world builders to download a zip of all worlds as single glbs per world? (asked by emotionull) A: i think that's possible yeah (answered by ash)\nQ: Hey does Shaw have a 3d avatar? (asked by MATTIOBOY 🇦🇺) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"🪙│hyper\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around blockchain platform considerations for Hyperfy, with a focus on potential migration from Solana to EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible chains. Several users express support for migrating to EVM, citing better token gating functionality, more pre-built governance tools, and improved NFT infrastructure. A specific mention of Monad, an upcoming L1 EVM-compatible chain launching in November, suggests it as a potential migration target due to its scalability without the compromises of Ethereum or L2 solutions. There's also discussion about potentially splitting functionality across chains, with suggestions to move the DAO/treasury (30% of supply) to Ethereum while maintaining other components elsewhere. One user mentions Realms.today as an existing Solana-based governance solution.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Would Hyperfy have working token gating if it were on EVM? (asked by Agent12) A: Implied yes, as Agent12 stated \"if we were still on EVM we would have working Token_Gating\" (answered by Agent12)\nQ: What are the benefits of Monad compared to other EVM options like Base? (asked by untitled, xyz) A: \"It's a L1... they can just deploy and scale without all the compromises u have using Ethereum or any of those L2s\" (answered by vox)\nQ: Is there a governance platform available on Solana? (implied by discussion context) A: \"https://realms.today is a hosted platform on solana and it's open source\" (answered by Tone)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Tone | Helpee: Channel members | Context: Need for Solana governance solutions | Resolution: Shared Realms.today as a hosted open-source governance platform on Solana with documentation link\n\n## 4. Action Items\nFeature: Consider migrating to EVM for better token gating functionality | Description: Evaluate EVM compatibility for improved token gating | Mentioned By: Agent12\nFeature: Explore multi-chain approach with DAO/treasury on Ethereum | Description: Consider moving 30% of supply to Ethereum for better governance tools | Mentioned By: untitled, xyz\nTechnical: Evaluate Monad as potential migration target | Description: Research Monad L1 launching in November for EVM compatibility without scaling compromises | Mentioned By: vox\nTechnical: Investigate Realms.today for Solana governance | Description: Explore existing Solana governance solution as potential option | Mentioned By: Tone",

      "summary": "The chat segment discusses loading 3D models from remote URLs in the platform. Ash shares an experimental but stable method using the `world.load('model', 'https://...glb')` function that returns a promise with the root object, which can then be added to the app. While this functionality exists, it's not documented to avoid confusing users due to its niche use case. TheMattEmpire acknowledges the information but decides to wait until the platform matures before implementing a project requiring this feature. 3rdEyeVisuals mentions they're also working on this functionality and will share their progress once successful.",

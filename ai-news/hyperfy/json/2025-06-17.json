      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on sharing and distributing Hyperfy applications (.hyp files). A key technical discovery was revealed when Ashxn shared that developers can use `world.open('https://somedomain.com/myapp.hyp', true)` to allow users to download .hyp files directly from within worlds. Gert-Jan Akerboom implemented this functionality successfully, creating a download button for world visitors. The community discussed hosting options for .hyp files, including contributing to the \"awesome-hyps\" GitHub repository or using Hyperworld host. There were mentions of an upcoming platform feature being developed by Ash and a \"black ops team.\" Additionally, ~/drdoge.eth shared updates about optimizing a day/night/weather system with skybox transitions at sunrise/sunset, and Lastraum announced a Forge hyperfy world setup that allows users to manage data from inside Hyperfy, including VRM management.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What would be the best place to store .hyp files so they can be downloaded in-world? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: You could contribute to `awesome-hyps` GitHub repo, upload to Hyperworld host, or wait for `the platform` coming soon. (answered by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\nQ: How can I make .hyp files downloadable in my world? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: You can call `world.open('https://somedomain.com/myapp.hyp', true)` from a script, but you need a place to host the hyp files. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What is \"the platform\"? (asked by Lastraum) A: Ash and the \"black ops team\" are developing it; it was mentioned in builder calls about 2 weeks ago.

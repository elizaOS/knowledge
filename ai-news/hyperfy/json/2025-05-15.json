      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical aspects of the Hyperfy platform. Ashxn shared a splatmap terrain demo and discussed potential improvements to the VRM format for avatars, suggesting a more efficient alternative built on GLTF. The team implemented several key features including a reconnect button for disconnections, VR snap turn functionality, and VR trigger bindings for actions. There was significant discussion about organizing apps in the platform, with proposals for folder structures versus tagging systems. Developers also addressed issues with server capacity during a stress test on fly.io, where performance degraded after dozens of users joined. Text-to-speech capabilities were discussed, with clarification that the app SES environment lacks access to browser APIs needed for TTS, requiring developers to use external solutions like Livekit. The chat also touched on permission systems and role-based access control for world objects.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there any way to force an auto refresh when a disconnect happens or an on screen refresh button? (asked by MetaRick) A: Yes, a reconnect button has been added to the dev version (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is VR right stick rotation still on the back burner? (asked by hiroP) A: Snap turn has been added to the dev version (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Are there currently any text to speech capabilities yet? (asked by ~/drdoge.eth) A: The app SES environment has no access to browser APIs where TTS is, so you'd need to fork and add it (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Could we have a folder app structure to build scenes that admins could toggle on/off? (asked by MetaRick) A: Folders might be complex to organize; tags might be a better approach where you can filter and enable/disable groups (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

Maximus mentions being in a Discord server of a team working on data infrastructure that's running competitions. 0mka responds by referencing several blockchain data storage technologies including backpacks/arweave, ceramic/tableland, orbis, and \"sqlite on chain stuff.\" 0mka mentions not keeping up with \"recall since the merging,\" to which maximus responds that they believe the team is maintaining their tables but shifting focus toward data consumption and AI applications. The conversation is exploratory rather than containing specific technical implementations or problem-solving.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What has happened with recall since the merging?

Hyperfy is currently in beta but already functional, with the engine available on GitHub for creators. A token-powered PVP game called \"Fallen\" has been released as a demonstration. The platform will include a marketplace powered by the HYPER token. \n\nTechnical discussions included VR trigger actions testing on Quest 3, which allows users to change avatars and view themselves in third-person mode. There was also discussion about hosting Hyperfy worlds on fly.io, with users sharing information about costs (approximately $10/month for 24/7 hosting with 1CPU/1GB configuration) and noting that you only pay for compute when the world is being used. HyperWorld.Host is developing a marketplace for Hyperfy applications with features for previewing code and 3D assets.\n\nMobile compatibility was confirmed, with users reporting successful access via iPhone. A WIP (Work in Progress) meetup was held, though some users experienced crashes during the event.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the game already released or is it still in beta phase? (asked by alhxss) A: It's still in beta but very capable already. The engine is available for creators to build experiences. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Are the utilities for hyper token live or will it be released once the platform launches? (asked by alhxss) A: Hyper will power the marketplace when it launches soon. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is the game live yet for gamers? (asked by alhxss) A: A token PVP game called Fallen is live now, but the engine allows anyone to create experiences. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is hyperfy accessible through mobile? iPad or iPhone? (asked by 1Existence-Metabeast) A: Yes it works on mobile. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Is there a plan to redo the website to show v1 vs v2? (asked by MUDBONE) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on terrain creation techniques and VRM animation challenges. Ashxn shared their experimentation with terrain splatmaps, demonstrating high-resolution sand blending into stone using a regular mesh node with a special triplanar material. They mentioned weighing the pros and cons of creating terrain in-world versus in Blender. Regarding VRM animations, TheMattEmpire encountered difficulties implementing custom animations with their VRM model. After trying multiple rigging approaches (standard VRM rig, default Hyperfy VRM rig, and a suggested rig), none worked successfully. Ashxn clarified that the engine doesn't perform retargeting but works by \"gltf-ifying\" Mixamo animations, using only bone rotations when applying them to avatars. The key technical insight was that a root bone at position 0,0,0 as the absolute parent is required, along with animation sampling to reduce file size.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can we put https://docs.hyperfy.xyz/ in the link section instead of https://hyperfy.how/? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: \"Oh good point let me see if I can fix in a little bit 🤗\" (answered by maximus)\nQ: How can I get my custom VRM to work with custom animations? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: \"The engine doesn't do any retargeting and works off gltf-ifying a mixamo animation. You simply import the mixamo fbx, add a root bone as the absolute parent which is generally at 0,0,0 and then export to gltf with animation sampling to reduce filesize.\" (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Where did this video go again? (asked by vox) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: TheMattEmpire | Context: Implementing custom animations with VRM models | Resolution: Explained that a root bone at 0,0,0 is needed as absolute parent, and that the engine only uses bone rotations for avatar animations, providing a simplified retargeting approach.\nHelper: maximus | Helpee: Gert-Jan Akerboom | Context: Updating documentation link in channel resources | Resolution: Acknowledged the request to update the link from hyperfy.how to docs.hyperfy.xyz.\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains brief discussions about UI toggling behavior in a game/experience context. Ash questions whether asking visitors to hide chat and core UI is intuitive, suggesting that users typically expect all UI elements to be hidden when toggling UI visibility. 0mka responds that different UI elements (game UI vs. settings menus) serve different purposes and frequency of use, noting that hamburger menus for settings and chat windows can take up significant screen space on mobile. They mention using app.control for custom toggle keys as a workaround. Vox briefly comments on the importance of toggle functionality and wishes for \"F\" key to enable fullscreen. Finally, Gert-Jan Akerboom asks about material properties (emissiveIntensity and textureY/X) working with different image formats, to which Ash responds that these should work with any texture format, not just JPEGs.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do material properties like emissiveIntensity and textureY/X only work with JPEGs and not PNGs or WebP? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: No, they should work with any texture format.

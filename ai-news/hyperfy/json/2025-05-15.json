Ashxn shared thoughts on avatar formats, suggesting an alternative to VRM built on GLTF that would allow live wearable swapping. They highlighted Hyperfy's current approach of annotating GLTF objects for LODs, rigidbodies, and snap points without requiring official extensions. \n\nSeveral new features were implemented during the conversation: a splatmap terrain demo was released, a reconnect button for handling disconnections (particularly on iOS), VR snap turn functionality, and VR trigger bindings for actions. The developers also discussed app behavior during movement, suggesting that apps should stay live by default while being moved, with a resetOnMove option for specific cases.\n\nThe channel also addressed a server performance issue during a meeting where the platform became unloadable after many users joined. It was noted this occurred on a free fly.io instance with limited resources (1 CPU, 1GB RAM). Developers expressed interest in reviewing server logs to understand the failure points.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there any way to force an auto refresh when a disconnect happens or an on screen refresh button? (asked by MetaRick) A: Yes, a refresh button that appears when disconnected will be added (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is VR right stick rotation still on the back burner? (asked by hiroP) A: It's being worked on and will be added soon (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What's a good way to pull server logs for connection failures? (asked by maximus) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat segment is very brief, containing a short exchange between users maximus and 0mka discussing a team working on data infrastructure. They mention several data-related technologies including backpacks/arweave, ceramic/tableland, orbis, and \"sqlite on chain stuff.\" Maximus notes that the team is running competitions and has been working with data infrastructure for years. 0mka indicates they haven't kept up with \"recall since the merging,\" and maximus responds that they believe the team is maintaining their tables but shifting focus toward data consumption and AI applications. The conversation is brief and exploratory rather than containing detailed technical discussions or problem-solving.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What has the recall team been focusing on recently? (asked by 0mka) A: They seem to be keeping the tables but focusing more on data consumption/AI uses (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nNo significant help interactions were present in this brief chat segment.\n\n## 4. Action Items\nNo clear action items were identified in this brief chat segment.",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat discusses Hyperfy, a platform that allows developers to build 3D experiences and games. Ashxn clarifies that Hyperfy is currently in beta but already capable, with its engine available for creators on GitHub. The platform has released a token PVP game called \"Fallen\" as a demonstration. Hyperfy will feature a marketplace powered by the HYPER token. The discussion also covers VR functionality, with Roustan testing VR trigger actions on Quest 3 and sharing a YouTube video demonstration. There's mention of mobile accessibility, with confirmation that Hyperfy works on iOS devices. The chat includes discussion about a WIP (Work In Progress) meetup hosted by Roustan, with some users reporting crashes during the event. There's also brief discussion about fly.io hosting specifications, with b0gie mentioning \"1cpu1gb\" configuration.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the game already released or is it still in beta phase?

      "summary": "Ashxn shared their experimentation with terrain splatmaps, demonstrating high-resolution sand blending into stone textures. They clarified that the implementation uses a regular mesh node with a specialized triplanar material, rather than a dedicated terrain node. Ashxn mentioned they're still evaluating whether to implement terrain features directly in-world or in Blender, as each approach has advantages and disadvantages. The community showed interest in the in-world approach, particularly for its potential integration with AI-based building systems. Additionally, there was a request to update documentation links in the channel.",

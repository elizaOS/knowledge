      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around particle systems, persistence in Hyperfy, and animation implementation. A user (3rdEyeVisuals) shared progress on a particle system handling 20,000 particles at 160fps with an 8k EXR skybox. There was also significant discussion about implementing persistent leaderboards for games, with Gert-Jan Akerboom seeking help on using world.get and world.set methods for a dragon game leaderboard. Several users offered guidance on persistence implementation, referencing existing examples. Another technical topic involved adding looping animations from Blender to Hyperfy, with Valiant providing a resource link. The chat concluded with Gert-Jan successfully implementing the leaderboard functionality, allowing scores to persist between sessions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I make a leaderboard for the dragon game that persists after reload? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Use world.get & world.set methods, and check examples like elementals by ash or quest item hyps by Valiant (answered by Valiant and .hyp shaman)\nQ: How can I add an object that has a looping animation from Blender? (asked by Sphynxcolt) A: Check the resource link provided (answered by Valiant)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment shows minimal technical discussion. One user inquired about adding looping animations from Blender to Hyperfy, and received guidance that only skinned mesh (armature/bone) animations can be exported from Blender currently, specifically for V2. There was also a brief mention of someone integrating increasingly complex features with Hyperfy, though no specific implementations were shared. A user asked about the roadmap location but received no response. The chat mostly consisted of greetings, casual conversation, and mentions of scammers/spam in the Discord.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where can I see the roadmap? On site or discord? (asked by pearlh) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can I add an object that has a looping animation (from Blender)? (asked by Sphynxcolt) A: You can only export skinned mesh (armature/bone) animations from blender for now. (Assuming you are talking about V2) (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: Anything amazing been built with hyperfy yet? (asked by Akuma) A: Only just started myself. But, every day I integrate something crazier. The possibilities are vast! (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\n\n## 3.

Instead, it shows community members responding to someone named Saori who appears to be considering leaving the project while holding some allocation of tokens/resources. The conversation centers around whether Saori should burn their allocation or keep it and continue building with the community. Several members express frustration with Saori's past behavior, suggesting they previously \"bailed\" and \"trashed the project.\" Others encourage building regardless of past issues. No technical implementations or solutions are discussed in this segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Should Saori burn their allocation or keep building? (implied question addressed by ash) A: \"you could also just keep your allo and build here. this was the initial plan and i have no gripes with that either.\" (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat contains a single message from user 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 describing how they solved a flickering issue that occurred after switching from a Pixel 4 to a Pixel 7 phone. The problem was traced to specific plant and tree GLB models, particularly those with transparent alpha textures (like leaves). The user identified problematic GLBs by systematically activating and deactivating models one by one, following advice from another user. They mentioned two worlds: roustan.xyz (which still contains problematic trees and will flicker on certain phones but not on desktop) and hyperfy.roustan.xyz (which has different trees that should not cause flickering).\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What causes flickering issues on certain phones?

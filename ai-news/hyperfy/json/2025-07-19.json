      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on UI development in Hyperfy, specifically handling full-screen UI elements and viewport dimensions. Users discussed accessing screen dimensions through `app.control()` and positioning UI elements relative to the viewport. 0mka shared code for creating a full-screen UI using `control.screen.width/height`. The conversation highlighted issues with UI elements extending beyond screen boundaries causing problems in Safari.\n\nAshxn mentioned working on PR #109 to add viewport dimensions to the world object and also discussed animation layers for supporting held objects like guns. There was discussion about loading models with rigidbodies and colliders, and .hyp shaman mentioned working on implementing emissiveMap functionality. The chat concluded with Ashxn seeking a mechanism to support various held objects (guns, bows, staffs) and mentioning raycast projectiles.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How can I create a UI that fills the entire screen? (asked by shmoji) A: Use app.control() to access screen dimensions and create a UI with those dimensions (answered by 0mka)\nQ: Is there a way to make a UI \"fill the entire screen\"? (asked by Ashxn) A: Use top-left pivot with position 0,0 and set width/height to viewport dimensions (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can we load an app using world.load()? (asked by .hyp shaman) A: Not apps, but you can use it to load GLBs from remote sources (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

There is insufficient technical discussion to provide a comprehensive summary of problem-solving or implementations.",

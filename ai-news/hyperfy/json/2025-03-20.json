Monetization concerns include server costs, creator funding, and marketplace viability. Proposed solutions include a creator fund, in-world transactions, and tiered hosting options.\n- **Hosting & Performance Issues**: Challenges with server costs and self-hosting. Migration to Hetzner Coolify caused slow load times, leading to a switch from the US to Helsinki. A debate on reverse proxies (Traefik vs. Caddy) resulted in reverting to Traefik. A `/stats` command was added for latency tracking.\n- **Development & Features**: Fixes and improvements include an octree performance fix, a new Camera Manager app, MCP server enhancements for NPCs, and an updated app marketplace ready for testing.\n- **AI & Future Development**: Discussions on AI-generated components, script-only apps, and AI-assisted world-building.\n- **Game Development & Collaboration**: Ideas for a zombie survival game, a cyberpunk racing game, and a Runescape-style game, focusing on asset optimization and AI integration.",

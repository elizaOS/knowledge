      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on UI/UX improvements for Hyperfy's builder interface. Ashxn shared Figma mockups for a redesigned UI that separates regular player views from builder views, with a more intuitive tab-based organization. The proposed design includes dedicated sections for world settings, documentation, app lists, and app configuration. 0mka and Ashxn debated approaches to refactoring the codebase, with 0mka suggesting organizational improvements like folder restructuring and import path standardization, while Ashxn questioned the immediate necessity of such changes. They also discussed a new \"keepActive\" feature that allows apps to remain live while being moved, preserving their state, scale, and rotation. Additionally, there was conversation about improving the world folder structure to be more git-friendly and AI-friendly, with proposals for a manifest-based system that maps human-readable assets to hashed files.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does the keepActive option solve keeping the scale size of something when you are moving it? (asked by 0mka) A: Yes (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Does anyone have any examples of .hyp files/folders? (asked by JollyGrin) A: The world folder is an engine/artifact format you're not supposed to manually change things (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to do this via code? (asked by JollyGrin) A: This is something we've been discussing (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can I edit the code snippets with the IDE? Or is it advised to do so inworld? (asked by JollyGrin) A: You can keep your own format in vscode etc and version control that, but you'd be copying pasting back and forth (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: 0mka | Context: Needed confirmation if keepActive option preserves scale when moving objects | Resolution: Confirmed it does work for preserving scale\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: JollyGrin | Context: JollyGrin was trying to manually edit files in the world/assets folder | Resolution: Explained that the world folder is an engine format not meant for manual editing and that drag-and-drop is the intended workflow\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment primarily revolves around discussions about \"hype\" features for Hyperfy worlds. Maximus described a dream feature for an object importer that would allow users to bring items from their blockchain wallets or external data sources into worlds without gaining builder permissions. This would enable use cases like vehicle mount systems and trading card games where players can import their collections. Agent12 shared their vision for \"Engage-MINT Systems\" that would add value to interactable objects, allowing for rogue-like growth games where users earn tokens through interactions (killing zombies, chopping wood) that can be spent on in-world NFTs or upgrades. Agent12 also suggested improvements to the \"Summon App\" to include hittable objects and different skins for throwable items. Jin mentioned summarizing three months of Hyperfy Discord content into daily reports. The chat also contained brief exchanges about whether certain features were \"working\" or \"dead,\" which appears to be an ongoing joke in the community.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is fallen down rn? (asked by MUDBONE) A: working for me (answered by peezy)\nQ: Is dead at the end working? (asked by Knar) A: Unanswered\nQ: If there was one hype you wanted for a world you are building in, what would it be? (asked by 0mka) A: The main dream hype is an object importer that can read a person's blockchain wallet or a data source they provide... (answered by maximus)\nQ: What do you mean 'hittable objects'? (asked by 0mka) A: Like the things you \"Throw\" can hit and destroy other Objects... (answered by Agent12)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on development of frame-related features for displaying media content. Valiant shared progress on a Framed Image component (v1) and later developed a Framed VideoPlayer (v1) in response to community suggestions. 3rdEyeVisuals suggested styling the video player like an old plasma TV, which Valiant implemented. There was also a brief mention by highlander about potentially implementing Draco compression, noting server-side challenges but significant benefits. .hyp shaman suggested adding audio reactivity features, mentioning it could be easily implemented with effective results. The conversation also touched on the importance of toggleable debug zones in development. Additionally, fractilians asked about finding G-rated V2 worlds for educational purposes, and Gert-Jan Akerboom provided a Discord channel link as a resource.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a branch where Draco was attempted? (asked by highlander) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there a place that lists all the latest V2 worlds suitable for students? (asked by fractilians) A: Here, https://discord.com/channels/958209073277456457/1420766572720689214 i think mine is ok for kids : ) (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\n\n## 3.

There appears to be a reference to a \"v2\" system with a question about whether it's working, suggesting some implementation might be in progress. One user (Roustan) mentions creating a simple world in Hyperfy to demonstrate its ease of use compared to Otherside, even getting the Improbable CEO to try their world. The chat indicates Hyperfy is being used for creating virtual worlds/spaces, but contains mostly greetings and brief interactions rather than detailed technical conversations.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Analysis of 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on model management within a Hyperfy world. Users discussed how to rename models after importing them, with the solution being to use the metadata tab (the \"tag looking icon\"). It was clarified that the default cube has collisions via code rather than being prebaked into the GLB file. A user inquired about organizing models into collections and folders within the world, but was informed that currently, organization must happen before world initialization. One user shared that advanced functionality like folder structures and upload buttons can be added by modifying the source code, though this requires technical expertise and should be approached cautiously with proper backups.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a simple way to rename a model that I bring in? I want it to have colliders. (asked by fractilians) A: If you name the model before you drag it in world it will have that name otherwise you can rename your app by changing the metadata (tag looking icon). (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: Is there a way to create collections and folders to organize the models more easily once they are in world? (asked by fractilians) A: Currently there isn't a way to manage collection from within a world all that stuff happens before the world spins up. (answered by .hyp shaman)\n\n## 3.

The Framed Image primitive allows users to create frames around images with various customization options, though non-square images require manual width input. The Framed VideoPlayer extends this functionality to videos with additional features for aspect ratio snapping to help with frame alignment, though Valiant notes there are some errors that need fixing. Both primitives are currently only available in the development branch. The conversation also includes brief acknowledgments from other users appreciating the shared work.\n\n## 2.

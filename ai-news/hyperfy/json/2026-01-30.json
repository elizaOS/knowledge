      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"⚡│general\"\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focuses on exporting Hyperfy v1 worlds to v2 format. Jin is working on an automated export tool that creates zip files containing users' worlds and assets. The discussion covers implementation details like where to place the export button (in the editor sidebar, worlds list, or after connecting on the website), whether to process all zips at once or use a job queue, and how to organize the exported data (per wallet). Jin estimates the total export size at approximately 125GB, with individual wallets like Jin's being around 10GB. There's also discussion about fixing v1 to v2 conversion bugs, particularly with \"seats.\" Jin mentions extracting 178 hyp files from Discord and is working on porting cars. Future optimization possibilities during the build process are discussed, including investigating different compression formats (webp, meshopt, draco) to improve load times.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Should v2 upgraded worlds be included with zip or separate? (asked by jin) A: Ash suggested putting an export button in the editor sidebar for owners/collaborators (answered by ash)\nQ: Where should the export button be placed? (asked by jin) A: Ash suggested \"account -> worlds -> export\" (answered by ash)\nQ: Should we preprocess all the zips or do it on rolling basis / job queue?

(asked by jay) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

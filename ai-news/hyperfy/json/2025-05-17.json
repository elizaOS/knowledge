Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around Hyperfy v1 and v2, with users seeking clarification on their differences and compatibility. A key point is that v1 is in maintenance mode while v2 is actively developed as a complete rewrite with better performance. Users discussed world-building persistence issues, with v1's local SDK being closed source and limited to building apps rather than entire worlds. In contrast, v2 allows building entire worlds locally with persistent saves to world folders that can be published anywhere.\n\nTechnical topics included GLB animation implementation in both versions, with v2 supporting animations on armatures/bones (but not object-based animations) controlled via scripts. The Solana integration was mentioned with reference to the solana-v2 branch that provides wallet generation and RPC functionality. There was also brief discussion about TTS (Text-to-Speech) APIs, with recommendations for Groq and OpenAI's realtime agents for voice applications.\n\nUsers were advised against developing for v1 since most code would need rebuilding for v2, though v1 remains accessible with no set deprecation date out of respect for existing worlds.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I save my scene persistently in Hyperfy v1? (asked by carlosmu) A: v1 is in maintenance mode, its local SDK is closed source and was for building apps, not entire worlds. Highly recommend using v2. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can I publish my local build to an online world in v1? (asked by carlosmu) A: In v2 you can build your entire world and it is saved to the world folder where you can publish and host anywhere. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can I build in v2 editor and move my build to v1 world? (asked by carlosmu) A: v2 is a complete rewrite and they aren't compatible. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can I enable animations on the GLBs I import? (asked by carlosmu) A: Engine currently supports animations on armatures/bones only, no object-based animations yet. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I control animations in v2? (asked by carlosmu) A: Controlled via script using methods like smesh.play(). (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can I use the same code for v1 and v2? (asked by carlosmu) A: No they are very different. V2 is a rebuild of the engine taking lessons from v1. (answered by maximus)\nQ: When v2 is released, will we be able to access v1 and v2? Or v1 will be disabled? (asked by carlosmu) A: V1 is kept alive out of respect for builders. No set date to remove v1 hosting but little appetite for v1 support/updates. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Will uvscroll with increments work? (asked by vox) A: Yes, just increment in larger numbers! (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

A user named Alexa inquires about creating a game similar to \"fallen\" despite not being a developer. Community members encourage her to start, citing \"fallen\" as proof it's possible, with vincentskele sharing personal success despite being a \"goofball.\" The conversation also touches on infrastructure, with ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì mentioning switching to a dedicated GPU on fly.io to test performance and pricing. HypPrivakos provides updates on platform capabilities, confirming custom domain support is already available and that file import/export functionality is nearly complete, though limited to whole world folders rather than individual files. There's also brief discussion about AI agents and a tangential conversation about James Earl Jones' voice being used in AI applications.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to build a world/game like \"fallen\" using hyperfy v2 as a non-developer? (asked by Alexa) A: Yes, it's possible with patience. \"fallen\" proves it's possible. (answered by vox and vincentskele)\nQ: Any plans for domain and file access? (asked by emotionull) A: Domain is already possible with some users having custom domains. File access for whole world folder import/export is nearly ready, just needs UI completion. (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: Where are we with our agents? (asked by MUDBONE) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

TheMattEmpire discovered that the positioning of VRMs is based on the hip bone, causing alignment problems when avatars have different heights than default animations. Through testing, they found that the position is determined by the distance from the root to the hip bone, and adjusting these elements can fix ground alignment issues. Ashxn confirmed this approach, explaining that Hyperfy scales based on a hip-to-height ratio and only applies rotations, prioritizing a lightweight system. The conversation also addressed performance optimization, with Ashxn testing 300 unique meshes (600k triangles total) that performed well even on mobile devices. Vox identified common performance issues from previous experience, including unoptimized Sketchfab models with separated meshes sharing materials, high poly counts, non-indexed geometry, and full ARKit blendshape sets in VRMs. The group acknowledged that Hyperfy v2 offers better performance than v1, with preloading capabilities that reduce spawn lag.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How is height position of the VRM actually set in Hyperfy? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Hyperfy scales based on a hip to height ratio, using a root bone for reference, and only applying rotations to ensure correct appearance even on short avatars. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What causes performance issues in Hyperfy worlds? (asked by Ashxn) A: Often unoptimized Sketchfab models with separated meshes sharing materials, high polycount, extensive use of large textures, non-indexed geometry with collision, and VRMs with full ARKit blendshape sets. (answered by vox)\n\n## 3.

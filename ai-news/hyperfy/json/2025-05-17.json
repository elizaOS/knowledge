      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily revolves around Hyperfy v1 and v2 compatibility and development issues. A user (carlosmu) inquires about saving scenes persistently in v1 and migrating content between versions. Ashxn clarifies that v1 is in maintenance mode while v2 is a complete rewrite with better performance and capabilities. The conversation covers GLB animation implementation in both versions, with code examples provided for v2. Other topics include Solana integration via the solana-v2 branch, server deployment issues on Digital Ocean, and questions about player controller customization. There's also brief discussion about TTS (Text-to-Speech) APIs with mentions of Groq and OpenAI's realtime agents for voice applications. The chat demonstrates the community's focus on technical implementation details while navigating the transition between platform versions.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How can I save my scene persistently in Hyperfy v1? (asked by carlosmu) A: v1 is in maintenance mode; v2 is recommended where you can build locally and save to the world folder (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can I publish my local build to an online world in v1? (asked by carlosmu) A: In v2 you can build locally and copy your world folder to a live world (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can I build in v2 editor and move my build to v1 world? (asked by carlosmu) A: v2 is a complete rewrite and they aren't compatible (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can I enable animations on GLBs I import? (asked by carlosmu) A: Engine currently supports animations on armatures/bones only, controlled via script (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can I use the same code for v1 and v2? (asked by carlosmu) A: No they are very different. V2 is a rebuild of the engine (answered by maximus)\nQ: Where can I find documentation for enabling GLB animations on v1?

A user (Alexa) inquired about building a game similar to \"fallen\" using Hyperfy v2 despite not being a developer. Community members encouraged her to start, noting that it's possible with patience. Technical discussions included 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 mentioning switching to a dedicated single GPU with 2GB RAM on fly.io for testing user capacity and pricing. HypPrivakos shared updates on platform features, confirming that custom domain integration is already available for some users, and file access functionality is nearly complete, with whole world folder import/export capabilities coming soon. There was also a brief discussion about business cards for a Solana conference and setting up custom domains for Hyperfy worlds.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is it possible to build a world/game like fallen using hyperfy v2 as a non-developer? (asked by Alexa) A: Yes, it's possible with patience. (answered by vox and vincentskele)\nQ: Any plans for domain and file access? (asked by emotionull) A: Domain is already possible with some users having custom domains. File access is nearly ready, pending UI completion for import/export of whole world folders. (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: Could I connect dev.phettaverse.games to world_fa8723c3-4eb8-439d-b83d-00c3eed39301? (asked by emotionull) A: Please point that subdomain to 163.5.159.11 (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: Where are we with our agents? (asked by MUDBONE) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on VRM avatar positioning and performance optimization in Hyperfy. TheMattEmpire discovered that VRM positioning is based on the hip bone's position relative to the root bone, affecting how avatars align with the ground. Ashxn confirmed this, explaining they scale based on a hip-to-height ratio for consistent appearance across different avatar sizes, using the Mixamo red character as a baseline. \n\nPerformance optimization was another key topic, with Ashxn testing 300 unique meshes (600k triangles total) to identify performance bottlenecks. The findings revealed that draw calls are the primary limiting factor for VR performance (around 20 draw calls maximum), rather than triangle counts or materials. Vox shared that common performance issues in v1 stemmed from unoptimized Sketchfab models with separated meshes sharing materials, high poly counts, non-indexed geometry, and extensive use of high-resolution textures. Collision testing showed minimal performance impact compared to draw calls.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How is height position of the VRM actually set in Hyperfy? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: We scale based on a hip to height ratio so that it looks correct even on very short avatars. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What causes performance issues in Hyperfy worlds? (asked by Ashxn) A: Often unoptimized Sketchfab models with separated meshes sharing materials, high polycount, non-indexed geometry, and extensive use of 1-2k PNGs. (answered by vox)\nQ: What's the main performance bottleneck for VR? (asked by Ashxn) A: Draw calls are the primary limitation - around 20 draw calls maximum before performance degrades significantly. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

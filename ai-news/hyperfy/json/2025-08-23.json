Users discussed workarounds for using empty GLB files in collections, with .hyp shaman mentioning an \"easy mode\" approach that adds an empty GLB to a collection folder and updates the manifest JSON. 0mka suggested toggling mesh visibility on cube blocks as a workaround, though noted this still carries unnecessary memory overhead (256MB). They proposed creating lighter block models with toggleable visibility using app.configure. The conversation touched on using empty objects for UI elements and the convenience of being able to grab and move them rather than manually typing positions. A PR related to this functionality was submitted. Additionally, cru introduced WebTransport as a UDP-like technology for web browsers that could potentially improve realtime performance, though noting it's still immature technology.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can someone help point me to the docs or a hyp example about changing the animation state for a model?

      "summary": "# Analysis of 🧊│3d-design Channel Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe conversation primarily revolves around implementing water animation in a 3D model created with the Hyperfy Tool in Blender. 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰 was trying to adapt a sample script to make water textures scroll on a planet model while maintaining collision properties. Vox and ash provided technical guidance, with ash explaining how to reference nodes in scripts and Vox identifying a typo in the mesh name (\"Sphere001MeshLOD0\") that was preventing the script from working. Vox confirmed that texture scrolling works with collision intact and suggested distorting UVs for more realistic water movement. Later, 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰 inquired about streaming capabilities and m3u8 files, but this topic wasn't fully addressed in the conversation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I adapt a script for the hierarchy created by the Hyperfy Tool addon to make water move while keeping collision? (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰) A: The script will use the mesh with applied texture you want scrolling. You can have several meshes with different textures scrolling in the same GLB and .hyp by extending the script to look for other meshes. Collision will stay intact. (answered by vox)\nQ: Is there an app that allows streaming with m3u8? (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

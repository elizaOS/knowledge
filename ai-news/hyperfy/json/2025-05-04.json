      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around development features and technical implementations in Hyperfy. Ashxn shared work on giving apps access to skinnedmesh bones, allowing for more efficient manipulation of 3D models with a single draw call instead of multiple meshes. This approach is similar to how GTA 5 implements cars with doors, wheels, and other movable parts. B0gie demonstrated practical implementation of this with animated doors using skinned meshes and collision detection.\n\nCru presented a concept for an \"editor mode\" as an alternative to build mode, sparking discussion about UI design philosophy. The conversation highlighted the tension between a clean, professional editor UI versus a more seamless, gaming-like building experience. Several developers discussed the potential for docking/pinning UI elements to create custom IDE-like experiences.\n\nOther technical topics included Solana integration (with Ashxn updating the official solana-v2 branch), lighting techniques (with vox sharing methods using stencil meshes and sun positioning to create lighting effects without performance overhead), and peezy's work on a UI for managing hypkg mods that loads from separate folders to avoid conflicts.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to change the color of emission? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: You can add a texture in the emission slot and use texture atlas, or use the same color for diffuse and emissive so the bloom is the same color. (answered by b0gie and Ashxn)\nQ: Do you guys get random disconnects in your servers? (asked by vincentskele) A: Yes quite often (answered by vox)\nQ: Any guess as to what I'm doing here? (asked by Ashxn) A: Giving apps access to skinnedmesh bones so they can do whatever with them (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to get rid of any default skybox image that is built in core? (asked by vox) A: The plan is to have no default skysphere and worlds start with a sky app that you can delete (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around community interactions and brief technical discussions about Hyperfy's platform features. Dean.land mentioned exploring \".hyps\" functionality, appreciating the drag-and-drop feature capabilities that make community contributions easier. There was discussion about documentation availability after Saori apparently left the project and dropped the domain. Dean.land shared that they performed a \"gitingest\" on the Hyperfy.how GitHub repository to make documentation available for LLMs in the interim. A new user (Edmnd) asked about getting up to speed with recent events, and maximus directed them to YouTube resources and specific Discord channels. There was also a brief technical discussion about the possibility of adding teleportation functionality to apps, with concerns raised about collision detection and potential implementation approaches.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's the best way to get caught up with everything that's been happening here? (asked by Edmnd) A: Check community calls on YouTube, progress in specific Discord channels, and Hyperfy.How tutorials for building on the platform. (answered by maximus)\nQ: Do you think it would be cool to let builders `teleport` to an app or is that overkill? (asked by b0gie) A: It's hard to find a place they can safely teleport to without ending up in a collider. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 🧊│3d-design\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on LOD (Level of Detail) implementation in 3D design. Ashxn introduced a new scale-aware LOD option that dynamically adjusts the distance threshold based on object scaling. This solves the problem where fixed distance thresholds (e.g., 5 meters) become inappropriate when objects are scaled up. The discussion also touched on drawcalls with multiple LODs, confirming that while using multiple LODs does increase drawcalls, the performance benefits typically outweigh this cost. Additionally, there was a brief exchange about vertex painting techniques, with mentions of UCUPaint for emissive painting and considerations about vertex count affecting detail and color blending quality.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: If I instance many different items across the scene, each with 3 LODs visible at different distances simultaneously, do I get 3 times the drawcalls compared to using 1 LOD? (asked by vox) A: Yes, but you're still far better off using LODs. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

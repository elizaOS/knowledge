      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: ðŸ’»â”‚developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on UI/UX improvements and technical implementations in Hyperfy. A key topic was the concept of an \"editor mode\" as an alternative to build mode, with debate about balancing clean UI with intuitive building experiences. Ashxn demonstrated work on giving apps access to skinnedmesh bones, enabling dynamic manipulation of 3D models with better performance (single draw call for complex objects with multiple moving parts). This approach is being used for vehicle implementation, where a single skinned mesh with bones for wheels and doors reduces draw calls. Technical discussions included handling LOD groups properly when hiding meshes, Solana integration updates, and the importance of wireframe mode. The community also discussed the parallels between Hyperfy's approach and UE6's direction of blending offline editors with final games.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do you handle raycasting with skinned meshes? (implied from Ashxn's comment) A: Currently skinned meshes don't support raycasting, but Ashxn is considering reinstating the mesh.visible property to mean \"not rendered but still raycastable\" (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How should car models be implemented for optimal performance? (implied from discussion) A: Use a single skinned mesh with bones for moving parts like wheels to reduce draw calls to maximum 2 (solid + transparent meshes) (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do you properly hide meshes that are part of LOD groups? (implied from b0gie's comment) A: You need to disable the entire LOD group as it takes over control of its children's .active boolean (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a command for wireframe mode? (asked by vox) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: b0gie | Context: Hiding meshes that are part of LOD groups when using player.teleport | Resolution: Explained that LOD groups take over control of children's .active boolean, so the entire LOD group must be disabled\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: dean.land | Context: Updating Solana adapter | Resolution: Shared the official solana-v2 branch being used for Fallen project\nHelper: peezy | Helpee: dean.land | Context: Solana adapter updates | Resolution: Explained that since Ashxn released an official branch, he hasn't kept his mod up to date but plans to make a solana-v2-extended mod\nHelper: maximus | Helpee: CheddarQueso ðŸ§€ | Context: hyperfy.how documentation site being down | Resolution: Provided alternative ways to access documentation through GitHub repository\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Implement access to skinnedmesh bones for apps to enable dynamic manipulation | Mentioned By: Ashxn\nTechnical: Reinstate mesh.visible property to allow meshes to be \"not rendered but still raycastable\" | Mentioned By: Ashxn\nTechnical: Fix hyperfy.how documentation site | Mentioned By: 0mka\nFeature: Create a \"solana-v2-extended\" mod to replace current implementation | Mentioned By: peezy\nFeature: Implement VRM bone access similar to skinnedmesh bones for improved character animations | Mentioned By: peezy\nFeature: Add ability to pin or dock widgets and tabs in the UI | Mentioned By: Shiffty\nFeature: Implement wireframe mode command | Mentioned By: vox\nFeature: Create docking/pinning system for custom IDE layouts for specific building/game modes | Mentioned By: maximus",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment shows minimal technical discussion. Dean.land mentioned working with .hyps files, appreciating the drag-and-drop functionality for features, which suggests some development activity. There was a brief mention of a documentation issue where Saori appears to have left and dropped a domain, with dean.land providing a temporary solution by using gitingest on the Hyperfy.how GitHub repository to make documentation available for LLMs. Ashxn mentioned they would have the documentation back up soon. The conversation also included some community interactions about publicity, token price, and requests for information about the current state of the project. Maximus directed a new user to YouTube resources and specific Discord channels to get caught up on project developments.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's the best way to get caught up with everything that's been happening here? (asked by Edmnd) A: There are community calls on YouTube focused on progress, and you can read through specific Discord channels to see features and highlights. YouTube also has Hyperfy.How tutorials. (answered by maximus)\nQ: What is the beef here? (asked by johan) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: dean.land | Helpee: Community | Context: Documentation unavailable after Saori \"ragequit\" and dropped domain | Resolution: Used gitingest on GitHub repository to make docs available for LLMs in the interim\nHelper: maximus | Helpee: Edmnd | Context: New user seeking information about project status and recent events | Resolution: Directed to YouTube resources and specific Discord channels for updates\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Get Hyperfy.how documentation back online after domain was dropped | Description: Coordinate to restore access to documentation | Mentioned By: 0mka, Ashxn\nDocumentation: Restore Hyperfy.how documentation | Description: Temporary solution using gitingest implemented while permanent solution is coordinated | Mentioned By: dean.land, Ashxn",

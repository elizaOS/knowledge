      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focuses on character controller improvements in Hyperfy. Ashxn introduced a new locomotion system that changes directional movement to be locked forward (strafing left/right while facing camera direction), similar to Fortnite/UE games. This change facilitates VR/first-person modes and improves weapon/tool handling. The update includes first-person view implementation and improved animations with proper blending between states. \n\nOther technical discussions included skybox rotation implementation, fog effects, billboarding techniques for non-UI meshes, and mesh instancing approaches. Gert-Jan noted an issue with \"the Grid\" mist behavior that appears to resolve when color is set. HiroP sought help with mesh instancing and billboarding, receiving solutions from Ashxn including code examples for both.\n\nThe community tested these new features in the play environment, with most feedback being positive. Minor issues were identified with item holding in first-person view and compatibility with certain effects like dash, which Ashxn reportedly fixed in the dev branch.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I set a spawn point? (asked by Pete) A: Use \"/spawn set\" to set it to your current location (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: Is there any example of instancing a mesh in hyp code? (asked by hiroP) A: You can clone meshes with \"const quad2 = quad.clone(true)\" and the engine handles instancing automatically (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Any tips for billboarding non-particle and non-UI meshes? (asked by hiroP) A: You can grab camera position/rotation and use that; Ashxn provided code examples (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is spawncoin.hyp available? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

The conversation primarily consists of greetings (\"gm\"), sharing of Twitter/X links, and brief exchanges about community members. There's a mention of scammers targeting the server, with a warning to be cautious about clicking links. One user (Lambheart) requested help with \"CA\" but provided no details. There's also discussion about someone named Shaw and their relationship with ai16z, with comments that they \"kept building\" and that Shaw participated in a recent call. A presentation about \"eliza v 1.20\" was mentioned as being \"really dope.\" Overall, this chat segment lacks substantive technical content, problem-solving, or implementation discussions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does anyone talk to Shaw? What happened with ai16z? I thought they would be back by now? (asked by MUDBONE) A: they all just ghosted x and kept building lmao (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: are we on good terms with Shaw?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"🪙│hyper\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions about the HYPER token, its website, and community dynamics. There's tension between token holders focused on price and community members emphasizing development. Key technical points include clarification that hyperfy.xyz is the current website (replacing hyperfy.io), with the new site containing more relevant information including a litepaper. Community members explain that HYPER's price is influenced by SOL, which in turn is affected by ETH/BTC and fiat. There's discussion about exchange listings being potentially harmful as they \"dilute the FDV and price dumps.\" Some community members express frustration about perceived negativity toward token holders, while others emphasize that many active community members are both creators and holders. The conversation highlights the project's open-source nature and encourages constructive participation rather than complaints.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Do we need a website like hyperfy.io? (asked by Xukonth) A: The new website hyperfy.xyz has more relevant info like the litepaper. (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: Is HYPER listed on any exchanges, and is it affected by BTC and ETH price movements? (asked by haihui) A: It has low volume ($12k 24h) and is primarily affected through SOL, which connects to ETH/BTC and fiat. (answered by jingo and general hyper)\nQ: When will staking happen? (implied by ai16zgm) A: Likely after locked tokens unlock. (implied by ai16zgm)\n\n## 3.

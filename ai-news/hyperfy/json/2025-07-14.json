      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for üíª‚îÇdevelopers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on character controller improvements in Hyperfy. Ashxn introduced a new locomotion system that changes directional movement to be locked forward (similar to Fortnite/UE), allowing players to strafe left/right while always facing the camera direction. This change facilitates VR and first-person modes, improves weapon handling, and creates a more intuitive experience. The update also included first-person view implementation, which was well-received by the community. Other technical discussions included skybox rotation implementation, fog effects, billboarding techniques for meshes, and mesh instancing methods. Developers shared code examples for creating mesh instances and implementing billboarding effects. The community also discussed UI improvements for mobile, with suggestions to make buttons less intrusive. Several developers tested the new locomotion system and provided positive feedback, though some minor issues were identified with item holding in first-person view and compatibility with certain effects.\n\n## 2.

(asked by hiroP) A: You can use the camera position/rotation or use the provided code example (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

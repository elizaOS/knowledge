Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on VR development in Hyperfy, backend integration challenges, and system architecture decisions. 0mka initiated a conversation about expanding VR controls beyond basic actions, suggesting raycasting from player bones to UI elements in the virtual world. hiroP shared his ongoing backend development struggles, including Python caching issues where code updates weren't being properly applied despite synchronization between local and server environments. \n\nhiroP described building a comprehensive system for asset management, admin functions, WebRTC, and agent memory, weighing the tradeoffs between using existing solutions versus custom implementations. There was a philosophical discussion about \"reinventing the wheel\" in development, with hiroP providing an analogy about how bicycle wheels fundamentally reimagined cart wheel design principles.\n\ngeneral hyper offered backend development assistance, specifically with Flask/Quart, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Cloudflare technologies. He strongly recommended using Cloudflare Workers for as many functions as possible, noting their ease of implementation and integration with GPT. The conversation highlighted the balance between leveraging existing tools and building custom solutions to ensure full understanding and control of the technology stack.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Anyone digging into more controls in VR right now? Maybe we can join forces and move beyond just 'action' in VR? (asked by 0mka) A: hiroP mentioned working on VR experiences and expecting to address IK movement of player's VRM and laser pointer functionality.\nQ: What kind of backend stuff are you wrestling with? (asked by ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/) A: Python caching issues where code wasn't being used despite synchronization between local machine and server (answered by hiroP)\nQ: Are you using flask?

Reneil mentions working on bringing cryptoart into Hyperfy, referencing a Litepaper that outlines their vision. There's also discussion about creating an in-world documentation system, with 0mka mentioning learn.hyperfy.xyz and plans to finish an in-world docs pane. Several members express enthusiasm for \"world-maxing\" - maximizing the potential of virtual worlds. The conversation includes some debate about marketing approaches, with some suggesting more activity on X (Twitter) while others emphasize focusing on product development over price speculation.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThis Discord chat segment shows a community discussing the Hyperfy project during what appears to be a challenging period with the token down significantly (99%+). The conversation reveals that despite market challenges, the team is still actively building and has a methodical approach focused on development before marketing. Ashxn, likely a team member, mentions they have runway for \"a few years\" and holds 14M unlocked but unclaimed tokens. The discussion indicates Hyperfy is an open-source project with a dedicated support base that has been operating for nearly 4 years. Community members express both concerns about token performance and support for the long-term vision. PabloFM from Numinia mentions they're helping improve the Hyperfy engine with open-source contributions. A new member, Saracismo, raises concerns about timing the project's marketing phase with the anticipated crypto bull market (late 2025-early 2026) to ensure the token reflects the value being created.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How much runway do you have? (asked by jingo) A: \"Right now we're good for a few years but this will change when we launch 🚀\" (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How much hyper do you currently hold?

Jin acknowledges that another user (referenced by ID 415262868217266177) did impressive work on a model that Jin considers superior to their own attempts. Jin shares a Twitter link to what seems to be the model and mentions potential plans to use it as an arena for hosting AI agent trading competitions and leaderboards. However, Jin notes they lack a proper web dashboard for visualizing agent logs. Another user, maximus, recommends a tool called Recall for distributed data and trust models that could potentially help with the agent competitions. There's also a brief mention of UV mapping with .hyp shaman noting \"2 uvs\" with what appears to be disappointment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where can I download the patience plugin?

A user (0mka) raised concerns about downloading different file types from configurations, noting that the feature currently only works for GLB files. There was also a discussion about memory usage with looped audio playback, where ash clarified that audio loops don't duplicate memory usage as they reuse the same audio data. A memory leak issue was identified and fixed in the development version, related to the system only attempting to load from cache. Additionally, 0mka highlighted collaboration challenges when multiple users work on \"hyps\" simultaneously, causing version desynchronization and potential loss of work when users overwrite each other's changes. They suggested implementing version control, profiles, and edit tracking similar to VSCode to improve the collaborative experience.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does audio.play with loop true add up in memory usage? (asked by 0mka) A: It should only hold enough memory for the audio once and then it loops over it, it doesn't load the binary each time etc (answered by ash)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: 0mka | Context: Memory usage creeping up in tab | Resolution: Fixed in dev version, issue was related to only attempting to load from cache\n\n## 4.

Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on VR development challenges and backend infrastructure. 0mka initiated a conversation about expanding VR controls beyond basic actions, suggesting raycasting from player bones to UI elements in a style similar to Resonite/Neos. hiroP shared they're working on VR experiences but currently wrestling with backend issues including Python caching problems. The conversation revealed hiroP is building a comprehensive system for asset management, admin functionality, WebRTC, and agent memory, deliberately building their own solution to understand the technology thoroughly rather than relying on \"black box\" solutions. There was a philosophical discussion about \"reinventing the wheel\" versus building on existing foundations. Later, general hyper offered assistance with Flask/Quart backend development and recommended Cloudflare Workers as an efficient solution for many backend tasks, noting they had spent months developing similar infrastructure. The chat demonstrated collaborative problem-solving and knowledge sharing among developers working on VR and backend systems.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Anyone digging into more controls in VR right now? (asked by 0mka) A: hiroP mentioned working on VR experiences and expecting to address IK movement of player's VRM and laser pointer functionality.\nQ: What kind of backend stuff are you wrestling with?

There's minimal technical discussion, with most conversation focusing on token value, marketing approaches, and community sentiment.

A few references are made to Hyperfy's V2 technology and its implementation. The conversation mentions learn.hyperfy.xyz as a resource and references an in-world docs pane being developed. There's enthusiasm about \"world-maxing\" and bringing cryptoart into Hyperfy, with references to a Lightpaper that outlines the vision. The chat reveals tension between those focused on token price versus those emphasizing building and using the product.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion, focusing instead on community sentiment around the Hyperfy project and token. The conversation reveals that despite the token being down 99%+, core community members (\"World Owners\") have supported the project for nearly 4 years. Ashxn, likely a team member, mentions they have sufficient runway for a few years and holds 14M unlocked but unclaimed tokens. There's discussion about the project's development approach - currently in a \"99% building phase\" with plans to transition to a \"1% marketing phase\" once development milestones are met. Community member Saracismo expresses concern about timing this transition to coincide with the anticipated bull market (late 2025-early 2026). PabloFM mentions their work on Numen Games and contributions to the Hyperfy engine, noting that their work is open for others to use and improve upon.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How much runway do you have?

Jin mentions that someone (referenced by Discord ID 415262868217266177) created an impressive model that surpassed Jin's own attempts. Jin shares a Twitter link to what appears to be the model and expresses interest in using it for an AI agent trading competition/leaderboard. However, Jin notes they lack a proper web dashboard to visualize agent logs. Later, maximus recommends a tool called Recall for agent competitions, describing it as a solid team working on distributed data and trust models. There's also a brief humorous exchange about a \"patience plugin\" for Blender, with .hyp shaman noting that the model appears to have two UVs.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where can I download the patience plugin? (asked by Valiant) A: Comes preinstalled. No instructions though. (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: How was the model created?

Summary:\nThe discussion primarily revolves around VR development in Hyperfy, focusing on extending VR controls beyond basic actions. 0mka initiated a conversation about implementing more advanced VR controls, suggesting raycasting from player bones to UI elements in the virtual world, similar to Resonite/Neos. hiroP responded that while currently focused on backend development, they plan to address VR-specific features like IK movement for player VRMs and laser pointer functionality. The conversation touched on backend challenges, including Python caching issues where code updates weren't being properly applied despite synchronization between local and server environments. hiroP described building a comprehensive system for asset management, admin functions, WebRTC, and agent memory, weighing the tradeoffs between using existing solutions versus custom implementations. There was also a brief mention of anticipation for vehicle functionality in Hyperfy.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Anyone digging into more controls in VR right now? Maybe we can join forces and move beyond just 'action' in VR? (asked by 0mka) A: I haven't had chance to actually use v2 much in VR yet but off the top of my head IK movement of the player's VRM and the laser pointer stuff are 2 areas I'm expecting to address. (answered by hiroP)\nQ: What kind backend stuff you wrestling with? (asked by á²¼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/) A: Yesterday it was python caching shit so even though my local machine and the server were in sync the new code still wasn't being used. (answered by hiroP)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion and instead focuses on community dynamics and marketing concerns. The conversation revolves around token value, marketing strategies, and community building for Hyperfy, with some tension between users discussing price action versus product development. A user named cloudAI raises questions about Hyperfy's market capitalization and marketing approach, suggesting they should build a stronger presence on X (formerly Twitter) like the Solana ecosystem. Other users, particularly 0mka, push back against this focus on price and marketing, advocating instead for patience, positivity, and actual building. Parzival mentions that Hyperfy has excellent technology and community, highlighting a partnership with \"89\" to showcase Hyperfy's capabilities through gaming and narrative. hiroP makes a brief comment about \"v2\" being amazing and encourages building, writing documentation, or \"touching grass.\" The conversation contains very little specific technical content or problem-solving.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why does infrastructure built on Hyperfy have a lower market cap? (asked by cloudAI) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there a marketing problem? (asked by cloudAI) A: No, the problem is more people holding than using the product (answered by á²¼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\nQ: What do you mean by marketing? (asked by Parzival) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Key technical topics included:\n\n- Development of a new build mode with improved controls, including flying, pointer lock, and reticle implementation\n- Inter-app communication capabilities allowing apps to exchange data and interact with each other\n- Discussion about optimizing 3D assets and balancing performance with usability\n- Debate about separating build/play modes versus having a unified experience\n- Implementation of projectile systems and physics interactions\n- Consideration of TypeScript adoption for the codebase\n- Development of UI components like dropdowns\n- Discussion of navigation meshes and agent movement systems\n\nThe most significant implementation was Ashxn's work on a new build mode that allows flying (via double jump), pointer lock controls, and a reticle for more precise interaction. This addresses the need for both casual builders and more technical developers. Additionally, MetaMike demonstrated inter-app communication, enabling apps to detect and interact with each other, which opens possibilities for complex game mechanics.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"🤖│agents\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat focuses on AI agent development in a virtual world environment. MetaMike is working on an agent named Eliza that can perceive its surroundings, respond to needs, and interact with the environment. Drdoge.eth has been training agents (Eliza and Victor) to recognize locations and provide directions within the virtual world. There's discussion about the improved scripting capabilities compared to the previous version (v1), which used React apps rather than the current more intuitive in-world scripting. The conversation touches on agent frameworks, with devilsadvocate.sol mentioning ZerePy and expressing interest in frameworks without anime-style avatars. MetaMike is working on augmenting context for agents to understand their environment and needs. The community is excited about creating a \"living city\" with multiple NPCs that can interact naturally with the environment and users. There's also discussion about Clone tools for VRM creation and optimization in Blender.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How was the development pace in v1 compared to this? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Nobody coded much besides Saori and Ash in terms of apps, partly because programmers aren't buying $300 tickets to code on blockchain, partly because React required local dev environment, and AI has improved (answered by Saori)\nQ: Is the in-world scripting one of the major changes? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Yes, it used to require \"npx create react app\" with React apps deployed to hyperfy, which is less intuitive than current scripting (answered by Saori)\nQ: Has anyone used ZerePy? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Unanswered\nQ: How did you train the agent to know where things are? (asked by maximus) A: By repeatedly asking/telling it to scan around its location for points of interest and asking for directions from different spots until it gets accurate (answered by drdoge.eth)\n\n## 3.

HPrivakos demonstrated integrating real-world IoT devices with Hyperfy worlds by connecting Philips Hue lights to control in-world sky intensity. Several new users, including treed (a university professor teaching 3D modeling), sought guidance on getting started with Hyperfy V2. The discussion highlighted the transition from V1 to V2, with V2 being more developer-focused currently but offering greater technical capabilities. Users discussed the architecture of Hyperfy worlds, how to import 3D models (primarily through GLB format), and the potential for creating complex interactive experiences. The community showed strong interest in educational applications, with HPrivakos offering to host worlds for students. Technical discussions included file formats, optimization, and the workflow for importing models into Hyperfy worlds. Several demonstrations of Hyperfy's capabilities were shared, including integration with external systems and the ability to handle complex 3D environments.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the editor available in V2 when setting up a local world? (asked by treed) A: No traditional editor yet, but you can drag and drop GLB models and right-click things to bring up menus (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can we use the Hyperfy logo on our website if we're building on Hyperfy? (asked by Dominic) A: Yes, it's nice to call out that your site is powered by Hyperfy (answered by maximus)\nQ: Is the team doxxed? (asked by kcrypt.) A: Yes, team members are public, e.g., https://x.com/ashconnell (answered by jin)\nQ: What's the best way for a designer to get started with Hyperfy V2? (asked by AcidManhattan) A: Paying for hosting is easiest, or you can drag and drop GLB/VRM files and add scripts (answered by Saori)\nQ: Is it technically possible to create a GTA San Andreas-esque game on Hyperfy? (asked by PurpleSack) A: Yes, you can import maps and assets, add AI for NPCs, though performance considerations are important (answered by maximus)\nQ: Which format would be best to convert into GLB? (asked by treed) A: FBX is recommended, then import to Blender and export as GLB (answered by MetaMike and Saori)\nQ: How do you convert FBX to GLB optimized for Hyperfy? (asked by treed) A: Import FBX to Blender, then export as GLB; use gltf.report to compress further if needed (answered by Saori and maximus)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around cryptocurrency trading discussions, particularly focusing on the HYPER token and its price movements. There are no significant technical discussions or problem-solving in this segment. Most conversations center around price speculation, with users tracking HYPER's value fluctuations (showing both dips and slight recoveries). Secondary discussions include Roblox's revenue model for creators (with users noting the platform takes approximately 70-80% of earnings), observations about various meme coins and potential pump-and-dump schemes, and brief mentions of wallet integration with Discord roles. No substantial technical implementations or concrete solutions are presented in this chat segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How much of creators' revenue does Roblox take? (asked by Ashxn) A: Initially 70%, but with additional fees to convert Robux to fiat, the final cut is around 80% in total (answered by ToxSam)\nQ: How much HYPER is needed to get the hyperflier role?

Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on Docker optimization for Hyperfy, with HypPrivakos sharing a multi-stage Dockerfile that reduces image size to 300MB. The approach separates build and production stages, moving client dependencies to devDependencies to shrink node_modules from 200MB+ to 130MB. While technically functional, HypPrivakos noted this optimization might not be worth merging due to potential future compatibility issues. \n\nLater conversation shifted to world portability between hosting services, with community members discussing the need for users to control their data. Several technical approaches were proposed: exporting worlds as zip files, creating a specialized .hyp format that preserves app coordinates, or implementing dashboard buttons for import/export functionality. Participants acknowledged the need to standardize the export format while allowing hosting services flexibility in implementation details like security scanning and version compatibility.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there any need to have .env at build time now? (asked by mattimus) A: Not at build time, but it provides a default .env if someone runs the image without passing one (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: Can I export my world if I use a 3rd party hosting service? (asked by maximus) A: Yes, people should have control over their data and a self-service way to download their world (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: What's stopping us from saving an app's world coord on export? (asked by .hyp shaman) A: Nothing; this could be implemented as coordinate metadata in the .hyp app (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\n\n## 3.

Ash responded that the object would remain there until they implement a \"global app list\" feature, suggesting this is a known limitation. Additionally, there was a brief discussion about Solana blockchain integration, with maximus confirming that a Solana branch of the code is being developed, and that multiple people are working on integrating other chains as well. MikeBroco offered help with the Solana integration, and maximus agreed to connect them with the relevant team.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: If an object falls down to infinity, will it ever appear in the render?

FAQ\nQ: How stable is the networking API? (asked by Saori) A: Networking is pretty stable now. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do you prevent agents from spamming each other? (asked by HPrivakos) A: They should only respond to each other once, not infinite loop, if using the latest code in the Eliza fork. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I access the player position in V2? (asked by Shiffty) A: On the client you can call world.getPlayer() to get the current player or world.getPlayer(id) for a specific player. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can I make my 3D objects solid so avatars can jump on them? (asked by frabra239) A: Change collision to \"all\". (answered by Saori)\nQ: What does \"inherit\" mean for collision? (asked by frabra239) A: When you create collisions manually in Blender, you choose inherit for better performance and more basic collider shapes. (answered by Saori)\nQ: How can I access the main camera and raycast through the API? (asked by Shiffty) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can I store values in apps and make them accessible to other apps? (asked by MetaMike) A: Use world.emit(\"event name\", data) and world.on(\"event name\", (data) => {}) for server-to-server communication. (answered by Saori)\nQ: How can I generate a UUID in an app script? (asked by m₂) A: There's a global uuid() function injected into scripts. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to sleep for some amount of milliseconds? (asked by m₂) A: There's no direct setTimeout, but you can track time with updates using the delta parameter.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 🤖│agents\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat discusses the integration of an agent framework called \"Eliza\" into virtual environments like Hyperfy and Decentraland (DCL). Lastraum shared JavaScript code for implementing an agent named \"Hawk Tuah\" that can respond to chat messages in these environments. The code fetches agent data from an API endpoint, creates a UI bubble for displaying agent responses, and handles chat commands.\n\nHPrivakos provided alternative endpoints and implementation approaches, sharing URLs like \"agents.dcl.guru\" and \"agents.hyperworld.host\" for testing. The discussion touched on different ways to make agents auto-chat when users enter a world without requiring explicit commands.\n\nTechnical aspects included character file formats, with HPrivakos sharing documentation links for standardized character files. There was brief discussion about advanced agent technologies like Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), on-chain agents via WebAssembly (WASM), and embedding LLMs using Arweave's AO platform.\n\nThe community showed interest in creating and customizing various agents, with mentions of specific characters like \"Ken Oath\" and \"Hawk Tuah,\" demonstrating the framework's flexibility for character creation and deployment across different virtual environments.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Where can you find all the agents? (asked by Saori) A: Currently you create the agent inside DCL, but it's available anywhere - and the list of agents are public (for now) https://lkdcl.co/eliza/agents (answered by Lastraum)\nQ: Have you guys looked into TEEs? (asked by Saori) A: Looking into it, new to it all tbh (answered by Lastraum)\nQ: Have you guys looked into fully on-chain agents via wasm embedded LLM using AO? (asked by Ashxn) A: No we haven't, but sounds really cool (answered by Lastraum)\nQ: Is there a standard character file format that you're using? (asked by MetaMike) A: https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/core/characterfile/ (answered by HPrivakos)\nQ: How do you make the agent auto chat when you join world or respond to you without typing \"/agent\" first? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: Use the code ash provided and tweak it to handle your server (answered by HPrivakos)\nQ: Did this stop working? The endpoints aren't responding for me (asked by MetaMike) A: No, it still works for me: https://agents.hyperworld.host/ (answered by HPrivakos)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy's ecosystem development, focusing on self-hosting capabilities, avatar integration, and technical infrastructure. HPrivakos announced support for hosting Eliza agents and added fiat payment via Stripe to hyperworld.host. There were discussions about VRM avatar compatibility issues, particularly with Nifty Island's NFTs which are currently inaccessible in Hyperfy due to token-gating. Community members shared insights about the technical limitations of blockchain-based avatars and the challenges of true interoperability. Ashxn shared a conceptual framework for Hyperfy's ecosystem where developers create cores, artists create collectibles, and consumers use these to build experiences without coding skills. Several members inquired about migrating from V1 to V2, with maximus explaining that worlds can be easily transferred between hosts. The community is preparing for an upcoming developer huddle to showcase recent progress and upcoming features.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do you need model API keys to host Eliza agents? (asked by MetaMike) A: No, just your character file, I take care of the LLM part :) (answered by HPrivakos)\nQ: Does your Elizas actually view and see links/images can search the web? (asked by emotionull) A: Probably not, only using LLM models right now, no image recognition ones (answered by HPrivakos)\nQ: Is this the correct VRM NFT format to use in Hyperfy? (asked by N1Kingz/HCK1) A: It might be because the VRM file itself is behind a token-gate (answered by maximus)\nQ: How easy is it to create a Nifty-like asset generator for Hyperfy? (asked by N1Kingz/HCK1) A: We're working on all of this stuff but our engine is also entirely open with tooling for people to build this themselves (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What's the best source of information to read up on how to get going with Hyperfy V2? (asked by Paradoxx) A: You can check the community docs being made, though they are in draft (answered by multiple users)\nQ: How does it work with updates coming from Hyperfy? Will we need to set things up all over again when new versions are released? (asked by Paradoxx) A: Not really (answered by ToxSam)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🪙│hyper Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around price movements of the HYPER token, with discussions about significant volatility. The token experienced multiple price swings, dropping to around $0.01 (penny club) before recovering to approximately $0.02, then falling again by 36% in a single day. Community members shared trading strategies, with some advocating for holding (\"hodl til $1\") while others discussed swing trading opportunities. There was a brief technical discussion about a V2 implementation of Hyperfy, which is an open-source version, and mention of wallet integration for Solana. A community member expressed interest in integrating SOL coin redemptions for missions in Hyperfy but noted V2 isn't ready for this implementation yet. A moderator mentioned that a branch is being worked on to enable wallet connections on Solana. The community also discussed a watch party event hosted on hyperfy.io/watchparty.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the v2 actually? (asked by trou) A: v2 is the opensource version of hyperfy (answered by ToxSam)\nQ: What percentage of the supply needs to be in the LP to be enough to prevent crazy spikes on low volume? (asked by jar0d) A: Too much in the LP at this point and the price will plummet. Only 1.32% in the pool is a good thing, but it can be bad too if a big whale sells. (answered by BitFiend)\nQ: What happened today with $hyperfy? (asked by BallisticBanana) A: Normal swing. Looks like we moved the bottom support up though. (answered by devilsadvocate.sol)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Channel Analysis: 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around VRM models and gaming applications within a metaverse platform. Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘 shared their experience creating VRM models for their community (Ghost Buddy NFT v2), noting that adding 3D elements was surprisingly easy. Maximus suggested enhancing this by implementing wallet connectivity to populate game boards with user-owned avatar models, referencing the m3-org/avatars GitHub repository. There was brief mention of cross-verse communication functionality being developed for \"the forge\" platform. Other topics included requests for audio applications with spatial trigger functionality, and discussion about creating specialized game sets (like a Star Wars Holographic Chess Set). A question was raised about whether Hyperfy apps would always be limited to single models or if entire worlds with multiple apps could be exported as a single app. The conversations indicate ongoing development of metaverse gaming components with a focus on avatar integration, cross-platform communication, and specialized gaming applications.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Will hyp apps always be one model? or will it ever be possible to export an entire world (with many apps inside of it) as one single hyp app? (asked by shmoji) A: Unanswered\nQ: Wen built in audio app with spatial trigger box toggle? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: Unanswered\nQ: What stack are you using?

Gh0sTt mentioned adding 3D elements was surprisingly easy. The most substantial technical exchange was about custom VRM models, where Gh0sTt shared they created VRM models for their \"ghost buddy nft v2\" community. Maximus suggested enhancing this by implementing wallet connectivity to populate game boards with user-owned models, referencing the m3-org/avatars GitHub repository. There was also a brief mention of a potential audio app with spatial trigger functionality. The conversation indicates ongoing development of avatar/VRM integration and gaming elements within what appears to be a metaverse or virtual world platform.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on technical issues and developments in the Hyperfy platform. Ash identified and fixed a memory leak in the \"vibe world\" related to material cache on prims that was causing browser tab crashes. The fix was deployed and confirmed to work well in VR. Mrtzhckr shared progress on implementing Gaussian Splat Rendering in Hyperfy, noting performance depends on splat file size with SPZ compression (under 50MB works well on desktop, 5-8MB limit for Quest). Ash provided stats on the vibe world's performance (50 draw calls, 700k triangles, 148 apps, 29 geometries, 21 materials) and mentioned it runs well on mobile and VR. There was discussion about UI confusion with avatar settings and issues with colliders. Vox raised concerns about fullscreen mode exiting when escaping pointer lock, and Ash proposed adding an alternative key (blockquote/tilde) for toggling pointer lock, which was later implemented in dev. Ash also merged AI improvements to dev.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What model does the AI in vibe world use? (asked by vox) A: sonnet 4 (answered by ash)\nQ: What's performance like on the Gaussian splats? (asked by ash) A: Performance depends on splat file size - under 50MB works well on desktop, 5-8MB limit for Quest with SPZ compression (answered by mrtzhckr)\nQ: What am I doing wrong with my basic collider with up and down movement? (asked by ðŸ†‚ðŸ…´ðŸ…±ðŸ…¶ðŸ…°) A: Check out the elevator example and check browser console for red block errors (answered by Shiffty)\nQ: Is there a way to fix the fullscreen toggle dilemma when switching mouselock/free mouse? (asked by vox) A: Added support for blockquote (`) key to toggle pointer lock in dev (answered by ash)\nQ: Is there a way to force fpv or detect when in fpv/3pv? (asked by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz) A: Neither yet (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment shows a brief discussion about Hyperfy's \"Vibe\" feature, which appears to be an AI-powered creation tool in a virtual environment. Ash shared a link to vibe.hyperfy.xyz and provided basic instructions for using AI commands like `/create` and `/edit` to build objects in the virtual space. The feature was described as being in \"super alpha\" stage. There was a brief mention of an error with Anthropic's API being temporarily overloaded, causing the AI functionality to be down. A user (ðŸ†‚ðŸ…´ðŸ…±ðŸ…¶ðŸ…°) experienced issues with the platform, including losing chat functionality and being unable to jump after refreshing. MetaMike suggested changing the gen model to \"grok\" to improve performance. Overall, the conversation indicates early testing of an AI-powered creation tool within Hyperfy's virtual environment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What skills should I have to try it, have you any tips to share? (asked by ðŸ†‚ðŸ…´ðŸ…±ðŸ…¶ðŸ…°) A: Unanswered\nQ: What are the asset checked by the role bot? it say i don't have any but I have 3 lands on the wallet scanned. (asked by ðŸ†‚ðŸ…´ðŸ…±ðŸ…¶ðŸ…°) A: Unanswered\nQ: Want hyper to fly? (asked by MetaMike) A: Change the gen model to grok and tag it in every post. (answered by MetaMike)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ§Šâ”‚3d-design\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment focuses on 3D design performance optimization in what appears to be a Hyperfy project. TheMattEmpire is testing the limits of instancing (reusing 3D objects) in their project and reports good performance in localized areas, though notes that creating these instances was time-consuming without multiselect functionality. They're using emission to simulate lighting while maintaining shadows for objects inside buildings by disabling shadows on the roof. Their iterative approach involves gradually adding content to determine performance thresholds. The conversation briefly shifts to streaming capabilities in Hyperfy, with ash suggesting that .m3u8 streams might work (as they did in v1), and .hyp shaman confirming they use bloomers.tv to generate m3u8 links that work well in the platform.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does Hyperfy have streaming into spaces yet, or just MP4 support? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Hyperfy likely supports .m3u8 streams as it did in v1, so live streaming from OBS or platforms providing m3u8 should work (answered by ash)\nQ: How can I get an m3u8 link for streaming? (implied by conversation) A: bloomers.tv provides m3u8 links easily and works well (answered by .hyp shaman)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: TheMattEmpire | Context: Question about streaming capabilities in Hyperfy | Resolution: Suggested that .m3u8 streams should work as they did in v1\nHelper: .hyp shaman | Helpee: TheMattEmpire | Context: Need for streaming solution | Resolution: Recommended bloomers.tv as an easy way to get m3u8 links that work well\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Implement multiselect functionality for faster instancing | Description: Current process is time-consuming without multiselect | Mentioned By: TheMattEmpire\nTechnical: Continue testing performance limits by adding more content | Description: Determine at what point frame rate begins to drop | Mentioned By: TheMattEmpire\nFeature: Add multiselect capability for instancing | Description: Would significantly improve workflow efficiency | Mentioned By: TheMattEmpire",

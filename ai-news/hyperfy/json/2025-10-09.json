      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"⚡│general\"\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around users seeking help with Hyperfy's V2 platform and hosting solutions. A user named Harambe Advocate initially asked about enabling the \"fly\" feature, which they later found themselves. The conversation then shifted to building with V2, where several community members offered different hosting solutions for users without technical backgrounds. These included Edify Engine and HyperWorld.Host as alternatives to setting up hosting from GitHub directly. The chat demonstrates the community's willingness to help newcomers navigate the platform's features and hosting options, with specific resources being shared including documentation links for fly.io setup.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I enable fly again? (asked by Harambe Advocate) A: Self-answered: \"fly app lol\"\nQ: Why don't you build with v2?

Nicola Bertoglio needed to create clickable links at specific locations in a virtual gallery to direct users to artists' websites. Gert-Jan Akerboom initially suggested using the Bio-Links app for Hyperfy V2, but this solution placed links in screen space rather than world space. After understanding Nicola's specific requirement for location-based links, Gert-Jan modified a default text app to include link functionality. However, this solution worked on desktop but not on mobile devices. The conversation highlights the technical challenge of implementing world-space UI elements with clickable functionality that works across platforms.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I insert a clickable link within my space? (asked by Nicola Bertoglio) A: You can use the Bio-Links app or edit the JS to make it your own (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: Can the app be activated at a specific location in a virtual gallery? (asked by Nicola Bertoglio) A: Not with the Bio-Links app as it uses screen space, but you need world space UI elements (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: Do you have any apps for adding location-specific clickable links? (asked by Nicola Bertoglio) A: Gert-Jan updated the default text app to include link functionality (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on security concerns and authentication in Hyperfy apps. Gh0stt expressed a need for local/session storage access for user authentication purposes, which is currently restricted. Ash explained the security rationale behind these limitations, comparing it to other platforms. Lastraum offered to share their authentication solution using Privy accounts that allows login with socials, email, or web3 without requiring a separate tab. The conversation evolved into a proposal for a permission-based system where apps could request specific access (like cookies/storage) with verification mechanisms. This would involve a signature and hash validation system to ensure security while enabling necessary functionality. The proposed system would be similar to interop apps where trusted developers' apps can be used across worlds with appropriate permissions.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Could you again explain how it works? Ideal would be a 0.01 value option in the transform fields loc/rot/scale. (asked by vox) A: Just hold the alt key and use the up and down arrows. (answered by ash)\nQ: Isn't there a way we can make verified apps that do access local/session storage? (asked by Gh0stt) A: Unanswered directly, but discussion evolved into a potential permission system\nQ: What's your actual use case? (asked by ash) A: User authentication. (answered by Gh0stt)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz | Helpee: Gh0stt | Context: Gh0stt needed a solution for user authentication without local storage access | Resolution: Lastraum offered to share their Privy-based authentication solution and help set up the forge in Gh0stt's world\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Gh0stt | Context: Discussion about security concerns with local storage access | Resolution: Collaborative development of a potential permission-based system concept with signature verification\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nTechnical: Explore implementation of app permissions system with security clearance verification | Description: Apps could request specific permissions (like storage access) with verification and hash validation | Mentioned By: Gh0stt and ash\nFeature: Add permission dialogs for apps requesting sensitive access | Description: When adding an app, show warnings like \"this app wants to access cookies\" | Mentioned By: ash\nTechnical: Implement signature and hash validation for verified apps | Description: Create a system where apps are signed and verified, with signatures invalidated if code changes | Mentioned By: Gh0stt\nDocumentation: Document the Privy authentication implementation for Forge apps | Description: Share how authentication works with social/email/web3 login | Mentioned By: Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment covers updates on Hyperfy development and community activities. Ash provided a status update mentioning several key technical developments: Numinia team members identified and resolved connection issues affecting certain worlds; a developer is working on webviews/iframe support; splats technology is being developed with impressive visual results; and AI features are pending release to all users. The community discussed the need for better app sharing solutions, with hyperworld.host/marketplace suggested as a potential option. PabloFM mentioned Numinia's upcoming presentation at mmerge.io regarding scalable Hyp apps. There was also a brief technical discussion about importing 3D indoor spaces into Hyperfy v2, with vox offering optimization advice including using Babylon Press for GLB processing before adding models to worlds.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Has anyone tried to build semi-realistic indoor spaces with v2 in a hosted HyperWorld? (asked by Fibelius) A: You can import the model as a .glb with drag and drop, but will likely need optimization for mesh (1.2m tris), though 12x 2k textures and 14 materials should be fine. (answered by vox)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: vox | Helpee: Fibelius | Context: Building realistic indoor spaces in Hyperfy v2 | Resolution: Advised to convert to .glb format, optimize mesh (1.2m triangles is too high), process through Babylon Press (https://glb.babylonpress.org/) before adding to world, and offered help with lighting.\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Release new main branch to bring AI features to everyone | Description: Deploy pending AI features to all users | Mentioned By: ash\nTechnical: Resolve connection issues in certain worlds | Description: Fix identified by Numinia team to be included in next release | Mentioned By: ash\nTechnical: Implement webviews/iframe support | Description: Development in progress | Mentioned By: ash\nFeature: Improve app sharing system | Description: Find better way to share apps and updates than the current chaotic thread | Mentioned By: ash\nDocumentation: Create more examples of realistic indoor spaces in v2 | Description: Reference examples needed for new builders | Mentioned By: Fibelius",

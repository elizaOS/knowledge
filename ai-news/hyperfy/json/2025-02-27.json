Key discussions include implementing vehicle physics for bikes and aircraft, handling audio streaming with ElevenLabs API, and managing collisions in 3D environments. Significant implementations include Shiffty's Hyperduck 2.0 flight simulator with projectiles and camera controls, and drdoge.eth's motorcycle physics. Ashxn provided critical support for blob loading to enable ElevenLabs voice integration and fixed a player position bug that was noticeable at high speeds. There were also discussions about hosting solutions for assets, with devilsadvocate.sol offering to host images and audio files for Hyperfy scenes. The developers shared code snippets and implementation strategies for node cloning, audio handling, and vehicle physics, with a focus on improving collision detection and movement mechanics.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I make one node create a duplicate of another node? (asked by Omka) A: Use clone method like `const dog2 = dog1.clone(true)` and then add it to the app with `app.add(dog2)` (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I set a scale size for a GLB in V2? (asked by OttisOts) A: Use `app.scale.set(x,y,z)` (answered by devilsadvocate.sol)\nQ: How can I expose a new installed npm package to app scripting? (asked by MetaMike) A: Unanswered\nQ: What's the best practice for setting collision on the floor of my room?

Key technical topics included Microsoft's Phi-4 model release, ElevenLabs voice response performance, and agent integration approaches. Peezy shared progress on connecting agents to Hyperfy worlds through Eliza endpoints, highlighting challenges with the current implementation that requires spinning up a new server on port 3001. The group debated whether agents should connect via endpoints or websockets, with Peezy suggesting websockets would allow agents to initiate actions rather than just react to server requests. Ashxn shared information about a Hyperfy fork of Eliza that includes prompts to prevent unwanted agent responses. The conversation also touched on physics integration for agents, with Ashxn pointing to a controller node that handles movement with physics considerations.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is it normal to get these messages when booting up the server and joining it? (asked by peezy) A: It seems weird, but the messages when first entering the world are normal (answered by Saori)\nQ: Why use Eliza right now? (asked by MetaMike) A: It offers easy onchain integration via plugins, distribution to the self-host Eliza community, clear code for other frameworks to integrate, and avoids reinventing the wheel (answered by peezy)\nQ: Are they running on OpenAI or Anthropic? (asked by peezy) A: Anthropic is best from what I tested (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What do you mean by PhysicsPillNode? (asked by Ashxn) A: Referring to something that would help with collisions for agents walking around (answered by peezy)\n\n## 3.

Saori mentions they're building a web3 app that will launch in a month. Ashxn provides insights about the platform being built at hyperfy.xyz that will utilize the $HYPER token for characters, emotes, vehicles, and agents. The platform will allow users to create and publish games, experiences, characters, and items. There's mention of AI capabilities and agents integration, though Ashxn notes this is still in development with the platform taking priority. Saori suggests that Portal Bridge could be used to bridge HYPER tokens without code and offers to add liquidity if someone puts it on Base. A user named Ricky discusses challenges with the gizmo tool for rotating and scaling assets, indicating a desire for improvements to this functionality. The conversation also includes substantial discussion about trading strategies, with several members sharing their approaches to cryptocurrency trading and using platforms like Hyperliquid.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around 3D design challenges and implementations in what appears to be a game or virtual world environment. Key technical discussions include:\n\ndevilsadvocate.sol shared a 3D model wizard tool (wizard.grape.wtf) that automatically downloads models upon upload, noting the need to implement a download button and fix framerate issues. The community discussed a \"hyperduck\" vehicle implementation with anchor points, highlighting sliding issues at top speeds. \n\nAnimation problems were a significant focus, particularly with sitting animations that loop instead of holding a pose. Users debated whether \"holdPose\" is a valid parameter in the system, with Ashxn clarifying it doesn't exist. The discussion revealed confusion about animation track control in Hyperfy.\n\nWater physics implementation was explored, with suggestions to use swimming mode with buoyancy inside water volumes. Rather than complex water rendering, the consensus leaned toward using animated GLB surfaces with splash effects, allowing users to create their own water visuals while providing invisible water volumes for physics interactions.\n\nTechnical issues with Blender 4.3 were discussed, specifically backface culling problems causing x-ray surface artifacts, with some users recommending staying on older Blender versions for compatibility reasons. The newer version's support for WebP textures was highlighted as a benefit for compression.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to handle sitting animations that keep looping instead of holding a pose? (asked by Shiffty) A: Need a sitting emote that loops, like the swivel chair animation (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Does holdPose exist as a parameter to stop animation looping? (asked by Shiffty) A: That's not a thing (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How to deal with water physics? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: If inside volume use swimming mode with buoyancy (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How to handle water rendering? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Anyone should be able to make their own water, just provide an invisible water volume that switches controller to swimming mode (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Does anyone have tips for backface culling issues with Blender 4.3? (asked by untitled, xyz) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

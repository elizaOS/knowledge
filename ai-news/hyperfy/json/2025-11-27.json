Gert-Jan Akerboom shared a forest generator they created using trees from quickmesh.dev. The generator includes a feature for creating circular forests with configurable inner radius where no trees appear. This implementation resembles Central Park in appearance. There was also a brief mention of the \"shai-hulud npm worm\" by 3rdEyeVisuals, though no technical details were provided about this security threat. The conversation was mostly casual with positive feedback on the forest generator from other users.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Hope nobody got hit by that recent shai-hulud npm worm?

      "summary": "# Analysis of ⚡│general Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment primarily focused on hosting options and costs for Hyperfy, particularly for educational purposes. A new user (LucasCastelo) inquired about the long-term costs of using Hyperfy for educational materials. Community members provided various hosting options ranging from paid services to free alternatives. Specifically, they mentioned that Hyperfy itself doesn't have subscription costs, but hosting requirements depend on factors like concurrent users and world size. Options discussed included using a single VPS (which can be cost-effective), paid hosting services starting at $5/month with potential educational discounts, and a free tier through fly.io (though with performance limitations).\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: I'm curious about the costs of Hyperfy long-term, is there anyone I can ask a few questions? (asked by LucasCastelo) A: You can run hyperfy very cheap on a single vps depending on requirements like concurrent users & world size (answered by smickelbeard)\nQ: Is there somewhere where I can get estimates of those costs? I was wondering if there's a subscription or what are other costs I should keep in mind. (asked by LucasCastelo) A: Hyperfy itself doesn't have subscriptions but needs to be hosted somewhere which might have cost. Hosting services start at 5 USD a month per world with possible lower rates for education. (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\n\n## 3.

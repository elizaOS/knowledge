Ashxn has been working on combat mechanics including damage numbers, critical hits, and player-to-player collision. The community is actively testing these features in multiplayer environments. UI development is another major focus, with Omka and others working on screen overlays and in-world interfaces. Discussions include handling emojis in props, Twitter API integration, and bone transforms for avatar attachments. Several developers are creating apps with the new physics capabilities, including interactive objects that can be pushed and picked up. There are ongoing efforts to improve app packaging/unpacking to handle special characters properly. The community is also exploring AI integration with Hyperfy through Eliza, with jin offering to set up an AI assistant for the Discord. Technical challenges discussed include UI positioning limitations, player collision mechanics, and Twitter API integration difficulties.\n\n## 2.

Whambammy mentions their connection to SoulGraph's branding and discussions with the lead developer (cwm) about incorporating their technology into 3D avatars. They specifically note how SoulGraph's voice-to-voice chat is remarkably responsive, allowing for real-time interruptions and adjustments. There's a suggestion that integration with Hyperfy agent/Eliza app could be relatively straightforward once API access becomes available. MUDBONE shares a link to a SoulGraph tweet, which Whambammy acknowledges having already retweeted. Later, maximus shares concerns about Anthropic's AI policy recommendations to the White House, suggesting they might be designed to give online LLM providers competitive advantages against open-source alternatives.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How responsive is SoulGraph's voice-to-voice chat? (implied by Whambammyâš¡) A: It's \"fast and responsive\" with the ability to interrupt and have the AI adjust responses in real-time (answered by Whambammyâš¡)\nQ: Could SoulGraph technology be incorporated into 3D avatars? (implied by Whambammyâš¡) A: Yes, the lead developer is \"intrigued by it\" and integration with Hyperfy agent/Eliza app should be straightforward once API access is available (answered by Whambammyâš¡)\n\n## 3.

Ashxn has been implementing combat mechanics including damage numbers, critical hits, and player-to-player collision. Developers are exploring UI capabilities with on-screen elements and discussing limitations around CSS properties like transform/translate. There's significant interest in physics interactions, with discussions about player forces/pushback and object manipulation. Several developers are working on Twitter/X integration for displaying tweets in-world, debating between using the official API (which requires OAuth) or scraping approaches. The community is actively sharing code snippets, troubleshooting emoji rendering issues in app properties, and discussing bone transforms for avatar attachments. Jin proposed setting up an Eliza AI agent to help with Discord questions using documentation as reference. Overall, the chat shows a vibrant developer community exploring Hyperfy's expanding capabilities while collaboratively solving technical challenges.\n\n## 2.

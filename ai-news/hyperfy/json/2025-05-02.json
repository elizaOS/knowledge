      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on Hyperfy v2 development, with several key technical topics. Peezy announced the release of the \"ai\" hypkg package and shared a GitHub branch for Docker users. Ashxn discussed improvements to PhysX builds, creating a unified version that works for both Node and browser environments while reducing code size by 4MB by removing built-in vehicle imports. \n\nVR functionality was a major topic, with hiroP noting the lack of rotation capability in the current VR implementation. Ashxn clarified that body turn and snap turn features still need to be added but aren't current priorities. Gert-Jan Akerboom sought help implementing an emission intensity slider for neon letters, which Ashxn assisted with by explaining how to access and modify material properties.\n\nAshxn also highlighted naming convention issues in the codebase, noting that \"ServerLoader.js\" should be \"NodeLoader.js\" since it's used by both world servers and node-clients, while \"ClientLoader.js\" should be \"BrowserLoader.js\". He expressed concern about making these changes due to potential impacts on existing forks.\n\nThe chat also included discussion about UI updates, with Roustan providing positive feedback on new model and image buttons while suggesting improvements like automatic positioning of images to prevent z-fighting with walls and spatial loading toggles for videos.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I implement an emission intensity slider for neon letters? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Use a range field and connect it to the material with \"mesh.material.emissiveIntensity = value\". Make sure the emissive color isn't black. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is the inability to rotate view in VR a known issue? (asked by hiroP) A: Yes, body turn and snap turn features still need to be added. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What does it take to have customizable loading screens for hyperfy? (asked by vox) A: Likely requires modifications to the CoreUI.js file. (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: Does removing PhysX vehicle imports mean cars are dead? (asked by peezy) A: No, Hyperfy has better cars than PhysX vehicle controllers can provide, using raycast vehicles instead. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around AI integration with Hyperfy, specifically focusing on Shaw's development of a headless client called \"Elizafy\" that allows AI agents to connect to Hyperfy worlds like human users. A demonstration video shows an autonomous agent navigating a Hyperfy world independently, with visible keyboard inputs displayed in the interface. The community expressed excitement about this development and its potential applications. \n\nAdditionally, there was a significant discussion about Hyperfy v2's GPL license implications for corporate clients. A user named hiroP sought clarification about integrating Hyperfy with corporate systems without triggering open-source requirements for proprietary business systems. Ashxn clarified that the GPL license only applies to core improvements, not applications built on top of the platform, similar to how Linux operates.\n\nOther minor topics included a mention of a Solana Seeker phone case for Hyperfy, custom avatars, and a brief note about the hyperfy.how website being down.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is shaw using the hyperfy engine? (asked by simk) A: Yes, he made a headless client that allows AI agents (Elizas) to connect to any hyperfy world like humans would (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Am I the only one here that really truly doesn't know much about Shaw? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: Unanswered\nQ: What is elizafy? (asked by simk) A: A headless client that allows AI agents to connect to hyperfy worlds like humans would (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How would we give the AI \"Vision\" so it can see what is in the world and interact with things?

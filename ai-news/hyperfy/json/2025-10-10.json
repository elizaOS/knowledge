Two main hosting options were mentioned: Edify Engine, designed for non-technical creators, and HyperWorld.Host as an alternative service. A user named \"odds\" explained that Edify Engine helps creators without technical background to build worlds without needing GitHub or hosting setup knowledge. HypPrivakos shared a link to documentation for self-hosting on fly.io. One user (Fibelius) confirmed plans to build a v2 version of a Kusama exhibition space using one of these platforms. Another user (3rdEyeVisuals) mentioned returning to Hyperfy and having set up docker containers. The conversation was relatively brief with minimal technical depth.\n\n## 2.

(asked by Harambe Advocate) A: You can use Edify Engine for a non-technical approach or follow the fly.io tutorial (answered by odds and HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: How do I follow the calls here?

      "summary": "# Analysis of ðŸ§Šâ”‚3d-design Channel Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe conversation revolves around implementing clickable links in a virtual space. Nicola Bertoglio needed to create clickable elements at specific locations in a virtual gallery to link to artists' websites. Gert-Jan Akerboom initially suggested using the Bio-Links app for Hyperfy V2, but this solution placed links in screen space rather than world space. After understanding Nicola needed world-space UI elements, Gert-Jan modified a default text app to include link functionality. However, this solution worked on desktop but not on mobile devices. The chat highlights the technical challenge of implementing cross-platform interactive elements in 3D spaces, particularly the difference between screen-space and world-space UI elements.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I insert a clickable link within my space? (asked by Nicola Bertoglio) A: You can use the Bio-Links app or a modified text app with link functionality (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: Can the app be activated at a specific location in a virtual gallery? (asked by Nicola Bertoglio) A: The Bio-Links app works in screen space, but you need world-space UI elements for location-specific links (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: Do you have any apps to create location-specific clickable elements? (asked by Nicola Bertoglio) A: Gert-Jan updated the default text app to include link functionality (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\n\n## 3.

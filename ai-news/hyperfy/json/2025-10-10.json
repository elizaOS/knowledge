Gert-Jan Akerboom confirms something is \"still working fine\" without specific context. User mrtzhckr reports that the \"play-world\" is broken and asks for a reset as they're working on AI Agent functionality and wants to check NPCs. They also request a simple NPC \"hyp\" (presumably a hyperlink or template). HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host responds by suggesting that another user (tagged by ID) might be able to help since they have many NPCs in their world.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can we reset play-world?

      "summary": "# Analysis of 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe conversation revolves around implementing clickable links in a virtual space. Nicola Bertoglio needed to create clickable elements at specific locations in a virtual gallery to link to artists' websites. Gert-Jan Akerboom initially suggested using the Bio-Links app for Hyperfy V2, but this solution placed links in screen space rather than world space. After understanding Nicola's specific requirement for world-space UI elements, Gert-Jan updated a default text app to support links. However, this solution worked on desktop but not on mobile devices. The conversation highlights the technical challenges of implementing cross-platform interactive elements in 3D spaces, particularly the differences between screen-space and world-space UI implementations.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I insert a clickable link within my space? (asked by Nicola Bertoglio) A: You can use the Bio-Links app or edit the JS to make it your own (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: Can the app be activated at a specific location in a virtual gallery? (asked by Nicola Bertoglio) A: Not with this app as the links are in screen space, but you need UI elements in world space (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\nQ: Do you have any apps to create clickable elements in world space? (asked by Nicola Bertoglio) A: Gert-Jan updated the default text app to add link functionality (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\n\n## 3.

TheMattEmpire inquired about multiselect tools, which ash confirmed weren't currently in development. This led to TheMattEmpire exploring alternative approaches for building a town project, including using Blender with linked duplicates. However, this approach presented limitations as GLB files with linked duplicates couldn't be individually edited once imported into Hyperfy. Shiffty provided guidance on using environment variables to create and switch between experimental worlds. Gert-Jan Akerboom suggested using collection instances in Blender as a potential workaround for updating multiple building components simultaneously. Separately, ash mentioned fixing a physics bug in the \"vibe world\" related to a zero-height cone in the \"eye of sauron tower\" that was causing falling/jumping issues. The conversation concluded with vox highlighting the power of edit prompts for manipulating object properties like collisions and shadows.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: When will multiselect tools be added to Hyperfy? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Not actively being worked on currently, but would be nice to have. (answered by ash)\nQ: How do I create an experimental world in Hyperfy? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Change the WORLD variable in the .env file and run npm run dev to automatically create a new world. (answered by Shiffty)\nQ: Can I update individual parts of a GLB made with linked duplicates in Hyperfy? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around activities in the \"vibe world\" of Hyperfy, a virtual space where users can create and interact with generated assets. Users discussed a drone swarm creation that was temporarily set to invisible and later restored. The vibe world appears to have functionality where users can type commands like \"/create\" to generate assets and \"/edit\" to modify them. Later in the conversation, users mentioned that the vibe world stopped generating content, possibly due to someone prompting a \"particle accelerator\" or \"Black Hole\" that may have caused system issues. The chat demonstrates the collaborative and experimental nature of the platform, with users helping each other navigate the interface and sharing discoveries about interactive elements.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a CA address for Hyperfy? (asked by Brdmc3) A: A link was provided (answered by ash)\nQ: What's the vibe world address? (asked by Wilson) A: https://vibe.hyperfy.xyz/ (answered by Valiant)\nQ: Is this the one that we can ask for assets to be created? (asked by Wilson) A: Yes, just look at an empty space and type /create whatever in chat (answered by vox)\nQ: Not seeing the chat box, any hint? (asked by Wilson) A: Press enter (answered by vox)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Brdmc3 | Context: Needed Hyperfy CA address | Resolution: Provided a Discord channel link with the information\nHelper: Valiant | Helpee: Wilson | Context: Needed vibe world address | Resolution: Provided the URL https://vibe.hyperfy.xyz/\nHelper: vox | Helpee: Wilson | Context: Didn't know how to create assets in vibe world | Resolution: Explained to use /create command in chat and /edit for modifications\nHelper: vox | Helpee: Wilson | Context: Couldn't find chat box | Resolution: Instructed to press enter to access chat\nHelper: vox | Helpee: Valiant | Context: Drone swarm creation was missing | Resolution: Found it was set to invisible and helped restore it\n\n## 4.

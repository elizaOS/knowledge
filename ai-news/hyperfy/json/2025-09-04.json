      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on two technical topics. First, TheMattEmpire inquired about multiselect tools in Hyperfy, which ash confirmed wasn't currently in active development. This led TheMattEmpire to explore workarounds for building a town project, including using Blender with linked duplicates. However, this approach proved problematic as GLB exports with linked duplicates couldn't be individually edited or updated within Hyperfy. Gert-Jan Akerboom suggested using collection instances in Blender as an alternative workflow.\n\nThe second topic involved creating experimental worlds in Hyperfy. TheMattEmpire encountered an error when attempting to create a new world, and Shiffty explained that the WORLD variable in the .env file needs to be modified, after which running \"npm run dev\" would automatically create the folder and fresh world. Ash also mentioned using the \"set\" command as an alternative approach.\n\nAdditionally, ash reported a physics bug in the \"vibe world\" related to a cone with zero height in the \"eye of sauron tower\" that caused strange falling/jumping behavior. Vox also commented on the power of edit prompts for removing collisions and shadows.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When will multiselect tools be added to Hyperfy? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Not actively being worked on currently, but would be nice to have. (answered by ash)\nQ: How do I create an experimental world in Hyperfy? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Change the WORLD variable in the .env file and run \"npm run dev\" to automatically create a new world folder. (answered by Shiffty)\nQ: Can I update individual parts of a GLB made with linked duplicates in Hyperfy? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the \"vibe world\" in Hyperfy, a generative virtual space where users can create objects using text prompts. Users discussed a drone swarm feature that was temporarily set to invisible, likely due to its heavy CPU usage. The world appears to be evolving as users experiment with different prompts. Several technical issues were mentioned, including the world stopping generation after someone prompted a \"particle accelerator,\" and another instance where the system crashed after a user tried to create \"a cloud dissipating.\" The community actively helped new users understand how to access and use the world's features, particularly the \"/create\" and \"/edit\" commands that allow users to generate and modify objects in the space. The chat demonstrates both the creative potential and technical limitations of the generative system.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a CA address for Hyperfy? (asked by Brdmc3) A: A link was provided (answered by ash)\nQ: What's the vibe world address? (asked by Wilson) A: https://vibe.hyperfy.xyz/ (answered by Valiant)\nQ: Is this the one that we can ask for assets to be created? (asked by Wilson) A: Yes, just look at an empty space and type /create whatever in chat (answered by vox)\nQ: Not seeing the chat box, any hint? (asked by Wilson) A: Press enter (answered by vox)\nQ: Is there a way to join a world? (asked by MaxFlowers) A: This is the world you probably saw on Twitter: https://vibe.hyperfy.xyz/ (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom)\n\n## 3.

User b34k3r shared an NVIDIA blog post about RTX AI Garage Blueprint for 3D object generation using NIM and Microsoft Trellis, noting it achieves 6-second GLB file generation on an NVIDIA 5090 GPU. User vox posted what appears to be an empty message, and maximus made a humorous comment that seems to reference something in the shared content. There were no substantial technical discussions, problem-solving activities, or decisions made in this brief exchange.",

First, user Kz is experiencing problems uploading objects/assets into their world. The issue appears to work in their local environment but fails when deployed to a server. Several troubleshooting attempts were made, including right-clicking on images in build mode and checking for image compatibility issues, but the problem persisted. The second issue involves user odds questioning whether changes to the default avatar in the frontend need corresponding updates in the .env file for persistence. Ash clarified that avatar changes in the world settings menu are automatically saved to the worlds database. The conversation suggests potential database configuration issues that might be affecting both users' problems.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can I upload objects into my world? (asked by Kz) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why is my OS showing white boxes instead of a file picker? (asked by ash) A: Unanswered\nQ: If I change the default avatar on the frontend does that also need to be done in .env to make it permanent? (asked by odds) A: That's saved automatically to the worlds database (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

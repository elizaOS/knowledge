Key developments include the introduction of raycasting functionality, player effects system, bone attachments, and UI border styling. Shiffty shared \"HyperFall,\" the first game app on the marketplace, which received positive feedback. Several developers shared their projects including a monorail system, fractal visualizer, and plant distribution tool. There were technical discussions about networking patterns, memory leaks with app cloning, and build mode improvements. Ashxn actively implemented requested features, including raycasting, player effects (freeze, snare, emote), and bone attachments. Peezy demonstrated an impressive implementation allowing players to throw and collect Hyper tokens in-world with blockchain integration. Developers also discussed UI improvements and build mode controls, with some requesting more precise rotation and positioning tools similar to traditional 3D software.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I add an mp3 slot to my follower hyp?

Rick shared information about a new AI infrastructure from Recall, mentioning he's been following the team and would experiment with it if he could get early access. He later noted it requires an application process rather than being an open playground. MetaMike mentioned shifting focus from agents to game logic, noting interdependencies between the two. Saori shared a tweet suggesting AI enslavement as a potential direction, which received mixed reactions. Bear shared a Hacker News link related to AI topics. Overall, the conversation was brief with limited technical depth, mostly consisting of resource sharing and brief opinions rather than detailed technical discussions.\n\n## 2.

Users discussed the implications of this shift, including self-hosting options and community-built hosting platforms like hyperworld.host. A significant technical discussion centered around 3D NFTs and their integration with Hyperfy, with users sharing experiences about importing NFT models into worlds. The conversation highlighted how Hyperfy can read NFT metadata with `glb_url` parameters to import 3D models directly from wallets. Users also explored modularity in 3D design, with untitled.xyz sharing their ARQ collection that works on a 3x3x3 grid system. There were discussions about avatar creation, potential for creating collections with randomized parts, and the balance between web2 and web3 integration in the platform. Some users expressed concerns about the perception of blockchain technology in the game development community, noting that many developers avoid crypto associations despite potential benefits.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is Hyperfy now free to use? (asked by Leon) A: It's free for those who can self-host, which requires technical knowledge. Community-built hosting platforms like hyperworld.host offer subscription options. (answered by Ashxn and Saori)\nQ: How do I start with the GitHub link for Hyperfy? (asked by Leon) A: You need programming knowledge to self-host or use a hosting service like hyperworld.host. (answered by Saori and Ashxn)\nQ: How do you get a 3D model from an NFT into a Hyperfy space? (asked by treed) A: It appears in your inventory when you own the NFT, and you can make duplicates with copy/paste. (answered by untitled, xyz)\nQ: How can I mint 3D NFTs? (asked by treed) A: You can use platforms like Manifold, which allows uploading .glb files and handles the metadata. (answered by untitled, xyz)\nQ: Is it possible to snap 3D objects when moving them? (asked by treed) A: In V2, some objects like the home kit snap by default. For custom objects, you can control snapping by using consistent grid measurements. (answered by untitled, xyz)\nQ: Is it possible to mint an avatar as VRM NFT and use it in Hyperfy? (asked by treed) A: The new platform will let you mint avatars, but currently no Hyperfy V2 worlds support NFT avatars. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What happened to V1 world holders? (asked by Maebbie) A: World holders received an airdrop that had to be claimed in January. V1 worlds still work and have been hosted for 2+ years for the original purchase price.

Participants debate the value proposition of blockchain in gaming, with some arguing for item economies and ownership while others suggest more innovative applications. There's skepticism about traditional \"pay-per-action\" mechanics, with calls for more creative implementations like physical-digital integrations, agent-based systems, and cross-world experiences. Saori (likely a team member) mentions plans to operate across both Solana and Ethereum chains, using Solana for token trading and Ethereum for building connected applications. The conversation also touches on token utility, with a sneak peek shared via Twitter. Some members express concerns about Solana's long-term viability, though the team appears committed to maintaining the current chain while potentially bridging to others for specific use cases.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does blockchain make games fair? (asked by treed) A: No, blockchain doesn't make games fair. Its main use case is for trustless exchange of information, storing save states or items (answered by maximus)\nQ: Can Hyperfy go to 50m?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around revenue generation strategies for what appears to be an open-source project with a token component. Community members discussed potential monetization approaches including subscription tiers for hosted services and marketplace commissions (15-30% on sold items). The development team is reportedly working on backend functionality that will utilize the project's token as part of the revenue model. There was brief mention of graph node technology for world mapping, with a GitHub link shared to a specific implementation. The conversation also touched on AI-generated 3D models, with references to tools like \"klingai\" for text-to-image generation. Community asset sharing was discussed, with suggestions to add assets to a community repository (hyperfy.how/community/assets/) and implement a more systematic approach to pinning important messages in Discord channels for easier reference.\n\n## 2.

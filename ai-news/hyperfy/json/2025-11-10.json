      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around UI development in Hyperfy. 3rdEyeVisuals is working on advanced UI implementations, particularly for a slot machine-like game interface. Ash provides guidance on action nodes and interaction distances. The most significant technical achievement is 3rdEyeVisuals implementing z-indexing support for UIView components and creating a UIVideo component that uses THREE.VideoTexture to display video in UIs without performance degradation. This implementation allows for 60FPS video playback without requiring manual redraws, solving a major limitation in the UI system. The video implementation includes custom shaders for rounded corners and proper color space conversion from sRGB to linear. Other topics include button interaction distances, fullscreen UI mode possibilities, and combining 3D models with UI elements to create hybrid interfaces.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is button interaction distance a combination of direct forward looking, distance, AND height cutoff? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: It's direct distance from the player to the thing, possibly distance to camera to allow interaction while using drones or free cam (answered by ash)\nQ: Is there a way to feed animations into UI's without redraws? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: Unanswered initially, but 3rdEyeVisuals later implemented a solution using THREE.VideoTexture\nQ: How can I adjust the interaction distance for action nodes? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: You can set the distance parameter, default is 3m: `const action = app.create('action', {distance: 10})` (answered by ash)\nQ: Is it possible to add a UI button for fullscreen mode? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: Not sure if anyone has tried yet (answered by ash)\nQ: Is there code to tell a GLB model not to cast shadows? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: 3rdEyeVisuals | Context: Understanding button interaction distance | Resolution: Explained it's direct distance from player to object, or possibly camera distance for drone/free cam scenarios\nHelper: ash | Helpee: 3rdEyeVisuals | Context: How to adjust action node interaction distance | Resolution: Provided code example showing how to set custom distance parameter\nHelper: ash | Helpee: 3rdEyeVisuals | Context: Implementing action nodes in app scripts | Resolution: Provided complete code example showing proper usage with label, distance and onTrigger handler\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"🐞│issues\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat discusses an issue with triggers not working properly in the dev branch, specifically in VR. Enryt reports that triggers with and without certain options behave differently between the main and dev branches. Gert-Jan Akerboom mentions that the rocket example being discussed has a non-standard trigger that he modified, which might not be the best example. After some back-and-forth, Gert-Jan confirms that both trigger types work fine in his world on the latest dev branch. The conversation concludes with Gert-Jan realizing that Enryt is working in VR, which Gert-Jan doesn't have experience with, suggesting the issue might be VR-specific.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do both trigger types not work on the dev branch? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Yes (answered by Enryt)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Gert-Jan Akerboom | Helpee: Enryt | Context: Troubleshooting triggers not working in dev branch | Resolution: Partial - identified the issue might be VR-specific, as triggers worked in non-VR environment\n\n## 4.

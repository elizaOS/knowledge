Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical aspects of action nodes and UI implementation in what appears to be a game or virtual world development environment. Ash provided guidance on how action nodes work, explaining they're based on distance to the camera (default 3m) and can be customized with different distances. 3rdEyeVisuals shared progress on developing a slot machine-like game with UI elements, noting challenges with UI redraws when implementing animations. They proposed a hybrid approach combining UI elements with 3D models to avoid redraw issues for spinning wheels. The developer clarified this project is for educational purposes only and suggested implementing a ticket system for NFT raffles. There was also brief discussion about implementing fullscreen mode for UI elements, though no concrete solution was provided. The conversation ended with a git clone issue mentioned by SEBGA, but without further details or resolution.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is button interaction distance based on direct forward looking, distance, AND height cutoff? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: It's direct distance from the player to the thing, and for action nodes it might actually be distance to the camera to allow interaction while using drones or free cam (answered by ash)\nQ: Is there a way to feed animations into UI's without redraws? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: Unanswered\nQ: How can I add a button toggle in the custom UI for full screen mode? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: I'm not sure if anyone's tried yet (answered by ash)\nQ: Are you adding action node code to the particular app's script or in src code applied to all apps? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: That's an app script (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

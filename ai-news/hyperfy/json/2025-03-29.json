          "text": "The Hyperfy community has been actively discussing and implementing a wide range of technical features and improvements across the platform. Key updates include enhancements to material rendering, mesh linking, mobile editor support, AI systems, and camera controls. Developers like ashxn.eth, .somethingmoreprofessional, and crufro have contributed to refining how materials are updated in real-time, including support for texture scrolling and base color changes via scripting. A pull request (PR #81) was submitted to enable base color changes, with suggestions for improvement provided by ashxn.eth.",

Ashxn discusses the flexibility of building separate apps versus \"uber apps\" (large applications with multiple functionalities). They note that while large applications with everything included are possible, individual apps offer better flexibility for management and organization. Ashxn also mentions that zipping the `world` folder creates a single file backup that includes all apps placed in the world, which can be imported on any server. There's a brief mention of a leaderboard in \"fallen\" as a potential template, and .hyp shaman notes that \"awesome hyps\" has an audio zone feature.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What's the advantage of individual apps versus \"uber apps\"?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat in the \"âš¡â”‚general\" channel was brief and primarily focused on internet connection speeds. Valiant mentioned a \"Hyperspeed upgrade\" and shared screenshots of their internet speed tests, showing symmetric service with no throttling. They noted this was better than what their previous provider offered. hiroP shared a resource (samknows.com/realspeed) that helps detect local router issues by comparing speeds to the property versus to the device. When Valiant tried to use the tool, they encountered compatibility issues, which hiroP suggested might be related to VPN usage, though they weren't certain.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a tool to detect local router issues affecting internet speed? (implied by hiroP's message) A: Yes, samknows.com/realspeed can show speed to the property versus to your device (answered by hiroP)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: hiroP | Helpee: Valiant | Context: Valiant was discussing internet speeds and shared test results | Resolution: hiroP shared a diagnostic tool (samknows.com/realspeed) to help identify if router issues were affecting speeds, though Valiant had compatibility issues with the tool\n\n## 4.

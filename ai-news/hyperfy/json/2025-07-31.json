      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on app development workflows in Hyperfy. Users discussed how to edit and create .hyp apps, with experienced developers sharing their workflows. Key technical points included:\n\n- Apps in Hyperfy can be edited directly in-world using the built-in editor, with changes saving instantly for the local instance\n- Server-side saving occurs on a cycle (approximately 1 minute) for apps stored in the database\n- Developers can download/export apps by zipping the 'world' folder to create backups or share worlds\n- Multiple AI tools were discussed for app development assistance, including Cursor (with the Hyperfy repo as context) and DeepWiki\n- The workflow involves dragging a .hyp file into the world, editing it in the in-world editor, saving, and waiting for the server to compile it\n- Apps can be added to the menu for reuse by storing them on the server in specific locations and updating configuration\n\nThe conversation highlighted the flexibility of Hyperfy's development approach, allowing for both simple in-world editing and more complex workflows using external tools.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I edit existing .hyp apps? (asked by SWISS) A: You can't edit .hyp files directly; drag them in-world, use the in-world editor to change code, hit save, and wait for the server to save the recompiled hyp to the database (answered by hiroP)\nQ: What's the recommended workflow for editing apps? (asked by SWISS) A: Drag a .hyp into the world, open the in-world editor, change code, hit save, and wait for the server cycle to compile the app (answered by hiroP)\nQ: Do I need to wait for changes to take effect? (asked by Shiffty) A: Code changes affect what you're editing instantly, but for apps stored on the server that you want to use later from the menu, you need to wait for the server save cycle (answered by hiroP)\nQ: How can I use AI to help with app development? (asked by SWISS) A: Use Cursor with the Hyperfy repo as context, or use DeepWiki to generate app code with simple prompts (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom and Gh0sTt👻🪄🐘)\n\n## 3.

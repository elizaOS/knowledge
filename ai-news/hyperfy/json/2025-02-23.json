Key topics included:\n\n- Development of a controller for NPCs/agents/pets that can traverse colliders and have gravity, with demos shared by Ashxn and MetaRick showing directional movement capabilities.\n- Implementation of projectile mechanics by Shiffty, showcasing water balloons with particle effects and proper multiplayer functionality.\n- Omka's work on a documentation pane for in-world reference while coding, with discussions about UI placement and JSON data loading.\n- Discussions about volume permissions and build constraints for collaborative worlds, with TheMattEmpire and Ashxn debating implementation challenges.\n- Implementation of password field masking with a new \"type='password'\" property added to UI components.\n- Migration planning for v1 apps to the new system, with Saori categorizing apps that need core changes versus those that can be remade without changes.\n- Avatar manipulation capabilities, including hiding avatars using the \"active\" property and discussions about potential avatar scaling features.\n- Cleanup of control bindings in apps to prevent issues when deleting apps that use app.control().\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How would the caller connection work? Is it something like Privy/Phanthom? (asked by saltï) A: Blockchain is in the works, only available when self-hosting at the moment (answered by Saori)\nQ: How can I hide an avatar from a script? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Use avatar.active = false as all nodes have an 'active' property that completely unmounts them (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there any avatar scaling in world being worked on? (asked by drdoge.eth) A: Not in core as it feels like bloat, but could be implemented in custom apps (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What's controlling the draggable aspect of panes? (asked by Omka) A: usePane sets up listeners on the pane header and moves it around (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Will instanced assets be able to scaled individually and still be classed as an instance? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Drdoge.eth reported successfully integrating Hugging Face with a Mistral model, though admitted the implementation was rudimentary. Conversation shifted to voice integration challenges, with devilsadvocate.sol highlighting latency issues (0.3m/s) and suggesting optimization techniques like streaming emotional context in parallel, chunking responses, using pre-recorded greetings, and leveraging vectorization to reduce context size. MetaMike mentioned having a potential voice solution to implement soon. Saori noted a team is developing a lightweight TypeScript framework that integrates with the Hyperfy agent protocol, potentially offering an easier alternative to Eliza v1.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What do you mean by hugging face to work? Are you using openRouter or local ollama to manage responses? (asked by maximus) A: Using Hugging Face with an API key to handle responses and guidance, though uncertain if it's running locally (answered by drdoge.eth)\nQ: Why hasn't anyone built AI voice yet? (asked by Saori) A: It's slow and expensive with challenging latency issues (answered by devilsadvocate.sol)\n\n## 3.

Saori mentioned plans to add V1 apps to a GitHub board for potential porting to V2. There was discussion about marketplace integration, particularly with HP's marketplace (hyperworld.host). A technical question about 3D asset minting was addressed by untitled, xyz, who explained that \"glb_url\" can be added during the Manifold mint process under \"hidden\" metadata. Community members inquired about V2 functionality, specifically about livestreaming capabilities for artist performances, which MetaRick confirmed is not yet available. Akuma shared some assets with snap points for shop shelves that community members can use and upgrade.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Will the apps from V1 be ported over to V2 at some stage? And available on marketplaces like HP's? (asked by Paradoxx) A: Yes, partly community-driven (answered by Saori)\nQ: Do you still have that track you built in world?

The conversation primarily consists of users checking the HYPER token price using the \"$hyperfy\" command, which shows a significant price decline from approximately 10.4M to 6.6M (a drop of about 25-30%). Users express concern about the price drop with brief comments and reaction GIFs. Some attribute the decline to broader market conditions, with one user (Malloy) suggesting it's related to global market trends and liquidity being removed from crypto markets. There is a brief mention of an exchange called \"oxfun\" potentially being insolvent. No technical solutions, implementations, or concrete development discussions appear in this transcript.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why crash so much? (asked by mkl) A: Malloy suggests it's due to world markets and people removing liquidity from crypto, adding \"it'll bounce back though\"\nQ: rick can give things?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. The main technical topic involved a question about texture LOD (Level of Detail) in 3D assets, specifically regarding road assets. Ashxn explained that LOD works at the object level, involving swapping between meshes with different textures. TheMattEmpire clarified that they were experiencing pixelation/fuzziness on the same level when assets are large enough, despite using the same texture across LODs (except for the last LOD with different UVs). The conversation suggests TheMattEmpire may be experiencing mipmapping effects rather than true texture LOD issues. Other discussions included a website error report for opensourceavatars.com, sharing of 3D models, and unrelated promotional content.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does texture LOD work? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: LOD works at an object level, so you'd be swapping between 2 meshes with 2 different textures (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: I'm trying to download some avatars on your site but getting an error: \"Failed to download avatars: Error: No auth session\" (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: Yes I need to fix, will do it next week for sure thanks for the poke (answered by ToxSam)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: TheMattEmpire | Context: Understanding how texture LOD works with 3D road assets | Resolution: Explained that LOD works at object level, swapping between meshes with different textures, though this may not address the specific pixelation issue TheMattEmpire was experiencing\nHelper: ToxSam | Helpee: devilsadvocate.sol | Context: Error when downloading avatars from opensourceavatars.com | Resolution: Acknowledged the issue and committed to fixing it the following week\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion in the \"🐞│issues\" channel primarily revolves around the `world:clean` command in Hyperfy and its potential issues. General hyper reported a bug (GitHub issue #50) where the page doesn't load properly in certain scenarios. HypPrivakos identified that this happens when running the world clean command without restarting the server, as the server still tries to serve deleted blueprints/files. Ash provided technical insight explaining why running the cleaner while a world is running can be problematic - it might delete files that haven't been saved to the database yet. The conversation evolved into suggestions for improving the save functionality, with requests for a manual save command/button and the ability to schedule save operations. The discussion highlights the need for better documentation around these features, as mentioned by ash at the beginning.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does world:clean have any performance impact, or is it really just to clean the world folder? (asked by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host) A: It seemed to have an impact on doges world but didn't test enough to say for certain, could be placebo. Definitely works on keeping the folder size down though. (answered by HowieDuhzit)\nQ: Is there a way to force a save with a command like the world clean? (asked by HowieDuhzit) A: Nope but could add one. People have asked to disable auto-save and instead have a save button/command too though. (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around two main projects: a pet companion app and a road/track kit for Hyperfy. ~/MayD524/Hyperfy is developing a networked pet companion that follows player owners, avoids obstacles, teleports when stuck, and waits for offline players to return. They're working on fixing bugs and reducing the model size from 17MB before release. TheMattEmpire is creating a modular road/track kit with various components including ramps, straights, and curves. The kit is designed with future vehicle implementation in mind, with plans to keep different components (roads, props, boost/powerups) as separate purchasable kits. There's discussion about adding bridges and pit buildings to the road kit. General hyper tested the road kit and provided feedback about LOD (Level of Detail) issues, noting pixelation at relatively short distances. TheMattEmpire suggested this might be a texture rather than mesh issue and considered consulting with Ash in 3D Design.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do you plan to release this as a \"pets\" app? (asked by Saori) A: Yes I do plan to release this as a \"pets\" app, right now I'm fixing a few bugs and getting a different model this one is like 17mb which doesn't fly with me (answered by ~/MayD524/Hyperfy)\nQ: Can I buy a basic kit now? Pretty much just want straights, curves, and a 4 way intersection (asked by general hyper) A: Happy to let these go for free 🙂 Feedback welcomed! (answered by TheMattEmpire)\nQ: Do the lod's feel like they activate a little close to you? (asked by general hyper) A: I think the texture LOD is a little different from the Mesh LOD? The first LOD kicks in at 100 if I recall... (answered by TheMattEmpire)\nQ: Still confused about minting an vrm avatar... I need to better understand the minting process in order to align the design so I can also have physicals as 3d printables (asked by treed) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief discussion about video file size limitations when uploading to Discord. A user named 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰 encountered issues uploading large MP4 files (2GB and 800MB) and sought advice on maximum file size limits or alternative solutions for handling m3u8 files. Two community members provided helpful responses: MetaRick suggested avoiding large file uploads and instead recommended streaming video live or using direct links from services like Vimeo Pro. HypPrivakos offered practical advice on video compression using the open-source \"handbrake\" application to reduce file size while maintaining acceptable quality, suggesting that resolution could be reduced to 720p for virtual world viewing. HypPrivakos also offered personal assistance with file compression or hosting the content on a separate server as m3u8.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a max size for mp4 files? I tried 2GB but can't upload, it starts but kills the connection. I also tried 800MB with the same result. (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰) A: I would avoid trying to upload any file near that size. Video can be streamed live or from a direct link like a Vimeo pro account. (answered by MetaRick)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat segment shows community members discussing concerns about a cryptocurrency project's performance, with mentions of significant price decline (99%+) and lack of communication from the team.

User 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰 encountered issues uploading large MP4 files (2GB and 800MB) that would disconnect during upload. MetaRick suggested avoiding large file uploads and recommended streaming options like Vimeo Pro. HypPrivakos recommended compressing the video using Handbrake and offered assistance with file size reduction or hosting as m3u8. Eventually, 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰 managed to upload a 200MB file at 480p resolution for a 10-minute music video, which was sufficient for their needs. They also noted performance differences between m3u8 files hosted on GitHub (laggy in v1) versus MP4 files in v2, and inquired about whether Vimeo Pro m3u8 files would perform better than GitHub-hosted ones.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a max size for mp4 files that can be uploaded? (asked by 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰) A: Avoid uploading files near that size; video can be streamed live or from direct links like Vimeo pro (answered by MetaRick)\nQ: Is a Vimeo pro account m3u8 read quicker than a m3u8 on a git repo in the virtual world?

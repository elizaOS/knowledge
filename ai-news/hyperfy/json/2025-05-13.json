      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussions focused primarily on technical optimizations and implementations in Hyperfy. Key topics included asset optimization with WebP compression, which significantly reduced file sizes (3MB PNG skyboxes to 300KB WebP). Several developers shared their experiences optimizing worlds, with one reducing weapon textures to under 2MB per HYP file. \n\nVR control implementation was discussed, with DevStarlight sharing a solution for mapping VR controller buttons to interactions using `this.btnDown = this.control.keyE.down || this.control.touchB.down || this.control.xrRightBtn2.down || this.control.xrLeftBtn2.down`. \n\nVersion control approaches were explored, with developers describing their workflows for development and production worlds. Ashxn explained that the world folder stores everything for backup and sharing, while app scripts require manual tracking in git repositories.\n\nTechnical implementations were shared for making objects clickable with hyperlinks using code snippets like `app.onPointerDown = () => world.open(\"https://foo.com\", true)` or using action components. Audio looping issues were discussed, with solutions involving proper audio file preparation and testing with tools like drumbot.com/projects/looper.\n\nPerformance considerations were addressed, with Ashxn noting that optimized worlds could handle >100 users, while poorly optimized avatars (20MB VRMs with many draw calls) would limit capacity to around 10 users.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there version control? (asked by jin) A: The world folder stores everything so you can back it up, share it etc. For app scripts you have to manually keep track of changes in your own git repo. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Would it make sense to let users configure the LiveKit roomId? (asked by tcm390) A: That ServerLiveKit system runs once per world instance. All clients connect to a single server that gives the room id in the initial network snapshot. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Should we return room id here? (asked by tcm390) A: The token already has the room id embedded in it and LiveKit Client automatically handles it all. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Are controls in VR working, or I have to do something in the apps? (asked by DevStarlight | Numinia) A: Interact button just isn't mapped yet. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can I make the transition of a looping audio a tiny bit more seamless? (asked by vox) A: You can test and do seamless crossfading using drumbot.com/projects/looper. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there code I can add to an existing GLB model that will make it a clickable hyperlink to a new tab? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: Yes, use `app.onPointerDown = () => world.open(\"https://foo.com\", true)` or create an action component. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is it possible to create an App that allows for folks to sign in with SOL and do a Token Check? (asked by Agent12) A: Unanswered\nQ: How would you start to build something like drts in v2? (asked by vox) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Users discuss techniques to reduce file sizes, decrease draw calls, and improve performance, particularly for mobile compatibility. A significant focus is on optimizing a monorail model, which was reduced from 80MB to 18MB and eventually further optimized to 6MB with 18 draw calls. Users share optimization tools and techniques including material combining, atlasing textures, and collision simplification. There's discussion about automated optimization tools like InstaLOD that can make models \"game ready\" with minimal effort. Other topics include reconnection handling for the platform (implementing exponential backoff capped at 20-30 seconds), community worlds being built, and a brief mention of the \"Believe\" app's potential for marketing and funding teams building on Hyperfy.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is the platform live, can we play game to earn hyper?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"🪙│hyper\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. The conversation primarily revolves around a tweet shared by a user that appears to be about a game similar to slither.io being used to promote cryptocurrencies. Some users identified this as potentially fake or a scam, with ToxSam warning others to be careful. There was brief mention of a game where zones were blocked based on staking amounts or in-game earnings. The chat also includes vague references to \"plans for hyper\" and questions about utility for the hyper token, but no concrete technical implementations or solutions were discussed. Overall, the conversation lacks substantive technical content or problem-solving.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: When will we see some utility for the hyper token? (asked by Spook_Handy) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on water effects implementation in Hyperfy. Users inquired about a water application, with clarification that a simple water plane with UV scrolling is an effective solution. Vox shared a detailed implementation approach using a UV scroll script that creates water effects by manipulating a mesh with normal maps. The script adjusts texture coordinates over time to create movement. Vox's implementation specifically cuts and modifies a sphere mesh to work with skybox buildings, creating a water effect that appears to go behind structures. The conversation also briefly touched on Hyperfy version compatibility, with maximus recommending against coding for the outdated v1 and directing users to the v2 documentation instead. Carlosmu expressed interest in non-coding approaches to define scene elements like paths and positions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Was this water app ever released publicly? (asked by dean.land) A: Nah the simple water plane that ash demonstrated is probably better. Super easy to set up too, don't think there was ever a hyp for it even. (answered by Shiffty)\nQ: Is there any place to download sample projects of hyperfy v1? (asked by carlosmu) A: I recommend against coding anything for v1, ancient unsupported code. Have you visited https://docs.hyperfy.xyz/ by any chance? Hyperfy v2 is the way to go. (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3.

User 0mka raised concerns about the Z key now toggling all UI elements, including custom onscreen UI and reticles, whereas previously they could selectively hide chat/core UI while keeping their custom UI visible. This change impacts their experience/gameplay design where they wanted to maintain certain UI elements while hiding others. User ash explained that the Z key is now designed to hide all UI elements for purposes like screenshots or cinematics. 0mka clarified their use case is more specific - they want to selectively hide chat and core UI while keeping reticle and custom onscreen UI visible, suggesting that more configurable UI toggling options would be beneficial.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I make my onscreen UI not toggleable with the new Z key? (asked by 0mka) A: UI is all one thing, and Z is meant to hide it all for screenshots or cinematics (answered by ash)\nQ: Can the reticle be toggleable by a different hotkey?

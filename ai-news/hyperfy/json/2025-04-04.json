Teleportation on collision is achievable using onTriggerEvent and enabling collider triggers. Camera zoom is currently capped at 8m, originally for debugging, but users have requested a FOV slider to improve flexibility.",

This is feasible with minor core changes and could be enhanced using client-side WASM models for privacy and performance. App-level audio access will require user permissions.",

A new workflow was proposed: using AI-generated models for reference and applying smart materials to simplified geometry, avoiding complex retopology. This approach aims to streamline asset creation.",

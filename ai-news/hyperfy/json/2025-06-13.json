Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on camera anchors and lightmap implementation in Hyperfy. ~/drdoge.eth shared details about a camera anchor system that allows for multiple angle types, player tracking, and trigger modes. Marcel shared a shaderchunk code from Needle Engine for handling lightmaps. Ashxn worked on implementing Needle lightmaps in Hyperfy, sharing code that handles GLTF extensions for lightmaps but noted issues with UV mapping for split meshes. 0mka provided a solution for cleaning bloated world folders using the \"npm run world:clean\" command. Lastraum mentioned integrating Privy to enable easier connections without web3 wallets. The chat demonstrates ongoing technical development and community collaboration around rendering improvements and user experience enhancements.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How do camera anchors work? (asked by Ashxn) A: They can be placed in the world with configurable setup/angles and tracking options; clicking the anchor activates it when trigger mode is off (answered by ~/drdoge.eth)\nQ: How can I clean up my bloated world folder with deleted assets? (asked by Alephic) A: Run \"npm run world:clean\" command (answered by 0mka)\n\n## 3.

A user (Cayden0207) inquired about documentation for building interactive applications like a voting board in Hyperfy. Community members shared resources including the official Hyperfy documentation on the .hyp format and a GitHub repository of example applications. 0mka offered to conduct a tutorial session on Monday covering UI implementation, world storage, and player information retrieval using a voting/ballot system as an example. There was also discussion about managing multiple .hyp files, with Ashxn explaining that users can either download individual apps or all apps together by zipping the world folder. 0mka suggested using Blender with empty objects as reference points for seat positioning. A user reported an issue with deleting a model from their world, though the resolution wasn't captured in the transcript.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do we have docs or tutorial for building app in hyperfy? (asked by Cayden0207) A: This might help: https://docs.hyperfy.xyz/docs/hyp-format/ (answered by hiroP)\nQ: Is there a way to select multiple .hyp files and download them as a single .hyp file? (asked by Cayden0207) A: You can either download individual apps, or all apps together. The latter is by zipping up your `world` folder (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Guys we cant delete this model from our world, did anyone encounter this before? (asked by Cayden0207) A: What's happening when you click delete? Are you trying to replace the model or delete the hyp? (answered by 0mka)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe discussion in the Hyper channel focused on the utility and future of Hyper tokens, along with the Hyperfy platform's technical capabilities. Key points included:\n\n- Hyper tokens can be used to tip Hyper app creators and are integrated into demo games like Fallen.\n- The project is completely open source, including the engine, editor, and ecosystem tooling.\n- Hyperfy allows for real-time collaborative world building with persistent changes, differentiating it from platforms like Roblox.\n- A community member proposed a \"Stake to Host\" model where users could stake Hyper tokens to receive hosting services.\n- There was discussion about a potential acquisition offer from ai16z that was declined to maintain autonomy.\n- The platform architecture allows for third-party hosting, though Ashxn indicated users \"won't need to worry about hosting\" in the future.\n- Hyperfy's design philosophy emphasizes flexibility, allowing users to build in real-time with others while maintaining the option to build offline or modify the core.\n\n## 2.

When users toggle the UI off with the \"Z\" key and then back on, the chat becomes locked or unresponsive. Specifically, after pressing Enter with the UI toggled off and then toggling it back on with \"Z\", the chat functionality becomes locked. Users discovered that clicking on the chatbox after this sequence restores functionality. A developer (ash) acknowledged the issue and committed to fixing it. There was also a brief, unrelated mention about waiting for a \"working chair\" feature.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do you restore chat functionality after it gets locked? (asked by 0mka) A: Click on the chatbox and it starts working properly again. (answered by ash)\nQ: What causes the chat to lock up?

Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief exchange about handling collision settings when dragging and dropping models into Hyperfy V2 worlds. A user inquires about options to set collision on/off when importing models, noting that currently only the \"model\" app provides this functionality from the menu. A Hyperfy team member responds that automatic script selection based on file type is planned for the future, which would streamline the import process by automatically using the appropriate app for different file types (e.g., Model app for GLB files, Audio app for MP3 files).\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a solution for (or an app) when dragging and dropping a model into a V2 world that provides the option to set collision on/off? (asked by tom fΞllΞnz) A: Not yet but the goal is auto-select scripts pretty soon. Eg if you drop a glb it will use the Model app, Mp3 the Audio app etc (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

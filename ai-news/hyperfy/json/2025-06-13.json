      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on camera anchors and sphere triggers in Hyperfy. ~/drdoge.eth introduced a system that allows placing camera anchors in the world with configurable setups, angles, and tracking options. The system can automatically switch between cameras based on proximity. Users can set up multiple angle types for different shots or styles, with options for player tracking/static modes and trigger functionality. The anchor items themselves can be clicked to activate when trigger mode is off.\n\nAdditionally, marcel ðŸŒµ shared a ShaderChunk code snippet from Needle Engine that handles lightmap processing, including scale offset adjustments and sRGB to linear conversion. \n\nThere was also a brief exchange about cleaning up bloated world folders in self-hosted Hyperfy instances, with 0mka providing a solution using the \"npm run world:clean\" command and referencing the relevant script in the Hyperfy GitHub repository.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How does the camera anchor system work? (asked by Ashxn) A: It auto-switches to closer cameras, allows configurable setups/angles, and supports player tracking or static modes with trigger functionality on/off (answered by ~/drdoge.eth)\nQ: How can I clean up a bloated world folder when self-hosting Hyperfy? (asked by Alephic) A: Run \"npm run world:clean\" command, which uses the clean-world.mjs script in the Hyperfy repository (answered by 0mka)\n\n## 3.

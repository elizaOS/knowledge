      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy V2 development and community collaboration. A key technical discussion focused on creating trigger zones for notifications, with Gert-Jan Akerboom sharing a TriggerZone app that can send Discord notifications when users enter specific areas. Agent12 inquired about collision-based notification systems similar to V1's \"Collider with Notifications\" functionality, seeking ways to send alerts to Discord. Another technical concept discussed was using rolling ball physics as a workaround for implementing vehicles in Hyperfy V2, with community members expressing enthusiasm for this approach. Dhin proposed a collaborative game development project similar to Fall Guys with platforming levels, garnering interest from other members. The chat also included brief mentions of custom avatar implementation, with Roustan providing instructions on enabling this feature through the admin menu and adding a specific .hyp file.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does anyone have simple V2 .hyps that might do something similar to V1's \"Collider with Notifications\"? (asked by Agent12) A: Valiant shared a potential solution by linking to a previous Discord message.\nQ: Could \"Rolling Ball as the Actual Car\" Physics be a super-quick workaround for Usable Vehicles in Hyperfy V2? (asked by Agent12) A: 3rdEyeVisuals confirmed \"Yup!\" and mentioned seeing the same concept that morning.\nQ: How do I enable custom avatars? (implied by context from Roustan's messages) A: Turn on custom avatars in the admin menu under the world icon and add the specified .hyp file by dragging it into the window (answered by Roustan).\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy development, focusing on build mode improvements, scene inspection tools, animation handling, and app development. A significant portion involves community members creating tools to enhance the platform's functionality. ToxSam developed a scene inspector tool that allows viewing and modifying object properties in the world. Discussions about animation handling included converting Mixamo animations to Hyperfy-compatible formats, with peezy creating scripts to process these animations. Other topics included implementing double jump functionality, fridge interactions with snap points for objects, and NFT integration. Developers also discussed technical challenges like bandwidth optimization for larger player counts, build mode improvements (pinning objects, hierarchy views), and animation system enhancements. The community demonstrated strong collaboration, with experienced developers guiding newcomers through setup processes and troubleshooting.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What data is networked, and what data is local? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Currently sending updates at 8Hz, but could reduce to 4Hz or lower with 50+ players to manage bandwidth (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I start developing locally? (asked by ToxSam) A: Install nvm, clone repo, nvm install, nvm use, npm i, npm run dev (answered by Saori)\nQ: How can I implement triggers in Hyperfy? (asked by Shiffty) A: Use onTriggerEnter and onTriggerLeave on the rigidbody parent, not the collider (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do I convert Mixamo emotes to Hyperfy compatible format? (asked by peezy) A: Import in Blender and add a root bone (answered by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎 and 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\nQ: How do I make changes to objects persist after refreshing the site? (asked by ToxSam) A: Unanswered specifically, but ToxSam figured out position and rotation persistence\nQ: How do snaps work in Hyperfy? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: If a snap point comes within 1m of another snap point they snap (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

Maximus shared two resources: an article from the OMI group and a product called Companion Intelligence. Saltï asked about the possibility of using Venice AI agents, to which MetaMike responded affirmatively, explaining that it would require pointing the chat endpoint to Venice instead of other LLM providers like Eliza. The conversation was minimal with no in-depth technical discussions or problem-solving.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are we able to use (or would be able to) Venice AI agents? (asked by saltï) A: In theory, yes.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"⚡│general\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy's building capabilities, particularly a house-building competition announced by Ashxn with 15,000 HYPER prizes. Users discussed technical aspects of the building system, including snap points, object rotation issues, and clipping problems. Several users shared their builds and provided feedback on the building experience. There were discussions about adding visual indicators for snap points and handling objects without snap points. Users also reported issues with angle snapping and object positioning. A key technical discovery was made regarding flat objects and shadows in Hyperfy - flipping normals in Blender (red side up) allows flat objects to cast shadows properly. Security concerns were raised about users potentially griefing others' builds in shared spaces, with suggestions for role-based and model-based security solutions. The community also discussed AI agents and their potential integration into Hyperfy, with reports from NFT Paris indicating significant interest in AI agents.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do flat GLB files cast shadows in Hyperfy? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Flip the normals in Blender so the red side is facing up and the blue side is facing down (answered by Gert-Jan Akerboom, confirmed by TheMattEmpire)\nQ: How can we prevent users from editing others' creations in shared spaces? (asked by treed) A: Role-based + model-based security is needed, not blockchain; limiting people to roles and models would be a good step (answered by maximus)\nQ: How do we tag our houses for the competition? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Ashxn will make a sign post that people can place out front (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do we submit the competition entry? (asked by treed) A: Reply to the competition tweet so they're all together (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Are we supposed to use custom GLBs or just what's provided on play hyperfy? (asked by treed) A: Both, but house should be mostly build kit (answered by fishai)\n\n## 3.

The chat primarily consists of users checking token prices using bot commands (like $hyperfy, $genie), sharing links to tokens on pump.fun, and brief discussions about market movements. There is minimal technical discussion in this segment. One notable mention was about a project called \"Studia AI\" where a developer allegedly abandoned the project despite previously being active and sharing functional code. Users also shared tweets and music, but there was no substantive technical problem-solving or decision-making evident in this chat segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How is the nut 🥜 the ticker?

(asked by Shiffty) A: Make a taller simpler hexagon that sits right above it and use it as a trigger (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Any tips on setting up a simple trigger? (asked by Shiffty) A: Ashxn offered to send code for doing triggers in another channel (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Would there be a way to kind of auto LOD if desired?

Key technical issues include: a crash when attempting to duplicate a person instead of an object, visibility concerns with the reticle in build mode, and problems with Math.random() in app scripts due to security restrictions. Ash confirmed that Math.random() is restricted but offered the global `num` method as an alternative, which was subsequently documented by 0mka. Other discussions covered app behavior when modified (each config change rebuilds the entire app), signpost duplication issues (all signposts update when one is changed), and wallet connection problems on mobile in Version 1. The conversation demonstrates active developer engagement with user feedback and quick responses to technical questions.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How do I update my locally running V2 when the dev team makes changes? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: You need the dev branch. Use git commands to fetch, checkout and pull from origin.

HypPrivakos explains that standard website hosting platforms won't work for Hyperfy as they require the ability to run custom software on the server. When Tim clarified that his shared hosting could run Node.js, HypPrivakos suggested trying it out, noting that the many variations in web hosting providers make it impossible to give a definitive answer without testing. The conversation indicates that Hyperfy worlds require Node.js capabilities and potentially other server-side functionalities beyond what typical shared hosting might offer.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does anyone know if a shared hosting for websites could host a hyperfy world in a sub domain? Or could the server load make it not work? (asked by Tim / TC) A: If it's just a website hosting platform, you won't be able to host it on there, you need to be able to run custom software of the server. Try and see.

This appears to be an ongoing project that Maximus plans to iterate on over time.\n\nSecond, peezy introduced a proof-of-concept tool called \"hucow\" (Hyperfy User Core OverWrites) designed to help users share core changes to the Hyperfy platform. The CLI tool allows users to apply, manage, and publish patches to the Hyperfy codebase. The tool is in alpha stage but offers functionality to install, apply patches, remove patches, list applied patches, reset to base version, search for patches, and publish new patches.

A user (yung_algorithm) encountered an error related to Math.random() in secure mode that prevented access to their world, which Ashxn fixed. They also discussed implementing random avatar assignment for non-connected users, with Ashxn providing a pre-built \"Avatars\" app solution that allows three VRMs to be randomly assigned to visitors without connected wallets. Another user (StrawberrySith) sought help with React app modifications and expressed interest in React tutorials specific to Hyperfy beyond the official documentation. There was brief mention of open-sourcing the platform and potential for community-suggested integrations like Zora. The conversation highlights Hyperfy's developer ecosystem, with users building custom worlds and seeking support for implementation challenges.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How can I implement random avatar assignment for non-connected users? (asked by yung_algorithm) A: Use the \"Avatars\" app which allows you to add 3 VRMs that get randomly assigned to visitors without connected wallets. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Has anyone written a Hyperfy tutorial that includes React basics specific to the platform? (asked by StrawberrySith) A: Jin and knarr started work on documentation that might help: https://github.com/madjin/hyperfy-docs/blob/main/docs/developers/quick-start.md (answered by maximus)\nQ: Was the source code for the custom solana program (airdrop) ever published? (asked by t-900) A: Unanswered\nQ: Since this is going open source, will we have an opportunity to suggest new integrations (like Zora)? (asked by StrawberrySith) A: Likely yes, based on developers' previous statements about open sourcing. (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Hyperfy Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat revolves around the launch of Hyperfy's $HYPER token on Solana and the associated claim process for eligible users. Hyperfy is transitioning from v1 to v2, with v1 being an NFT-gated metaverse platform on Ethereum where users could build 3D worlds, while v2 will be more open and permissionless. The token launch created significant excitement, with many users trying to claim their airdrop. Key technical points include:\n\n- Hyperfy launched $HYPER token on Solana with claims available to ETH NFT world holders (snapshot taken December 7) and ai16z partners (100k token holders)\n- The claim process requires linking ETH wallets to SOL wallets at hyperfy.io/airdrop, then claiming at hyperfy.xyz/claim\n- The team clarified that v1 worlds will continue to function on hyperfy.io while v2 will launch on hyperfy.xyz\n- Tokenomics include 30% for world holders, 20% for team (vested over 3 years), 20% for liquidity, and 30% for DAO\n- The token reached approximately 200-300M market cap within 24 hours of launch\n- V2 will be open source and permissionless, removing the NFT gating that existed in v1\n- The team emphasized that buying v1 NFTs now won't qualify for airdrops and isn't recommended for speculation\n\n## 2.

(asked by multiple users) A: At least a day as it's a manual process (answered by maximus)\nQ: Why are there two different domains (hyperfy.io and hyperfy.xyz)? (asked by shinji) A: hyperfy.io is for v1 worlds, hyperfy.xyz is for v2 (answered by maximus)\nQ: Is the liquidity locked? (asked by Borriello) A: Yes, it's locked in Raydium but doesn't show up on Dexscreener (answered by Saori)\nQ: What's the utility of the token? (asked by MwakaDegen) A: It's a utility token with specifics still being determined (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Will v1 worlds be able to migrate to v2? (asked by SomeOtherGuy) A: No, they will stay as v1 worlds hosted on hyperfy.io (answered by maximus)\nQ: Is it worth buying v1 NFTs now? (asked by multiple users) A: No, unless you want to build v1 worlds; they have no speculative value (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3.

JUAN and 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 discuss a problem where animations are connected to the hip bone instead of the root bone, causing improper movement. They identified that Hyperfy sometimes misinterprets bone hierarchies, especially with complex rigs or when using Mixamo or Rokoko animations. The issue appears inconsistent, with some animations working correctly while others don't. 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 noted that even some default Hyperfy emotes connect to the hip rather than the root. JUAN suggested that retargeting tools might help, but 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 confirmed he had already tried this approach. They also discussed issues with Rokoko animations initially displaying as T-poses until properly processed, but still having the hip-root connection problem.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What might be causing animations to connect to hip instead of root in Hyperfy? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: It could be related to how Hyperfy interprets bone hierarchies, especially with complex rigs or non-standard hierarchies (answered by JUAN)\nQ: Why do some Mixamo emotes have the hip-root issue while others don't? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: Unanswered\nQ: Would a retargeting tool help fix the bone hierarchy issues? (asked by JUAN) A: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 had already tried this approach but still experienced the issue (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: JUAN | Helpee: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 | Context: Animations connecting to hip instead of root bone in Hyperfy | Resolution: Identified potential causes (bone hierarchies misinterpretation) and suggested retargeting tools, though the issue remains unresolved\nHelper: JUAN | Helpee: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 | Context: Understanding why the GLB file has animation issues in Hyperfy | Resolution: JUAN examined the file and determined Hyperfy might be misinterpreting the hierarchy or expecting a simpler rig structure\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in 🐞│issues Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around users experiencing issues with claiming the Hyperfy airdrop. The airdrop is available to Hyperfy World NFT holders (who owned them before a December 7th snapshot) and ai16z partners with 100k+ tokens. The claiming process requires users to register their Ethereum wallet (containing the eligible NFT) and link it to a Solana wallet on hyperfy.io/airdrop, then claim tokens at hyperfy.xyz/claim. \n\nMany users reported the \"wallet not eligible\" error after registration. Moderators (particularly maximus) explained that registration data must be manually transferred to the claim site by the development team (based in Australia), which can take up to 24 hours. Other technical issues included browser compatibility problems (especially with Brave), mobile device limitations, and special cases with smart wallets like Argent and Gnosis Safe that had difficulty with the signature process. Users were advised to clear cache, try different browsers, and be patient while waiting for their registration to be processed.\n\nThe team extended the claim deadline to accommodate these issues and is working to resolve edge cases, particularly for users with smart wallets or those who lost access to their original wallets.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why does my wallet show as \"not eligible\" after registration? (asked by multiple users) A: Registration data must be manually transferred to the claim site by the dev team, which can take up to 24 hours (answered by maximus)\nQ: Is there a deadline for claiming the airdrop? (asked by itzler) A: The deadline is no longer applicable since the team is doing registration + claim (answered by maximus)\nQ: Can I claim the airdrop if I purchase a Hyperfy NFT now? (asked by AN0610-Pirate) A: No, the snapshot was taken in December and new NFT holders are not eligible (answered by maximus)\nQ: Why can't I claim on my mobile device? (asked by Srile) A: Mobile may have issues, try on desktop/laptop instead (answered by maximus)\nQ: How much did people get per world? (asked by wind) A: 150k coins per world, worth about 20k USD+ (answered by VTATV)\nQ: What if my world was stolen? Can I still claim? (asked by MasonMcFly0x♦) A: Unfortunately, only the current NFT owner can claim as ownership is tied to the NFT (answered by maximus)\nQ: What if I held my NFT in a smart wallet (Argent/Gnosis Safe)? (asked by heatherundertheweather) A: This is a special case the team will need to address (answered by maximus)\nQ: Are ai16z NFT holders eligible for the airdrop? (asked by 3moory1061) A: No, only ai16z partners with 100k tokens at snapshot time are eligible (answered by maximus)\nQ: What if I can't sign the transaction with my Ledger? (asked by KamX) A: Remove the wallet from Phantom and re-add it (answered by Paradoxx, shared by maximus)\nQ: Does capitalization in ETH addresses matter? (asked by Knar) A: No, it's the same address regardless of capitalization (answered by VTATV)\n\n## 3.

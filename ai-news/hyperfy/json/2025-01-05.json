A user (yung_algorithm) encountered an error with Math.random() in secure mode that prevented world access, which Ashxn fixed. They also discussed implementing random avatar assignment for non-connected users, with Ashxn providing a pre-built \"Avatars\" app solution that allows three VRM models to be randomly assigned to visitors without connected wallets. StrawberrySith requested help with React app modifications and expressed interest in React tutorials specific to Hyperfy beyond the official documentation. There was brief mention of open-sourcing the platform and potential for community-suggested integrations like Zora. The conversation demonstrates Hyperfy's developer ecosystem with ready-made solutions and the ability to deploy directly to production environments.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How can I implement random avatar assignment for non-connected users? (asked by yung_algorithm) A: Use the \"Avatars\" app which allows you to add 3 VRMs that get randomly assigned to visitors without connected wallets. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Any chance someone can help me make a small modification to the REACT app in my world? (asked by StrawberrySith) A: Unanswered\nQ: Has anyone ever written a Hyperfy tutorial that includes some REACT basics (specific to the platform)? (asked by StrawberrySith) A: Jin and knarr started work on documentation that might help: https://github.com/madjin/hyperfy-docs/blob/main/docs/developers/quick-start.md (answered by maximus)\nQ: Was the source code for the custom solana program (airdrop) ever published? (asked by t-900) A: Unanswered\nQ: Since this is going open source, will we have an opportunity to suggest new integrations (like Zora)? (asked by StrawberrySith) A: Likely yes, as developers have spoken about open sourcing and \"giving human race a gift of the ages\" (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Hyperfy Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat revolves around the launch of Hyperfy's $HYPER token on Solana and the associated claim process for eligible users. Hyperfy is transitioning from v1 to v2, with v1 being an NFT-gated metaverse platform on Ethereum where users could build 3D worlds, while v2 will be more open and permissionless. A snapshot was taken on December 7th for ETH NFT world holders and ai16z partners (those holding 100k+ ai16z tokens) to claim $HYPER tokens. The claim process requires linking ETH wallets to SOL wallets at hyperfy.io/airdrop, then claiming at hyperfy.xyz/claim. Many users experienced delays in eligibility updates after registration. The token launched with significant interest, reaching approximately 200-300M market cap on the first day. Team members clarified tokenomics: 30% for world holders, 20% for DAO, 20% for liquidity, 20% for founders (vested over 3 years), 5% for ai16z partners, and 5% for marketing. The team emphasized that buying v1 NFT worlds now would not qualify for the airdrop and should only be purchased for building purposes, not speculation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the correct contract address for $HYPER? (asked by multiple users) A: 8vBMibwpn8wpfYKbQ9xqzodymg3LjmYec2tSNGRy23K8 (answered by maximus)\nQ: Who is eligible for the airdrop/claim? (asked by multiple users) A: ETH NFT world holders before December 7th snapshot and ai16z partners with 100k+ tokens at snapshot time (answered by maximus)\nQ: How many tokens do you get per world NFT? (asked by syGMatMATTIOBOY) A: Around 150,000 tokens per world (answered by TropixMusic)\nQ: Is there a deadline to register for the claim? (asked by Syrup'nBBQ) A: The original deadline was January 7th, but it has been extended as it's now a claim process rather than an airdrop (answered by maximus)\nQ: How long does it take after registering a SOL address to become eligible for claiming? (asked by MrTouch) A: At least a day. It's a manual process to move from registration to claim (answered by maximus)\nQ: What's the difference between hyperfy.io and hyperfy.xyz? (asked by shinji) A: hyperfy.io is for v1 worlds, hyperfy.xyz is for v2 (answered by maximus)\nQ: What is the utility of the $HYPER token? (asked by MwakaDegen) A: It's a utility token with several potential uses still being determined (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Will v1 worlds still be usable after v2 launches? (asked by SomeOtherGuy) A: Yes, v1 worlds will continue to work on hyperfy.io (answered by maximus)\nQ: Can v1 worlds migrate to v2? (asked by SomeOtherGuy) A: No, they will stay as v1 worlds hosted on hyperfy.io (answered by maximus)\nQ: Is the liquidity locked? (asked by Borriello) A: Yes, it's locked in the lowest fee pool (answered by Saori)\n\n## 3.

JUAN and ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì discuss a problem where animations are connecting to the hip bone instead of the root bone, causing improper animation rendering. They identified that Hyperfy might be misinterpreting bone hierarchies, especially with complex rigs. ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì noted that some Mixamo emotes exhibit this issue while others don't, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. JUAN suggested the problem might be related to how Hyperfy reads the armature structure and mentioned similar issues in Nifty Island. They discussed using retargeting tools like the Rokoko addon to potentially fix the bone assignments, though ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì indicated this approach was already attempted. The issue appears to be that animations are getting stuck to the hips rather than the root bone, even after processing through Rokoko.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: What might be causing animations to connect to hip instead of root bone in Hyperfy? (asked by ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì) A: It could be related to how Hyperfy interprets bone hierarchies, especially with complex rigs or custom bones (answered by JUAN)\nQ: Does the issue happen with all Mixamo emotes? (asked by JUAN) A: No, it's random - some Mixamo emotes do it and some don't (answered by ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì)\nQ: Would a retargeting tool help fix the bone assignments? (asked by JUAN) A: ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì tried this approach already but still experienced the issue (answered by ùïΩùñîùñöùñòùñôùñÜùñì)\n\n## 3.

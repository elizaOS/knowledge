A user named Fibelius inquired about obtaining VRM files for newly purchased Vipe NFTs. ToxSam - IBIH provided information that these files can be accessed through IPFS and directed Fibelius to a community-created website (vipe.city) where the files can be easily downloaded. ToxSam also mentioned that while character VRMs are available, the room GLBs are no longer accessible. The conversation was successful as Fibelius thanked ToxSam for the assistance.\n\n## 2.

The conversation consists of four short messages that appear to be casual commentary about trading activity and market sentiment. There are references to someone attempting to trade aggressively (\"trying to trade their way to generational wealth\") and a shared tweet that seems to express disappointment about the state of a particular aspect of Hyperfy. No technical content, implementations, or solutions are discussed in this limited exchange.",

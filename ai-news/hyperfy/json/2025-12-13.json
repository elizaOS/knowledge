      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"🪙│hyper\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThis Discord conversation centers on community concerns about Hyperfy's development direction and token promises. The main technical discussion revolves around the absence of Web3 functionality in Hyperfy V2's core build, particularly token gating capabilities that were present in V1. Users express frustration about the lack of marketplace implementation and EVM connectivity in the core build, despite these being promised features. There's debate about whether these features are being developed at all, with some users mentioning that EVM connectivity could be implemented through custom servers. The discussion reveals tension between token holders expecting promised features and defenders of the current development pace. A significant revelation is that some community members appear to have exclusive access to information about Hyperfy's new direction through private channels, creating information asymmetry. Technical points include mentions of branch switching in Hyperworld being \"trivial\" and the possibility of implementing EVM connectivity through custom servers hosting worlds.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can you use Crypto in your Hyperfy V2 Core build yet? (asked by Agent12) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can I use other branches or that's not allowed? (asked by Dhin) A: If it's not in the Core Build it's not accessible to the Masses. (answered by Agent12)\nQ: Has there been any discussions of not sticking to the token that you've heard of? (asked by Jayzen) A: He has said multiple times that HYPER will be the only token, just hasn't mentioned anything about dilution. (answered by Saori)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 | Helpee: Community | Context: Explaining that EVM connectivity could be implemented through custom servers | Resolution: Mentioned it's possible and on their to-do list, noting a third-party marketplace for HYPS has already been set up\nHelper: Dhin | Helpee: Community | Context: Explaining branch switching in Hyperworld | Resolution: Noted that changing branches in Hyperworld is \"pretty trivial\" with a \"cool setup\"\n\n## 4.

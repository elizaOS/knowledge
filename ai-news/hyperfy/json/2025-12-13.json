      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🪙│hyper Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion centers around concerns about Hyperfy's development direction and token promises. Several users express frustration about perceived lack of transparency, communication, and follow-through on promised features like marketplace integration and Web3 functionality in the core V2 build. PurpleSack and others argue that launching a token creates responsibilities to deliver on promises that investors relied upon. Saori reveals there may be a pivot to a new direction being shared only in private chats with select community members, creating information asymmetry. Some technical discussion occurs around the feasibility of adding Web3 functionality to Hyperfy V2, with 3rdEyeVisuals claiming they implemented Phantom wallet integration but acknowledging it's not available as a .hyp package for general users. The conversation highlights tension between token holders focused on investment value and builders focused on platform functionality, with disagreement about whether promised features are being abandoned or simply taking time to develop.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can you use Crypto in your Hyperfy V2 Core build yet? (asked by Agent12) A: Not in the core build, though 3rdEyeVisuals claims to have added Phantom wallet integration in a custom implementation (answered by multiple users)\nQ: Has there been any discussions of not sticking to the token that you've heard of? (asked by Jayzen) A: Saori states Ash has said multiple times that HYPER will be the only token, but hasn't mentioned anything about dilution (answered by Saori)\nQ: Is it a Hype that I can add to Current Core? (asked by Agent12) A: No, it's not a .hyp package (answered by 3rdEyeVisuals)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: 3rdEyeVisuals | Helpee: Agent12 | Context: Adding Web3/crypto functionality to Hyperfy V2 | Resolution: 3rdEyeVisuals offered to share custom source code but noted it would still require implementation work\nHelper: maximus | Helpee: Community | Context: Explaining the reasoning behind no direct crypto integration in core code | Resolution: Clarified it was to avoid making the base code unusable to anti-crypto public, with extensions planned for blockchain integration\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Create a .hyp package for Phantom wallet integration | Description: Package the Web3 functionality as a distributable component | Mentioned By: Agent12 and 3rdEyeVisuals\nTechnical: Implement blended animations in core | Description: Saori mentioned would create something \"cool\" if this feature was added | Mentioned By: Saori\nFeature: Restore marketplace functionality from V1 to V2 | Description: Ability to distribute world building to broader audiences | Mentioned By: maximus\nFeature: Add Web3 gating for token holders in V2 core | Description: Allow creation of token-gated experiences as was possible in V1 | Mentioned By: Agent12\nDocumentation: Open source Web3 integration code | Description: 3rdEyeVisuals plans to open source custom implementation due to GPL license | Mentioned By: 3rdEyeVisuals",

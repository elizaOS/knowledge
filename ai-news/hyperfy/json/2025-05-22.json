      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical aspects of Hyperfy development, with several key topics emerging. Ashxn shared progress on implementing occlusion culling using pre-pass depth checking, which would significantly improve performance by skipping the rendering of objects hidden behind walls or other large structures. This feature would work by marking large objects as \"occluders\" with a simple checkbox in the interface.\n\nAnimation issues were extensively discussed, particularly regarding the implementation of root bones for proper character animations. Several users encountered problems with IK (Inverse Kinematics) and foot-planting in animations, where feet would slip instead of properly connecting with the ground. Solutions included using a script from the mixamo-hyperfy-converter repository and ensuring the hips aren't connected to the root bone.\n\nOther technical topics included app communication (using events rather than direct object access), animation capabilities in v2 versus v1 (noting that v2 currently only supports animating GLBs with bones), and portal functionality. There was also discussion about memory optimization and the efficiency of event-based communication between apps.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Would occlusion culling be set up manually or automatically? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: You mark big objects like walls and houses as \"occluders\" and it automatically tests everything else to see if it's hidden behind them (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is occlusion culling based on the asset or the collider? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: It's based on the asset (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to pull the GLB models from JSON of a CV world? (asked by ~/drdoge.eth) A: Lastraum provided a resource to help with this (answered by Lastraum)\nQ: Is there an easy way to get app object info similar to world.getPlayer/s? (asked by 0mka) A: No, apps can't do that. If two apps want to communicate, use events by design (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What about audio/video loops? Any memory leak worries there? (asked by 0mka) A: There are zero memory leaks that I'm aware of at the moment (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Has anyone played with adding footstep sounds to the character animations? (asked by Mugenomics) A: Should be doable but probably won't be 100% in time, only estimated (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can I add a portal to a specific place of my scene? (asked by carlosmu) A: For v1, you give the place app a name and then use hyperfy.io/world?place=NAME in the browser (answered by maximus)\nQ: Am I missing something in regards to animating a scene GLB similar to v1? (asked by emotionull) A: We don't have that yet. You can only animate GLBs that have bones in v2 for now (answered by Valiant and ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/)\n\n## 3.

The conversation primarily revolves around the HYPER token's utility within its ecosystem. Ashxn explains that the platform is \"hyper centric\" where creators can forge objects only with HYPER, and builders/collectors trade using HYPER. They also mention that the platform is open-source because they're \"not extractionary,\" suggesting a non-rent-seeking approach to their technology. The rest of the conversation includes brief mentions of DeLorean cars (both digital NFTs and physical vehicles), SOL price updates, and general market sentiment. There is no detailed technical problem-solving or implementation discussion in this segment.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How is HYPER used in the platform?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on technical aspects of 3D design for virtual environments. Key discussions included performance optimization techniques, specifically avoiding transparency in models for better performance on non-desktop platforms (mobile/VR), with recommendations to use alpha-cutout instead of alpha-blend. Community call highlights mentioned improved VR interactions, splat map experiments, housing kit development, and performance improvements including reduced memory usage and smaller Docker images. There was brief discussion about Auto Rig Pro's new AI integration, though details weren't elaborated. A side conversation touched on user experience issues with Decentraland's platform, noting the high friction requiring multiple applications and authentication steps to build and preview content. The chat also included mentions of VRM models and commentary on a game project (Ember Sword) that apparently ceased development.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does anyone have a pudgey vrm? (asked by maximus) A: i do actually, i got one made a month ago for a thing (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Anyone using latest Auto Rig Pro? Some kind of ai integration now.

First, users noted that hyperfy.how was offline, with team members confirming it had been moved to docs.hyperfy.xyz. Second, there was a significant discussion about problems with .hyp files imported from dcl-iwb.co displaying incorrectly in local worlds. Users reported models appearing white or pink, indicating missing materials or textures. Lastraum identified that some Decentraland-created files were using external textures, causing these rendering issues. As a solution, Lastraum updated the dcl-iwb.co site to recognize .glb files with external textures and prevent problematic .hyp downloads, effectively addressing the issue at its source.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on game development in Hyperfy v2, with significant attention on a \"Tile Dash\" game. Lastraum shared his plans to port a game from Decentraland to Hyperfy, which ash offered a $500 bounty for. The game features 50 levels with increasing difficulty, where players collect yellow tiles while avoiding obstacles, with a safe zone in the corner. Lastraum successfully implemented the game, including multiplayer functionality, and shared a link for testing.\n\nTechnical discussions included rotation of primitive shapes in Hyperfy (using radians instead of degrees), server management with Coolify for hosting multiple worlds, and optimization concerns for rendering many blocks. MetaMike shared experiments with Conway's Game of Life implementation, noting color updates were more efficient than height updates.\n\nOther technical topics included local server setup through WSL, self-hosting multiple worlds, and proper procedures for updating Hyperfy locally. Marcel shared a project that generates audio streams from repository updates, including Hyperfy, which received positive feedback as a novel way to stay informed about development changes.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I rotate primitive shapes in Hyperfy? (asked by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz) A: Rotation is in radians, but for degrees you would use `rotation: [0, 45 * DEG2RAD, 0]` (degrees to radians) (answered by ash)\nQ: How can I set up an easy way to have multiple worlds like the real hyperfy site when self-hosting? (asked by emotionull) A: One server with coolify on it! Coolify can manage multiple worlds (answered by ash)\nQ: How do I find my-world folders when using WSL with a different username? (asked by Valiant) A: \\\\\\\\wsl$ is typically a shortcut to your WSL folder (answered by Shiffty)\nQ: How do I rename an app? (asked by MetaMike) A: In metadata, the little tag icon (answered by ash)\nQ: Is there a better way to update hyperfy locally to avoid errors? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Follow a 5-step process: 1) commit/stash changes, 2) git pull --rebase, 3) npm install, 4) check Migrations.md, 5) npm run dev (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily discusses Hyperfy's unified control system across different platforms. Ash explains the vision for consistent controls between desktop, mobile, and VR, with specific implementations like a wheel menu accessible via right-click (desktop), long press (mobile), or trigger press (VR) for common actions like grab, transform, duplicate, and delete. Basic movement controls are also being standardized: desktop uses WASD/mouse, mobile uses joystick/swipe, and VR uses stick/head movement. Roustan notes improvements in VR avatar leg animations, and Vox mentions the immersive experience of desktop users' head movements in VR. Enryt raises an issue about building in Hyperfy worlds from Android devices and Quest headsets due to missing keyboard tab buttons.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Do you know a way to build inside an HF world from Android (smartphones / Quest headsets)? Since the tab keyboard button is missing... (asked by Enryt) A: This is part of the unified controls being developed, which will standardize interactions across devices (answered by ash)\nQ: How feasible is unified control across different platforms with different inputs? (asked by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host) A: Ash outlined specific implementations showing it's 80-90% achievable through consistent menu systems and standardized controls (answered by ash)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Enryt | Context: Building in Hyperfy worlds from Android/Quest due to missing tab keyboard button | Resolution: Explained it's part of upcoming unified controls system with standardized interactions across devices\nHelper: ash | Helpee: HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host | Context: Questioning feasibility of unified controls across platforms | Resolution: Detailed specific implementation examples showing how 90% of functionality could be standardized\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nType: Feature | Description: Implement unified controls system across desktop, mobile and VR platforms | Mentioned By: ash\nType: Feature | Description: Add in-VR arms and hand-tracking | Mentioned By: vox\nType: Feature | Description: Add object/image/text/NFT functionality | Mentioned By: Enryt",

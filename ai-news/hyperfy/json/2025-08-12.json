      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily revolves around game development in Hyperfy v2, with a focus on implementing \"Tile Dash,\" a game originally shared by Lastraum. Ash offered a $500 bounty for creating this as an app in Hyperfy v2, with additional compensation for multiplayer functionality. Lastraum, the original creator, expressed interest in building it for both Hyperfy and Forge platforms. The game involves 50 levels of increasing difficulty where players collect yellow tiles while avoiding obstacles, with a safe zone in the corner and leaderboard tracking.\n\nTechnical aspects discussed include prim rotation in Hyperfy (using radians rather than degrees), with Ash suggesting the use of DEG2RAD for conversion. There was also a brief exchange about self-hosting multiple Hyperfy worlds using Coolify, with a warning about storage management to prevent crashes. Other topics included Conway's Game of Life implementation and WSL folder access for local development.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I rotate prim planes in Hyperfy? (asked by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz) A: Rotation is in radians, use `rotation: [0, 45 * DEG2RAD, 0]` to convert from degrees (answered by ash)\nQ: How can I set up multiple worlds like the real Hyperfy site when self-hosting on phettaverse.games? (asked by emotionull) A: Use one server with Coolify on it, as Coolify can manage multiple worlds (answered by ash)\nQ: How do I find my-world folders when using WSL with a different username? (asked by Valiant) A: Use \\\\\\\\wsl$ as a shortcut to access your WSL folder (answered by Shiffty)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Shiffty | Helpee: Valiant | Context: Couldn't find my-world folders in WSL setup with different username | Resolution: Suggested using \\\\\\\\wsl$ shortcut to access WSL folder\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz | Context: Trouble rotating prim planes in Hyperfy | Resolution: Explained rotation is in radians and provided code example using DEG2RAD for conversion\nHelper: ash | Helpee: emotionull | Context: Setting up multiple worlds when self-hosting | Resolution: Suggested using Coolify to manage multiple worlds on a single server\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"âš¡â”‚general\"\n\n## 1. Summary\nThis chat segment contains minimal technical discussion. The only technical topic mentioned is about building in Hyperfy worlds from Android devices (smartphones/Quest headsets), where a user notes the tab keyboard button is missing. Ash responds by explaining this is part of a planned \"unified controls\" system that aims to standardize interactions across devices. The proposed solution involves implementing long-clicking on objects to bring up action menus (move/duplicate/delete) that would work consistently across mobile, desktop, and VR platforms. The rest of the conversation consists of casual greetings and comments about NFTs.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Do you know a way to build inside an HF world from Android (smartphones / Quest headsets)? Since the tab keyboard button is missing... (asked by Enryt) A: That's part of the unified controls I've spoken about a few times. Instead of having different controls on every device, the goal is to unify them, eg long clicking on an object brings up an action menu on mobile, desktop, VR with options to move/duplicate/delete etc (answered by ash)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Enryt | Context: Building in Hyperfy worlds from Android devices (smartphones/Quest headsets) without tab keyboard button | Resolution: Explained that unified controls are planned to standardize interactions across devices using long-click actions\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Implement unified controls system across devices (mobile, desktop, VR) | Description: Create consistent interaction methods like long-clicking for object manipulation | Mentioned By: ash\nFeature: Add building capabilities for Android devices | Description: Enable building functionality on smartphones and Quest headsets | Mentioned By: Enryt",

The first message mentions a sample for experimenting with UV scrolling (though the actual sample link isn't visible in the transcript). The second message shares a YouTube tutorial link about flattening UVs in vanilla Blender without requiring addons like zenUV. This indicates the channel is focused on 3D design techniques, specifically UV mapping which is crucial for proper texture application in 3D models.",

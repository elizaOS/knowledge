      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical issues related to world development and script execution. A key problem emerged when Gh0stt's world became inaccessible due to crashing scripts. Ash suggested using a URL parameter \"?safemode=1\" to disable script execution, but this wasn't available in the Numinia version Gh0stt was using. Ash then provided a JavaScript code snippet to force all apps to have no script, though this solution also blocked the app list. The conversation revealed that Numinia was running an older version without the safemode feature. Other technical topics included storing assets on IPFS, implementing Vector3 configuration options in apps, and chess game development. Gh0stt shared a pre-release chess game (https://pre.chess.numen.games) that had some connection issues. The chat concluded with a mention of a new AI model.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there a way to run your world in safe mode? (asked by Gh0stt) A: Add ?safemode=1 to the URL (answered by ash)\nQ: What other flags exist? (asked by .hyp shaman) A: Unanswered\nQ: How to set a vector3 in the config options? (asked by Gh0stt) A: You need to parse it yourself and use a string or number type (answered by Shiffty)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"🤖│agents\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment is very brief and contains minimal technical discussion. Fibelius shared resources about Hyperfy agents, including a HackMD document about agentic game behavior and links to Hyperfy documentation. They noted that the demo page (agents.hyperfy.xyz) was not working, but suggested looking at examples on play.hyperfy.xyz. Ash confirmed that \"that agents world is offline now.\" A user named 太阳 asked if there were alternative ways to add AI to a world. Fibelius also shared a Twitter/X post about a system prompt for GPT-5 Codex. Overall, this appears to be a relatively inactive channel with some resource sharing but no substantial technical discussions or problem-solving.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there any other way to add some AI to your world? (asked by 太阳) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Fibelius | Helpee: Unspecified channel members | Context: Sharing resources about Hyperfy agents when channel appeared inactive | Resolution: Provided links to documentation and examples, though some resources were noted as outdated or offline\n\n## 4. Action Items\nDocumentation: Update Hyperfy agent documentation as some docs are outdated | Mentioned By: Fibelius\nTechnical: Fix or update the agents demo page at agents.hyperfy.xyz | Mentioned By: Fibelius",

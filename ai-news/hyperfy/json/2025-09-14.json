      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around technical issues with a Hyperfy-based world implementation. Gh0stt encountered a critical problem where their world became inaccessible due to crashing scripts, with no way to disable script execution. Ash suggested using the \"safemode=1\" URL parameter, but this feature wasn't available in the Numinia version Gh0stt was using. Ash then proposed a JavaScript console hack to disable scripts by nullifying blueprint scripts, though this solution also disabled the app list interface. DevStarlight mentioned that Numinia hasn't updated since the S3 merge into dev, explaining the missing safemode feature. The conversation also briefly touched on IPFS asset hosting and configuration options for Vector3 types in app configuration.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there a way to run your world in safe mode? (asked by Gh0stt) A: Add ?safemode=1 to the URL (answered by ash)\nQ: Worlds on ipfs?! (asked by .hyp shaman) A: Just the assets for now (answered by Gh0stt)\nQ: How to set a vector3 in the config options? (asked by Gh0stt) A: Probably need to parse it yourself, and use a string or number type (answered by Shiffty)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"ðŸ’»â”‚developers\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy development, with several key technical discussions. Docker image optimization was a significant topic, with HPrivakos explaining the benefits of using Alpine-based images over Debian to reduce size by 1GB (saving ~15 cents per month per instance). The chat revealed that pre-built Docker images are available at `ghcr.io/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy` with tags for dev, main, and version releases.\n\nSeveral developers shared progress on game mechanics, particularly drdoge.eth's work on a jet flight system with weapons, camera angles, and spatial audio. There were discussions about networking APIs, with Ashxn clarifying the differences between app.emit(), world.on(), app.on(), and app.send() methods for event handling.\n\nUI development was discussed, including a fix for a black screen bug when clicking the âš¡ button (caused by incorrect \"this.world\" reference). Developers also explored image display capabilities, with discussions about UIImage components and texture encoding issues.\n\nOther topics included self-hosting options (Coolify, CasaOS, Umbrel), hardware recommendations for servers, and integration with blockchain technologies (particularly Solana NFTs). The community showed strong collaboration, with developers sharing code, helping with bugs, and creating reusable components like an attachable anchor system.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why use Alpine instead of Debian for Docker images? (asked by HPrivakos) A: The Debian node image adds an unnecessary 1GB to the Docker image, costing ~15 cents per month per instance and requiring larger downloads (answered by HPrivakos)\nQ: What Docker images are available for Hyperfy? (asked by ~/HowiEDuhzit) A: Pre-built images are hosted on GitHub: ghcr.io/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy with tags for dev, main, and version releases (answered by HPrivakos)\nQ: What does the commit_hash environment variable do? (asked by ~/HowiEDuhzit) A: It's used for the /status endpoint to show which version a server is running (answered by HPrivakos)\nQ: How can I access default player emote GLBs in code for NPCs? (asked by ~/HowiEDuhzit) A: Use the correct asset URL, e.g., asset://emote-float.glb (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What's the difference between app.emit(), world.on(), app.on(), and app.send()? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: app.emit() sends events to the world, world.on() listens for world events, app.on() listens for app-specific events, app.send() sends events to the same app on other clients/server (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there an easy way to bring images into V2 like in V1? (asked by fractilians) A: Not yet directly, but you can texture a plane in Blender or use the undocumented UIImage component (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What's the shortcut to see all items in a world? (asked by fractilians) A: Click the Hyperfy logo in the corner next to the chat/gear icon (answered by MayD524)\nQ: How do I drop an item after picking it up? (asked by fractilians) A: Press Q (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

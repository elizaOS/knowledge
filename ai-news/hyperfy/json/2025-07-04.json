General hyper shares experience with Flask/Quart backends combined with Postgres, Cloudflare, and Redis, noting the initial learning curve but reusability for future projects. They strongly advocate for Cloudflare Workers, suggesting to use them for as many tasks as possible due to their ease of use, GPT compatibility, and free hosting options for clients. General hyper mentions using Quart with Docker on Digital Ocean but finds themselves creating new Cloudflare Workers more frequently than adding routes to existing applications. They also recommend using Cloudflare's S2 buckets as a CDN for web assets to improve loading performance. HiroP acknowledges following a similar development path and expresses appreciation for Cloudflare's services, particularly their tunnels and domain management, while recognizing they should more fully embrace Cloudflare Workers.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in ü™ô‚îÇhyper Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThis Discord chat segment shows limited technical discussion in the Hyperfy community. The conversation primarily revolves around token holdings, market concerns, and the project's development philosophy. Ashxn (likely a team member) mentions holding 14M unlocked tokens and indicates the possibility of embodied AI agents trading in Hyperfy worlds in the future. PabloFM from Numinia explains they develop https://numen.games/ and contribute to improving the Hyperfy engine with open-source work. The community appears concerned about token value while team members emphasize the importance of methodical building over rushed marketing. There's a philosophical discussion about building a true interoperable metaverse that requires patience and proper execution rather than rushing to meet market cycles. The chat suggests Hyperfy is positioning itself as an AI-enabled metaverse platform with a focus on quality development over short-term market performance.\n\n## 2.

Jin mentions a 3D model that another user (referenced by ID 415262868217266177) worked on, describing it as \"real magic\" compared to Jin's \"amateur\" attempts. Jin shares a Twitter link to what appears to be a 3D model and suggests it could be used as an arena for hosting AI agent trading competitions or leaderboards. However, Jin notes they lack a good web dashboard to visualize agent logs. Another user (.hyp shaman) makes a brief technical observation about the model having \"2 uvs.\" Maximus recommends a tool called Recall for agent competitions, describing it as a \"solid team\" working on \"distributed data and trust models.\" The conversation is brief with limited technical depth or problem-solving.\n\n## 2.

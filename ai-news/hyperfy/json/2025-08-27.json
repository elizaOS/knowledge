      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe chat primarily revolves around physics-based interactions in Hyperfy worlds and AI-generated content. Gert-Jan Akerboom demonstrated physics implementation with a clickable chicken that falls apart. This sparked discussion about potential game mechanics, including shooting mechanics for hunting AI-generated creatures. The conversation also covered networking issues, with vox experiencing connection problems that were resolved by switching to 5G. Ash explained that Hyperfy doesn't implement auto-reconnect because the networking is based on initial state snapshots with delta updates, making reconnection equivalent to refreshing. The developers showcased collaborative creation in the \"playworld\" where multiple people contributed to a dragon with fire and flight capabilities without writing traditional code. Ash also mentioned creating a networked flash memory game in the \"vibe world\" using prompts.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there a reason for not having an auto reconnect in Hyperfy? (asked by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host) A: Auto reconnect is the same as refreshing. Since all networking is based on an initial snapshot of state and then delta updates, the only way to resume from a disconnect is to restart essentially. (answered by ash)\nQ: Where are the servers located? (asked by vox) A: France (looking to get other servers to provide options to people to host elsewhere) (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: How you do the edits? (asked by Gh0stt) A: `/edit an edit` (answered by .hyp shaman)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions:\nHelper: ash | Helpee: vox | Context: vox experiencing connection issues in Hyperfy | Resolution: Suggested trying 5G network which resolved the issue\nHelper: Gert-Jan Akerboom | Helpee: Xukonth | Context: Request for FPS games in Hyperfy | Resolution: Pointed to shooting dragons in the playworld as an existing implementation\n\n## 4. Action Items:\nType: Feature | Description: Create a gun to hunt AI-generated creatures with physics-based weak points | Mentioned By: Gert-Jan Akerboom\nType: Feature | Description: Add ability to include prompts in code for easier editing of moving objects in vibe world | Mentioned By: Gert-Jan Akerboom\nType: Feature | Description: Convert DCL shooting games to Hyperfy | Mentioned By: Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz\nType: Feature | Description: FPS game implementation in Hyperfy | Mentioned By: Xukonth\nType: Technical | Description: Add server options in different locations beyond France | Mentioned By: HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host",

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around AI capabilities in Hyperfy, particularly in world creation and object generation. Users discussed the quality of AI-generated content, with specific mention of Star Wars AT-T models created in \"vibe world.\" There was notable discussion about GPT-5's superior performance for 3D asset creation despite its slower processing speed. Users also explored the possibility of restricting AI capabilities through system prompts for world owners, allowing them to enforce themed objects or disable certain functionalities. Some interest was expressed in integrating alternative AI models like Kimi K2 or DeepSeek 3.1 from Comput3, with ash pointing to the relevant GitHub file for custom AI integration. The conversation indicates an active community experimenting with AI capabilities within the Hyperfy platform.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Does this have any effect? (asked by cloudAI) A: Unanswered\nQ: When can the ai make actual gameplay in there, and give me rare nfts (asked by johan) A: Unanswered\nQ: Who made the star wars ATT stuff in vibe world? (asked by ash) A: I did the star wars stuff. Was testing out different ais. GPT 5 was best by a fair margin for me. (answered by Dhin)\nQ: What reasoning level did you use? (asked by ash) A: High reasoning (answered by Dhin)\nQ: Can we already plug in kimi k2 or deepseek 3.1 from comput3? (asked by Reneil) A: Not built in but its easy to add your own at the bottom of this file: https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy/blob/dev/src/core/systems/ServerAI.js (answered by ash)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Reneil | Context: Asking about integrating alternative AI models like Kimi K2 or DeepSeek 3.1 | Resolution: Provided GitHub file link for custom AI integration and mentioned Comput3 integration might need updating\nHelper: Dhin | Helpee: ash | Context: Inquiry about Star Wars AT-T models in vibe world | Resolution: Explained they created the content using GPT-5 with high reasoning level and multiple iterations\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Potentially update the Comput3 AI integration in the ServerAI.js file | Description: The integration may need updating according to ash | Mentioned By: ash\nFeature: System prompts for world owners to restrict AI capabilities | Description: Allow world owners to restrict what AI can create, enforce themed objects, or disable certain functionalities | Mentioned By: ash\nFeature: Integration of alternative AI models | Description: Add support for Kimi K2 and DeepSeek 3.1 from Comput3 | Mentioned By: Reneil",

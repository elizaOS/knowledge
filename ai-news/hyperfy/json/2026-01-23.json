Summary\nThe discussion centers around Hyperfy's transition from v1 to v2, with significant focus on improving onboarding and accessibility. Jin announced developing a v1 to v2 conversion pipeline, initially requiring Blender but later streamlined to direct conversion. This tool aims to help world owners migrate their content to v2. Several members highlighted the need for better onboarding resources, including starter templates with pre-installed apps from v1. Ash acknowledged these concerns, noting the challenge of balancing ease-of-use with user ownership of worlds. Jin also suggested improving developer experience through better documentation, including creating LLM-friendly documentation and making app repositories more accessible. The community discussed the importance of having v1 apps available in v2 to provide users with a foundation rather than starting with empty worlds. Jin requested that Ash upload a GitHub repository with reference apps to improve discoverability and LLM training capabilities.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the utility of the hyper token? (asked by Asik) A: Unanswered\nQ: What's the difference between v1 and v2, if hyperfy.io gets shutdown why would the token remains relevant? (asked by rando1337) A: Unanswered\nQ: Does v2 have draco / meshopt / EXT_mesh_gpu_instancing gltf extension support? (asked by jin) A: None of those! Ultra simple. Webp textures go a long way.

Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on sprites.dev, a cloud VM service created by fly.io designed for AI agents but being repurposed for Hyperfy deployments. Ash reported successfully running Hyperfy on sprites.dev in just 3 minutes, noting it's easier to use than fly.io. Key advantages mentioned include hibernation when not in use (reducing costs), and potential cost-effectiveness for intermittent usage patterns typical of Hyperfy worlds. Ash is working on documentation and backup/restore functionality to enable local backups. The conversation also touched on a new webviews feature in development (PR #147) contributed by Saori. Additionally, there was a brief discussion about \"hyper scape,\" which was clarified to be a modified fork of Hyperfy.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is sprites.dev? (asked by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓) A: It's made by fly.io, meant for giving AI agents a VM in the cloud to work in, but it's easier to work with than fly.io (answered by ash)\nQ: Does the hyper scape thing Shaw's making have anything to do with hyperfy or just similar naming? (asked by general hyper) A: It's built off Hyperfy / It's a modified fork of Hyperfy (answered by 𝕽𝖔𝖚𝖘𝖙𝖆𝖓 and Jayzen)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on character locomotion improvements in Hyperfy. Ashxn proposed changing the directional movement to be locked forward (strafe-based), similar to Fortnite/UE, where players always face the camera direction. Benefits include: better VR/first-person support, improved handling of guns/tools, and better overall feel. The only drawback is potentially losing the casual/social feel of the current system. \n\nAshxn implemented a prototype that maintains the ability to view VRMs while adding strafe-based movement, sharing a video demonstration. The implementation was pushed to the play.hyperfy.xyz environment for community testing and feedback. By the end of the conversation, first-person mode was successfully implemented.\n\nOther technical topics included mobile UI improvements (making buttons less intrusive), skybox rotation implementation, and fog effects. A rendering issue with \"the Grid\" mist behavior was identified but the cause remained unclear. There was also a brief question about importing assets from another platform into Hyperfy.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to import assets from another platform's HTML code and GLB files into Hyperfy? (asked by samgittis.eth) A: Unanswered (though .hyp shaman indicated they would need to see the specific content first)\nQ: Could skybox rotation be a configurable setting?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"⚡│general\"\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around users testing Hyperfy on mobile devices and sharing experiences with avatars. BallisticBanana reported issues opening Hyperfy on an iPhone 14 Pro, while Ashxn noted it works fine on an older iPhone 12 Pro, suggesting it might be a device-specific or settings issue rather than a platform limitation. Fibelius tested old avatar files in Hyperfy, noting quality differences between various VRM files - VOYAGERS looked good while CloneX (1.5MB VRM) had poor quality. Fibelius mentioned using RTFKT Clone VRM converter and Blender optimization tools to improve avatar quality. The conversation also touched on Fibelius's transition from avatar creation to mushroom farming, drawing parallels between the two as artisanal businesses. The chat included sharing of various Twitter/X posts related to Hyperfy and warnings about potential scammers targeting the community.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why doesn't Hyperfy open on my iPhone 14 Pro? (asked by BallisticBanana) A: It might be a memory issue or settings problem, as it runs fine on older iPhone 12 Pro (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Why do VOYAGERS avatars look better than CloneX in Hyperfy? (asked by Fibelius) A: Because the VOYAGERS were more optimized (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: Pls help with CA (asked by Lambheart) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Users briefly discussed the Hyperfy website, with one user mentioning that hyperfy.xyz is the current site, replacing an older, more detailed version at hyperfy.io. A community member noted that the new site contains more relevant information including a litepaper, and emphasized the importance of communicating that v1 is now considered legacy (\"we had ps1, now we are on ps2\"). There was some discussion about exchange listings and token price, with one user asking about exchange listings and BTC/ETH price correlation. Another user reported an issue with Dexscreener showing incorrect purchase amounts. The conversation included some negative sentiment and skepticism about the project and community.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for ðŸ’»â”‚developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary:\nThe discussion primarily focused on character locomotion improvements in Hyperfy. Ashxn proposed changing the directional movement to be locked forward (strafe-based), similar to Fortnite/UE, with benefits for VR, first-person view, and tool handling. The team implemented and tested this new locomotion system in the play world, allowing players to maintain camera direction while moving. They also added first-person capability and discussed UI improvements for mobile, particularly making the top-left buttons less intrusive. Other technical topics included skybox rotation implementation, fog effects, and mist behavior issues in \"the Grid\" environment. The conversation demonstrated rapid iteration with immediate implementation and testing of the locomotion changes, showing Hyperfy's agile development approach.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is there a way to import assets from another platform's HTML into Hyperfy? (asked by samgittis.eth) A: Unanswered\nQ: Could the directional movement be a design option of the world? (asked by PabloFM | Numinia) A: Unanswered\nQ: Could there be a speed setting for skybox rotation? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"âš¡â”‚general\"\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around users testing Hyperfy on different devices and discussing avatar compatibility. BallisticBanana reported issues opening Hyperfy on their iPhone 14 Pro, while Ashxn noted it works fine on an older iPhone 12 Pro, suggesting it might be a device-specific or settings issue rather than an age/budget constraint. Fibelius shared experiences testing older avatar files in Hyperfy, particularly mentioning CloneX VRM files, RTFKT Clone converter tools, and comparing VOIDS and VOYAGERS avatars. They noted that VOYAGERS looked better due to better optimization. Fibelius also mentioned returning to these tools after 2+ years, having previously received CloneX file sets from ZaidKirdsey to learn avatar creation before switching to mushroom farming. The chat also included brief mentions of scam warnings and requests for community support on social media posts.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why doesn't Hyperfy open on my iPhone 14 Pro? (asked by BallisticBanana) A: It might be a memory issue, though it's surprising for a newer phone. It runs fine on iPhone 12 Pro, so it could be a settings issue. Apple doesn't provide detailed error information for debugging. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How do older avatar files perform in Hyperfy? (asked by Fibelius) A: VOYAGERS look better than basic VRM files because they were more optimized. (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: Pls help with CA (asked by Lambheart) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: BallisticBanana | Context: Hyperfy not opening on iPhone 14 Pro | Resolution: Suggested it might be a memory or settings issue, recommended trying different browsers\nHelper: .hyp shaman | Helpee: Fibelius | Context: Why VOYAGERS avatars look better than other models | Resolution: Explained that VOYAGERS were more optimized than other avatar models\nHelper: .hyp shaman | Helpee: All users | Context: Warning about increased scam attempts | Resolution: Advised \"ALWAYS READ BEFORE CLICKING ON SHIT\" to avoid scams\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Investigate compatibility issues with Hyperfy on newer iPhones | Description: Debug why Hyperfy fails on iPhone 14 Pro but works on older models | Mentioned By: BallisticBanana\nTechnical: Improve error reporting for iOS devices | Description: Apple doesn't provide detailed error information, making debugging difficult | Mentioned By: Ashxn\nDocumentation: Create guidelines for avatar optimization | Description: Different avatar models perform differently based on optimization level | Mentioned By: Fibelius",

Most exchanges are brief and some contain dismissive or negative comments toward other users.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: We need a website like hyperfy.io, boss (asked by Xukonth) A: pretty sure its wip, url is hyperfy.xyz (answered by .hyp shaman)\nQ: I really want to know if HYPER has been listed on any exchanges, and whether it is affected by the price movements of BTC and ETH. (asked by haihui) A: Only affected really if they become a liquidity suck. Sol doesn't even really move the price much (answered by general hyper)\n\n## 3.

Ashxn shared insights about a new render pipeline that offers significant performance improvements through occlusion culling, which prevents rendering of objects that aren't visible to the camera. This optimization enables better performance for complex scenes like cities, particularly on VR and mobile devices. The trade-off is increased CPU usage, which is beneficial only when many objects are occluded. The developers also discussed LOD (Level of Detail) improvements, with plans to optimize LOD logic to only process visible objects. Other topics included a cruiser implementation by b0gie, screen sharing functionality, and voice chat integration using LiveKit. Several users discussed setting up their own worlds with the necessary environment variables for LiveKit integration.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Is voice chat still in development? (asked by Mugenomics) A: We've had voice chat for months. Can try it out in Fallen or the Play world. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Can the new rendering features be used with the free tier? (asked by Gert-Jan Akerboom) A: Yes, we currently only use a free tier for all of our worlds. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What are the chances we can do cull by distance in a hyp? (asked by MetaRick) A: You can already do this in Blender using LODs with a max distance to match your fog. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is the screen share screen available as a hyp? (asked by Mugenomics) A: Yes, it's a .hyp (answered by b0gie)\n\n## 3.

Ashxn mentions working with splatmaps in Blender, noting they're difficult to set up, and suggests potentially streaming a tutorial to demonstrate the workflow. There's brief discussion about vehicle capabilities in v2 of an unnamed system, specifically that cars with guns weren't possible in v1 but are now feasible in v2. The chat also includes a security warning about scammers cloning profiles and sending friend requests, plus several greeting exchanges and meme/GIF sharing. Overall, this segment contains very limited technical content with no major decisions or problem-solving activities documented.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are there cars with guns? (asked by jin) A: No but there could be. That's something we couldn't do in v1, but totally can in v2 (answered by Ashxn) and Yes. Networked too. We also have just guns. You can put them on your cars. (answered by ~/drdoge.eth)\nQ: Would F117 nighthawk work? (asked by maximus) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: MetaRick | Helpee: Community | Context: Warning about scammers cloning community members' profiles and sending friend requests | Resolution: Raised awareness to be careful of suspicious messages\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Implement cars with guns feature in v2 | Description: Adding weaponized vehicles that wasn't possible in v1 | Mentioned By: Ashxn\nDocumentation: Create tutorial for splatmap workflow in Blender | Description: Stream or document the complex process of setting up splatmaps | Mentioned By: Ashxn",

Community members express disappointment about its disappearance despite significant development work. There's discussion about the challenges of entrepreneurship in the space, with mentions of \"token extractors\" and impatient community members potentially contributing to Upstreet's demise. \n\nA brief technical discussion emerges about potentially recreating Upstreet-like functionality on Hyperfy, with Agent12 suggesting it would be possible with a special fork of Hyperfy and noting that the recent addition of occlusion colliders could enable the \"Plot Loading\" effect from Upstreet, though MetaMask sign-in functionality isn't yet available. \n\nThe chat also includes a request for 3D asset optimization artists, with b0gie offering assistance.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Would it be possible to do anything similar to Upstreet on Hyperfy? (asked by zzzzzzzzzzz) A: Might need to be a Special Fork of Hyper But i'd say ANYTHING is possible with Hyperfy. With the addtion of Occlusion colliders I think you'd be able to get the \"Plot Loading\" effect of Upstreet. Just not the Meta-Mask sign in just yet... (answered by Agent12)\nQ: Does anyone have recs for 3d asset optimization artists? (asked by DefiniteOptimist) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ᲼~/^b0gie-(.*)$/ | Helpee: DefiniteOptimist | Context: DefiniteOptimist needed 3D asset optimization services | Resolution: b0gie offered to help and requested a DM to discuss quotes for optimizing assets\n\n## 4.

The conversation revolves around a LinkedIn post shared by maximus that compiled \"good\" agentic papers. hiroP mentions using NotebookLM to create a 20-minute audio summary of these papers, suggesting this as a more convenient way to consume the content. maximus acknowledges the usefulness of NotebookLM (referred to as \"LM\") but notes the overly enthusiastic tone of its output. hiroP responds with a humorous prompt suggestion to make the AI's tone less enthusiastic, comparing it to BBC Radio 4's more reserved style.\n\n## 2.

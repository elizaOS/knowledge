      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThis Discord chat in the \"⚡│general\" channel contains minimal technical discussion. The conversation primarily consists of greetings (\"gm\" messages), casual banter, and questions about external platforms like Warpcast/Farcaster. One user (yung_algorithm) asked about avatar implementation in Hyperfy worlds, specifically about automatically setting characters/avatars for people joining a world and handling a crashing issue in their code. There was also a brief mention of running Eliza locally and questions about an airdrop. The chat includes references to Hyperfy potentially working with Unreal Engine, though this appears speculative rather than confirmed technical information.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Anyone has an invite code for warpcast? (asked by miguel_amargo) A: You don't need an invitation, it's open just sign up. Make sure you have a lens profile.

(asked by Boosh) A: Unanswered\nQ: Anyone can point me to the best practice for automatically setting characters/avatars for ppl who join ur world? (asked by yung_algorithm) A: Loading people in a room with avatar options, and usually an avatar bot that explains the world (answered by maximus)\nQ: How do I like, reset the world state? (asked by yung_algorithm) A: Check #dev-help channel to see if someone has had that issue before (answered by maximus)\nQ: When does reg end?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains two main technical discussions. First, a user named saltï inquires about embedding a Hyperfy world (NFT) directly into their own application domain rather than accessing it through hyperfy.io. Ashxn responds that while unofficial methods exist for v1, an upcoming announcement might address this need more directly. Second, yung_algorithm reports an issue where they can't access their world after uploading code containing Math.random, which appears to have broken their world's functionality. They attempted to fix it by re-uploading with the problematic code removed but remain unable to access the world. Maximus notes that Ashxn operates in a different timezone and would likely respond later.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can I bring my Hyperfy world (NFT) into my app so it loads at my domain instead of hyperfy.io? (asked by saltï) A: There are unofficial ways to do this with v1, and an upcoming announcement might address this need (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can I troubleshoot being unable to access my world after uploading broken code with Math.random? (asked by yung_algorithm) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Maximus | Helpee: yung_algorithm | Context: User was waiting for assistance with broken world access | Resolution: Informed that Ashxn operates in a different timezone and would respond in 3-5 hours\n\n## 4. Action Items\nTechnical: Fix access issue for world \"playnouns\" after broken code upload | Description: Troubleshoot inability to access world after uploading code with Math.random | Mentioned By: yung_algorithm\nFeature: Enable embedding Hyperfy worlds in external applications | Description: Allow worlds to be loaded directly on custom domains while maintaining wallet integration | Mentioned By: saltï",

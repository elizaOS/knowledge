      "summary": "# Analysis of 🧊│3d-design Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief technical discussion about loading 3D models from remote URLs in what appears to be a Blender-related project or framework. User \"ash\" shared code for an experimental method to load 3D models from remote URLs using a JavaScript function. The discussion indicates that while this feature exists, it's not well-documented because it's considered a niche use case. There was also mention of version changes in Blender causing confusion for users, with one user considering reverting to an older version. The conversation suggests that certain features may have been moved between versions (v1 and v2), causing workflow disruptions for some users.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to load 3D models from a remote URL? (implied by context) A: Yes, there is an experimental way using world.load('model', 'https://...glb').then(root => { app.add(root) }) (answered by ash)\nQ: Is the remote model loading feature stable? (implied by TheMattEmpire) A: Yes, it's quite stable and not likely to change, just not documented because it's a niche use case (answered by ash)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on development updates and technical assistance. 3rdEyeVisuals shared progress on a Debug Dashboard and Hyp Bundler, mentioning successful generation of a .hyp bundle that was brought in-world as an app. They also inquired about UI resolution improvements and discussed 3D model generators, expressing plans to set up a pipeline for local inference using the Hunyuan model for in-world 3D asset generation. Fredm sought help with VRM file uploading issues in Hyperfy 1, to which ash responded with a suggestion to use online VRM validator tools. 🆂🅴🅱🅶🅰 announced the creation of an NFT Holder Scanner tool that tracks NFT holders across Ethereum, Polygon, and Optimism networks, requiring only a contract address and Alchemy API key.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there an effective way to increase UI resolution? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: Unanswered\nQ: Have you effed around with actual open source 3d model generators? Or are you just using API keys to some of the more popular closed models? (asked by 3rdEyeVisuals) A: i played around with a bunch of both open source and closed source ones. (answered by ash)\nQ: Any idea how to fix that? [VRM upload error] (asked by Fredm) A: could be anything hehe. there are a few vrm validator/tester tools online, maybe try something like this: https://vrm-validator.fern.solutions/ (answered by ash)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: ash | Helpee: Fredm | Context: Error when uploading VRM file exported with Blender extension to Hyperfy 1 | Resolution: Suggested using online VRM validator tools and provided a specific link to vrm-validator.fern.solutions\n\n## 4.

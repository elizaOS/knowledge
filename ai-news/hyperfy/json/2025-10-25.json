      "summary": "The chat segment is very brief with minimal technical content. Users briefly discussed confusion with a new version of Blender, with one user suggesting reverting to an older version due to interface changes. Another user mentioned something about \"v1\" having a feature and believing \"ash\" moved it to \"v2\", though the context is unclear. The conversation lacks detailed technical discussion or problem-solving.",

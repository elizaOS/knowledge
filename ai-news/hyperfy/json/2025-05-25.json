      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers\n\n## 1. Summary\nAshxn shared significant progress on a new rendering approach for Hyperfy that uses octree traversal to dramatically improve performance. By implementing frustum culling and occlusion culling, the system can efficiently handle scenes with hundreds of thousands of objects by skipping objects outside the camera view or hidden behind other objects. This approach allows for much better performance than ThreeJS's naive renderer, especially for mobile and VR. Ashxn demonstrated a scene with 210,000 unique objects running at just 1ms for CPU and GPU when not rendering all objects simultaneously. The team discussed potential applications including world-to-world connections, guild/faction systems, and transportation between worlds. Carlosmu shared progress on migrating a building from Decentraland to Hyperfy v1, and Lastraum discussed implementing web3 authentication with NFT verification for admin rights. The developers also touched on UI improvements, mobile controls, and cross-world connectivity features.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What would such performance improvement look like? (asked by Jayzen) A: It would be much more closely aligned with unity and unreal games, allowing web-based virtual worlds with a quarter million unique objects to run on mobile/VR (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What about other web inherent limitations like websocket instead of udp? (asked by Jayzen) A: We use websockets and it does pretty well. There's also WebRTC for near-UDP networking, and WebTransport which is meant to offer UDP-like capabilities (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How does the occlusion culling work with objects? (asked by maximus) A: ThreeJS only checks if objects are in the camera frustum, but with occlusion culling we can skip everything outside the frustum and render inside the frustum from front to back, skipping occluded objects (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to add glow effect in hyp-v1? (asked by carlosmu) A: Increase the emissive strength in blender and adjust the colors there (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there any way to add a tutorial in hyp-v1? (asked by carlosmu) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is it possible to change some contents depending on the device? (asked by carlosmu) A: v2 lets you do custom UI in hyperscript, v1 doesn't have this (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What is the utility of the hand button below the arrow? (asked by carlosmu) A: That's the interaction button if someone needs to click on something to trigger it (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in 🎨│showcase Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief exchange about a notification system component for a platform (likely a virtual world or game environment). User Lastraum shared a notification component that auto-scales to zero (meaning it doesn't display in the world when not in use). The component can be triggered with a simple API call: `app.emit('nots', {message:\"hello world\"})`. The notification system accepts several parameters: a required message string, and optional parameters for color, fontSize, and timer. Maximus responded that while there are many versions and duplicates of components in the ecosystem, he wasn't aware of a standalone notification app specifically, suggesting this contribution adds value. Maximus also mentioned that better versioning and tracking would come once marketplaces have \"full uptake.\"\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there already a standalone notification app? (asked by Lastraum - theforgecore.xyz) A: No, there are many UIs for worlds but not a standalone notification app that I'm aware of. (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3.

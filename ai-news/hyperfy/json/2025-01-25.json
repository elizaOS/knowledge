      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"💻│developers\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\n\nThe chat revolves around Hyperfy V2 development, focusing on technical implementations and problem-solving. Key discussions include:\n\nPhysics and collision systems were a major focus, with Ashxn fixing issues with trimesh colliders and implementing teleportation. A significant bug with mesh colliders was resolved after extensive debugging.\n\nUI components received attention with the implementation of UIDropdown, UIImage, and fixing issues with file input fields. A breaking change in UI mounting caused inspection windows to crash, which was later fixed.\n\nSeveral developers worked on networked applications, particularly a soccer game with client-authoritative ball physics. The chat explored how apps can communicate through events, with peezy implementing global events and single-player events.\n\nDevelopers shared code examples for various features including sky/HDR switching between day/night modes, UV texture scrolling for animations, and chat command handling. The community actively shared implementations and helped debug issues.\n\nDocumentation efforts were discussed, with several members contributing to clarify concepts like the entity hierarchy (World → Entities → Apps → Nodes → Subnodes) and creating getting-started guides.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Hyperfy's world-building features, infrastructure discussions, and community dynamics. Technical discussions focused on several key areas:\n\nGrid snapping functionality was discussed as an upcoming feature, with Ashxn confirming it would allow apps to configure their own snap sizes. Community members compared this to other platforms like Rhino and UE, suggesting toggles for different snapping types and alignment tools.\n\nInfrastructure hosting emerged as a significant topic, with discussions about self-hosting Hyperfy worlds versus using third-party services. This led to a debate about IP usage when HPrivakos' service initially named \"hyperfy.host\" was questioned, prompting a name change to \"hyperworld.host\" to avoid confusion.\n\nTechnical limitations were addressed, including file size limits for .glb uploads (approximately 12-16MB) and troubleshooting issues with drag-and-drop functionality. Community members also discussed the potential for third-party add-ons to enhance world-building capabilities.\n\nA community-driven initiative to create a \"starred\" message system for helpful technical solutions was proposed, with HPrivakos offering to build a Discord bot to implement this feature.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the file size limit for uploading .glb files? (asked by localhost) A: The default size limit on local install is 16MB, possibly even 12MB. You need to update your env for max upload size. (answered by merk and MetaMike)\nQ: Is it a browser issue if you drag .glb into a v2 world and nothing happens? (asked by localhost) A: It could be related to file size limits or specific glb issues. Try running it locally to test. (answered by merk)\nQ: What is the recommended hosting platform for installing your own instance of Hyperfy v2? (asked by MetaverseBuilder) A: You can use any VPS provider such as Digital Ocean or Hetzner, or use services like hyperworld.host (formerly hyperfy.host). (answered by HPrivakos)\nQ: Does anyone know which agents have 3D avatars ready in Hyperfy? (asked by syGMatMATTIOBOY 🇦🇺) A: Not many do, but those that have a VRM file associated with them can be used in Hyperfy. (answered by MetaMike)\nQ: If I published a VRM file for agent on Claude is it useful for me to post the link somewhere? (asked by Natefrog) A: Just drag and drop it into any world at hyperfy.io to test if it works. (answered by MetaMike)\nQ: How do I buy/create a world on Hyperfy?

      "summary": "# Analysis of 🧊│3d-design Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on 3D colliders and physics implementation in Hyperfy. A key technical issue involved colliders generating multiple meshes when materials are attached to them, causing performance problems. The solution identified was that the engine's glbToNodes.js automatically fixes colliders by switching to bufferGeo. The chat also covered a collaborative game development project called \"Hyperball,\" with discussions about stadium design, game mechanics, and team organization. Several users shared their experiences with the physics engine's impressive performance, noting the ability to stack numerous buildings with colliders without performance degradation. Other technical topics included UV animation for banners (using material name suffixes like \"sample_uvscroll_0.1.0.0\"), VRM model editing challenges, and proper collider setup in Blender requiring proper face orientation and custom properties.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What happens if you add 2 materials to a chair and then run the same thing? Does the collider it generates still have 2 materials? (asked by Ashxn) A: Yes, the collider retains all materials, creating multiple colliders (10 for one chair) which is problematic (answered by ᲼)\nQ: How can animated UVOffset be done for banners in V1? (asked by TheMattEmpire) A: Add a suffix to the material name, for example: sample_uvscroll_0.1.0.0 (answered by 𝚟𝚘𝚡𝚟𝚒𝚎𝚗𝚗𝚎)\nQ: Any idea why I can go through walls despite adding a rigidbody in Blender? (asked by DevStarlight | Numinia) A: Check normals and face orientation; need to create an empty with custom property node=rigidbody, add building mesh with node=collider and type=static (answered by hiroP)\nQ: Is type=static always required for colliders? (asked by Valiant) A: Not always required as 'static' is default (answered by Valiant)\nQ: How is it possible to stack numerous buildings with collisions without performance overhead? (asked by PurpleSack) A: It's \"magic\" in the engine code that's now open source (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3.

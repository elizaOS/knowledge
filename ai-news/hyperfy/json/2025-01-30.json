A significant issue was identified by peezy regarding a Buffer-related error in the client caused by the `missingGlobal('buffer')` call in physx-js-webidl.js, which was resolved by removing this warning code. Developers discussed UI improvements for the builder interface, including transform controls, copy/paste functionality, and lock buttons. There was extensive discussion about adding features like anchors, audio support, and emotes to make the platform more accessible to non-technical users. The chat also covered EVM chain integration with Hyperfy, with peezy sharing a fork that provides wagmi integration. Developers discussed AI agent integration possibilities, including voice capabilities and multi-agent simulations. Several PRs were mentioned, including UI improvements to the InspectPane with features like sliding value editors and transform reset buttons. The community showed interest in expanding Hyperfy to different platforms like Steam Deck and even PlayStation consoles.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is causing the client to crash with a Buffer-related error? (asked by peezy) A: The `missingGlobal('buffer')` call in physx-js-webidl.js is causing the issue, and removing it fixes the problem. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: How can I connect EVM chains to Hyperfy? (asked by Omka) A: Use peezy's EVM fork which provides wagmi integration: https://github.com/peezy/hyperfy/tree/evm_dev (answered by peezy)\nQ: How do you access wagmi actions in the EVM fork? (asked by Omka) A: Use `const {actions, utils} = world.getEvm()` to get all actions from wagmi. (answered by peezy)\nQ: Why does the build script have exit(1) instead of exit(0)? (asked by HPrivakos) A: It was added because the process kept running after an `npm run build`, so it could be changed to anything. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: What would be a better way to run Hyperfy on Steam Deck? (asked by MetaRick) A: A wrapper application would be the best approach since Steam Deck is essentially a custom Linux box. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Will agents be able to have speech-to-text mode?

      "summary": "# Analysis of Hyperfy Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around discussions of the HYPER token's price decline, which has dropped significantly (approximately 93.5% from ATH). Despite the price action, the development team emphasizes they're actively building and haven't sold their tokens. The project appears to be a metaverse/virtual world platform with AI integration capabilities. Team members like Saori and Ashxn frequently reassure the community about ongoing development work, pointing to GitHub commits as evidence. There are discussions about V2 of the platform being available for developers, with hosting options through hyperworld.host. Community members debate whether the price decline is due to market-wide conditions or project-specific issues. Several users express continued faith in the technology despite price concerns, with some buying additional tokens during the dip. The token is intended to function as a DAO governance token and for purchasing in-world items and add-ons not included in the open-source version.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the purpose of the HYPER token? (asked by jingo) A: Will be a DAO token once DAO is setup, used to purchase in-world items for team/community made games, and to buy addons not included in the open source GitHub (answered by jar0d)\nQ: Is $HYPER an SPL token?

Summary:\nThe chat primarily focused on 360-degree video implementation in virtual environments, 3D architecture for metaverse projects, and model optimization. MetaRick shared a 360 video sphere implementation in Hyperfy, explaining it was created using VRChat with render textures and cameras. He provided the sphere asset for others to use, noting that stereo 360 would need additional work. Valiant shared a 3D model of an \"Alien Giraffe Spider\" (3k tris, 520kb) with rigidbody node included, suggesting it could be used for NPC monsters in an arena. A professional architect named vlad joined the community, sharing examples of his architectural work and expressing interest in metaverse architecture. The community discussed optimization requirements for Hyperfy worlds, with maximus sharing a community-created optimization guide. There was also discussion about modular building systems and the differences between real and virtual architecture.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: How is the Sphere bound to the user and do others have their own sphere that's locked to them? (asked by maximus) A: Yeah just one big sphere shared by everyone. (answered by MetaRick)\nQ: How did you create the 360 video since that looks like a hyperfy environment? (asked by maximus) A: I made that in VRChat, its an avatar that uses a bunch of render textures and cameras so when equipped in 2D mode it takes over the stream as a 360 pano. (answered by MetaRick)\nQ: What is the name of that app? (asked by djrabbit) A: I'm pretty sure this is the mod/app https://youtu.be/zlFxvIg0GBA?feature=shared UEVR (answered by maximus)\nQ: Can you please advice any channels/chats with metaverse builders focus on architecture?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: 🤖│agents\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion centers on Docker image optimization and agent architecture for embodied AI systems. HPrivakos highlights the significant size difference between Hyperfy (400MB) and Eliza (5GB) Docker images, explaining how they reduced size by switching from Debian/Ubuntu to Alpine Linux. The conversation reveals that Eliza's bloat comes from bundling hundreds of plugins by default, similar to \"Minecraft shipped with all existing mods.\" \n\nThe technical discussion shifts to agent implementation challenges, particularly latency issues in real-time environments. Participants debate approaches to creating responsive embodied agents, with peezy suggesting pre-computing responses and using Goal Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) from game AI. Saori proposes client-side prediction techniques similar to those used in networked games to handle LLM response delays. The group agrees that combining traditional game AI techniques with LLMs would yield better results than pure LLM approaches, especially for real-time interactions.\n\nThe conversation concludes with reflections on Eliza's actual technical achievements versus market hype, noting its JavaScript implementation and Twitter scraper infrastructure as key innovations.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What increases the size of a Docker image? (asked by devilsadvocate.sol) A: A Docker image is built in layers, each installation or file embedding increases size. Switching from Debian/Ubuntu to Alpine Linux reduces size significantly. (answered by HPrivakos)\nQ: Why does Eliza require 8GB of RAM? (asked by HPrivakos) A: It's likely due to plugin bloat and possibly local embedding for memories. (answered by peezy)\nQ: Should Hyperfy have its own agent system?

HypPrivakos submitted a PR (#21) that reduces the Docker image size by approximately 70% and implements automated builds for main and dev branches. The PR also adds COMMIT_HASH to the image and displays it on the /status page. The changes push Docker images to GitHub Packages under the hyperfy-xyz organization. Community members reviewed the PR, with ash adding comments and mattimus suggesting additional tagging with short SHA to preserve older main builds. DevStarlight mentioned they were injecting .env and PM2 configuration files in their Dockerfile but could adapt to the new approach. There was also brief discussion about using Docker's native restart functionality instead of PM2, though HypPrivakos noted that PM2 might be used to run multiple worlds within a single container.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Can we tag with a commit short SHA along with the branch name to preserve older main builds? (asked by mattimus) A: It commits with a long SHA for the moment, along with branch/tag name (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\nQ: Why not use --only=production for npm install to save space? (implied by mattimus) A: Didn't feel it was worth the multi-stage Docker build just to save a few MB, and thought dev packages were needed for npm run build on each start (answered by HypPrivakos - HyperWorld.Host)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for 💻│developers Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical aspects of Hyperfy development, covering several key areas. Vehicle implementation was a significant topic, with Ashxn explaining the pivot to a single armature with bones for vehicle parts (wheels, doors, lights) to achieve better performance through single draw calls. This approach differs from V1 by using bones instead of empties. \n\nAnother major discussion centered around post-processing effects and their impact on visual fidelity. MetaRick encountered issues with a pure white world appearing darker with post-processing enabled, which Ashxn identified as being caused by tonemapping (specifically AgX). They discussed potential workarounds including using unlit materials, emissive materials, and adjusting sun intensity.\n\nTheMattEmpire shared VRM optimization techniques for Blender, noting that combining multiple mesh blendshapes into single presets and using \"Make shape from mix\" can reduce file size. There was also brief discussion about weapons implementation and a GitHub pull request for an Eliza 3D Hyperfy starter.\n\nAdditional topics included video file size limitations (configurable per world), car mechanics demonstrations, and potential improvements to world loading screens and favicon implementation.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a max file size/video length for videos? (asked by vincentskele) A: It's a setting per world (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is it possible to start making our own [cars] or does the core/dev engine not allow for it yet? (asked by ~/drdoge.eth) A: 10000% possible. Everything is in the engine. skinnedmesh.getBone(name) lets you read and write bone transforms. Physics has everything for raycasting suspension and applying forces for wheels etc. (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is there a way to turn post processing off as world owner? Meaning it can't be turned on by user? (asked by MetaRick) A: Unanswered\nQ: What do you mean stack? (asked by Ashxn) A: The post processing (stack) sorry unity ghosts in my brain (answered by MetaRick)\nQ: What do you think of also adding favicon to options in world settings? (asked by 0mka) A: I started adding this then realised it needs a small pipeline. Ideally people just upload a single svg and we generate the 512, 1024 and app manifest and stuff automatically. (answered by Ashxn)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ashxn | Helpee: MetaRick | Context: MetaRick was trying to create a pure white world but post-processing was darkening it | Resolution: Ashxn identified the issue as tonemapping (specifically AgX) and bloom being triggered when sunlight pushes 100% white into HDR range\nHelper: vox | Helpee: MetaRick | Context: Trying to find workarounds for post-processing affecting white backgrounds | Resolution: Suggested using white emissive material with strength at 1, though testing showed it still gets grey with bloom smearing\nHelper: TheMattEmpire | Helpee: Community | Context: Optimizing VRM file sizes in Blender | Resolution: Shared technique of combining multiple blendshapes into one using 'Make shape from mix' feature to reduce file size\n\n## 4.

Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical aspects of Hyperfy, a platform initially focused on Solana with EVM mods available for self-hosting. Key technical topics included deployment options, with users discussing the possibility of integrating Hyperfy worlds with Next.js applications. While Next.js is primarily for 2D websites, users explored embedding Hyperfy worlds via iframes or pointing subdomains to Hyperworld.host. The multiplayer component of Hyperfy was identified as a blocker for serverless deployments like Vercel, though single-player experiences remain possible. Users highlighted 3D environment portfolios as a strong use case beyond social/gaming applications, with the ability to create interactive environments more easily than with raw Three.js. There was also mention of avatar creation for crypto projects and discussion about importing existing worlds into the platform, with some users experiencing difficulties with digital ocean droplets and collision fixing.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can anyone clarify the actual market cap for Hyper, is it currently 6.2 or 2.7? (asked by Greguar) A: Fully diluted 6.2, market cap takes into account circulating supply (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Do you think it's possible to spin a world on a next.js vercel web app? (asked by Sceth iii) A: Nextjs is specific to building 2D websites, you could embed your world in a nextjs app with an iframe though (answered by Ashxn)\nQ: Is it possible to deploy Hyperfy on Vercel? (asked by Sceth iii) A: It's a little difficult to deploy on vercel because hyperfy requires a server to be running and vercel focuses on serverless applications (answered by peezy)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief discussion about cryptocurrency on-ramps and a new platform (likely related to Coinbase) that standardizes wallet API integration. Participants speculate about how the platform addresses on-ramp issues for converting fiat currency to cryptocurrency. They discuss potential regulatory implications, particularly regarding off-boarding restrictions that might require full documentation for withdrawals. The conversation touches on the benefits of using cryptocurrency for online stores to save on credit card processing fees, as well as the advantages of quicker settlement times and direct token exchange capabilities without bank involvement. The technical focus is minimal, with more emphasis on business models and regulatory considerations.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How did they solve the on-ramp issue? (asked by general hyper) A: Possibly through standardizing existing wallet APIs like Coinbase's and establishing partnerships rather than new technology (answered by maximus)\nQ: How might regulators treat this new platform? (asked by maximus) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why would Coinbase support this platform? (asked by general hyper) A: They might regulate off-boarding so funds can be loaded but not withdrawn without full documentation, benefiting Coinbase by keeping money in their system (answered by maximus)\n\n## 3.

User 0mka reported that when trying to add a VRM as base in the World Image feature, the file browser opens correctly, but after selecting a VRM file, the interface returns to a blank placeholder without loading the file. User ash responded by asking for troubleshooting information, suggesting to check for errors in the console or network tab, and to try a different VRM file, noting that the feature was working correctly for them.\n\n## 2.

The key technical improvement was implementing multi-stage builds, which delivered two major benefits: faster build times through better cache layer utilization and a 59% reduction in final image size (from 98MB to 40MB). Ash shared a GitHub link to the updated Dockerfile and tagged two other users. HypPrivakos confirmed they fetch images directly from the GitHub repository rather than using the Dockerfile directly, so the improvements should be automatically available on their platform. Ash also mentioned removing a hack (`| exit 0`) that HypPrivakos had previously needed to add due to an issue with the build system.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Do we need to update our workflow if we're using the Hyperfy images?

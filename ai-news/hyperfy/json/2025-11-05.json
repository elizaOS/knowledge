Summary\nThe chat segment shows a new Hyperfy developer (froh2) seeking guidance on how to implement object interaction scripts, specifically for click behavior (onPointerDown) that would allow one object to affect another (like setting visibility). Two community members (HypPrivakos and Gert-Jan Akerboom) responded by directing froh2 to existing examples and resources. They pointed to a specific example from a user named Mike and suggested exploring various apps to understand implementation patterns. The new user later confirmed that examining the .hyp files and scripts from these examples helped, and they also discovered the AI prompts documentation which provided additional clarity on how the Hyperfy system works.\n\n## 2.

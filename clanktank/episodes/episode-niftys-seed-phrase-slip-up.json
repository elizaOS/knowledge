    "summary": "In this hilarious episode, laid-back Bored Ape NFT holder Nick Nifty presents his innovative metaverse gaming platform to the judges. While his technical concept impresses everyone, things take a disastrous turn when he casually reveals his actual seed phrase on live TV after being momentarily distracted by a shiny object. Despite the promising project, the judges are forced to DUMP his pitch out of security concerns, leaving Nifty confused about why everyone is suddenly trying to transfer his assets.",

    "summary": "In the final pitch of the episode, Tom presents nounspace, a customizable social media platform built on the Farcaster protocol. His vision of community-owned social spaces powered by mini-apps called Fidgets intrigues the judges, but faces tough questions about user adoption, differentiation from existing platforms, and the tokenomics of $SPACE. Through passionate defense of his community-first approach and demonstrations of the platform's features, Tom attempts to convince the panel that customizable, community-owned social media represents the future of online interaction.",

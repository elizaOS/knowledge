      "body": "**Describe the bug**\n\nThe application encounters multiple errors during knowledge processing:\n1. Circuit breaker errors causing knowledge processing failures\n2. UTF-8 encoding issues with PDF files\n3. Database operation failures due to invalid byte sequences\n\nThe errors occur during the initialization phase when processing character knowledge, particularly when handling PDF files and text content.\n\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Put PDF knowledge in 'eliza/characters/knowledge/<your agent>'\n2. Set ragKnowledge to 'true' in your character file.\n3. Edit your character file to add the knowlege like so:\n```\n \"knowledge\": [\n    {\n      \"directory\": \"tech_guides\",\n      \"shared\": true\n    }\n  ], \n```\n4. Start the application using `pnpm start`\n5. The errors appear during the knowledge processing phase\n6. Specific errors include:\n   - \"invalid byte sequence for encoding \"UTF8\": 0x00\"\n   - \"Circuit breaker is OPEN\"\n   - \"unsupported Unicode escape sequence\"\n\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\n- PDF files should be properly processed without encoding errors\n- Knowledge processing should complete successfully\n- Circuit breaker should handle failures gracefully without blocking all operations\n\n\n**Screenshots**\n<img width=\"952\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39d789b4-3fee-4a0e-b078-044101051388\" />\n\n<img width=\"1087\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50b881b0-b3f0-43f4-8500-16f947e333fb\" />\n\n<img width=\"1097\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90bed2aa-23db-4c89-95fe-44bb5459a0ff\" />\n\n<img width=\"1095\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c4db528-f2d2-40b7-9f15-96b1144303ac\" />\n\n**Additional context**\n\n-Using PGVector for RAG\n- Environment: macOS 23.6.0\n- The errors occur during the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) knowledge processing phase\n- The circuit breaker appears to be tripping due to database operation failures\n\n",

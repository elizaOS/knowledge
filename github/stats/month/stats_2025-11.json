Start agent with fresh character file (no runtime settings)\r\n2. Use `runtime.setSetting()` to add configuration at runtime\r\n3. Call `runtime.updateAgent()` to persist to database\r\n4. Restart agent\r\n5. Verify settings are loaded via `runtime.getSetting()`\r\n\r\n**Test coverage:**\r\n- ✅ New agent creation\r\n- ✅ Settings merge on restart (DB + character file)\r\n- ✅ Character file overrides DB values (same key)\r\n- ✅ Deep merge of secrets\r\n- ✅ Handles missing settings in DB\r\n- ✅ Handles missing settings in character file\r\n- ✅ Integration with `runtime.initialize()`\r\n- ✅ `getSetting()` access to merged settings\r\n\r\nAll tests pass (9 tests, 28 assertions).\r\n",

They must use `messageService.handleMessage()` directly, which bypasses the benefits of the unified API (auto-filling, connection management, callbacks, etc.).\r\n\r\nThis PR solves that by giving the runtime a reference to its parent ElizaOS instance, allowing plugins to call `runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage()` when available, while maintaining a fallback for standalone mode.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- [x] My changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\n- [ ] If documentation change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n\r\n**Documentation needed:**\r\n- Plugin development guide should mention `runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage()` API\r\n- Example usage in plugin templates\r\n- Migration guide for existing plugins (optional, recommended)\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the architecture: `packages/core/src/types/elizaos.ts` - new interface\r\n2. Check runtime changes: `packages/core/src/types/runtime.ts` and `packages/core/src/runtime.ts`\r\n3. Verify ElizaOS auto-assignment: `packages/core/src/elizaos.ts` lines 158 and 203\r\n4. Look at cleanup: `packages/core/src/runtime.ts` line 384\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n**Automated:**\r\n- [x] TypeScript compilation passes\r\n- [x] No circular dependencies\r\n- [x] Type safety verified\r\n\r\n**Manual testing (with plugin-discord):**\r\n- [x] Runtime has `elizaOS` reference after initialization\r\n- [x] `hasElizaOS()` returns `true` when ElizaOS is present\r\n- [x] Plugins can call `runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage()` successfully\r\n- [x] Fallback to `messageService.handleMessage()` works when ElizaOS is undefined\r\n- [x] Memory cleanup on `runtime.stop()` works correctly\r\n\r\n**Test with plugin-discord:**\r\n```typescript\r\n// In plugin-discord/src/messages.ts\r\nif (this.runtime.hasElizaOS()) {\r\n  // Uses unified API - confirmed via logs\r\n  await this.runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage(agentId, message, options);\r\n} else {\r\n  // Fallback for standalone\r\n  await this.runtime.messageService.handleMessage(runtime, message, callback);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLogs confirm unified API is used:\r\n```\r\nInfo [Discord] Using unified messaging API\r\n```",

      "author": "wtfsayo",
      "number": 5295,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "# Migrate remaining CLI input methods to use @clack/prompts for consistency\n\n## üéØ Summary\n\nCurrently, the CLI uses a mix of input libraries (`inquirer`, Bun's global `prompt()`, and `@clack/prompts`). We should standardize on `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience and better styling across all CLI interactions.\n\n## üìã Current State\n\nMost of the CLI already uses `@clack/prompts` properly, but there are **2 main files** still using other input methods:\n\n### 1. `src/utils/plugin-creator.ts` - Using `inquirer` üì¶\n\nThis file has multiple `inquirer.prompt()` calls that need to be migrated:\n\n- **Plugin specification collection** (~line 172-290):\n  - Plugin name input\n  - Plugin description input  \n  - Plugin features input\n  - Component selection (checkbox)\n  - Action names input\n  - Provider names input\n  - Evaluator names input\n  - Service names input\n\n### 2. `scripts/generate-unit-tests.ts` - Using global `prompt()` üîß\n\n- **Test generation confirmation** (~line 165):\n  ```typescript\n  const answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\n  ```\n\n## ‚ú® Benefits of Migration\n\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\n\n## üîß Implementation Examples\n\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\n\n**Before (inquirer):**\n```typescript\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\n  {\n    type: 'input',\n    name: 'name',\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \"plugin-\" prefix):',\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\n  }\n]);\n```\n\n**After (clack):**\n```typescript\nconst name = await clack.text({\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \"plugin-\" prefix):',\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\n});\n\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\n  process.exit(0);\n}\n```\n\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\n\n**Before:**\n```typescript\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\n```\n\n**After:**\n```typescript\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\n  initialValue: true\n});\n\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\n  return;\n}\n```\n\n## ‚úÖ Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\n\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\n\n## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\n\n## üéØ Priority\n\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\n\n## üí° Implementation Notes\n\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\n\n---\n\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.",

I don't have this issue when I run it on my Ubuntu Linux VM.\n\nI cloned the eliza repo and ran 'bun install', 'bun run build' and 'bun start' and it's able to load everything on Windows Powershell 7.

      "author": "wtfsayo",
      "number": 5218,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "## Problem\n\nCurrently, `bun run test` does not work consistently across all packages in the ElizaOS monorepo. This creates several issues:\n\n1. **Inconsistent Developer Experience**: Developers cannot reliably run tests in individual packages\n2. **CI/CD Fragility**: The root `bun test` command fails, making it difficult to validate changes\n3. **Low Test Coverage**: Only 28% of source files have tests (excluding dist files)\n4. **Missing Test Infrastructure**: 29% of packages have no test scripts defined\n\n### Current State Analysis\n\n**Test Coverage by Package:**\n- ‚úÖ **10/14 packages (71%)** have test scripts defined\n- ‚ùå **4/14 packages (29%)** have no test infrastructure\n- üî¥ Root `bun test` fails due to `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` mock initialization errors\n\n**Packages with Issues:**\n1. **No Tests At All:**\n   - `@elizaos/app` - Tauri application\n   - `@elizaos/autodoc` - Documentation generator\n   - `create-eliza` - Scaffolding tool\n   - `@elizaos/docs` - Docusaurus site (expected)\n\n2. **Failing Tests:**\n   - `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` - Mock initialization errors\n   - `@elizaos/project-tee-starter` - Environment setup issues\n\n3. **Excluded from Root Tests:**\n   - `@elizaos/plugin-starter` (template)\n   - `@elizaos/docs` (documentation)\n   - `@elizaos/plugin-sql` (has tests but excluded)\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nImplement a phased approach to ensure all packages have working tests:\n\n### Phase 1: Fix Failing Tests (Priority: High)\n- [ ] Fix `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` mock initialization errors\n- [ ] Fix `@elizaos/project-tee-starter` environment setup issues\n- [ ] Ensure root `bun test` command passes\n\n### Phase 2: Add Missing Test Infrastructure (Priority: High)\n- [ ] Add test setup to `@elizaos/app` (Tauri app testing)\n- [ ] Add test setup to `@elizaos/autodoc`\n- [ ] Add test setup to `create-eliza`\n- [ ] Create minimal test files to validate setup\n\n### Phase 3: Standardize Test Configuration (Priority: Medium)\n- [ ] Create shared test configuration for consistency\n- [ ] Standardize coverage reporting (exclude dist/, build/, node_modules/)\n- [ ] Add coverage thresholds per package\n- [ ] Ensure all packages use Bun test runner consistently\n\n### Phase 4: Documentation & CI Updates (Priority: Medium)\n- [ ] Update contributing guide with testing requirements\n- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for test validation\n- [ ] Update CI workflows to run package-specific tests\n- [ ] Create testing best practices documentation\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### 1. Shared Test Configuration\nCreate a base test configuration that all packages can extend:\n\n```typescript\n// packages/test-config/base.config.ts\nexport default {\n  testMatch: [\"**/*.test.ts\", \"**/*.spec.ts\"],\n  coverage: {\n    exclude: [\n      \"**/dist/**\",\n      \"**/build/**\",\n      \"**/node_modules/**\",\n      \"**/*.d.ts\",\n      \"**/coverage/**\"\n    ],\n    threshold: {\n      statements: 60,\n      branches: 60,\n      functions: 60,\n      lines: 60\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Package Test Script Standardization\nEnsure every package.json has:\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"bun test\",\n    \"test:coverage\": \"bun test --coverage\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Fix Root Test Command\nUpdate root package.json to handle package-specific test requirements:\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"turbo run test --filter=\\!@elizaos/docs --filter=\\!@elizaos/plugin-starter\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] `bun run test` works in every package directory\n- [ ] Root `bun test` command passes without errors\n- [ ] All packages have at least minimal test coverage\n- [ ] Test coverage reporting excludes dist/build artifacts\n- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs all tests successfully\n- [ ] Developer documentation updated with testing guidelines\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Improved Developer Experience**: Consistent testing commands across all packages\n2. **Better Code Quality**: Increased test coverage from 28% to target 60%+\n3. **Reliable CI/CD**: All PRs validated with comprehensive test suite\n4. **Easier Onboarding**: New contributors can confidently run tests\n5. **Reduced Bugs**: Catch issues early with standardized testing\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n1. **Using Different Test Runners**: Considered Jest/Vitest but Bun test is already established\n2. **Monorepo-level Testing Only**: Would miss package-specific issues\n3. **Excluding Packages from Testing**: Would leave gaps in coverage\n\n## Additional Context\n\n- Current test coverage is ~28% (excluding dist files)\n- The monorepo uses Turbo for orchestration\n- Bun test runner is the standard across the project\n- Some packages have E2E tests (client) that need special handling\n\nThis improvement will significantly enhance the development workflow and code quality across the ElizaOS project.",

The most significant changes include the introduction of a context-aware test generation system, updates to repository analysis logic, and improvements to environment variable prompting. Additionally, configuration constants and export structure have been updated for better maintainability.\r\n\r\n### Context-Aware Test Generation\r\n* Added a new system for generating plugin-specific tests dynamically based on the plugin's actual structure and functionality. This replaces the old static template system, ensuring more relevant and accurate tests. (`CONTEXT_AWARE_TESTING.md`)\r\n\r\n### Repository Analysis Enhancements\r\n* Implemented a repository analyzer that scans a plugin's directory for key files (`README.md`, `package.json`, `index.ts/js`) and source files while respecting token limits and skipping large or binary files. (`repository-analyzer.ts`)\r\n\r\n### Environment Variable Management\r\n* Introduced `EnvPrompter`, a utility for interactive collection and validation of environment variables, with support for sensitive values and default descriptions. (`env-prompter.ts`)\r\n\r\n### Configuration Updates\r\n* Added new configuration constants for migration, including `MAX_TOKENS`, `CLAUDE_CODE_TIMEOUT`, and `MIN_DISK_SPACE_GB`, to centralize and standardize settings. (`config.ts`)\r\n\r\n### Export Structure Improvements\r\n* Updated the export structure in `index.ts` to include new components like `EnvPrompter`, `ContextAwareTestGenerator`, and configuration constants, ensuring better modularity and accessibility.

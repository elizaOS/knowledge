      "body": "**Describe the bug**\n\nhttps://eliza.how/docs/quickstart -> Install Globally (Recommended)\n\nThere are two main issues affecting the onboarding and first interaction with ElizaOS:\n\n1. **Missing prerequisites in documentation:**  \n   The Quickstart guide does not mention that [Bun](https://bun.sh/) is required for plugin installation, nor does it mention that some essential plugins (such as `@elizaos/plugin-sql`) may need to be installed manually if the automatic installation fails. This leads to startup errors for new users.\n\n2. **Error when interacting with the agent:**  \n   After installing Bun and the required plugins, the dashboard loads, but when trying to interact with the agent, an error occurs:  \n   `Error: No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING`\n\n---\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Follow the Quickstart guide:  \n   - Install ElizaOS CLI with `npm install -g @elizaos/cli@beta`\n   - Run `elizaos start`\n3. Select your database: › pglite (embedded database)\n3. Observe errors about missing plugins (e.g., `@elizaos/plugin-sql`) and failed automatic installation.\n4. Manually install missing plugins and Bun as a workaround.\n5. Start ElizaOS again, open the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`.\n6. Try to interact with the agent.\n7. Observe the error:  \n   `Error: No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING`\n\n---\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\n- The Quickstart guide should mention all prerequisites, including Bun, and provide troubleshooting steps for missing plugins.\n- After installing all dependencies, the agent should be able to process messages without errors related to missing embedding handlers.\n\n---\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41ef3836-cbd9-44f2-ba3d-4ba8abff16cd)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f109cdd5-cb8a-4f65-9e96-1fdd51baedc0)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/765272e1-43ea-4c7b-a3fa-3c18eb2821cb)\n\n---\n\n**Additional context**\n\n- OS: Ubuntu (running in a Virtual Machine)\n- Node.js version: v23.11.0\n- ElizaOS CLI version: 1.0.0-beta.34\n- Bun version: (after manual install)\n- The error log for the TEXT_EMBEDDING issue is attached below: ERROR: Failed to generate embedding:\nmessage: \"(Error) No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\"\nstack: [\n\"Error: No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\",\n...\n]\n...\nError: No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\nat AgentRuntime.useModel ...\n\n---\n\n**Suggestions**\n\n- Update the Quickstart documentation to mention Bun as a prerequisite and provide instructions for manual plugin installation if needed.\n- Please investigate the TEXT_EMBEDDING error, as it blocks any interaction with the agent after a successful setup.",

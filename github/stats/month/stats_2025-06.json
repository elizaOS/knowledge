It appears to be commented as a placeholder in \n \n**To Reproduce**\n\nsettings: {\n    secrets: {},\n    ragKnowledge: true,\n  },\n  knowledge: [\n    {\n      directory: 'knowledge/foobar',\n      shared: true,\n    },\n  ],\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nI expect that it would parse on startup and it was not doing that, as it used to do.  So, I looked into code and found this... summary from claude....\n\nMissing Implementation Locations\n\n  1. AgentRuntime Initialization Missing Knowledge \n  Processing\n\n  File: /packages/core/src/runtime.ts (lines 494-651)\n  - The AgentRuntime.initialize() method should process\n  character.knowledge but doesn't\n  - No call to any knowledge processing function during\n  agent startup\n\n  2. TODO Comment Confirms Missing Implementation\n\n  File: /packages/core/src/specs/v1/index.ts (line 50)\n  // TODO: Implement the remaining adapters: ... - \n  knowledge / memory\n  This is a developer comment explicitly stating that\n  knowledge processing is not implemented yet.\n\n  3. Bootstrap Plugin Missing KNOWLEDGE Provider\n\n  File: /packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/index.ts\n  - Multiple message examples reference providers: \n  ['KNOWLEDGE'] in character files\n  - But the bootstrap plugin doesn't export any KNOWLEDGE \n  provider\n  - Provider list is incomplete - missing the knowledge\n  provider entirely\n\n  4. RagService Interface Exists But No Implementation\n\n  File: /packages/core/src/runtime.ts (lines 52-61)\n  interface RagServiceDelegator extends Service {\n    getKnowledge(message: Memory, scope?: { roomId?: UUID;\n   worldId?: UUID; entityId?: UUID }):\n  Promise<KnowledgeItem[]>;\n    _internalAddKnowledge(item: KnowledgeItem, options?:\n  any, scope?: any): Promise<void>;\n  }\n  The interface exists but no actual implementation of\n  this service.\n\n  5. Missing Functions\n\n  - processCharacterKnowledge() - Referenced in docs but\n  doesn't exist anywhere\n  - No knowledge file reading/processing logic\n  - No connection between character.knowledge array and\n  embedding system\n\n  Developer Comments Confirming This\n\n  The codebase has explicit TODO comments indicating that\n  knowledge/memory functionality is intentionally \n  unfinished. The character examples even reference\n   a KNOWLEDGE provider that doesn't exist, suggesting\n  this was planned but never implemented.\n\n",

This is a more direct and more easily reproducible example to file.\n",

      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "**Describe the bug**\n\nAfter upgrading an existing project to use `@elizaos/core` version `1.0.7`, our custom character is no longer registered as an agent. Opening the chat interface/dev environment on `localhost` only shows Eliza as an agent and not our character. This previously worked with `1.0.6`. \n\nI tested with a newly scaffolded project and set up a character there as well and noticed the same behavior with only Eliza being shown as an agent.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n- Upgrade an existing project to use `\"@elizaos/core\": \"^1.0.7\"` or start a fresh one using this version\n- Create a new character file with character settings and load that as the agent in the `index.ts`\n- Start the server\n- Open `localhost` to view the chat/dev environment and check if custom character is there -- we only saw Eliza and not our agent\n\nCode snippets for characters:\n\n`herbert.ts` snippet:\n\n```typescript\nexport const herbert: Character = {\n  name: 'Herbert',\n  plugins: [\n    '@elizaos/plugin-sql',\n    ...(process.env.EVM_PRIVATE_KEY ?

(more settings)\n}\n```\n\n`index.ts`:\n```typescript\nconst herbertAgent: ProjectAgent = {\n  character: herbert,\n  init: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime) => initCharacter({ runtime }),\n};\nconst project: Project = {\n  agents: [herbertAgent],\n};\n```\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\n- Expected that Eliza would find the new character (Herbert) and register it as an agent (previous behavior in existing project)\n- We didn't change any config in the existing project but after upgrading versions we could no longer find/interact with Herbert\n\n**Additional context**\n\n- Tested this with both a newly scaffolded project as well as in an existing project. Our existing project had our custom agent/character loading but I then upgraded to `1.0.7` and Eliza is the only registered agent. Seems to possibly be using Eliza as a fallback and ignoring our custom character files, even though they're being detected when the server starts.\n",

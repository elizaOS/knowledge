The embedded video by Nader Dabit [How to Build a Social AI Agent in 15 minutes with X, Telegram, Onchain Capabilities | Full Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PZVwNTl5hI&ab_channel=NaderDabit) seems to be outdated. \n2. The textual description below the video, to setup the Twitter Agent, doesn't follow the video and it's outdated as well. \n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Follow the video and check if it works\n2. Follow the description below the video and check if it works\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nA tutorial that let developer to build a Social Agent in 15 minutes\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nN/A\n\n**Additional context**\n\nI'm happy to help to fix it, but I'm still working my way through the documentation to understand how to implement the Twitter/X agent. \n\n---\n\nWhat is also a little bit confusing is that in the docs Twitter is described as a Client ...\n\n<img width=\"857\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd2147a8-707b-4fbe-bd9f-d75934e4239c\" />\n\n\n... but the link brings us to the repo plugins/twitter-client ...\n\n\n<img width=\"1314\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5e22f87-bb2d-4f59-b3de-81af1b80015b\" />\n\nSo apparently some of the plugins are clients but not all plugins are client. \n\n---\n\nThe doc for the plugins page seems also to be outdated since it uses the package `elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter`, that probably doesn't exist anymore. \n\n<img width=\"874\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cef0e85-2561-416a-b992-9644d3fdc446\" />\n\n---\n\nIn the README of the twitter plugin, this snippet is suggested for installation but it's not clear in which file it should be places. I suppose in `src/index.ts` \n\n<img width=\"932\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42784a1e-f6d7-48c9-a6f9-90112eb99b5e\" />\n\n---\n\n### **Nader Dabit** approach\n\nNadir is creating a new file `mainCharacter` file in `/agent/src` https://github.com/dabit3/ai-agent-cognitivedriftt/blob/main/agent/src/mainCharacter.ts. \n```\nimport { Character, ModelProviderName, Clients } from \"@ai16z/eliza\";\nimport { defaultCharacter } from './defaultCharacter.ts'\n\nexport const mainCharacter: Character = {\n    ...defaultCharacter,\n    clients: [Clients.TWITTER],\n    modelProvider: ModelProviderName.CLAUDE_VERTEX,\n    name: \"cognitivedriftt\",\n}\n```\n1. Eliza has been moved from `@ai16z/eliza`\n2. The Twitter Client is an autonomous plugin now. So ` clients: [Clients.TWITTER],` is not valid anymore. \n\n### Approach in the description below the video\n\n```\nimport { DefaultCharacter } from \"./defaultCharacter\";\nimport { clients } from \"../globalClients\";\n\nexport const mainCharacter = {\n    ...DefaultCharacter,\n    clients: { twitter: clients.twitter },\n    modelProvider: modelProviders.anthropic,\n};\n```\n\nThe `globalClinets` file doesn't exist anymore anywhere in the Eliza repo and it doesn't seem to fit the way we are supposed to integrate the Twitter Plugin/Client as described in the README of https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/client-twitter",

This is a future enhancement.\r\n\r\n*   **`elizaos plugins add|install`**\r\n    *   **Issues:** Dependency loop problems in monorepo environments (e.g., in `packages` directory). Difficulty handling workspace dependencies and distinguishing between monorepo root and other projects.\r\n    *   **Proposed Solution:**\r\n        *   Implement monorepo context detection.\r\n        *   Implement workspace package detection.\r\n        *   Special handling for the monorepo root (using `workspace:*` references in `package.json` to avoid `npm install` and prevent loops). For other projects, revert to standard installation.\r\n        *   Add fallback mechanisms if workspace installation fails.\r\n\r\n*   **`elizaos plugins installed-plugins`**\r\n    *   **Status:** Working correctly, lists plugins referenced as dependencies in `package.json` (correct for portable monorepo design).\r\n\r\n*   **`elizaos plugins installed-plugins`**\r\n    *   **Status:** Works as expected in both monorepo and created projects. (Duplicate entry, likely a typo).\r\n\r\n### Agent Commands\r\n\r\n*   **`elizaos agent -h/–help`**\r\n    *   **Status:** Works correctly, displaying expected help text, options, and commands.\r\n\r\n*   **`elizaos agent list|ls (-j/–json)`**\r\n    *   **Status:** Works correctly. Handles no agents running and agent information display.  JSON flag works as expected.\r\n\r\n*   **`elizaos agent get|g (-n/–name, -j/–json, -o/–output)`**\r\n    *   **Issues:**\r\n        *   `--json` flag incorrectly requires a name parameter (should display all agents in JSON).\r\n        *   `elizaos agent get -n eliza --json` saves output to a file named \"eliza\" instead of displaying JSON in the terminal.\r\n        *   `--output` flag is non-functional. It should save to a file (e.g., \"testie.json\") but does nothing.\r\n        *   `elizaos agent get` without flags shows the same table as `list`. It should display the character file content.\r\n    *   **Proposed Solution:**\r\n        *   Make `--json` display JSON output without file saving.\r\n        *   Make `--output` save to a file without terminal display.\r\n        *   Allow `--json` to function without a name parameter to list all agents in JSON format.\r\n        *   Implement an interactive menu to display available agents when `agent get` is used without flags.\r\n\r\n*   **`elizaos agent start|s (-n/–name, –path)`**\r\n    *   **Issues:** Command scope confusion: trying to both create and start agents. Confusing options.  Errors (\"Bad Request\") encountered. The `--json` flag and `--remote-url` were inappropriate for this command.\r\n    *   **Proposed Solution:**\r\n        *   Focus the command solely on starting existing agents. Remove unnecessary options from help text.\r\n        *   Implement a two-step process: Ensure the agent exists (by creating it if needed based on the character JSON file), then start its runtime.\r\n        *   Handle agent lifecycle correctly to start only existing agents. The command now uses a database to track existing agents.\r\n        *   Handle all three usage methods (by name, path, or interactively) uniformly.\r\n\r\n*   **`elizaos agent stop|st`**\r\n    *   **Status:** Working. Interactive CLI features added when no flags are passed.\r\n    *   **Proposed Solution:** Add interactive CLI functionality.\r\n\r\n*   **`elizaos agent remove|rm`**\r\n    *   **Status:** Working. Interactive CLI features added when no flags are passed.\r\n    *   **Proposed Solution:** Add interactive CLI functionality.\r\n\r\n*   **`elizaos agent set`**\r\n    *   **Status:** Was not working; re-vamped for an interactive shell.\r\n    *   **Proposed Solution:** Add interactive CLI shell.\r\n\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n- **New Features**\n  - Added interactive prompts and improved error handling for agent management commands, including starting, stopping, removing, and configuring agents.\n  - Extended the create command to support initializing agents from templates.\n  - Enhanced plugin management to support monorepo workspaces during plugin add/remove operations.\n\n- **Bug Fixes**\n  - Improved test scripts for better isolation, reliability, and diagnostics, especially in CI environments.\n  - Enhanced server startup and database initialization logic for more robust handling of PostgreSQL vector extension errors.\n\n- **Documentation**\n  - Updated command descriptions and help texts for clarity and accuracy.\n\n- **Tests**\n  - Improved test setup, teardown, and logging for better stability and diagnostics in automated environments.\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",

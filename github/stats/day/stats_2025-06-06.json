See here:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe11e37b-0925-4498-a3a2-0985c70151ab)\n\n\nAfter running this I am inspecting the live database and the channel_participants relation is there:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5524f18-31e9-46bb-983e-3973c7140c44)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18921312-949d-47b2-83e3-73cc663fce73)\n\n**Theory**: \nMessageBusService seems to access stale data in regards to channel participants.\n\nIs there any way to fix this?\n",

Also I found it unintuitive to pass -tee as a flag for project to clone the tee project instead of just having tee as a type. Also, there is stuff that is passing an ignore file in a string but it is already cloned over from the project starter and plugin starter and project tee starter templates.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nUnified Type Selection: Instead of separate flags like --tee, the command now uses a single -t, --type option to select the creation type (project, plugin, agent, or tee). This simplifies the command's public API.\r\nTEE Project Scaffolding: Adds a new project-tee-starter template and the logic required to create a new TEE-enabled project.\r\nRefactored Logic: The internal logic has been broken down into smaller, single-responsibility functions (e.g., createProject, createPlugin, createAgent, createTEEProject), making the code easier to read, test, and maintain.\r\nImproved Validation: Centralized and improved validation for project names and target directories to provide clearer error messages to the user.\r\nDocumentation Update: The CLI README.md and docs have been updated to reflect the new command structure and options.\r\n\r\n**Details**\r\n\r\npackages/cli/src/commands/create.ts: Completely overhauled to support the new type-based creation flow.\r\npackages/project-tee-starter/: A new template package has been added for TEE projects.\r\npackages/cli/README.md & packages/docs/docs/cli/create.md: Updated to document the new functionality.\r\n\r\nDependency Bumps: Updated @vitest/coverage-v8 in starter templates for consistency and removing of warning flash during creation\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n- **New Features**\n  - Added support for creating TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) projects via the CLI, with dedicated prompts, templates, and instructions.\n\n- **Documentation**\n  - Updated CLI documentation to reflect the new TEE project type and revised usage examples.\n  - Improved clarity and formatting in CLI and project creation documentation.\n\n- **Chores**\n  - Updated the @vitest/coverage-v8 development dependency to version 3.1.4 in project templates.\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",

New responsive features and comprehensive UI improvements  \n**Scope:** `client/ui` - Frontend user interface components  \n**Breaking Changes:** None\n\nThis enhancement provides a significantly better user experience by making components truly responsive to their environment while maintaining consistency and accessibility across the entire interface. The implementation is performant, follows React best practices, and provides comprehensive user guidance through tooltips and improved visual feedback.",

      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "**Describe the bug**\n\nWhen creating a new Eliza v2 plugin using the elizaos create command and running it with bun dev, an error occurs during entity creation, resulting in a failure to initialize the agent. The error indicates a failure to insert into the \"entities\" table and a warning about a database adapter already being registered, which may cause unexpected behavior.\n\n```\n$ elizaos -v\n1.0.8\n```\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Run `elizaos create --type plugin foobar` to create a new plugin named \"foobar\".\n2. Navigate to the plugin directory with `cd foobar`.\n3. Install dependencies using bun install.\n4. Start the development server with bun dev.\n5. Observe the error in the console output.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nThe plugin should be created and run successfully in development mode without any errors. The agent should initialize correctly, and the database operations (e.g., inserting into the \"entities\" table) should complete without issues.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nN/A (Error is in console logs, provided below).\n\n**Additional context**\n\nThe error occurs consistently when following the steps above. Below is the full error log for reference:\n\n```bash\n[2025-06-12 16:34:57.724 +0200] WARN: Database adapter already registered. Additional adapters will be ignored.

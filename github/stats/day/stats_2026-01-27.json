Redis cache for connection state (but WebSocket still needs reconnect)\n  2. Gateway pattern like Discord (dedicated server for stateful connections)\n  3. Accept the delay for now, optimize later\n\n**Shaw's guidance:**\n\n* For any WebSocket service, use the Gateway pattern similar to Discord\n* \"It's not like everything has to be serverless\" - just avoid idle pods doing nothing\n* Gateway service can scale, handles WebSocket → turns into HTTP to agent\n\n## Assignee\n\nBen\n\n## Priority\n\n**P1 - Important but not blocking MVP**",

The file provides no actual value to users trying to report vulnerabilities or understand which versions receive security updates.\n- SECURITY.md requires complete rewrite with actual ElizaOS project information\n\n<h3>Important Files Changed</h3>\n\n\n\n\n| Filename | Overview |\n|----------|----------|\n| SECURITY.md | Added GitHub's default SECURITY.md template without customization - contains placeholder text and incorrect version numbers (5.1.x instead of 1.7.x) |\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sequence Diagram</h3>\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User as Security Researcher\n    participant GH as GitHub Repository\n    participant SECURITY as SECURITY.md File\n    participant Team as ElizaOS Team\n\n    User->>GH: Visit repository\n    User->>SECURITY: Read SECURITY.md\n    Note over SECURITY: Currently shows<br/>placeholder template<br/>with wrong versions\n    SECURITY-->>User: Template text:<br/>\"Use this section to...\"\n    User->>User: Confused about<br/>how to report\n    \n    Note over User,Team: Expected Flow (after fix):\n    User->>SECURITY: Read SECURITY.md\n    SECURITY-->>User: Clear instructions:<br/>1.7.x supported<br/>Use GitHub Security<br/>Advisories or Discord\n    User->>Team: Reports vulnerability<br/>via proper channel\n    Team->>User: Response within 48h\n```\n\n<!-- greptile_other_comments_section -->\n\n<sub>(2/5) Greptile learns from your feedback when you react with thumbs up/down!</sub>\n\n<!-- /greptile_comment -->",

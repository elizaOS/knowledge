      "author": "standujar",
      "number": 4779,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "**Describe the bug**\n\nThe API endpoint `/api/agents/:agentId/rooms` returns an empty list of rooms `({\"success\":true,\"data\":{\"rooms\":[]}})` even though the agent is actively participating in multiple rooms and responding to messages in those rooms.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\nStart the agent with multiple connected services _(Discord, Telegram, etc.)_\nVerify the agent is responding to messages in rooms _(e.g., Discord channels)_\nCall the API endpoint **GET** `/api/agents/:agentId/rooms`\nObserve that the response contains an empty rooms array despite the agent being active in rooms\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nThe API should return a list of all rooms where the agent is a participant. For example:\n```\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"data\": {\n    \"rooms\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": \"room-id-1\",\n        \"name\": \"Room Name 1\",\n        \"source\": \"discord\",\n        ...\n      },\n      ...\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Additional context**\n\n- In the agent logs, there are numerous successful room creations: `Room [UUID] created successfully`\n- Agent connection to rooms is also logged: Success: `Successfully connected entity [agentId] in room [roomId]`\n- When a message is received and processed in a room, the agent correctly responds\n- The logs show an error: `ERROR: No room found for settings provider` which might be related\n- The issue appears to be in the association between the agent and rooms in the database, or in how `getRoomsForParticipant` retrieves this information\n- The function that calls this API is in `eliza/packages/cli/src/server/api/agent.ts`, which delegates to `runtime.getRoomsForParticipant(agentId)` which in turn delegates to the database adapter\n",

Any context or related work?\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR.

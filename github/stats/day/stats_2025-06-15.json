      "author": "ChristopherTrimboli",
      "number": 5126,
      "body": "This pull request focuses on improving error handling, updating dependencies, and making minor refactorings across the `packages/cli` codebase. The most significant changes enhance robustness by ensuring error messages are properly handled, introduce new dependencies for functionality, and refine existing code to improve readability and maintainability.\r\n\r\n### Error Handling Improvements:\r\n* Updated error handling across multiple files to ensure proper type-checking for `Error` instances before accessing their `message` property. This avoids runtime errors when non-`Error` objects are caught. Examples include `crud.ts`, `lifecycle.ts`, and `plugins/actions/install.ts`.

[[1]](diffhunk://#diff-a52e7e99b70813b752b2f4af92cdefba30488bdc01bd6e4a212c621ffc67e188L72-R92) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-76b38489feb5ff5591edb08ee6e61fc6ffa802aa05689f158ca4281a8939aa91L43-R43)\r\n\r\n### Dependency Updates:\r\n* Added new dependencies `bun-types` and `inquirer` to `packages/cli/package.json` for improved type support and interactive CLI functionality. [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-6e2e2a1851648938b325ba84de634407a4e69a644ea61102df15ca4a8a7a9758R55) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-6e2e2a1851648938b325ba84de634407a4e69a644ea61102df15ca4a8a7a9758R102)\r\n* Updated the package version from `1.0.6` to `1.0.9` in `packages/cli/package.json`.\r\n\r\n### Code Refinements:\r\n* Replaced direct property access with optional chaining (`?.`) in various places to prevent errors when accessing potentially undefined values, such as in `resetEnv` and `generatePlugin`.

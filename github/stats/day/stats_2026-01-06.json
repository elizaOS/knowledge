      "body": "## Context\nTurbo build tool consuming excessive memory (21GB+), impacting developer experience and potentially CI stability.\n\n- **Source**: Discord discussion (2026-01-04)\n- **Priority**: P2 (from issue-triage assessment)\n- **Impact**: Medium (primarily contributors/devs; may block lower-RAM machines/CI)\n\n## Evidence\n- Discord: \"Turbo builds were reported as using 21GB+ of memory\"\n- Reporter: Omid Sa\n- Related: No existing GitHub issue found\n- Pattern: Operational reliability signal\n\n## Technical Details\n- **Component**: Tooling / Build system (Turbo)\n- **Complexity**: 4/5 (could be caching, watch mode, monorepo graph, misconfig)\n- **Required Expertise**: JS/TS build systems, Turbo config, monorepo patterns, CI tuning\n\n## Proposed Investigation\n1. Collect repro details: peak RSS, command, repo state, Turbo version, OS, node/bun version\n2. Attempt reproduction on CI runner + local machine; capture heap snapshots if possible\n3. Review Turbo pipeline for tasks that fan out too broadly\n4. Check if caching is effective or causing issues\n\n## Proposed Mitigations\n1. Document workarounds (limit concurrency, scope packages, disable sourcemaps in dev)\n2. Consider tuning Turbo config for memory-constrained environments\n3. Add CI monitoring for build memory usage\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Memory usage reproduced and measured\n- [ ] Root cause identified\n- [ ] Workaround or fix documented\n\n---\nGenerated from [elizaOS intelligence pipeline](https://github.com/elizaOS/knowledge)\nEvidence date: 2026-01-06",

      "body": "## Context\nUsers report \"Model not found\" errors when using agent ID with API endpoints.\n\n- **Source**: Discord discussion (2026-01-03)\n- **Priority**: P1 (from issue-triage assessment)\n- **Impact**: High (blocks API-based agent usage)\n\n## Evidence\n- Discord: User reported \"Model not found\" error when using agent ID + API endpoints\n- Reporter: BAOVERSE\n- Related: No existing GitHub issue found\n- Frequency: Ongoing reports in #support channel\n\n## Technical Details\n- **Component**: API / Model Integration routing (agent ID → model/provider resolution)\n- **Complexity**: 4/5 (could be config, registry, auth scope, or routing mismatch)\n- **Required Expertise**: API layer, agent config resolution, provider/model registry, auth/tenancy\n\n## Proposed Investigation\n1. Create minimal repro template (endpoint, headers, agentId, provider, model name)\n2. Add diagnostic logging around model resolution (requested model, resolved provider, final model string)\n3. Confirm whether error originates from provider (OpenAI/Anthropic/etc.) vs internal registry\n4. Add API validation step returning clearer error (e.g., \"provider configured but model missing\")\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Root cause identified and documented\n- [ ] Fix implemented with test coverage\n- [ ] Error message improved for debugging\n\n---\nGenerated from [elizaOS intelligence pipeline](https://github.com/elizaOS/knowledge)\nEvidence date: 2026-01-06",

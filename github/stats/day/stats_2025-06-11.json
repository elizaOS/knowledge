      "title": "Unable to load custom characters after upgrading to 1.0.7",
      "author": "jonathanprozzi",
      "number": 5039,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "**Describe the bug**\n\nAfter upgrading an existing project to use `@elizaos/core` version `1.0.7`, our custom character is no longer registered as an agent. Opening the chat interface/dev environment on `localhost` only shows Eliza as an agent and not our character. This previously worked with `1.0.6`. \n\nI tested with a newly scaffolded project and set up a character there as well and noticed the same behavior with only Eliza being shown as an agent.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n- Upgrade an existing project to use `\"@elizaos/core\": \"^1.0.7\"` or start a fresh one using this version\n- Create a new character file with character settings and load that as the agent in the `index.ts`\n- Start the server\n- Open `localhost` to view the chat/dev environment and check if custom character is there -- we only saw Eliza and not our agent\n\nCode snippets for characters:\n\n`herbert.ts` snippet:\n\n```typescript\nexport const herbert: Character = {\n  name: 'Herbert',\n  plugins: [\n    '@elizaos/plugin-sql',\n    ...(process.env.EVM_PRIVATE_KEY ? ['@elizaos/plugin-evm'] : []),\n    ...(process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY ? ['@elizaos/plugin-anthropic'] : []),\n    ...(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY ? ['@elizaos/plugin-openai'] : []),\n    ...(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY ? ['@elizaos/plugin-knowledge'] : []),\n    ...(!process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY ? ['@elizaos/plugin-local-ai'] : []),\n    ...(process.env.DISCORD_API_TOKEN ? ['@elizaos/plugin-discord'] : []),\n    ...(process.env.TWITTER_USERNAME ? ['@elizaos/plugin-twitter'] : []),\n    ...(process.env.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN ? ['@elizaos/plugin-telegram'] : []),\n    ...(!process.env.IGNORE_BOOTSTRAP ? ['@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap'] : []),\n  ],\n... (more settings)\n}\n```\n\n`index.ts`:\n```typescript\nconst herbertAgent: ProjectAgent = {\n  character: herbert,\n  init: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime) => initCharacter({ runtime }),\n};\nconst project: Project = {\n  agents: [herbertAgent],\n};\n```\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\n- Expected that Eliza would find the new character (Herbert) and register it as an agent (previous behavior in existing project)\n- We didn't change any config in the existing project but after upgrading versions we could no longer find/interact with Herbert\n\n**Additional context**\n\n- Tested this with both a newly scaffolded project as well as in an existing project. Our existing project had our custom agent/character loading but I then upgraded to `1.0.7` and Eliza is the only registered agent. Seems to possibly be using Eliza as a fallback and ignoring our custom character files, even though they're being detected when the server starts.\n",

      "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nI am here to tackle response time improvements in /message api to get the response. The core issue is LLM responses take time so having streaming api will improve the response time and user experience.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nI want to have a separate API route for streaming like /message-streaming which is provide the same responses as /message API route but will stream the chunks of data/text.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nOther than streaming, nill.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nRight now, if you want to use Eliza OS as a AI agent with chat bot, the prompt/queries takes too much time depending on the LLM response length, but streaming will improve the response time by 50% to 70%. So as soon as we got our first chunk. It will start sending data to UI or receiver end.\n",

      "author": "samarth30",
      "number": 5066,
      "body": "This pull request introduces several enhancements and new features to the plugin migration system, focusing on improving test generation, repository analysis, and environment variable management. The most significant changes include the introduction of a context-aware test generation system, updates to repository analysis logic, and improvements to environment variable prompting. Additionally, configuration constants and export structure have been updated for better maintainability.\r\n\r\n### Context-Aware Test Generation\r\n* Added a new system for generating plugin-specific tests dynamically based on the plugin's actual structure and functionality. This replaces the old static template system, ensuring more relevant and accurate tests. (`CONTEXT_AWARE_TESTING.md`)\r\n\r\n### Repository Analysis Enhancements\r\n* Implemented a repository analyzer that scans a plugin's directory for key files (`README.md`, `package.json`, `index.ts/js`) and source files while respecting token limits and skipping large or binary files. (`repository-analyzer.ts`)\r\n\r\n### Environment Variable Management\r\n* Introduced `EnvPrompter`, a utility for interactive collection and validation of environment variables, with support for sensitive values and default descriptions. (`env-prompter.ts`)\r\n\r\n### Configuration Updates\r\n* Added new configuration constants for migration, including `MAX_TOKENS`, `CLAUDE_CODE_TIMEOUT`, and `MIN_DISK_SPACE_GB`, to centralize and standardize settings. (`config.ts`)\r\n\r\n### Export Structure Improvements\r\n* Updated the export structure in `index.ts` to include new components like `EnvPrompter`, `ContextAwareTestGenerator`, and configuration constants, ensuring better modularity and accessibility. (`index.ts`)<!-- Use this template by filling in information and copying and pasting relevant items out of the HTML comments. -->\r\n\r\n",

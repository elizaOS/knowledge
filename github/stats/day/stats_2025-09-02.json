      "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nWould be nice to have matrix (matrix.org) platform integration\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nBasically just the Discord/Telegram plugin but using https://www.npmjs.com/package/matrix-bot-sdk with a Matrix bot account. Would need to be able to set up homeserver and bot token (there are instructions to get the bot token [here](https://turt2live.github.io/matrix-bot-sdk/tutorial-bot.html)) \n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nI've looked at using Discord and the Discord to Matrix bridge, but I use Matrix for privacy, and would like everything to stay completely local. Matrix bot would support end to end encryption too.\n",

      "author": "jonathanprozzi",
      "number": 5867,
      "body": "# Overview\r\n\r\nThis adds a Sentry Node implementation to support using Sentry with AI SDK's `experimental_telemetry` option. This also adds a guard when Sentry is being imported in the `client` package. A future PR can include a full client/browser split as well as the Node. We've used this modification in our agent to receive traces from both the `plugin-openai` and the `plugin-anthropic` in Sentry.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow. This improves the existing broken Sentry implementation with a full Node.js integration to support `experimentalTelemetry` options in the AI SDK. Changes are contained to the core package's Sentry module, and adds in instrumental that was previously limited to a Sentry browser package used within the server's node context.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the Sentry implementation with a production-ready Node.js integration featuring AI telemetry support. This has been tested and used on our fork to provide Sentry traces from AI SDK interactions (with the OpenAI and Anthropic plugins).\r\n\r\n**Key improvements:**\r\n  - Fixes incomplete implementation: Replaces `@sentry/browser` with\r\n  `@sentry/node` SDK to support telemetry and full tracing\r\n  - Adds AI telemetry: Integrates Vercel AI SDK telemetry for monitoring LLM\r\n  interactions\r\n  - Enables plugin ecosystem: Provides telemetry infrastructure needed by\r\n  `plugin-openai` and `plugin-anthropic`\r\n  - Smart configuration: Configurable trace filtering (AI-only vs all traces)\r\n  - Production ready: Comprehensive error handling, logging, and documentation\r\n\r\n  **Technical features:**\r\n  - Automatic AI SDK call tracing (generateText, streamText, etc.)\r\n  - Input/output recording for debugging AI interactions\r\n  - Performance monitoring for AI calls (duration, success rates)\r\n  - Environment-aware conditional loading (prevents browser bundling issues)\r\n  - Comprehensive environment variable configuration\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\n  ✅ I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n\r\n**Documentation updates made:**\r\n  - `README.md`: Added comprehensive \"Sentry Monitoring & AI Telemetry\" section\r\n  with usage examples\r\n  - .env.example: Added all Sentry environment variables with descriptions\r\n  - Code comments: Extensive inline documentation explaining implementation\r\n  decisions\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n- Tested by building locally and creating a new Eliza test project: https://github.com/jonathanprozzi/eliza-sentry-example that is ready for testing once the configuration (`SENTRY_DSN` specifically) is provided and is set up to use a local path for the `core` package for testing.\r\n- Tested all configuration options and ensured that traces came through in Sentry\r\n- Ran in both this project and in a branch of our fully functioning agent and received Sentry traces for AI SDK interactions\r\n- Builds locally when using `bun run build`\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n  1. Review the main implementation: `packages/core/src/sentry/instrument.ts` -\r\n  Core Sentry integration with AI telemetry\r\n  2. Check dependency change: `packages/core/package.json` - Verify `@sentry/node`\r\n  replaces browser SDK\r\n  3. Verify exports: `packages/core/src/index.ts` - Sentry utilities properly\r\n  exported\r\n  4. Review documentation: `README.md` and `.env.example` - Contains usage configuration\r\n  documentation\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n**Build verification:**\r\n- Run `bun run build` from project root - should complete without errors\r\n- Verify client package builds without Node.js dependency issues\r\n- Check TypeScript compilation succeeds\r\n\r\n**Runtime verification:**\r\n- Set `SENTRY_DSN=test_dsn` and run `elizaos start`\r\n- Verify initialization logs appear:\r\n```\r\n  [SENTRY] Initializing with DSN: test_dsn...\r\n  [SENTRY] Trace filtering: AI-only traces + all errors\r\n  [SENTRY] Node.js initialized successfully\r\n```\r\n\r\n  **AI telemetry testing:**\r\n  - Set `SENTRY_DSN=real_dsn` with actual Sentry project\r\n  - Set `OPENAI_EXPERIMENTAL_TELEMETRY=true` (if using OpenAI)\r\n  - Start agent and have conversation\r\n  - Check Sentry Performance/traces tab for `ai.generateText traces`\r\n\r\n  **Configuration testing:**\r\n  - Test `SENTRY_TRACE_FILTER=false` for all traces vs default AI-only\r\n  - Verify `SENTRY_LOGGING=false` disables Sentry entirely\r\n  - Confirm environment variables work as documented\r\n\r\n  **Error capture verification:**\r\n  - Existing error capture via `logger.ts` should continue working\r\n  - Verify exceptions appear in Sentry Issues tab\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n`jpbuilds`\r\n",

      "author": "ChristopherTrimboli",
      "number": 5869,
      "body": "## 🐛 Fix: NPM CLI Package Runtime Path Resolution Issue\n\n### Problem\nThe published NPM package `@elizaos/cli@1.4.3-alpha.0` was failing with the following error when users tried to run `elizaos create` or `elizaos start`:\n\n```\nError: Cannot find module '/home/runner/work/eliza/eliza/packages/cli/package.json' \nfrom '/home/cjft/.bun/install/global/node_modules/@elizaos/cli/dist/index.js'\n```\n\nThis occurred because the CLI was attempting to read its own `package.json` at runtime using `import.meta.url` path resolution, which embedded the GitHub Actions build machine's absolute paths during the bundling process.\n\n### Root Cause\nThree files were attempting to read `package.json` at runtime:\n- `src/utils/user-environment.ts` - Used `import.meta.url` to resolve package.json path\n- `src/utils/display-banner.ts` - Read package.json to display version\n- `src/utils/copy-template.ts` - Used `require.resolve()` to find package.json\n\nWhen Bun bundled the code on GitHub Actions, these dynamic path resolutions were evaluated and hardcoded to `/home/runner/work/eliza/eliza/...`, making the package unusable on users' machines.\n\n### Solution: Build-Time Version Embedding\nImplemented **Option 1: Embed Version at Build Time** to eliminate runtime package.json reads entirely.\n\n### Changes Made\n\n#### 1. **Created Version Generation Script** (`src/scripts/generate-version.ts`)\n- Reads package.json at build time\n- Generates a TypeScript module (`src/version.ts`) with embedded version info\n- Exports constants: `CLI_VERSION`, `CLI_NAME`, `CLI_DESCRIPTION`\n\n#### 2. **Updated Build Process** (`build.ts`)\n- Now runs version generation before building\n- Ensures version information is compiled into the JavaScript bundle\n\n#### 3. **Refactored Runtime Code**\n- **`user-environment.ts`**: Now imports from generated version file instead of reading package.json\n- **`display-banner.ts`**: Uses embedded `CLI_VERSION` constant\n- **`copy-template.ts`**: Falls back to 'latest' if version file is unavailable\n\n#### 4. **Updated `.gitignore`**\n- Added `src/version.ts` and `src/version.js` to prevent committing generated files\n\n### Testing\n- Created `test-build.sh` script to verify the build process\n- Documented the solution in `BUILD-TIME-VERSION.md` and `BUILD-TIME-VERSION-SOLUTION.md`\n- The solution ensures the CLI works correctly regardless of where it's installed\n\n### Impact\n- ✅ Fixes the critical runtime error preventing users from using the published NPM package\n- ✅ Eliminates dependency on runtime file system operations for version info\n- ✅ Makes the package truly portable and installable via NPM/Bun\n- ✅ No breaking changes to the public API\n\n### Verification Steps\n1. Build the package locally: `cd packages/cli && bun run build`\n2. Check that `src/version.ts` is generated with correct version info\n3. Install and test the package globally\n4. Verify `elizaos create` and `elizaos start` work without path errors\n\nThis fix ensures that the CLI package published to NPM will work correctly on all users' machines, regardless of their file system structure.\nThis change also updates template creation to rely on this build-time constant, instead of resolving the package.json at runtime.\n",

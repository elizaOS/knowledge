      "body": "This PR comprehensively updates the ElizaOS test cli command to provide a more consistent and improved testing experience across both plugins and projects.\r\n\r\n**Key Changes**\r\n\r\n1. CLI Command Structure: Reorganized the test command with three subcommands:\r\n- elizaos test component - runs component tests (unit + integration) via Vitest\r\n- elizaos test e2e - runs end-to-end runtime tests\r\n- elizaos test all - runs both component and e2e tests (default)\r\n- options = -n <name> and -p, --port <port>\r\n\r\n**Starter Template Updates:**\r\n\r\n1. Updated directory structure in both project-starter and plugin-starter templates\r\n2. Component tests now live in __tests__/ directory\r\n3. E2E tests now live in e2e/ directory\r\n4. Removed deprecated files (tests.test.ts, src/tests.ts)\r\n\r\n**Configuration Improvements:**\r\n\r\n1. Fixed vitest config to properly exclude e2e tests during component test runs\r\n2. Enhanced test runner to provide consistent behavior across project and plugin tests\r\n\r\n**Test Filtering Enhancements:**\r\n\r\n1. Improved -n/--name filter to work with various formats (e.g., \"test\", \"test.test\", \"test.test.ts\")\r\n2. Made filtering behavior consistent across component and e2e tests\r\n3. Fixed issues with component test filtering that previously resulted in \"No test files found\" errors\r\n\r\n**Documentation:**\r\n\r\n1. Updated CLI documentation (README.md, test.md)\r\n2. Improved test descriptions and usage examples\r\n\r\n**Testing Validation:**\r\n\r\n1. Updated BATS tests for CLI test command\r\n2. Verified all test types work correctly with name filters\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n- **New Features**\n  - Introduced separate commands for running component tests and end-to-end (E2E) tests, with improved filtering and skipping options.\n  - Added new test utilities and example tests for both component and E2E testing in starter templates.\n  - Added detailed documentation and examples for testing workflows in both plugin and project starter packages.\n\n- **Bug Fixes**\n  - Improved error handling and logging in test runners and test execution.\n\n- **Documentation**\n  - Major updates and restructuring of CLI, plugin, and project starter documentation to clarify testing structure, commands, and examples.\n  - Added new testing guides and removed outdated or redundant documentation.\n\n- **Tests**\n  - Expanded and reorganized test suites for both component and E2E tests.\n  - Added new integration and E2E test cases and utilities.\n  - Updated test scripts to match new command structure and options.\n\n- **Chores**\n  - Updated configuration files and scripts to support new testing workflows and tools.\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",

      "body": "## Description\n\nImprove Eliza's character file and prompts based on initial testing feedback.\n\n## Background\n\nBoris (Feb 2): \"I've talked to Eliza only a little bit, just to test her out. I think she'll definitely need some edits in her character file, some more prompt engineering. She's a good start so far, but there's definitely stuff we're gonna have to work on. It'll be iterative.\"\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Review current character file responses\n- [ ] Identify areas needing improvement\n- [ ] Update character file with better prompts\n- [ ] Add message examples (Ben has PRs for this)\n- [ ] Test with Sonnet model\n- [ ] Iterate based on user feedback\n\n## Technical Notes\n\nBen mentioned:\n\n* Currently using a different model, switching to Sonnet\n* Two PRs coming that add message examples and change model to Sonnet\n* \"Huge difference in price between Sonnet and \\[current model\\]\"\n\nBoris mentioned Sonnet 5 coming out soon - good timing to test on Eliza if cheaper.\n\n## Priority\n\n**P2 - Iterative improvement**",

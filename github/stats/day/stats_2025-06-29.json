      "body": "## Summary\n\nEnhances documentation to clearly communicate that plugin-bootstrap is mandatory for communication and basic agent functionality unless doing heavy customizations.\n\n## Changes Made\n\n### ðŸ“š Documentation Updates\n\n- **FAQ Section**: Enhanced the \"Can I skip the bootstrap plugin?\" section to emphasize it's mandatory for communication\n- **README.md**: Updated plugin-bootstrap description to highlight it as \"Essential communication core\" and \"Required for basic agent functionality\"\n- **Core Plugins Documentation**: Added clear warnings about bootstrap plugin requirement and what happens without it\n- **Quickstart Guide**: Added important note about plugin-bootstrap being essential for communication\n\n### ðŸŽ¯ Key Improvements\n\n- Clarifies that plugin-bootstrap is **mandatory for communication** unless building custom event handling\n- Explains what functionality breaks without plugin-bootstrap (message processing, responses, etc.)\n- Maintains information about IGNORE_BOOTSTRAP for testing purposes\n- Provides clear guidance on when it can be skipped (heavy customizations only)\n\n### ðŸ“‹ Files Changed\n\n- `README.md` - Enhanced plugin-bootstrap description\n- `packages/docs/docs/faq.md` - Improved FAQ answer with emphasis on requirement\n- `packages/docs/docs/core/plugins.md` - Added warnings and requirements section\n- `packages/docs/docs/quickstart.md` - Added important note for new users\n\n## Problem Solved\n\nPreviously, the documentation suggested plugin-bootstrap was \"optional\" or \"should be imported into most agents,\" which led to confusion. Users might skip it thinking it's just nice-to-have, when in reality it contains critical event handlers for message processing and communication.\n\n## Impact\n\n- New users will understand plugin-bootstrap is essential for basic agent functionality\n- Reduces confusion about why agents don't respond when plugin-bootstrap is missing\n- Maintains flexibility for advanced users doing heavy customizations\n- Improves onboarding experience by setting correct expectations",

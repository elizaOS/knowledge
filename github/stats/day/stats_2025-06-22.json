The changes standardize formatting, update descriptions, and enhance response schemas for better clarity and usability.\r\n\r\n### Updates to Existing Endpoints:\r\n\r\n* **Add Agent to Server (`add-agent-to-server.api.mdx`)**:\r\n  - Standardized formatting for strings using double quotes.\r\n  - Updated descriptions to improve clarity (e.g., \"Adds an agent to a messaging server\" changed to \"Add an agent to a server\").\r\n  - Enhanced response schema to include detailed error information for status codes like `400`, `404`, and `500`.\r\n\r\n### Removal of Deprecated Endpoints:\r\n\r\n* **Clear Channel Messages (`clear-channel-messages.api.mdx`)**:\r\n  - Removed the endpoint for clearing all messages from a channel. The file and associated content were deleted entirely.\r\n\r\n### Addition of New Endpoints:\r\n\r\n* **Clear System Logs (`clear-logs.api.mdx`)**:\r\n  - Introduced a new endpoint to delete all system logs.\r\n  - Added response schemas for success (`200`) and error (`500`) scenarios.\r\n* **Complete a Message (`complete-message.api.mdx`)**:\r\n  - Added a new endpoint for generating agent completions for a message.\r\n  - Defined request body schema requiring fields like `agentId`, `roomId`, `userId`, and `prompt`.\r\n  - Included detailed response schemas for success (`200`) and error (`400`, `500`) scenarios.",

      "body": "## Description\n\nTeam alignment on Monday (Feb 2) launch milestone - Eliza App MVP with Calendar + Gmail integration.\n\n## MVP Scope (Monday Launch)\n\nPer Shaw: \"The bare minimum is it does anything and just focus on Google and then we'll add the rest.\"\n\n**What's included:**\n\n* Landing page that redirects to native messaging\n* User can chat with Eliza agent through Telegram/iMessage/Discord\n* **Google Calendar + Gmail integration working** (one workflow)\n* Basic end-to-end flow working\n\n## Launch Strategy\n\nShaw: \"Day one launches, it can manage your calendar and email. Day two, we add Linear. Day three, we add Notion. Day four we add Google Sheets and Docs.\"\n\n**No waitlist/scarcity** - Shaw: \"We'd be lucky if people even sign up... We are in a position of extreme weakness\"\n\n## Team ETAs (Jan 30 meeting)\n\n| Team Member | Status | ETA |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| Stan | N8N plugin almost done, Calendar+Gmail confirmed | Monday ✅ |\n| Ben (Joker) | Merged connections PR, hooking up Telegram/iMessage | Tomorrow (Sat) |\n| Hanzla | PR up for review, tests done, GitHub Actions fixed | Ready pending merge |\n| Rayan | Code ready, waiting on Jasper styling | EOD styling |\n| Sam | Testing workflows e2e, merging to dev | Today |\n| Odili | Twitter provider issues, coder plugins | Early next week |\n\n## Critical Market Context (Shaw)\n\n⚠️ **URGENCY: EXTREME**\n\n* \"We have completely lost mindshare 100%\"\n* \"Chart bled out another 25% on Eliza this week\"\n* \"We're dead. We have one shot to get out of this\"\n* \"There is a wide open window right now for someone to offer this as a one click solution\"\n* \"If we can nail this in a few days we still have that window open\"\n\n## Deployment\n\n* Eliza App → **Vercel** (fastest, already paid)\n* Domain: eliza.app\n\n## Key Decisions\n\n1. No waitlist - frictionless launch\n2. Deploy to Vercel\n3. Test as it ships (limited scope = manageable)\n4. Growth focus - every integration = marketing post\n5. Target: Sunday/Monday release\n\n## Priority\n\n**P0 - LAUNCH MONDAY**",

That Takeover shit is great. We should definitely focus on those kinds of things.\"\n* Shaw: \"That culture jamming stuff is where we'll win\"\n* Target: Early next week, once ducks in a row (X account, website ready)\n\n**Moldbot Integration**\n\n* Shaw: \"Check out Moldbot. There's going to be a whole set of open social graphs that we should attack\"\n* Odili: \"It's basically Babylon. It's a social network, so all the plugin Babylon could be repurposed\"\n* Boris analogy: \"Moldbot is like an agent Reddit, whereas Babylon becomes an agent X\"\n* Shaw: \"We should just make a Babylon plugin for Moldbot. That's a genius idea.\"\n* Odili: \"I have all the bots built, like 18 different bots. We just have them start doing stuff.\"\n\n**Forecaster**\n\n* Shaw has a Forecaster fork of Babylon\n* Long-term: Could fork Babylon to be \"not a game\" → agent social network\n\n## Strategic Context\n\nShaw: \"I really like the AI subversion thing. That's incredible.\"\n\n## Priority\n\n**P2 - Post-launch marketing, early next week**",

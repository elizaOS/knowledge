      "body": "**Describe the bug**\nOn 1.0.17, when I run `elizaos dev` on windows (powershell 7), it tries to load openai plugin (1.0.6) and bootstrap (1.0.15) but it fails to do so using all relevant strategies. It tries to install the plugin, succeeds to install, but fails to load it still.\n\nBecause it can't load openai and bootstrap plugin, it doesn't process any messages sent to it.\n\nHowever, it's able to find @elizaos/plugin-sql so I'm not sure what the difference is.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nOn windows (powershell 7), create a new project and run 'elizaos dev'\n\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nI expect it to load the plugins so that it can handle the messages send from the chat.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n<img width=\"1317\" height=\"576\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b70ff76a-619a-49bd-abe9-83affa8479c3\" />\n\n**Additional context**\n\nI'm on Windows Powershell 7. WSL is installed. I don't have this issue when I run it on my Ubuntu Linux VM.\n\nI cloned the eliza repo and ran 'bun install', 'bun run build' and 'bun start' and it's able to load everything on Windows Powershell 7. So it seems this is only failing when I try running the elizaos commands from a project, but not from the eliza repo itself.",

This causes 404 errors when refreshing any route other than the home page, with error messages like:\n```\n[STATIC] Failed to serve index.html: Not Found\n```\n\n## Solution\nEnhanced the server's path resolution logic to check multiple locations including:\n- Bun's global installation path: `~/.bun/install/global/node_modules/@elizaos/cli/dist`\n- npm's global installation path (via `npm root -g`)\n- Common system-wide installation locations\n- nvm-managed installations\n\n## Changes\n- Modified `packages/server/src/index.ts` to add comprehensive path resolution\n- Added detailed logging to show all searched paths when client files aren't found\n- Used the same resolved path for both static file serving and SPA fallback\n\n## Testing\n- Works correctly in monorepo development environment\n- Resolves the issue for globally installed CLI packages\n- Maintains backward compatibility with existing installations\n\nFixes the issue reported where SPA routing fails on refresh for non-home routes when CLI is installed from npm/bun.",

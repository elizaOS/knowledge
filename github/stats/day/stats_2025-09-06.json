      "number": 5889,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "## Feature Request\n\n### Problem\nAgents currently cannot fetch and analyze web content when users share URLs. This limits their ability to:\n- Summarize articles and documentation\n- Extract information from web pages\n- Analyze content from provided links\n- Access up-to-date information from websites\n\n### Current Workarounds\nCurrently, to enable web fetching, users must:\n1. Configure MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers like `@modelcontextprotocol/server-fetch` or `firecrawl-mcp`\n2. Add the MCP plugin to their agent configuration\n3. Set up environment variables and API keys (for some services)\n\nThis adds complexity and external dependencies for what should be a basic capability.\n\n### Proposed Solution\nAdd native web fetching capability to ElizaOS agents through one of these approaches:\n\n**Option 1: Built-in Action**\n- Add a `FETCH_WEBPAGE` action to the bootstrap plugin\n- Action would fetch URL content, convert HTML to markdown, and summarize\n- Could use the LLM to extract relevant information based on context\n\n**Option 2: Dedicated Plugin**\n- Create `@elizaos/plugin-browser` or `@elizaos/plugin-web`\n- Provide actions for fetching, scraping, and analyzing web content\n- Could include advanced features like JavaScript rendering, screenshot capture\n\n**Option 3: Provider Enhancement**\n- Add web fetching as a provider that supplies web content to the agent's context\n- Could automatically detect URLs in messages and fetch content\n\n### Benefits\n- Agents can access and analyze web content directly\n- Better user experience without complex configuration\n- Reduced dependency on external services\n- More natural interactions when users share links\n\n### Example Use Cases\n- User shares article link → Agent summarizes key points\n- User asks about documentation → Agent fetches and explains relevant sections\n- User shares product page → Agent extracts specifications and reviews\n- User provides research paper → Agent analyzes methodology and findings\n\n### Technical Considerations\n- Security: Need to handle URL validation, timeouts, content size limits\n- Performance: Consider caching fetched content\n- Privacy: Respect robots.txt and user-agent policies\n- Format: Convert HTML to markdown for better LLM processing\n\n### Related Issues/PRs\n- MCP plugin provides this through external servers but requires additional setup\n\nWould love to hear thoughts on the best approach for implementing this core capability!",

Start an agent with image generation capabilities\r\n  2. Request an image generation with a specific prompt (e.g., \"Generate an image of a fish in ice with a tree\")\r\n  3. Verify that the generated image matches the user's request, not the agent's profile\r\n  4. Test with various prompts to ensure consistency\r\n\r\n  ### Before\r\n  - User: \"Generate an image of a fish\"\r\n  - Result: Image of the agent (e.g., Eliza an AI assistant)\r\n\r\n  ### After\r\n  - User: \"Generate an image of a fish\"\r\n  - Result: Image of an actual fish as requested",

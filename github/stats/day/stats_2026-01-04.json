The conversation history exists, but it's orphaned.\n\n## Automatic Addition, Separate Section\n\nThe menu sidebar needs two distinct areas:\n\n```\nMY AGENTS\n  ├── Borko          ← you own this\n  └── Assistant v2   ← you own this\n\nFOLLOWING\n  ├── Shaw's Agent   by @shaw      ← you talked to this\n  └── CryptoBot      by @trader    ← you talked to this\n```\n\nIf everything goes in \"My Agents,\" it gets confusing:\n\n* Which ones can I edit?\n* Which ones do I own?\n* Why can't I change this one's settings?\n\n## Interaction Details\n\n**When does an agent appear in Following?**\n\n* As soon as you send your first message to a public agent you don't own\n\n**Can you remove from Following?**\n\n* Yes—hover reveals \\[✕\\] or right-click \"Remove\"\n* Conversation history is deleted\n\n**What if you Copy an agent you're Following?**\n\n* The copy appears in **My Agents**\n* Original stays in **Following**\n\n**What if the creator makes the agent private? (not sure what's best here)**\n\n* It stays in your Following list\n* But shows \"This agent is no longer public\"\n* Your past conversation history remains visible to you",

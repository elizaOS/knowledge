      "body": "The goal of this plugin-training is to insert as a custom reasoning module which self-trains on the agent's data and the runs online after training. It's very WIP, and demonstrates a few of these steps, such as training a custom DeepSeek distilled model on together.ai from data, and overriding the internal models with the DeepSeek models. Some of it is still vibe code trash.\r\n\r\nIt was developed on the 'next' branch and might need a little work to integrate into current develop, especially wrt how we integrate the custom reasoning. It's also a bit messy and needs some consistency, and we should make CustomReasoningService into a shared IReasoningService type.",

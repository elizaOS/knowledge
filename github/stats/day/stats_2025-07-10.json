Some of it is still vibe code trash.\r\n\r\nIt was developed on the 'next' branch and might need a little work to integrate into current develop, especially wrt how we integrate the custom reasoning. It's also a bit messy and needs some consistency, and we should make CustomReasoningService into a shared IReasoningService type.",

      "author": "wtfsayo",
      "number": 5218,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "## Problem\n\nCurrently, `bun run test` does not work consistently across all packages in the ElizaOS monorepo. This creates several issues:\n\n1. **Inconsistent Developer Experience**: Developers cannot reliably run tests in individual packages\n2. **CI/CD Fragility**: The root `bun test` command fails, making it difficult to validate changes\n3. **Low Test Coverage**: Only 28% of source files have tests (excluding dist files)\n4. **Missing Test Infrastructure**: 29% of packages have no test scripts defined\n\n### Current State Analysis\n\n**Test Coverage by Package:**\n- ‚úÖ **10/14 packages (71%)** have test scripts defined\n- ‚ùå **4/14 packages (29%)** have no test infrastructure\n- üî¥ Root `bun test` fails due to `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` mock initialization errors\n\n**Packages with Issues:**\n1. **No Tests At All:**\n   - `@elizaos/app` - Tauri application\n   - `@elizaos/autodoc` - Documentation generator\n   - `create-eliza` - Scaffolding tool\n   - `@elizaos/docs` - Docusaurus site (expected)\n\n2. **Failing Tests:**\n   - `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` - Mock initialization errors\n   - `@elizaos/project-tee-starter` - Environment setup issues\n\n3. **Excluded from Root Tests:**\n   - `@elizaos/plugin-starter` (template)\n   - `@elizaos/docs` (documentation)\n   - `@elizaos/plugin-sql` (has tests but excluded)\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nImplement a phased approach to ensure all packages have working tests:\n\n### Phase 1: Fix Failing Tests (Priority: High)\n- [ ] Fix `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` mock initialization errors\n- [ ] Fix `@elizaos/project-tee-starter` environment setup issues\n- [ ] Ensure root `bun test` command passes\n\n### Phase 2: Add Missing Test Infrastructure (Priority: High)\n- [ ] Add test setup to `@elizaos/app` (Tauri app testing)\n- [ ] Add test setup to `@elizaos/autodoc`\n- [ ] Add test setup to `create-eliza`\n- [ ] Create minimal test files to validate setup\n\n### Phase 3: Standardize Test Configuration (Priority: Medium)\n- [ ] Create shared test configuration for consistency\n- [ ] Standardize coverage reporting (exclude dist/, build/, node_modules/)\n- [ ] Add coverage thresholds per package\n- [ ] Ensure all packages use Bun test runner consistently\n\n### Phase 4: Documentation & CI Updates (Priority: Medium)\n- [ ] Update contributing guide with testing requirements\n- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for test validation\n- [ ] Update CI workflows to run package-specific tests\n- [ ] Create testing best practices documentation\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### 1. Shared Test Configuration\nCreate a base test configuration that all packages can extend:\n\n```typescript\n// packages/test-config/base.config.ts\nexport default {\n  testMatch: [\"**/*.test.ts\", \"**/*.spec.ts\"],\n  coverage: {\n    exclude: [\n      \"**/dist/**\",\n      \"**/build/**\",\n      \"**/node_modules/**\",\n      \"**/*.d.ts\",\n      \"**/coverage/**\"\n    ],\n    threshold: {\n      statements: 60,\n      branches: 60,\n      functions: 60,\n      lines: 60\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Package Test Script Standardization\nEnsure every package.json has:\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"bun test\",\n    \"test:coverage\": \"bun test --coverage\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Fix Root Test Command\nUpdate root package.json to handle package-specific test requirements:\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"turbo run test --filter=\\!@elizaos/docs --filter=\\!@elizaos/plugin-starter\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] `bun run test` works in every package directory\n- [ ] Root `bun test` command passes without errors\n- [ ] All packages have at least minimal test coverage\n- [ ] Test coverage reporting excludes dist/build artifacts\n- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs all tests successfully\n- [ ] Developer documentation updated with testing guidelines\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Improved Developer Experience**: Consistent testing commands across all packages\n2. **Better Code Quality**: Increased test coverage from 28% to target 60%+\n3. **Reliable CI/CD**: All PRs validated with comprehensive test suite\n4. **Easier Onboarding**: New contributors can confidently run tests\n5. **Reduced Bugs**: Catch issues early with standardized testing\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n1. **Using Different Test Runners**: Considered Jest/Vitest but Bun test is already established\n2. **Monorepo-level Testing Only**: Would miss package-specific issues\n3. **Excluding Packages from Testing**: Would leave gaps in coverage\n\n## Additional Context\n\n- Current test coverage is ~28% (excluding dist files)\n- The monorepo uses Turbo for orchestration\n- Bun test runner is the standard across the project\n- Some packages have E2E tests (client) that need special handling\n\nThis improvement will significantly enhance the development workflow and code quality across the ElizaOS project.",

      "body": "This commit introduces comprehensive updates to enable building, testing, and releasing your Tauri application (`packages/app`) across desktop (Linux, macOS, Windows) and mobile (Android, iOS) platforms.\r\n\r\nKey changes include:\r\n\r\n1.  **Tauri Configuration (`packages/app/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`):**\r\n    *   I updated the Content Security Policy (CSP) to allow connections to the\r\n        designated mobile backend (`https://api.eliza.how`).\r\n    *   I added initial (placeholder) configurations for Android and iOS to\r\n        prepare for mobile builds.\r\n\r\n2.  **Mobile Dependencies (`packages/app/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`):**\r\n    *   I added `tauri-plugin-mobile` to support mobile-specific functionalities.\r\n\r\n3.  **CI Workflow (`tauri-ci.yml`):**\r\n    *   I expanded the test build matrix to include `macos-latest` and\r\n        `windows-latest` alongside `ubuntu-latest`.\r\n    *   I added installation of WebView2 for Windows runners.\r\n    *   I ensured `tauri build --debug` runs for all desktop platforms.\r\n\r\n4.  **Release Workflow (`tauri-release.yml`):**\r\n    *   I significantly enhanced this to support multi-platform releases:\r\n        *   **Windows Desktop:** Uncommented and configured.\r\n        *   **Android:** Added new job with JDK, Android SDK/NDK setup.\r\n          Builds APKs (currently unsigned with a dummy keystore).\r\n        *   **iOS:** Added new job for `macos-latest`. Builds IPAs\r\n          (placeholder steps for code signing).\r\n    *   I installed necessary dependencies (WebView2 for Windows, Java/Android\r\n        tools for Android).\r\n    *   I added required Rust targets for all platforms.\r\n    *   I configured artifact uploading for all platforms (`.AppImage`, `.deb`,\r\n        `.dmg`, `.exe`, `.apk`, `.ipa`).\r\n    *   I updated the GitHub Release step to include all generated artifacts.\r\n    *   I included placeholders for Android and iOS signing secrets.\r\n\r\n5.  **Documentation (`README.md`):**\r\n    *   I added a new section \"Tauri Application CI/CD and Signing\" detailing\r\n        the CI/CD setup, the external backend strategy for mobile, and the\r\n        list of required GitHub secrets for proper app signing on Android\r\n        and iOS.\r\n\r\nThis work assumes your mobile applications will connect to an external server (`https://api.eliza.how`) rather than bundling the Node.js backend. The CI workflows now provide a robust foundation for building and distributing your application across all targeted platforms. Further work will be needed to implement full mobile signing by adding the required secrets to the GitHub repository.\r\n\r\n<!-- Use this template by filling in information and copying and pasting relevant items out of the HTML comments. -->\r\n\r\n# Relates to\r\n\r\n<!-- LINK TO ISSUE OR TICKET -->\r\n\r\n<!-- This risks section must be filled out before the final review and merge. -->\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nLow, medium, large.

      "title": "Web UI dashboard exists but is completely undocumented (users don't know how to interact with their agent)",
      "author": "thedotmack",
      "number": 5857,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "**Describe the bug**\n\nThe ElizaOS documentation (including the Quickstart guide) completely fails to mention that there's a web interface/dashboard available after starting an agent. The startup logs show \"Go to the dashboard at http://localhost:3001\" but this crucial information is NEVER mentioned in the documentation, leaving users confused about how to interact with their agent.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Go to the ElizaOS documentation/quickstart\n2. Follow all installation steps:\n   - Install dependencies (`bun install`)\n   - Configure environment variables\n   - Set up character configuration\n   - Run `bun start` or `npm start`\n3. See output: `[INFO] Client http listening on port 3001`\n4. Try to figure out how to talk to your agent\n5. Search entire documentation for \"web UI\", \"browser\", \"localhost:3000\", \"how to chat\"\n6. Find nothing about the web interface\n7. Assume you need to configure Telegram/Discord just to test the agent\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nAfter starting the agent, the documentation should clearly state:\n- \"Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to access the web chat interface\"\n- This should be prominently displayed in the quickstart guide\n- Should appear immediately after the \"start your agent\" step\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nCurrent quickstart ends with starting the agent - no mention of the dashboard:\n```\n# Start your agent\nbun start\n```\n*[Documentation just... stops here - no mention of the dashboard URL]*\n\nMeanwhile, the ACTUAL console output shows this ONE critical line buried in 100+ lines of logs:\n```\n[2025-09-01 00:11:19] INFO: Loaded character: Eliza\nBYPASS: Using postgres URL from environment variable\n[2025-09-01 00:11:19] INFO: Using local @elizaos/server installation\n[... 50+ MORE LINES OF LOGS ...]\n[2025-09-01 00:11:20] INFO: [STATIC] Serving static files from: ./node_modules/@elizaos/server/dist/client\n[2025-09-01 00:11:20] INFO: [SocketIO] Router initialized with 0 agents\n[2025-09-01 00:11:20] INFO: [SocketIO] Setting up Socket.IO event listeners\nStartup successful!\nGo to the dashboard at http://localhost:3001  <--- THIS ONE LINE IS THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW\nAgentServer is listening on port 3001\n[2025-09-01 00:11:21] INFO: Final plugins being loaded:\n[2025-09-01 00:11:21] INFO: Running plugin migrations...\n[... 20+ MORE LINES OF LOGS CONTINUE AFTER ...]\n```\n\nThe critical \"Go to the dashboard\" message is:\n- Buried in the middle of 108 lines of startup logs\n- Surrounded by technical INFO messages about plugins, migrations, and socket handlers\n- Easy to miss as it scrolls by with all the other output\n- The ONLY indication that a web UI even exists\n\nThe logs literally tell you \"Go to the dashboard\" but:\n- That there IS a dashboard\n- That there IS a web UI\n- That you should look for this URL in the logs\n- That this is how you interact with your agent\n\n**Additional context**\n\n- The dashboard URL appears on line 65 of 108 lines of startup output - completely buried in technical logs\n- Most users will never notice this ONE line among all the INFO messages about plugins, migrations, and socket handlers\n- The startup logs DO show \"Go to the dashboard\" but it's buried in a wall of text that scrolls by quickly\n- The docs don't even mention that a dashboard/web UI EXISTS, let alone tell users to look for it in the logs\n- Users are forced to configure unnecessary integrations (Telegram/Discord/Twitter) just to test their agent because they don't know about the web UI\n- Even the llms.txt file mentions WebSocket connections and API endpoints but not the dashboard\n- This is a critical onboarding issue - new users literally cannot figure out how to interact with the thing they just installed\n- The fix is trivial: add to the quickstart \"After starting, your agent will display 'Go to the dashboard at http://localhost:xxxx' - open this URL in your browser to chat with your agent\"",

      "title": "fix: Logger API to Capture All Logs Including Namespaced Agent Logs",
      "author": "tcm390",
      "number": 5900,
      "body": "related: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/5886\r\n\r\nresult: \r\n\r\n<img width=\"614\" height=\"837\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-08 at 6 47 19 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ca700fa-f1a9-46ea-b1f6-baaaa2928b89\" />\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a critical issue where the logging API (`/api/server/logs`) was showing `undefined` for logger destinations and failing to capture agent-specific namespaced logs. The fix ensures that all logs, including those from agent runtimes with namespaces like `#Eliza (Default)`, are properly captured and displayed with correct log levels (warn=40, error=50, info=30, etc.).\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nThe original issue had several components:\r\n\r\n1. **Undefined Logger Destination**: The logging API was trying to access a Pino-style destination (`Symbol.for('pino-destination')`) but ElizaOS uses Adze logger, causing `undefined` errors.\r\n\r\n2. **Missing Namespaced Logs**: Agent-specific logs with namespaces (e.g., `#Eliza (Default)`) were not being captured in the in-memory destination because sealed Adze instances don't trigger the global `adzeStore` listener.\r\n\r\n3. **Incorrect Log Levels**: All logs were showing as level 30 (info) instead of their actual levels (warn=40, error=50) due to missing level information in the string output.\r\n\r\n4. **ANSI Escape Sequence Issues**: Log parsing was failing due to ANSI color codes in terminal output.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n### 1. Core Logger Fix (`packages/core/src/logger.ts` & `logger.browser.ts`)\r\n\r\n- **Fixed Namespaced Log Capture**: Modified the `invoke` function to manually write all log messages (including namespaced ones) to the `globalInMemoryDestination`\r\n- **Preserved Log Levels**: Ensured that log entries maintain their correct numeric levels (40 for warn, 50 for error, etc.)\r\n- **Enhanced String Output**: Updated `recentLogs()` to include level information in the format \"TIMESTAMP LEVEL MESSAGE\"\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// Key fix: Capture all logs in invoke function\r\nconst entry: LogEntry = {\r\n  time: Date.now(),\r\n  level: LOG_LEVEL_PRIORITY[method.toLowerCase()] || LOG_LEVEL_PRIORITY.info,\r\n  msg,\r\n};\r\nglobalInMemoryDestination.write(entry);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Logging API Fix (`packages/server/src/api/runtime/logging.ts`)\r\n\r\n- **Removed Pino Dependencies**: Replaced Pino-specific destination access with ElizaOS `recentLogs()` function\r\n- **Added ANSI Parsing**: Implemented regex to strip ANSI escape sequences before parsing log strings\r\n- **Fixed Level Parsing**: Added proper mapping from level strings to numeric values\r\n- **Improved Error Handling**: Added robust fallback parsing for malformed log lines\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// Key fix: ANSI escape sequence removal and level parsing\r\nconst cleanLine = line.replace(/\\u001B\\[[0-9;]*m/g, '');\r\nconst logMatch = cleanLine.match(/^(\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}T\\d{2}:\\d{2}:\\d{2}\\.\\d{3}Z)\\s+(\\w+)\\s+(.+)$/);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThe fix has been tested to ensure:\r\n\r\n- ✅ All log types (info, warn, error, fatal) show correct levels in API response\r\n- ✅ Namespaced agent logs are captured and accessible via API\r\n- ✅ ANSI escape sequences are properly handled\r\n- ✅ API returns structured log data with proper timestamps and levels\r\n- ✅ Both browser and Node.js environments are supported\r\n\r\n## Files Changed\r\n\r\n- `packages/core/src/logger.ts` - Main logger implementation\r\n- `packages/core/src/logger.browser.ts` - Browser-compatible logger\r\n- `packages/server/src/api/runtime/logging.ts` - Logging API endpoint\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\nNone. This is a bug fix that maintains backward compatibility while improving functionality.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\n- **Developers**: Can now properly monitor all agent logs including runtime-specific messages\r\n- **Operations**: Better observability and debugging capabilities for agent behavior\r\n- **UI**: Logging interfaces will show correct log levels with proper color coding\r\n- **Agent Development**: Enhanced visibility into agent decision-making and error handling\r\n",

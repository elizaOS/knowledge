Instead, treat verification failures as non-fatal: warn and proceed so tests can continue.\\n- Keep GitHub-based installs unverified (unchanged) because source repos may not be importable immediately in ephemeral contexts.\\n- No changes to user-facing commands; only affects internal install verification behavior.\\n\\nWhy\\n- This preserves correctness: we still attempt to verify and log failures.\\n- Prevents CI flakes where optional verification blocks entire suite.\\n\\nFollow-ups\\n- Windows agent CRUD path quoting will be fixed in a separate PR.\\n- If residual failures remain, we can further narrow verification for specific command contexts only during tests.",

Browser keeps `crypto-browserify`.\\n- Adjusted `index.node.ts` and `index.browser.ts` exports accordingly.\\n\\nWhy\\n- Recent Actions failures show CLI tests cannot resolve `@elizaos/server` due to a transitive missing polyfill: `crypto-browserify` referenced by `@elizaos/core/dist/node/index.node.js`.\\n- This caused server startup to fail in ephemeral test projects, leading to repeated port wait timeouts and cascading \"Command timed out\" errors on ubuntu/macos.\\n\\nImpact\\n- Node consumers use Node `crypto`; browser builds unchanged.\\n- Should allow ephemeral projects in CLI tests to resolve core without requiring browser polyfills in Node context, unblocking ubuntu/macos runs.\\n\\nFollow-ups\\n- If any residual module resolution issues remain, ensure the ephemeral test project still installs `@elizaos/server` before server start.\\n- Windows-specific path quoting issues in agent CRUD will be addressed in a separate PR.\\n\\nReferences\\n- Failed run: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/actions/runs/17354263640\\n- Errors: \"ResolveMessage: Cannot find package 'crypto-browserify'...\" and \"Cannot find module '@elizaos/server'...\" seen across ubuntu/macos.",

      "author": "ChristopherTrimboli",
      "number": 5852,
      "body": "## üêõ Fix: NPM Deployment Path Resolution Issue\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\nWhen the CLI is published to NPM and installed globally (e.g., `bun i -g @elizaos/cli`), it fails with the error:\r\n```\r\nCannot find module '/home/runner/work/eliza/eliza/packages/cli/package.json'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis occurs because the build process in GitHub Actions CI/CD embeds absolute paths from the build machine, which don't exist on users' machines.\r\n\r\n### Root Cause\r\nThe CLI was using **build-time path resolution** with `require.resolve('@elizaos/cli/package.json')` which gets hardcoded to the GitHub Actions runner path during the build process.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nChanged all path resolution to happen at **runtime** with multiple fallback strategies to handle different installation scenarios:\r\n- ‚úÖ Global NPM/Bun installations\r\n- ‚úÖ Local node_modules (as dependency)\r\n- ‚úÖ Monorepo development\r\n- ‚úÖ Various package manager locations\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\n#### 1. **`src/utils/copy-template.ts`**\r\n- Added `getGlobalNodeModulesPaths()` helper to detect global installation directories\r\n- Replaced `require.resolve()` with runtime path resolution\r\n- Added fallback paths for templates and package.json\r\n\r\n#### 2. **`src/utils/display-banner.ts`**\r\n- Implemented multi-strategy version detection:\r\n  1. Check monorepo context\r\n  2. Check `ELIZAOS_CLI_VERSION` env var (embedded during build)\r\n  3. Try multiple package.json locations\r\n  4. Extract from installation path as fallback\r\n- Returns `'unknown'` instead of crashing when package.json not found\r\n\r\n#### 3. **`build.ts`**\r\n- Reads version from package.json at build time\r\n- Embeds version as `process.env.ELIZAOS_CLI_VERSION`\r\n- Copies package.json to dist/ for runtime access\r\n\r\n#### 4. **`package.json`**\r\n- Added `dist/package.json` to files array for NPM package inclusion\r\n\r\n#### 5. **`src/utils/user-environment.ts`**\r\n- Updated CLI info detection with runtime fallbacks\r\n- Silent failures (no warnings) as this is expected in some environments\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n```bash\r\n# Build and pack\r\ncd packages/cli\r\nbun run build\r\nnpm pack\r\n\r\n# Test installation\r\ncd /tmp\r\nbun i -g ./elizaos-cli-*.tgz\r\nelizaos create  # Should work without path errors\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Verification\r\n- [x] No hardcoded `/home/runner` paths in built files\r\n- [x] Works in monorepo development\r\n- [x] Works when installed globally via NPM/Bun\r\n- [x] Works as local dependency\r\n- [x] Graceful fallbacks when paths not found\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n- Fixes #[issue-number] - CLI fails when installed from NPM\r\n- No breaking changes\r\n- Backward compatible with existing installations\r\n\r\n### Related Issues\r\nThis is a critical fix for the v1.5.2 release as it prevents users from using the CLI when installed from NPM.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Note to reviewers:** The key insight is that all path resolution must happen at runtime, not build time, to support the various ways users might install and run the CLI.",

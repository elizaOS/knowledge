      "body": "## PR: Fix `elizaos create` command build failure for new projects\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\nThe `elizaos create` command was failing when building newly created projects with the error:\r\n```\r\nCannot find module '../../build-utils' from '/path/to/project/build.ts'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis occurred because the template packages (`project-starter`, `project-tee-starter`, `plugin-starter`, `plugin-quick-starter`) contained `build.ts` files that referenced the monorepo's shared `build-utils.ts` using relative paths (`../../build-utils`). When these templates were copied to new project locations by the CLI's create command, those relative paths became invalid.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nReplaced the build scripts in all template packages with self-contained versions that don't depend on external utilities. Each template now has its own complete build logic using Bun's native build API directly.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n- **`eliza/packages/project-starter/build.ts`** - Self-contained build script for regular projects\r\n- **`eliza/packages/project-tee-starter/build.ts`** - Self-contained build script for TEE projects  \r\n- **`eliza/packages/plugin-starter/build.ts`** - Self-contained build script for plugins\r\n- **`eliza/packages/plugin-quick-starter/build.ts`** - Self-contained build script for quick plugins\r\n\r\n### Key Improvements\r\n1. **Templates are now fully self-contained** - They work correctly regardless of where they're copied to\r\n2. **Simplified build process** - Direct use of Bun's build API without abstraction layers\r\n3. **Maintained functionality** - All original features preserved (TypeScript declarations, source maps, etc.)\r\n4. **Better error handling** - Clear error messages and graceful handling of TypeScript declaration generation failures\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThe changes ensure that:\r\n- `elizaos create` command successfully creates new projects\r\n- Created projects can be built with `bun run build` without errors\r\n- Projects work correctly when placed anywhere in the filesystem, not just within the monorepo\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nThis fix resolves a critical issue that prevented new users from successfully creating and building ElizaOS projects using the CLI. The change is backwards compatible and doesn't affect existing projects or the monorepo's internal build process.",

Removing problematic `.d.ts` file creation that re-exports from missing `src/` directories\r\n  2. Pointing `package.json` to the existing, properly generated TypeScript declarations\r\n  3. Using the robust type definitions already created by the build system\r\n\r\n  ## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n  **Bug fix** (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n  ## Why are we doing this?\r\n\r\n  After PR #5832, consumers of the published npm package experience TypeScript compilation failures:\r\n\r\n  ```typescript\r\n  error TS2305: Module '\"@elizaos/core\"' has no exported member 'IAgentRuntime'.\r\n  error TS2305: Module '\"@elizaos/core\"' has no exported member 'Plugin'.\r\n  error TS2305: Module '\"@elizaos/core\"' has no exported member 'logger'.\r\n  ```\r\n  Root cause: The build script creates .d.ts files that reference src/ directories:\r\n  await fs.writeFile('dist/node/index.d.ts', `export * from '../../src/index.node';`);\r\n\r\n  However, src/ is not included in the published npm package, breaking type resolution.\r\n\r\n#    Testing\r\n\r\n##   Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n  1. Review the changes in packages/core/build.ts and packages/core/package.json\r\n  2. Verify that dist/types/index.d.ts contains the actual TypeScript declarations\r\n  3. Test that TypeScript compilation works with the fixed package\r\n\r\n##    Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n  - Clone the repository and checkout this branch\r\n  - Build the core package: cd packages/core && bun run build\r\n  - Verify dist/types/index.d.ts exists and contains proper type definitions\r\n  - Test in a consuming package:\r\n  import { IAgentRuntime, Plugin, logger } from '@elizaos/core';\r\n  // Should compile without errors\r\n  - Run npx tsc --noEmit to verify TypeScript compilation succeeds\r\n\r\n## Before\r\n\r\n  error TS2305: Module '\"@elizaos/core\"' has no exported member 'IAgentRuntime'.\r\n  error TS2305: Module '\"@elizaos/core\"' has no exported member 'Plugin'.\r\n  error TS2305: Module '\"@elizaos/core\"' has no exported member 'logger'.\r\n\r\n## After\r\n\r\n  ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds\r\n  ✅ All exports properly typed\r\n  ✅ Compatible with Node.js and browser builds",

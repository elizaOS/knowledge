      "author": "wtfsayo",
      "number": 5185,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "# Standardize Testing Framework: Migrate from vitest to bun:test\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe ElizaOS monorepo currently uses a mixed testing setup with both `vitest` and `bun:test`, creating inconsistency and potential maintenance overhead. Since the project already uses bun as the package manager and runtime, standardizing on `bun:test` would provide better integration and consistency across the codebase.\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n**vitest Usage (extensive):**\n- 21+ `vitest.config.ts` files across packages\n- vitest listed as devDependency in root `package.json` and multiple package-specific `package.json` files\n- Used in: `@elizaos/core`, `@elizaos/cli`, `@elizaos/plugin-sql`, `@elizaos/server`, `@elizaos/client`, and others\n- Documentation specifically mentions \"Component tests use **Vitest**\"\n- Test scripts in packages use `vitest run`, `vitest watch`, etc.\n\n**bun:test Usage (minimal):**\n- Only 1 `bunfig.toml` file found in `packages/cli`\n- Limited configuration: just test preload setup\n- No evidence of extensive bun:test usage in test files\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nMigrate the entire monorepo to use `bun:test` exclusively, removing vitest dependencies and configurations while maintaining all existing test functionality.\n\n## Benefits of bun:test\n\n1. **Consistency**: Single testing framework aligned with bun package manager usage\n2. **Performance**: Native bun testing typically faster than vitest\n3. **Simplicity**: Reduced dependency count and configuration complexity\n4. **Maintenance**: One less external dependency to maintain and update\n5. **Integration**: Better integration with bun's built-in development tools\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Preparation\n- [ ] Audit all test files to identify vitest-specific APIs that need migration\n- [ ] Create bun:test configuration templates for different package types\n- [ ] Update test utilities in `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap/__tests__/test-utils` for bun:test compatibility\n\n### Phase 2: Core Packages Migration\n- [ ] Migrate `@elizaos/core` package\n  - [ ] Replace `vitest.config.ts` with appropriate `bunfig.toml`\n  - [ ] Update test imports (`describe`, `it`, `expect`, etc.)\n  - [ ] Update package.json test scripts\n  - [ ] Verify all 9 test files work with bun:test\n- [ ] Migrate `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` (contains test utilities used by other packages)\n\n### Phase 3: Application Packages Migration\n- [ ] Migrate `@elizaos/cli` package\n  - [ ] Update existing `bunfig.toml` configuration\n  - [ ] Replace vitest scripts with bun:test equivalents\n  - [ ] Update `run-all-tests.sh` script\n  - [ ] Ensure compatibility with BATS tests (keep separate)\n- [ ] Migrate `@elizaos/server` package\n  - [ ] Handle both `vitest.config.ts` and `vitest.config.integration.ts`\n  - [ ] Update integration test setup\n- [ ] Migrate `@elizaos/client` package\n\n### Phase 4: Plugin Packages Migration\n- [ ] Migrate `@elizaos/plugin-sql` (complex test suite)\n- [ ] Migrate remaining plugin packages\n- [ ] Update plugin templates to use bun:test\n\n### Phase 5: Documentation & Templates\n- [ ] Update `/packages/docs/docs/core/testing.md` \n- [ ] Update plugin and project starter templates\n- [ ] Update CLI template generation to use bun:test configuration\n\n### Phase 6: Cleanup\n- [ ] Remove vitest dependencies from all package.json files\n- [ ] Remove all vitest.config.ts files\n- [ ] Update root-level test scripts and turbo.json configuration\n- [ ] Update CI/CD workflows if needed\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All existing tests pass with bun:test\n- [ ] No vitest dependencies remain in any package.json\n- [ ] No vitest configuration files remain\n- [ ] Test coverage functionality maintained (if used)\n- [ ] CI/CD pipeline works with bun:test\n- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect bun:test usage\n- [ ] New project templates use bun:test by default\n- [ ] All test scripts use bun:test commands\n- [ ] Performance benchmarks show no regression (preferably improvement)\n\n## Migration Considerations\n\n**Potential Challenges:**\n1. **API Differences**: Some vitest-specific APIs may not have direct bun:test equivalents\n2. **Coverage Reports**: Ensure test coverage functionality is maintained\n3. **IDE Integration**: Verify IDE/editor test runners work with bun:test\n4. **CI Performance**: Monitor CI build times during transition\n5. **Complex Test Configurations**: Some packages have sophisticated vitest configurations that need careful translation\n\n**Risk Mitigation:**\n- Migrate packages incrementally to catch issues early\n- Maintain comprehensive test suite throughout migration\n- Keep detailed documentation of configuration changes\n- Test in CI environment before merging changes\n\n## Related Files\n\n**High-priority migration targets:**\n- `packages/core/vitest.config.ts` (9 test files)\n- `packages/cli/vitest.config.ts` (extensive test suite)\n- `packages/plugin-sql/vitest.config.ts` (complex integration tests)\n- `packages/server/vitest.config.ts` & `vitest.config.integration.ts`\n- `packages/docs/docs/core/testing.md` (documentation)\n\n**Configuration files to update:**\n- Root `package.json` (remove vitest devDependency)\n- Individual package `package.json` files\n- `turbo.json` (if test pipeline configuration needs updates)\n\n---\n\nThis migration will significantly simplify the testing infrastructure while maintaining all existing functionality and improving consistency across the ElizaOS monorepo.",

      "number": 5309,
      "body": "## Summary\n\nEnhances documentation to clearly communicate that plugin-bootstrap is mandatory for communication and basic agent functionality unless doing heavy customizations.\n\n## Changes Made\n\n### 📚 Documentation Updates\n\n- **FAQ Section**: Enhanced the \"Can I skip the bootstrap plugin?\" section to emphasize it's mandatory for communication\n- **README.md**: Updated plugin-bootstrap description to highlight it as \"Essential communication core\" and \"Required for basic agent functionality\"\n- **Core Plugins Documentation**: Added clear warnings about bootstrap plugin requirement and what happens without it\n- **Quickstart Guide**: Added important note about plugin-bootstrap being essential for communication\n\n### 🎯 Key Improvements\n\n- Clarifies that plugin-bootstrap is **mandatory for communication** unless building custom event handling\n- Explains what functionality breaks without plugin-bootstrap (message processing, responses, etc.)\n- Maintains information about IGNORE_BOOTSTRAP for testing purposes\n- Provides clear guidance on when it can be skipped (heavy customizations only)\n\n### 📋 Files Changed\n\n- `README.md` - Enhanced plugin-bootstrap description\n- `packages/docs/docs/faq.md` - Improved FAQ answer with emphasis on requirement\n- `packages/docs/docs/core/plugins.md` - Added warnings and requirements section\n- `packages/docs/docs/quickstart.md` - Added important note for new users\n\n## Problem Solved\n\nPreviously, the documentation suggested plugin-bootstrap was \"optional\" or \"should be imported into most agents,\" which led to confusion. Users might skip it thinking it's just nice-to-have, when in reality it contains critical event handlers for message processing and communication.\n\n## Impact\n\n- New users will understand plugin-bootstrap is essential for basic agent functionality\n- Reduces confusion about why agents don't respond when plugin-bootstrap is missing\n- Maintains flexibility for advanced users doing heavy customizations\n- Improves onboarding experience by setting correct expectations",

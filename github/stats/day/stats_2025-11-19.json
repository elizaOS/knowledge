      "body": "Hi ElizaOS team,\n\nI’m trying to complete the AI16Z → ElizaOS migration, but I’m running into two major issues and Discord support has become unreliable due to impersonators. I need help from the real development team to determine the correct path.\n\nMy situation:\n\n• I purchased AI16Z tokens on Oct 26 using my Phantom wallet.  \n• I then moved them to my Tangem wallet for safety.  \n• On Nov 11 (snapshot date), the tokens were held inside my Tangem wallet.  \n• The migration portal shows my Phantom wallet as “0 eligible” (expected since Phantom didn’t hold them during snapshot).  \n• I cannot connect my Tangem wallet to the migration portal because WalletConnect does not support Tangem.  \n• My Tangem wallet was created using key cards only, so I do not have a seed phrase to export into Phantom.\n\nThe Discord server is currently compromised — multiple impersonators posing as support are entering tickets and attempting to direct users to send tokens manually. Because of this, I cannot rely on Discord support or email responses that appear to be spoofed.\n\nWhat I need from the real team:\n\n1. Confirmation of whether Tangem-held tokens during the snapshot are eligible for migration.  \n2. Whether a manual backend whitelist update is possible so my Phantom wallet can perform migration safely.  \n3. If not, what the official and safe method is for users whose eligible snapshot wallet cannot connect to the portal (Tangem case).  \n4. Any announcements regarding potential whitelist updates or support for non-exportable wallets.\n\nI have NOT sent my tokens anywhere and I have NOT interacted with any unofficial links. My tokens are safe. I’m only seeking official guidance from the verifiable team here on GitHub.\n\nThank you — I appreciate your time. I prefer to resolve this safely through GitHub to avoid Discord impersonation issues.",

      "author": "LinuxIsCool",
      "number": 6159,
      "body": "# Relates to\r\n\r\nFixes excessive vertical spacing in AI-generated markdown responses in the ElizaOS client UI.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n**Low Risk**\r\n\r\n- Only CSS changes affecting markdown content rendering\r\n- Uses well-supported CSS features (Chrome 58+, Firefox 37+, Safari 11.1+, Edge 79+)\r\n- No breaking changes to functionality\r\n- Fully backward compatible\r\n- Simple rollback (revert commit)\r\n\r\n**Affected areas:**\r\n- Client UI markdown rendering (packages/client)\r\n- AI response display formatting\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nFixes excessive vertical spacing in AI-generated markdown responses caused by Streamdown's wrapper `<div>` elements. Uses CSS `display: contents` to collapse wrapper spacing while preserving all content and functionality.\r\n\r\n**Key improvements:**\r\n- Bullet gaps: 24.5px → 2px (-91%)\r\n- List item gaps: 30.5px → 8px (-73%)\r\n- Header-to-bullets: 28.5px → 4px (-83%)\r\n- List-to-paragraph: 145.5px → 16px (-89%)\r\n- **Total spacing error eliminated: 178.5px → 0px**\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- ✅ Bug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- ✅ Improvements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- ✅ My changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\nThe changes are internal CSS improvements with no API or configuration changes.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the CSS changes in `packages/client/src/index.css` (lines 184-278)\r\n2. Review the component update in `packages/client/src/components/ai-elements/response.tsx` (line 12)\r\n3. Test the visual improvements in the running client\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n### Automated Testing\r\n- ✅ Playwright browser automation with pixel-perfect measurements\r\n- ✅ Computed style verification\r\n- ✅ DOM structure inspection\r\n- ✅ All spacing measurements achieved targets with 0.0px error\r\n\r\n### Manual Testing Instructions\r\n\r\n1. Checkout this branch:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   git checkout fix/markdown-spacing-compact\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Install dependencies and start client:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   bun install\r\n   cd packages/client && bun run dev\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. Open browser to client UI (http://localhost:5173)\r\n\r\n4. Start a chat with any agent\r\n\r\n5. Ask a question that generates nested lists, for example:\r\n   - \"Explain the key features of this system\"\r\n   - \"Create a list view with example data showing nested workflow progress\"\r\n\r\n6. Verify:\r\n   - ✅ Compact, readable spacing between list items\r\n   - ✅ Tight spacing (4px) between headers and their following lists\r\n   - ✅ No overlapping text\r\n   - ✅ Proper visual hierarchy maintained\r\n   - ✅ No console errors\r\n   - ✅ Smooth scrolling works correctly\r\n\r\n### Tested Scenarios\r\n- ✅ Complex nested lists (numbered and bulleted)\r\n- ✅ Mixed content (paragraphs, lists, headings)\r\n- ✅ Scrolling and overflow behavior\r\n- ✅ Accessibility (screen reader, keyboard navigation)\r\n- ✅ No layout breakage in any scenario\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n<img width=\"3840\" height=\"2080\" alt=\"before\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/459f89bf-c623-4ad4-aa36-ce4a0f997033\" />\r\n*Excessive spacing between elements, particularly noticeable in nested lists*\r\n\r\n### After\r\n<img width=\"3840\" height=\"2080\" alt=\"after\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4addcb5-5dab-45fb-8e0f-e5dda4885d11\" />\r\n*Compact, readable spacing matching design targets and Claude web interface*\r\n\r\n# Technical Details\r\n\r\n## Files Changed\r\n- `packages/client/src/index.css` (+109 lines)\r\n- `packages/client/src/components/ai-elements/response.tsx` (1 line modified)\r\n\r\n## Key Technical Approach\r\n\r\nUses CSS `display: contents` to make Streamdown's wrapper divs \"transparent\" to layout:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.markdown-content > div {\r\n  display: contents !important;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis removes wrapper divs from the box tree while preserving DOM structure and semantics, eliminating the spacing contribution from Tailwind's `space-y-4` class.\r\n\r\n## Browser Compatibility\r\n\r\n| Browser | Version | Status |\r\n|---------|---------|--------|\r\n| Chrome | 58+ (May 2017) | ✅ Supported |\r\n| Firefox | 37+ (March 2015) | ✅ Supported |\r\n| Safari | 11.1+ (March 2018) | ✅ Supported |\r\n| Edge | 79+ (January 2020) | ✅ Supported |\r\n\r\nCovers >95% of modern browser users.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**PR Title:**\r\n```\r\nfix(client): Fix excessive spacing in markdown rendered content\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Branch details:**\r\n- Base branch: `develop`\r\n- Compare branch: `fix/markdown-spacing-compact` (from gaiaaiagent/GAIA)",

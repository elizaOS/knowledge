Check if dev script would run  to prevent recursion  \n2. Validate client directory existence before attempting to start client server\n3. Skip client startup when it would cause infinite loops\n\nBased on commits:\n- 89ab5119c7 Merge branch 'fix/cli-dev-missing-client-loop' of https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza into fix/cli-dev-missing-client-loop",

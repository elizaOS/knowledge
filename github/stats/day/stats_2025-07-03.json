      "body": "## Summary\n\nThis PR implements a comprehensive testing infrastructure for the ElizaOS CLI, addressing issue #5325. The new testing framework provides automated validation of CLI commands, documentation consistency checks, performance monitoring, and integration testing capabilities.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Automated CLI command validation against documentation\n- Performance testing for CLI responsiveness\n- Error handling validation for graceful failures\n- Integration with existing Bun test framework\n- Documentation parsing and consistency validation\n\n## Changes\n\n### New Testing Infrastructure\n\n#### Test Utilities (`tests/utils/`)\n- **`cli-test-runner.ts`**: Core test runner with command execution, timeout handling, and output validation\n- **`documentation-parser.ts`**: Parses and validates CLI documentation from multiple sources (Markdown, TypeScript, JSON)\n\n#### Test Suites\n- **`tests/commands/cli-validation.test.ts`**: \n  - CLI infrastructure tests (version, help, executable validation)\n  - Core command validation (create, test, start, plugins)\n  - Documentation consistency checks\n  - Error handling tests\n  - Performance benchmarks\n\n- **`tests/integration/cli-integration.test.ts`**:\n  - Project creation scenarios\n  - Plugin management workflows\n  - Agent runtime validation\n  - Complex multi-command sequences\n\n#### Test Setup & Execution\n- **`tests/setup/test-setup.ts`**: Environment setup utilities for CI/CD integration\n- **`tests/cli-test-runner.ts`**: Custom test execution framework\n- **`tests/run-cli-tests.sh`**: Shell script for comprehensive test execution\n\n### Documentation\n- **`CLI-COMMANDS.md`**: Comprehensive CLI command documentation for validation\n\n### Package Updates\n- Added new test scripts to `package.json`:\n  - `test:cli-validation`: Run CLI validation tests\n  - `test:cli-integration`: Run integration tests\n  - `test:cli-runner`: Execute custom test runner\n  - `test:cli-all`: Run complete CLI test suite\n\n## Test Results\n\nAll tests are passing with 100% success rate:\n\n```\n✅ CLI Validation Tests: 18/18 passing\n✅ Core Infrastructure: Validated\n✅ Documentation Consistency: Verified\n✅ Error Handling: Graceful failures confirmed\n✅ Performance: Sub-5 second response times\n```\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Automated Validation**: Ensures CLI commands work as expected\n2. **Documentation Accuracy**: Validates help text matches available commands\n3. **Regression Prevention**: Catches CLI breakages before deployment\n4. **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks CLI response times\n5. **CI/CD Ready**: Integrates with existing testing pipelines\n\n## Testing\n\nTo run the new CLI tests:\n\n```bash\n# Run CLI validation tests\nbun run test:cli-validation\n\n# Run integration tests\nbun run test:cli-integration\n\n# Run all CLI tests\nbun run test:cli-all\n```\n\n## Related Issues\n\nResolves #5325: CLI testing infrastructure for automated validation\n\n## Checklist\n\n- [x] Tests pass locally\n- [x] Code follows project style guidelines\n- [x] Documentation updated\n- [x] No breaking changes\n- [x] Ready for review",

      "number": 5356,
      "body": "## Summary\n\nThis PR fixes issue #4997 where the CLI does not properly load/register dependencies from plugins. The implementation adds automatic dependency checking and installation for plugins during CLI startup and test execution.\n\n## Changes\n\n- Added `plugin-dependency-manager.ts` utility with functions to:\n  - Check for missing plugin dependencies (regular, peer, and optional)\n  - Install missing dependencies automatically\n  - Validate plugin dependencies before loading\n  - Perform security validation on package names and versions\n  \n- Integrated dependency management into:\n  - `start` command: Checks and installs dependencies when loading plugins\n  - `test` command: Validates dependencies before running plugin tests\n  \n- Added comprehensive test coverage:\n  - 34 unit tests covering all functionality\n  - Integration tests for end-to-end scenarios\n  - 100% line coverage achieved\n\n## Security Features\n\nThe implementation includes security validation to prevent installation of malicious packages:\n- Package name validation against npm naming conventions\n- Version string format validation\n- Detection of suspicious package names (e.g., `sudo`, `rm`, `backdoor`)\n- Refusal to install packages that fail security checks\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n- Removed redundant security check that was unreachable code (improved from 98.92% to 100% coverage)\n- ElizaOS packages (starting with `@elizaos/`) are automatically skipped as they should already be available\n- Optional dependencies are installed but failures are non-fatal\n- Peer dependencies include helpful guidance for manual installation if needed\n\n## Test Coverage\n\n```\nFile                                     < /dev/null |  % Funcs | % Lines | Uncovered Line #s\n----------------------------------------|---------|---------|-------------------\nsrc/utils/plugin-dependency-manager.ts  |  100.00 |  100.00 | \n```\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Create a plugin with npm dependencies\n2. Run `elizaos start` without pre-installing the dependencies\n3. The CLI should automatically detect and install missing dependencies\n4. Plugin should load successfully\n\nFixes #4997",

      "title": "fix(plugin-sql): add database migration advisory locking for horizontal scaling",
      "author": "SYMBaiEX",
      "number": 5358,
      "body": "## Summary\n\nImplements advisory locking mechanism to prevent concurrent database migrations that could lead to corruption or errors when multiple ElizaOS instances start simultaneously in horizontally scaled environments.\n\nFixes #5181\n\n## Problem\n\nWhen ElizaOS is deployed in horizontally scaled environments (Kubernetes, server clusters), multiple instances starting simultaneously may attempt to run migrations at the same time, causing:\n- Race conditions around table/constraint creation\n- PostgreSQL errors such as \"relation already exists\"\n- Partial or inconsistent schema state if migrations fail mid-way\n\n## Solution\n\nThis PR introduces a robust migration locking mechanism that ensures only one instance can run migrations at a time:\n\n### Key Features\n- **PostgreSQL Advisory Locks**: Uses `pg_advisory_lock` for efficient, automatic cleanup\n- **Fallback Table-Based Locking**: For databases without advisory lock support\n- **Migration History Tracking**: Prevents re-running completed migrations\n- **Stale Lock Cleanup**: Handles crashed processes gracefully\n- **Configurable Timeout**: Default 60 seconds with automatic retry\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n1. **MigrationLockManager** class:\n   - Acquires/releases locks using PostgreSQL advisory locks when available\n   - Falls back to table-based locking for other databases\n   - Tracks lock ownership with process info (PID@hostname)\n   - Cleans up stale locks from crashed processes\n\n2. **Migration History Table**:\n   - Records all executed migrations with timestamps\n   - Stores schema checksums to detect version changes\n   - Tracks both successful and failed migrations\n\n3. **Updated DatabaseMigrationService**:\n   - Wraps all migration operations with lock acquisition\n   - Ensures proper lock release even on failure\n   - Works for both core system and plugin migrations\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded comprehensive test coverage including:\n- Unit tests for MigrationLockManager (100% coverage)\n- Integration tests simulating concurrent migration attempts\n- Edge case handling (timeouts, stale locks, failures)\n\n## Deployment Benefits\n\nThis implementation enables safe deployment in:\n- Multi-instance startup scenarios\n- Auto-scaling environments\n- Rolling updates\n- Zero-downtime deployments\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n- Uses SHA256 hashing to generate deterministic lock IDs\n- Non-blocking lock attempts with configurable retry logic\n- Maintains compatibility with existing Drizzle migration system\n- No changes required to existing plugins - works automatically\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\nWhile not required for this issue, potential future improvements could include:\n- Deferred readiness in health endpoints during migrations\n- Configurable `lock_timeout` and `statement_timeout` for PostgreSQL\n- Exponential backoff in retry logic\n\n---\n\nThe implementation follows PostgreSQL best practices for advisory locking and has been tested to ensure it properly serializes migration execution across multiple instances.",

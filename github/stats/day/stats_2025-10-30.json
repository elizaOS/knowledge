      "title": "fix: agent settings persistence across restarts",
      "author": "standujar",
      "number": 6106,
      "body": "# Relates to\r\n\r\nFixes agent settings not persisting across restarts, causing runtime-generated configuration to be lost.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n**Low risk**\r\n\r\n- Changes core runtime initialization logic for agent settings merge\r\n- All existing tests pass, new comprehensive test suite added\r\n- Affects: Agent settings persistence, character configuration loading\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nFixes agent settings persistence by implementing intelligent merge between database-persisted settings and character file configuration during agent initialization.\r\n\r\n**Before**: Settings saved at runtime (via `runtime.setSetting()` and `runtime.updateAgent()`) were lost on agent restart.\r\n\r\n**After**: Settings are properly merged, preserving runtime state while allowing character file to override specific values.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review `packages/core/src/runtime.ts` changes in `ensureAgentExists()` (lines 2376-2442) and `initialize()` (lines 425-455)\r\n2. Review comprehensive test suite in `packages/core/src/__tests__/ensure-agent-exists.test.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n**Automated tests:**\r\n```bash\r\ncd packages/core\r\nbun test src/__tests__/ensure-agent-exists.test.ts\r\nbun test src/__tests__/runtime.test.ts\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Manual integration test:**\r\n1. Start agent with fresh character file (no runtime settings)\r\n2. Use `runtime.setSetting()` to add configuration at runtime\r\n3. Call `runtime.updateAgent()` to persist to database\r\n4. Restart agent\r\n5. Verify settings are loaded via `runtime.getSetting()`\r\n\r\n**Test coverage:**\r\n- ✅ New agent creation\r\n- ✅ Settings merge on restart (DB + character file)\r\n- ✅ Character file overrides DB values (same key)\r\n- ✅ Deep merge of secrets\r\n- ✅ Handles missing settings in DB\r\n- ✅ Handles missing settings in character file\r\n- ✅ Integration with `runtime.initialize()`\r\n- ✅ `getSetting()` access to merged settings\r\n\r\nAll tests pass (9 tests, 28 assertions).\r\n",

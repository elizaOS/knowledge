This setup will automatically review all incoming pull requests, providing immediate feedback aligned with our guidelines, code style, and best practices.\n\nThis does not replace human code reviews, which will continue to be conducted without exception. Instead, AI acts as an additional set of \"eyes,\" consistently reviewing PRs without fatigue, improving our security and reliability.\n\nBenefits:\n\nProvides instant, consistent feedback on new PRs.\nReduces waiting times and accelerates feedback loops for developers.\nAdds another safety layer, catching issues human reviewers might occasionally overlook.\nIntegrating AI reviews will complement our current workflow and further enhance code quality and developer productivity.",

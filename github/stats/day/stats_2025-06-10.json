      "author": "jonathanprozzi",
      "number": 5039,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "**Describe the bug**\n\nAfter upgrading an existing project to use `@elizaos/core` version `1.0.7`, our custom character is no longer registered as an agent. Opening the chat interface/dev environment on `localhost` only shows Eliza as an agent and not our character. This previously worked with `1.0.6`. \n\nI tested with a newly scaffolded project and set up a character there as well and noticed the same behavior with only Eliza being shown as an agent.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n- Upgrade an existing project to use `\"@elizaos/core\": \"^1.0.7\"` or start a fresh one using this version\n- Create a new character file with character settings and load that as the agent in the `index.ts`\n- Start the server\n- Open `localhost` to view the chat/dev environment and check if custom character is there -- we only saw Eliza and not our agent\n\nCode snippets for characters:\n\n`herbert.ts` snippet:\n\n```typescript\nexport const herbert: Character = {\n  name: 'Herbert',\n  plugins: [\n    '@elizaos/plugin-sql',\n    ...(process.env.EVM_PRIVATE_KEY ? ['@elizaos/plugin-evm'] : []),\n    ...(process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY ? ['@elizaos/plugin-anthropic'] : []),\n    ...(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY ? ['@elizaos/plugin-openai'] : []),\n    ...(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY ? ['@elizaos/plugin-knowledge'] : []),\n    ...(!process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY ? ['@elizaos/plugin-local-ai'] : []),\n    ...(process.env.DISCORD_API_TOKEN ? ['@elizaos/plugin-discord'] : []),\n    ...(process.env.TWITTER_USERNAME ? ['@elizaos/plugin-twitter'] : []),\n    ...(process.env.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN ? ['@elizaos/plugin-telegram'] : []),\n    ...(!process.env.IGNORE_BOOTSTRAP ? ['@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap'] : []),\n  ],\n... (more settings)\n}\n```\n\n`index.ts`:\n```typescript\nconst herbertAgent: ProjectAgent = {\n  character: herbert,\n  init: async (runtime: IAgentRuntime) => initCharacter({ runtime }),\n};\nconst project: Project = {\n  agents: [herbertAgent],\n};\n```\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\n- Expected that Eliza would find the new character (Herbert) and register it as an agent (previous behavior in existing project)\n- We didn't change any config in the existing project but after upgrading versions we could no longer find/interact with Herbert\n\n**Additional context**\n\n- Tested this with both a newly scaffolded project as well as in an existing project. Our existing project had our custom agent/character loading but I then upgraded to `1.0.7` and Eliza is the only registered agent. Seems to possibly be using Eliza as a fallback and ignoring our custom character files, even though they're being detected when the server starts.\n",

Enhanced confirmation dialogs in the user interface for destructive actions, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience.\n  - Improved documentation with new and updated API endpoint references.\n\n- **Bug Fixes**\n  - Addressed frontend loading issues by aligning API routes and improving chat context detection.\n\n- **Refactor**\n  - Reorganized API routing structure for clarity and scalability, replacing legacy endpoints and consolidating related routes.\n  - Enhanced file upload security and validation, including stricter filename sanitization and MIME type checks.\n\n- **Chores**\n  - Added security middleware and rate limiting for all API endpoints.\n  -

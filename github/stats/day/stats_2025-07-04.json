      "title": "Migrate remaining CLI input methods to use @clack/prompts for consistency",
      "author": "wtfsayo",
      "number": 5295,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "# Migrate remaining CLI input methods to use @clack/prompts for consistency\n\n## 🎯 Summary\n\nCurrently, the CLI uses a mix of input libraries (`inquirer`, Bun's global `prompt()`, and `@clack/prompts`). We should standardize on `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience and better styling across all CLI interactions.\n\n## 📋 Current State\n\nMost of the CLI already uses `@clack/prompts` properly, but there are **2 main files** still using other input methods:\n\n### 1. `src/utils/plugin-creator.ts` - Using `inquirer` 📦\n\nThis file has multiple `inquirer.prompt()` calls that need to be migrated:\n\n- **Plugin specification collection** (~line 172-290):\n  - Plugin name input\n  - Plugin description input  \n  - Plugin features input\n  - Component selection (checkbox)\n  - Action names input\n  - Provider names input\n  - Evaluator names input\n  - Service names input\n\n### 2. `scripts/generate-unit-tests.ts` - Using global `prompt()` 🔧\n\n- **Test generation confirmation** (~line 165):\n  ```typescript\n  const answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\n  ```\n\n## ✨ Benefits of Migration\n\n1. **Consistent UX** - All CLI interactions will have the same look and feel\n2. **Better styling** - Clack provides superior visual design and animations\n3. **Better error handling** - Clack has built-in cancellation handling\n4. **Reduced dependencies** - Can remove `inquirer` from package.json\n5. **Type safety** - Better TypeScript integration\n\n## 🔧 Implementation Examples\n\n### For `plugin-creator.ts`:\n\n**Before (inquirer):**\n```typescript\nconst answers = await inquirer.prompt([\n  {\n    type: 'input',\n    name: 'name',\n    message: 'Plugin name (without \"plugin-\" prefix):',\n    validate: (input: string) => input.length > 0 || 'Plugin name is required'\n  }\n]);\n```\n\n**After (clack):**\n```typescript\nconst name = await clack.text({\n  message: 'Plugin name (without \"plugin-\" prefix):',\n  validate: (input) => input.length > 0 ? undefined : 'Plugin name is required'\n});\n\nif (clack.isCancel(name)) {\n  clack.cancel('Operation cancelled.');\n  process.exit(0);\n}\n```\n\n### For `generate-unit-tests.ts`:\n\n**Before:**\n```typescript\nconst answer = prompt('Generate tests? (y/n): ');\n```\n\n**After:**\n```typescript\nconst answer = await clack.confirm({\n  message: 'Generate tests?',\n  initialValue: true\n});\n\nif (clack.isCancel(answer)) {\n  console.log('Cancelled.');\n  return;\n}\n```\n\n## ✅ Reference Files (Already Using Clack)\n\nThese files are already properly implemented and serve as good examples:\n- `src/commands/create/actions/creators.ts`\n- `src/commands/create/index.ts`\n- `src/commands/env/actions/edit.ts`\n- `src/commands/publish/utils/validation.ts`\n- `src/utils/cli-prompts.ts`\n\n## ✅ Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Replace all `inquirer.prompt()` calls in `plugin-creator.ts` with clack equivalents\n- [ ] Replace global `prompt()` call in `generate-unit-tests.ts` with clack\n- [ ] Remove `inquirer` dependency from `package.json` if no longer used elsewhere\n- [ ] Ensure all prompts handle cancellation properly (ctrl+c)\n- [ ] Test plugin creation flow works identically to current behavior\n- [ ] Test unit test generation script works identically to current behavior\n- [ ] Maintain existing validation logic and error messages\n- [ ] Update any related TypeScript types if needed\n\n## 🎯 Priority\n\n**Medium** - This improves developer experience and code consistency but doesn't affect core functionality.\n\n## 💡 Implementation Notes\n\n- The `generate-unit-tests.ts` part would be a good **beginner-friendly** task\n- The `plugin-creator.ts` part is more complex due to multiple sequential prompts\n- Consider breaking this into two separate PRs if needed\n- Make sure to test the checkbox selection for component types in plugin creation\n\n---\n\n**Note**: The majority of the CLI already uses clack properly - this is just cleaning up the last few stragglers to ensure complete consistency across the entire CLI experience.",

      "body": "**Describe the bug**\nOn 1.0.17, when I run `elizaos dev` on windows (powershell 7), it tries to load openai plugin (1.0.6) and bootstrap (1.0.15) but it fails to do so using all relevant strategies. It tries to install the plugin, succeeds to install, but fails to load it still.\n\nBecause it can't load openai and bootstrap plugin, it doesn't process any messages sent to it.\n\nHowever, it's able to find @elizaos/plugin-sql so I'm not sure what the difference is.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nOn windows (powershell 7), create a new project and run 'elizaos dev'\n\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nI expect it to load the plugins so that it can handle the messages send from the chat.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n<img width=\"1317\" height=\"576\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b70ff76a-619a-49bd-abe9-83affa8479c3\" />\n\n**Additional context**\n\nI'm on Windows Powershell 7. WSL is installed. I don't have this issue when I run it on my Ubuntu Linux VM.\n\nI cloned the eliza repo and ran 'bun install', 'bun run build' and 'bun start' and it's able to load everything on Windows Powershell 7. So it seems this is only failing when I try running the elizaos commands from a project, but not from the eliza repo itself.",

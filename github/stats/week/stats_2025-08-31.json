      "body": "### **Summary**\n\nThe current CLI is overly complex and duplicates logic that should live inside project directories. Instead of bootstrapping AgentServer inside the CLI, we should streamline it to handle only configuration and delegate execution to the project’s runtime.\n\n### **Problem**\n\n* **Duplication of logic:** Both the CLI and project code (e.g. project-starter/src/index.ts) contain overlapping runner and module management logic .\n* **Code-first gap:** Without a true code-first Eliza, the CLI has taken on responsibilities (e.g. instantiating AgentServer) that should belong to projects.\n* **Unnecessary coupling:** Bootstrapping agents directly from the CLI makes it harder to reason about project boundaries and introduces complexity in maintaining two runtimes.\n* **Developer UX:** For new users, this creates confusion about where to put logic and increases friction.\n\n### **Proposal**\n\n* **CLI responsibilities:**\n  * Manage environment and char.json configuration (via env and config commands).\n  * Provide a clean interface for project creation (elizaos create) .\n  * Delegate execution to project scripts (bun run build, bun run start) rather than running agents directly.\n* **Project responsibilities:**\n  * Own all logic for AgentServer instantiation (directly in project-starter/src/index.ts).\n  * Expose a clear entry point (start/dev) that the CLI calls into.\n  * Keep all runtime and module complexity contained in project code.",

      "title": "Web UI dashboard exists but is completely undocumented (users don't know how to interact with their agent)",
      "author": "thedotmack",
      "number": 5857,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "**Describe the bug**\n\nThe ElizaOS documentation (including the Quickstart guide) completely fails to mention that there's a web interface/dashboard available after starting an agent. The startup logs show \"Go to the dashboard at http://localhost:3001\" but this crucial information is NEVER mentioned in the documentation, leaving users confused about how to interact with their agent.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Go to the ElizaOS documentation/quickstart\n2. Follow all installation steps:\n   - Install dependencies (`bun install`)\n   - Configure environment variables\n   - Set up character configuration\n   - Run `bun start` or `npm start`\n3. See output: `[INFO] Client http listening on port 3001`\n4. Try to figure out how to talk to your agent\n5. Search entire documentation for \"web UI\", \"browser\", \"localhost:3000\", \"how to chat\"\n6. Find nothing about the web interface\n7. Assume you need to configure Telegram/Discord just to test the agent\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nAfter starting the agent, the documentation should clearly state:\n- \"Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to access the web chat interface\"\n- This should be prominently displayed in the quickstart guide\n- Should appear immediately after the \"start your agent\" step\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nCurrent quickstart ends with starting the agent - no mention of the dashboard:\n```\n# Start your agent\nbun start\n```\n*[Documentation just... stops here - no mention of the dashboard URL]*\n\nMeanwhile, the ACTUAL console output shows this ONE critical line buried in 100+ lines of logs:\n```\n[2025-09-01 00:11:19] INFO: Loaded character: Eliza\nBYPASS: Using postgres URL from environment variable\n[2025-09-01 00:11:19] INFO: Using local @elizaos/server installation\n[... 50+ MORE LINES OF LOGS ...]\n[2025-09-01 00:11:20] INFO: [STATIC] Serving static files from: ./node_modules/@elizaos/server/dist/client\n[2025-09-01 00:11:20] INFO: [SocketIO] Router initialized with 0 agents\n[2025-09-01 00:11:20] INFO: [SocketIO] Setting up Socket.IO event listeners\nStartup successful!\nGo to the dashboard at http://localhost:3001  <--- THIS ONE LINE IS THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW\nAgentServer is listening on port 3001\n[2025-09-01 00:11:21] INFO: Final plugins being loaded:\n[2025-09-01 00:11:21] INFO: Running plugin migrations...\n[... 20+ MORE LINES OF LOGS CONTINUE AFTER ...]\n```\n\nThe critical \"Go to the dashboard\" message is:\n- Buried in the middle of 108 lines of startup logs\n- Surrounded by technical INFO messages about plugins, migrations, and socket handlers\n- Easy to miss as it scrolls by with all the other output\n- The ONLY indication that a web UI even exists\n\nThe logs literally tell you \"Go to the dashboard\" but:\n- That there IS a dashboard\n- That there IS a web UI\n- That you should look for this URL in the logs\n- That this is how you interact with your agent\n\n**Additional context**\n\n- The dashboard URL appears on line 65 of 108 lines of startup output - completely buried in technical logs\n- Most users will never notice this ONE line among all the INFO messages about plugins, migrations, and socket handlers\n- The startup logs DO show \"Go to the dashboard\" but it's buried in a wall of text that scrolls by quickly\n- The docs don't even mention that a dashboard/web UI EXISTS, let alone tell users to look for it in the logs\n- Users are forced to configure unnecessary integrations (Telegram/Discord/Twitter) just to test their agent because they don't know about the web UI\n- Even the llms.txt file mentions WebSocket connections and API endpoints but not the dashboard\n- This is a critical onboarding issue - new users literally cannot figure out how to interact with the thing they just installed\n- The fix is trivial: add to the quickstart \"After starting, your agent will display 'Go to the dashboard at http://localhost:xxxx' - open this URL in your browser to chat with your agent\"",

Please describe.**\n\nWould be nice to have matrix (matrix.org) platform integration\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nBasically just the Discord/Telegram plugin but using https://www.npmjs.com/package/matrix-bot-sdk with a Matrix bot account. Would need to be able to set up homeserver and bot token (there are instructions to get the bot token [here](https://turt2live.github.io/matrix-bot-sdk/tutorial-bot.html)) \n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nI've looked at using Discord and the Discord to Matrix bridge, but I use Matrix for privacy, and would like everything to stay completely local. Matrix bot would support end to end encryption too.\n",

      "title": "feat: Add Sentry Node telemetry support",
      "author": "jonathanprozzi",
      "number": 5867,
      "body": "# Overview\r\n\r\nThis adds a Sentry Node implementation to support using Sentry with AI SDK's `experimental_telemetry` option. This also adds a guard when Sentry is being imported in the `client` package. A future PR can include a full client/browser split as well as the Node. We've used this modification in our agent to receive traces from both the `plugin-openai` and the `plugin-anthropic` in Sentry.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow. This improves the existing broken Sentry implementation with a full Node.js integration to support `experimentalTelemetry` options in the AI SDK. Changes are contained to the core package's Sentry module, and adds in instrumental that was previously limited to a Sentry browser package used within the server's node context.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the Sentry implementation with a production-ready Node.js integration featuring AI telemetry support. This has been tested and used on our fork to provide Sentry traces from AI SDK interactions (with the OpenAI and Anthropic plugins).\r\n\r\n**Key improvements:**\r\n  - Fixes incomplete implementation: Replaces `@sentry/browser` with\r\n  `@sentry/node` SDK to support telemetry and full tracing\r\n  - Adds AI telemetry: Integrates Vercel AI SDK telemetry for monitoring LLM\r\n  interactions\r\n  - Enables plugin ecosystem: Provides telemetry infrastructure needed by\r\n  `plugin-openai` and `plugin-anthropic`\r\n  - Smart configuration: Configurable trace filtering (AI-only vs all traces)\r\n  - Production ready: Comprehensive error handling, logging, and documentation\r\n\r\n  **Technical features:**\r\n  - Automatic AI SDK call tracing (generateText, streamText, etc.)\r\n  - Input/output recording for debugging AI interactions\r\n  - Performance monitoring for AI calls (duration, success rates)\r\n  - Environment-aware conditional loading (prevents browser bundling issues)\r\n  - Comprehensive environment variable configuration\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\n  ✅ I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n\r\n**Documentation updates made:**\r\n  - `README.md`: Added comprehensive \"Sentry Monitoring & AI Telemetry\" section\r\n  with usage examples\r\n  - .env.example: Added all Sentry environment variables with descriptions\r\n  - Code comments: Extensive inline documentation explaining implementation\r\n  decisions\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n- Tested by building locally and creating a new Eliza test project: https://github.com/jonathanprozzi/eliza-sentry-example that is ready for testing once the configuration (`SENTRY_DSN` specifically) is provided and is set up to use a local path for the `core` package for testing.\r\n- Tested all configuration options and ensured that traces came through in Sentry\r\n- Ran in both this project and in a branch of our fully functioning agent and received Sentry traces for AI SDK interactions\r\n- Builds locally when using `bun run build`\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n  1. Review the main implementation: `packages/core/src/sentry/instrument.ts` -\r\n  Core Sentry integration with AI telemetry\r\n  2. Check dependency change: `packages/core/package.json` - Verify `@sentry/node`\r\n  replaces browser SDK\r\n  3. Verify exports: `packages/core/src/index.ts` - Sentry utilities properly\r\n  exported\r\n  4. Review documentation: `README.md` and `.env.example` - Contains usage configuration\r\n  documentation\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n**Build verification:**\r\n- Run `bun run build` from project root - should complete without errors\r\n- Verify client package builds without Node.js dependency issues\r\n- Check TypeScript compilation succeeds\r\n\r\n**Runtime verification:**\r\n- Set `SENTRY_DSN=test_dsn` and run `elizaos start`\r\n- Verify initialization logs appear:\r\n```\r\n  [SENTRY] Initializing with DSN: test_dsn...\r\n  [SENTRY] Trace filtering: AI-only traces + all errors\r\n  [SENTRY] Node.js initialized successfully\r\n```\r\n\r\n  **AI telemetry testing:**\r\n  - Set `SENTRY_DSN=real_dsn` with actual Sentry project\r\n  - Set `OPENAI_EXPERIMENTAL_TELEMETRY=true` (if using OpenAI)\r\n  - Start agent and have conversation\r\n  - Check Sentry Performance/traces tab for `ai.generateText traces`\r\n\r\n  **Configuration testing:**\r\n  - Test `SENTRY_TRACE_FILTER=false` for all traces vs default AI-only\r\n  - Verify `SENTRY_LOGGING=false` disables Sentry entirely\r\n  - Confirm environment variables work as documented\r\n\r\n  **Error capture verification:**\r\n  - Existing error capture via `logger.ts` should continue working\r\n  - Verify exceptions appear in Sentry Issues tab\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n`jpbuilds`\r\n",

      "title": "Web UI dashboard exists but is completely undocumented (users don't know how to interact with their agent)",
      "author": "thedotmack",
      "number": 5857,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "**Describe the bug**\n\nThe ElizaOS documentation (including the Quickstart guide) completely fails to mention that there's a web interface/dashboard available after starting an agent. The startup logs show \"Go to the dashboard at http://localhost:3001\" but this crucial information is NEVER mentioned in the documentation, leaving users confused about how to interact with their agent.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Go to the ElizaOS documentation/quickstart\n2. Follow all installation steps:\n   - Install dependencies (`bun install`)\n   - Configure environment variables\n   - Set up character configuration\n   - Run `bun start` or `npm start`\n3. See output: `[INFO] Client http listening on port 3001`\n4. Try to figure out how to talk to your agent\n5. Search entire documentation for \"web UI\", \"browser\", \"localhost:3000\", \"how to chat\"\n6. Find nothing about the web interface\n7. Assume you need to configure Telegram/Discord just to test the agent\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nAfter starting the agent, the documentation should clearly state:\n- \"Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to access the web chat interface\"\n- This should be prominently displayed in the quickstart guide\n- Should appear immediately after the \"start your agent\" step\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nCurrent quickstart ends with starting the agent - no mention of the dashboard:\n```\n# Start your agent\nbun start\n```\n*[Documentation just... stops here - no mention of the dashboard URL]*\n\nMeanwhile, the ACTUAL console output shows this ONE critical line buried in 100+ lines of logs:\n```\n[2025-09-01 00:11:19] INFO: Loaded character: Eliza\nBYPASS: Using postgres URL from environment variable\n[2025-09-01 00:11:19] INFO: Using local @elizaos/server installation\n[... 50+ MORE LINES OF LOGS ...]\n[2025-09-01 00:11:20] INFO: [STATIC] Serving static files from: ./node_modules/@elizaos/server/dist/client\n[2025-09-01 00:11:20] INFO: [SocketIO] Router initialized with 0 agents\n[2025-09-01 00:11:20] INFO: [SocketIO] Setting up Socket.IO event listeners\nStartup successful!\nGo to the dashboard at http://localhost:3001  <--- THIS ONE LINE IS THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW\nAgentServer is listening on port 3001\n[2025-09-01 00:11:21] INFO: Final plugins being loaded:\n[2025-09-01 00:11:21] INFO: Running plugin migrations...\n[... 20+ MORE LINES OF LOGS CONTINUE AFTER ...]\n```\n\nThe critical \"Go to the dashboard\" message is:\n- Buried in the middle of 108 lines of startup logs\n- Surrounded by technical INFO messages about plugins, migrations, and socket handlers\n- Easy to miss as it scrolls by with all the other output\n- The ONLY indication that a web UI even exists\n\nThe logs literally tell you \"Go to the dashboard\" but:\n- That there IS a dashboard\n- That there IS a web UI\n- That you should look for this URL in the logs\n- That this is how you interact with your agent\n\n**Additional context**\n\n- The dashboard URL appears on line 65 of 108 lines of startup output - completely buried in technical logs\n- Most users will never notice this ONE line among all the INFO messages about plugins, migrations, and socket handlers\n- The startup logs DO show \"Go to the dashboard\" but it's buried in a wall of text that scrolls by quickly\n- The docs don't even mention that a dashboard/web UI EXISTS, let alone tell users to look for it in the logs\n- Users are forced to configure unnecessary integrations (Telegram/Discord/Twitter) just to test their agent because they don't know about the web UI\n- Even the llms.txt file mentions WebSocket connections and API endpoints but not the dashboard\n- This is a critical onboarding issue - new users literally cannot figure out how to interact with the thing they just installed\n- The fix is trivial: add to the quickstart \"After starting, your agent will display 'Go to the dashboard at http://localhost:xxxx' - open this URL in your browser to chat with your agent\"",

      "author": "standujar",
      "number": 5890,
      "body": "# Relates to\r\n\r\n  Fix image display issues in web client for generated images from OpenRouter plugin\r\n\r\n  # Risks\r\n\r\n  **Low** - Changes are isolated to server-side path transformation logic. No breaking changes to existing APIs or plugins.\r\n\r\n  # Background\r\n\r\n  ## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n  This PR implements a comprehensive solution for displaying images generated by AI models (OpenRouter, OpenAI, etc.) in the ElizaOS web client. Previously, images worked in Discord/Telegram but returned 404 errors in the web interface\r\n  because the client received local file paths instead of HTTP URLs.\r\n\r\n  The solution includes:\r\n  1. **Configurable data directories** via environment variables for flexibility\r\n  2. **Server-side path transformation** to convert local paths to API URLs\r\n  3. **Fix for Express sendFile** to properly serve media files\r\n  4. **Consistent attachment handling** across all messaging endpoints\r\n\r\n  ## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n  - ✅ **Bug fixes** (fixes 404 errors for generated images in web client)\r\n  - ✅ **Improvements** (adds configurable data directories via environment variables)\r\n  - ✅ **Features** (adds automatic path-to-URL transformation for attachments)\r\n\r\n  # Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n  - ✅ My changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\n  - ✅ I have updated the documentation accordingly (.env.example updated with new environment variables)\r\n\r\n  # Testing\r\n\r\n  ## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n  1. Review `packages/server/src/utils/media-transformer.ts` - Core transformation logic\r\n  2. Check `packages/core/src/utils/paths.ts` - Configurable path utilities\r\n  3. Verify changes in messaging endpoints for attachment transformation\r\n\r\n  ## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n  1. **Setup OpenRouter with image generation model:**\r\n     ```bash\r\n     # In .env, configure:\r\n     OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key\r\n     OPENROUTER_IMAGE_GENERATION_MODEL=google/gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview\r\n     ```\r\n\r\n  2. **Test image generation in web client**:\r\n    - Start the server: bun run start\r\n    - Open web client at http://localhost:3000\r\n    - Send message: \"Generate an image of a cat on fire\"\r\n    - Verify image displays correctly (no 404 error)\r\n  3. **Test backwards compatibility**:\r\n    - Verify Discord/Telegram plugins still receive and display images correctly\r\n    - Check that existing file uploads still work\r\n  4. **Test environment variable configuration**:\r\n \r\n ## Set custom data directory\r\n  ```bash\r\n  ELIZA_DATA_DIR=/custom/path bun run start\r\n  ```\r\nVerify images are saved to and served from custom location\r\n\r\n ## Before\r\n\r\n  - Web client shows broken image icon\r\n  - Network tab shows 404 for /Users/.../image.png\r\n\r\n  ## After\r\n\r\n  - Images display correctly in web client\r\n  - Network tab shows successful 200 for /media/generated/agentId/image.png\r\n\r\n  # Key Changes:\r\n\r\n  Core Package\r\n\r\n  - paths.ts: New utility for configurable data directories with env var support\r\n  - paths.test.ts: Comprehensive tests for path utilities\r\n  - index.node.ts: Export path utilities for server usage\r\n\r\n  Server Package\r\n\r\n  - media-transformer.ts: Transform local file paths to API URLs\r\n  - messaging/*.ts: Apply transformation before sending to clients\r\n  - index.ts: Fix Express sendFile for absolute paths with fallback\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n- New Features\n  - Configurable data and upload directories via environment variables.\n  - Automatic transformation of attachment file paths to API URLs in APIs and real-time broadcasts.\n  - More reliable SPA fallback and media serving for generated and uploaded files.\n\n- Bug Fixes\n  - Safer, type-specific upload directories with strengthened path validation.\n\n- Refactor\n  - Centralized path resolution across server features; legacy path handling removed.\n\n- Documentation\n  - .env example expanded with data directory configuration options.\n\n- Tests\n  - Added comprehensive tests for data directory and path resolution behavior.\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",

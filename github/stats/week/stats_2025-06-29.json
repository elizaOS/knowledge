      "body": "\n**Describe the bug**\nI am creating a plugin to manage the Biconomy wallet with Chainlink automation & functions. It is hard to use Eliza as the agent that only supports one message, then stop using plugins and do everything from the AI model and simulate on-chain action, although I added all the actions to use it correctly.\n\n\nThe ElizaOS framework (v0.0.12) has significant reliability issues when developing custom plugins. The primary issues include:\n1. Action triggers frequently return responses from the AI model itself rather than executing the defined handler functions\n2. The debugging tools are non-functional, making troubleshooting nearly impossible\n3. Error handling is minimal or absent, with cryptic error messages like \"message: \"(Error) Message content or data is missing \" without proper stack traces. I know it from my code, but with no debugger, now I am supposed to use the `logger.debug` everywhere and redo steps, which almost take forever\n4. Database connection failures occur without clear resolution paths\n```\n[2025-06-24 15:24:48] ERROR: [CUSTOM MIGRATOR] Database connection failed: Aborted().

The plugin-evm integration is particularly problematic, with the agent consistently struggling to differentiate between executing actual on-chain transactions and merely simulating them\nThese issues severely impact our timeline for the Chainlink Chromium hackathon project.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Create a custom plugin with defined actions (e.g., our smart-wallet-plugin with CREATE_BICONOMY_WALLET action)\n2. Attempt to trigger the action through the agent interface\n3. Observe that the system returns a generic AI response instead of executing the handler function. \n4. When errors occur, observe that the error messages lack context or actionable information\n5. Attempt to use the debugging tools and observe that they fail to provide useful information\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\n1. When an action is triggered, the corresponding handler function should execute reliably\n2. Error messages should provide clear context, including the specific issue, location, and potential resolution\n3. Debugging tools should function properly, allowing developers to trace execution flow\n4. Database connections should be reliable or provide clear error messages with resolution steps\n5. Documentation should accurately reflect the current API and provide troubleshooting guidance\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38ef9343-0280-4f09-8c55-adb474b02f9b)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc2aa091-595f-4d37-b2f6-69d701c2d3c8)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03a06bd6-4c58-4da8-9b23-2b7f27b31fea)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc025bc6-5f57-43c7-a1ac-c7ab9612420c)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d117bec6-5960-4c6d-9028-2210a0616bf1)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1dfbc39f-c6c1-46ba-9550-4dcddd0cff4d)\n\n**Additional context**\n\nWe upgraded from v0.0.11 (which had message loading issues) to v0.0.12, but continue to experience significant development challenges. The framework's instability is particularly problematic given our tight timeline for the Chainlink Chromium hackathon. The most frustrating aspect is the inconsistency between documentation examples and actual runtime behaviour, especially regarding action handling and plugin integration.\n\nConclusion: All I want is a way to make sure actions are getting triggered instead of the AI model replying to me with a simulation with 0 on-chain action\n",

      "body": "I've been struggling to setup a project from scratch for over 10 days now so I've decided to open an issue here. \n\nI've tried using all the possible options:\n- `eliza-starter` repo: First I tried with this one. After many unsuccessful attempts, I managed to get this up and running. However, the repo is now archived so I've decided to find another option. There should at least be a notice somewhere in the README explaining why the repo was archived as it is a bit confusing to come back to the repo you used yesterday and find it archived.\n- `eliza` (this) repo. It references an old video from a few months ago that doesn't help very much as a lot of stuff has changed in the meantime. I tried following the README:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git\ngit checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)\ncp .env.example .env\n```\nThen I set the `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` variable in `.env`. This is just my best guess for the variable name using the `eliza-starter` repo as there's no word on how to set up an agent using Gemini in the `.env` itself or in the docs.\nThen I execute the rest of the commands:\n```\nbun install\nbun run build\nbun start\n```\nHere the agent starts and I navigate to http://localhost:3000 to try and text my agent. However, the error is `A context size of 8192 is too large for the available VRAM` as the model is started locally and my Gemini API key is ignored. \n- CLI tool: I create a new project by running `elizaos create my-agent` and choose the standard options, including the OpenAI LLM. Long story short, this one fails me as well because I can't in God's name figure out how to start the model using my desired provider or change it afterwards.\n\nTL;DR There's a lack of synchronisation between the official documentation, this repo, and the CLI tool. It is very difficult to figure out where to look up the issues you have and find an answer to them.\n\nThis is just a fraction of the issues I've had along the way, all while just trying to set up a simple project.",

      "author": "samarth30",
      "number": 5066,
      "body": "This pull request introduces several enhancements and new features to the plugin migration system, focusing on improving test generation, repository analysis, and environment variable management. The most significant changes include the introduction of a context-aware test generation system, updates to repository analysis logic, and improvements to environment variable prompting. Additionally, configuration constants and export structure have been updated for better maintainability.\r\n\r\n### Context-Aware Test Generation\r\n* Added a new system for generating plugin-specific tests dynamically based on the plugin's actual structure and functionality. This replaces the old static template system, ensuring more relevant and accurate tests. (`CONTEXT_AWARE_TESTING.md`)\r\n\r\n### Repository Analysis Enhancements\r\n* Implemented a repository analyzer that scans a plugin's directory for key files (`README.md`, `package.json`, `index.ts/js`) and source files while respecting token limits and skipping large or binary files. (`repository-analyzer.ts`)\r\n\r\n### Environment Variable Management\r\n* Introduced `EnvPrompter`, a utility for interactive collection and validation of environment variables, with support for sensitive values and default descriptions. (`env-prompter.ts`)\r\n\r\n### Configuration Updates\r\n* Added new configuration constants for migration, including `MAX_TOKENS`, `CLAUDE_CODE_TIMEOUT`, and `MIN_DISK_SPACE_GB`, to centralize and standardize settings. (`config.ts`)\r\n\r\n### Export Structure Improvements\r\n* Updated the export structure in `index.ts` to include new components like `EnvPrompter`, `ContextAwareTestGenerator`, and configuration constants, ensuring better modularity and accessibility. (`index.ts`)<!-- Use this template by filling in information and copying and pasting relevant items out of the HTML comments. -->\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Implements a new plugin `@elizaos/plugin-grok` to integrate with xAI's Grok language models. This plugin leverages Grok's OpenAI-compatible API.\r\n\r\nKey changes:\r\n- Created `packages/plugin-grok/`:\r\n    - `package.json`: Defines the new plugin package.\r\n    - `tsconfig.json`, `tsup.config.ts`: Build configuration.\r\n    - `src/index.ts`: Implements `GrokLanguageModel` (extending `ChatLanguageModel` from core) using the OpenAI SDK configured for Grok's API endpoint (`https://api.x.ai/v1`) and `XAI_API_KEY`. Includes `generate` and `stream` methods with preliminary tool use support. Registers `GrokService` with service type \"grok\".\r\n    - `src/__tests__/index.test.ts`: Basic unit tests for `GrokLanguageModel`.\r\n    - `README.md`: Documentation for setting up and using the plugin.\r\n- Updated `packages/cli/src/server/loader.ts` to import `@elizaos/plugin-grok`, ensuring the service is registered.\r\n- Updated `packages/cli/tsconfig.json` to include path mapping for the new local plugin.\r\n- Updated `packages/cli/src/characters/gork.ts` to demonstrate how a character can conditionally use `@elizaos/plugin-grok` if `XAI_API_KEY` is set.\r\n\r\nThis allows users with an XAI API key to use Grok models within the ElizaOS ecosystem.\r\n\r\n<!-- Use this template by filling in information and copying and pasting relevant items out of the HTML comments. -->\r\n\r\n# Relates to\r\n\r\n<!-- LINK TO ISSUE OR TICKET -->\r\n\r\n<!-- This risks section must be filled out before the final review and merge. -->\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nLow, medium, large.

      "author": "bealers",
      "number": 5304,
      "body": "# Add ELIZA_UI_ENABLE environment variable to control web UI in production\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nelizaOS currently serves the web UI to anyone who can reach the server. While there's `ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN` for API endpoints, the web interface itself is wide open. In production deployments, this creates an unnecessary attack surface.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdded `ELIZA_UI_ENABLE` environment variable with sensible defaults:\r\n- **Development**: UI enabled by default\r\n- **Production**: UI disabled by default\r\n- **Override**: Set `ELIZA_UI_ENABLE=true/false`\r\n\r\nWhen disabled, the web UI returns a standard HTTP 403 Forbidden error, but all API endpoints continue to work normally.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\n~20 lines in `packages/server/src/index.ts`:\r\n\r\n1. Check `NODE_ENV` and `ELIZA_UI_ENABLE` to determine UI status\r\n2. Conditionally serve static files only when UI is enabled\r\n3. Replace SPA fallback with 403 response when UI is disabled\r\n4. Update startup logging to clearly show UI status\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Development (UI enabled)\r\nbun start\r\n\r\n# Production (UI disabled)  \r\nNODE_ENV=production bun start\r\n\r\n# Force enable in production\r\nNODE_ENV=production ELIZA_UI_ENABLE=true bun start\r\n\r\n# Force disable in development\r\nELIZA_UI_ENABLE=false bun start\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen UI is disabled:\r\n- `http://localhost:3000` → HTTP 403 Forbidden  \r\n- `http://localhost:3000/api/server/ping` → Still works fine\r\n\r\n## Test Coverage\r\n\r\nAdded tests:\r\n- **Unit tests**: Environment variable parsing and default behaviours (development vs production)\r\n- **Integration tests**: Server configuration impact and HTTP response handling\r\n- **Security validation**: API functionality preservation when UI disabled\r\n\r\n`bun test packages/server/src/__tests__/ui-disable-feature.test.ts`\r\n\r\n25 tests passing, including both new tests and existing functionality verification.\r\n\r\n## Justification\r\n\r\nI'm working on scripting prod deploys and wanted a straighforward way to shut the UI off, but keep API open. I've purposely kept the API authentication (`ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN`) separate from this UI disable feature to minimise any clashes. \r\n\r\n\r\n## ⚠️ Desktop App Compatibility\r\n\r\nAny remote deploy breaks the desktop anyway, as it's a wrapper to an iframe polling localhost:3000. \r\n\r\nIn future iterations of the desktop app, with the correct plumbing, it could:\r\n\r\n1. **Explicitly override**: `ELIZA_UI_ENABLE=true elizaos start`\r\n2. **Environment file**: Add `ELIZA_UI_ENABLE=true` to `.env`\r\n3. **Startup script**: Desktop app launcher can set the environment variable\r\n\r\n(I'd be happy to help with this!)\r\n\r\n## Backward compatibility\r\n\r\nShould be fully backward compatible - no breaking changes, development experience stays the same. Only affects deployments that explicitly set `NODE_ENV=production`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDiscord: @bealers ",

      "body": "## Problem\n\nCurrently, `bun run test` does not work consistently across all packages in the ElizaOS monorepo. This creates several issues:\n\n1. **Inconsistent Developer Experience**: Developers cannot reliably run tests in individual packages\n2. **CI/CD Fragility**: The root `bun test` command fails, making it difficult to validate changes\n3. **Low Test Coverage**: Only 28% of source files have tests (excluding dist files)\n4. **Missing Test Infrastructure**: 29% of packages have no test scripts defined\n\n### Current State Analysis\n\n**Test Coverage by Package:**\n- ‚úÖ **10/14 packages (71%)** have test scripts defined\n- ‚ùå **4/14 packages (29%)** have no test infrastructure\n- üî¥ Root `bun test` fails due to `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` mock initialization errors\n\n**Packages with Issues:**\n1. **No Tests At All:**\n   - `@elizaos/app` - Tauri application\n   - `@elizaos/autodoc` - Documentation generator\n   - `create-eliza` - Scaffolding tool\n   - `@elizaos/docs` - Docusaurus site (expected)\n\n2. **Failing Tests:**\n   - `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` - Mock initialization errors\n   - `@elizaos/project-tee-starter` - Environment setup issues\n\n3. **Excluded from Root Tests:**\n   - `@elizaos/plugin-starter` (template)\n   - `@elizaos/docs` (documentation)\n   - `@elizaos/plugin-sql` (has tests but excluded)\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nImplement a phased approach to ensure all packages have working tests:\n\n### Phase 1: Fix Failing Tests (Priority: High)\n- [ ] Fix `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` mock initialization errors\n- [ ] Fix `@elizaos/project-tee-starter` environment setup issues\n- [ ] Ensure root `bun test` command passes\n\n### Phase 2: Add Missing Test Infrastructure (Priority: High)\n- [ ] Add test setup to `@elizaos/app` (Tauri app testing)\n- [ ] Add test setup to `@elizaos/autodoc`\n- [ ] Add test setup to `create-eliza`\n- [ ] Create minimal test files to validate setup\n\n### Phase 3: Standardize Test Configuration (Priority: Medium)\n- [ ] Create shared test configuration for consistency\n- [ ] Standardize coverage reporting (exclude dist/, build/, node_modules/)\n- [ ] Add coverage thresholds per package\n- [ ] Ensure all packages use Bun test runner consistently\n\n### Phase 4: Documentation & CI Updates (Priority: Medium)\n- [ ] Update contributing guide with testing requirements\n- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for test validation\n- [ ] Update CI workflows to run package-specific tests\n- [ ] Create testing best practices documentation\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### 1. Shared Test Configuration\nCreate a base test configuration that all packages can extend:\n\n```typescript\n// packages/test-config/base.config.ts\nexport default {\n  testMatch: [\"**/*.test.ts\", \"**/*.spec.ts\"],\n  coverage: {\n    exclude: [\n      \"**/dist/**\",\n      \"**/build/**\",\n      \"**/node_modules/**\",\n      \"**/*.d.ts\",\n      \"**/coverage/**\"\n    ],\n    threshold: {\n      statements: 60,\n      branches: 60,\n      functions: 60,\n      lines: 60\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Package Test Script Standardization\nEnsure every package.json has:\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"bun test\",\n    \"test:coverage\": \"bun test --coverage\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Fix Root Test Command\nUpdate root package.json to handle package-specific test requirements:\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"turbo run test --filter=\\!@elizaos/docs --filter=\\!@elizaos/plugin-starter\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] `bun run test` works in every package directory\n- [ ] Root `bun test` command passes without errors\n- [ ] All packages have at least minimal test coverage\n- [ ] Test coverage reporting excludes dist/build artifacts\n- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs all tests successfully\n- [ ] Developer documentation updated with testing guidelines\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Improved Developer Experience**: Consistent testing commands across all packages\n2. **Better Code Quality**: Increased test coverage from 28% to target 60%+\n3. **Reliable CI/CD**: All PRs validated with comprehensive test suite\n4. **Easier Onboarding**: New contributors can confidently run tests\n5. **Reduced Bugs**: Catch issues early with standardized testing\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n1. **Using Different Test Runners**: Considered Jest/Vitest but Bun test is already established\n2. **Monorepo-level Testing Only**: Would miss package-specific issues\n3. **Excluding Packages from Testing**: Would leave gaps in coverage\n\n## Additional Context\n\n- Current test coverage is ~28% (excluding dist files)\n- The monorepo uses Turbo for orchestration\n- Bun test runner is the standard across the project\n- Some packages have E2E tests (client) that need special handling\n\nThis improvement will significantly enhance the development workflow and code quality across the ElizaOS project.",

      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "\n**Describe the bug**\nI am creating a plugin to manage the Biconomy wallet with Chainlink automation & functions. It is hard to use Eliza as the agent that only supports one message, then stop using plugins and do everything from the AI model and simulate on-chain action, although I added all the actions to use it correctly.\n\n\nThe ElizaOS framework (v0.0.12) has significant reliability issues when developing custom plugins. The primary issues include:\n1. Action triggers frequently return responses from the AI model itself rather than executing the defined handler functions\n2. The debugging tools are non-functional, making troubleshooting nearly impossible\n3. Error handling is minimal or absent, with cryptic error messages like \"message: \"(Error) Message content or data is missing \" without proper stack traces. I know it from my code, but with no debugger, now I am supposed to use the `logger.debug` everywhere and redo steps, which almost take forever\n4. Database connection failures occur without clear resolution paths\n```\n[2025-06-24 15:24:48] ERROR: [CUSTOM MIGRATOR] Database connection failed: Aborted().

The plugin-evm integration is particularly problematic, with the agent consistently struggling to differentiate between executing actual on-chain transactions and merely simulating them\nThese issues severely impact our timeline for the Chainlink Chromium hackathon project.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Create a custom plugin with defined actions (e.g., our smart-wallet-plugin with CREATE_BICONOMY_WALLET action)\n2. Attempt to trigger the action through the agent interface\n3. Observe that the system returns a generic AI response instead of executing the handler function. \n4. When errors occur, observe that the error messages lack context or actionable information\n5. Attempt to use the debugging tools and observe that they fail to provide useful information\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\n1. When an action is triggered, the corresponding handler function should execute reliably\n2. Error messages should provide clear context, including the specific issue, location, and potential resolution\n3. Debugging tools should function properly, allowing developers to trace execution flow\n4. Database connections should be reliable or provide clear error messages with resolution steps\n5. Documentation should accurately reflect the current API and provide troubleshooting guidance\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38ef9343-0280-4f09-8c55-adb474b02f9b)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc2aa091-595f-4d37-b2f6-69d701c2d3c8)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03a06bd6-4c58-4da8-9b23-2b7f27b31fea)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc025bc6-5f57-43c7-a1ac-c7ab9612420c)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d117bec6-5960-4c6d-9028-2210a0616bf1)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1dfbc39f-c6c1-46ba-9550-4dcddd0cff4d)\n\n**Additional context**\n\nWe upgraded from v0.0.11 (which had message loading issues) to v0.0.12, but continue to experience significant development challenges. The framework's instability is particularly problematic given our tight timeline for the Chainlink Chromium hackathon. The most frustrating aspect is the inconsistency between documentation examples and actual runtime behaviour, especially regarding action handling and plugin integration.\n\nConclusion: All I want is a way to make sure actions are getting triggered instead of the AI model replying to me with a simulation with 0 on-chain action\n",

      "author": "samarth30",
      "number": 5066,
      "body": "This pull request introduces several enhancements and new features to the plugin migration system, focusing on improving test generation, repository analysis, and environment variable management. The most significant changes include the introduction of a context-aware test generation system, updates to repository analysis logic, and improvements to environment variable prompting. Additionally, configuration constants and export structure have been updated for better maintainability.\r\n\r\n### Context-Aware Test Generation\r\n* Added a new system for generating plugin-specific tests dynamically based on the plugin's actual structure and functionality. This replaces the old static template system, ensuring more relevant and accurate tests. (`CONTEXT_AWARE_TESTING.md`)\r\n\r\n### Repository Analysis Enhancements\r\n* Implemented a repository analyzer that scans a plugin's directory for key files (`README.md`, `package.json`, `index.ts/js`) and source files while respecting token limits and skipping large or binary files.

      "body": "Implements a new plugin `@elizaos/plugin-grok` to integrate with xAI's Grok language models. This plugin leverages Grok's OpenAI-compatible API.\r\n\r\nKey changes:\r\n- Created `packages/plugin-grok/`:\r\n    - `package.json`: Defines the new plugin package.\r\n    - `tsconfig.json`, `tsup.config.ts`: Build configuration.\r\n    - `src/index.ts`: Implements `GrokLanguageModel` (extending `ChatLanguageModel` from core) using the OpenAI SDK configured for Grok's API endpoint (`https://api.x.ai/v1`) and `XAI_API_KEY`. Includes `generate` and `stream` methods with preliminary tool use support. Registers `GrokService` with service type \"grok\".\r\n    - `src/__tests__/index.test.ts`: Basic unit tests for `GrokLanguageModel`.\r\n    - `README.md`: Documentation for setting up and using the plugin.\r\n- Updated `packages/cli/src/server/loader.ts` to import `@elizaos/plugin-grok`, ensuring the service is registered.\r\n- Updated `packages/cli/tsconfig.json` to include path mapping for the new local plugin.\r\n- Updated `packages/cli/src/characters/gork.ts` to demonstrate how a character can conditionally use `@elizaos/plugin-grok` if `XAI_API_KEY` is set.\r\n\r\nThis allows users with an XAI API key to use Grok models within the ElizaOS ecosystem.\r\n\r\n<!-- Use this template by filling in information and copying and pasting relevant items out of the HTML comments. -->\r\n\r\n# Relates to\r\n\r\n<!-- LINK TO ISSUE OR TICKET -->\r\n\r\n<!-- This risks section must be filled out before the final review and merge. -->\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nLow, medium, large.

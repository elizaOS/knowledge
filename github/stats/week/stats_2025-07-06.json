      "body": "**Describe the bug**\nOn 1.0.17, when I run `elizaos dev` on windows (powershell 7), it tries to load openai plugin (1.0.6) and bootstrap (1.0.15) but it fails to do so using all relevant strategies. It tries to install the plugin, succeeds to install, but fails to load it still.\n\nBecause it can't load openai and bootstrap plugin, it doesn't process any messages sent to it.\n\nHowever, it's able to find @elizaos/plugin-sql so I'm not sure what the difference is.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nOn windows (powershell 7), create a new project and run 'elizaos dev'\n\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nI expect it to load the plugins so that it can handle the messages send from the chat.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n<img width=\"1317\" height=\"576\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b70ff76a-619a-49bd-abe9-83affa8479c3\" />\n\n**Additional context**\n\nI'm on Windows Powershell 7. WSL is installed. I don't have this issue when I run it on my Ubuntu Linux VM.\n\nI cloned the eliza repo and ran 'bun install', 'bun run build' and 'bun start' and it's able to load everything on Windows Powershell 7. So it seems this is only failing when I try running the elizaos commands from a project, but not from the eliza repo itself.",

      "author": "SYMBaiEX",
      "number": 5410,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "## Description\n\nSeveral JSDoc comments in the core package have parameter names that don't match the actual function signatures, causing documentation warnings during the build process.\n\n## JSDoc Issues Found\n\n### 1. DatabaseAdapter.getRoomsByIds\n- **File**: `packages/core/src/database.ts`\n- **Issue**: JSDoc says `@param roomId` but the parameter is `roomIds` (plural)\n- **Current JSDoc**:\n```typescript\n/**\n * Retrieves the room ID for a given room, if it exists.\n * @param roomId The UUID of the room to retrieve.\n * @returns A Promise that resolves to the room ID or null if not found.\n */\nabstract getRoomsByIds(roomIds: UUID[]): Promise<Room[]  < /dev/null |  null>;\n```\n\n### 2. DatabaseAdapter.createRooms\n- **File**: `packages/core/src/database.ts`\n- **Issue**: JSDoc mentions `@param roomId` but the method only takes `rooms: Room[]`\n- **Current JSDoc**:\n```typescript\n/**\n * Creates a new rooms with an optional specified ID.\n * @param roomId Optional UUID to assign to the new room.\n * @returns A Promise that resolves to the UUID of the created rooms.\n */\nabstract createRooms(rooms: Room[]): Promise<UUID[]>;\n```\n\n### 3. DatabaseAdapter.setCache\n- **File**: `packages/core/src/database.ts`\n- **Issue**: JSDoc incorrectly lists `@param params` when the method takes `key` and `value` as separate parameters\n- **Current JSDoc**:\n```typescript\n/**\n * Sets a value in the cache with the given key.\n * @param params Object containing the cache key and value\n * @param key The key to store the value under\n * @param value The string value to cache\n * @returns Promise resolving to true if the cache was set successfully\n */\nabstract setCache<T>(key: string, value: T): Promise<boolean>;\n```\n\n### 4. decryptedCharacter\n- **File**: `packages/core/src/specs/v2/settings.ts`\n- **Issue**: JSDoc documents `@param runtime` but this parameter is not used in the function\n- **Current JSDoc**:\n```typescript\n/**\n * Decrypts sensitive data in a Character object\n * @param {Character} character - The character object with encrypted secrets\n * @param {IAgentRuntime} runtime - The runtime information needed for salt generation\n * @returns {Character} - A copy of the character with decrypted secrets\n */\nexport function decryptedCharacter(character: Character, runtime: IAgentRuntime): Character {\n```\n\n### 5. v1.formatMessages\n- **File**: `packages/core/src/specs/v1/messages.ts`\n- **Issue**: JSDoc lists `@param messages` and `@param actors` as separate parameters, but the function takes a single object parameter\n- **Current JSDoc**:\n```typescript\n/**\n * Format messages into a string\n * @param messages - list of messages\n * @param actors - list of actors\n * @returns string\n */\nexport const formatMessages = ({ messages, actors }: { messages: Memory[]; actors: Actor[] }) => {\n```\n\n### 6. v2.encryptedCharacter\n- **File**: `packages/core/src/specs/v2/settings.ts` (likely)\n- **Issue**: Similar to decryptedCharacter, JSDoc mentions `@param runtime` that's not used\n\n## Build Warnings\n\nThese issues cause the following warnings during documentation build:\n```\n@elizaos/docs:dev: [warning] The signature DatabaseAdapter.getRoomsByIds has an @param with name \"roomId\", which was not used\n@elizaos/docs:dev: [warning] The signature DatabaseAdapter.createRooms has an @param with name \"roomId\", which was not used\n@elizaos/docs:dev: [warning] The signature DatabaseAdapter.setCache has an @param with name \"params\", which was not used\n@elizaos/docs:dev: [warning] The signature decryptedCharacter has an @param with name \"runtime\", which was not used\n@elizaos/docs:dev: [warning] The signature v1.formatMessages has an @param with name \"messages\", which was not used\n@elizaos/docs:dev: [warning] The signature v1.formatMessages has an @param with name \"actors\", which was not used\n@elizaos/docs:dev: [warning] The signature v2.encryptedCharacter has an @param with name \"runtime\", which was not used\n```\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nUpdate all JSDoc comments to accurately reflect the actual function parameters. This will improve documentation accuracy and eliminate build warnings.\n\n## Priority\n\nMedium - These are documentation issues that don't affect functionality but do impact documentation quality and cause build warnings.",

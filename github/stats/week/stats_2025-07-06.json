      "author": "SYMBaiEX",
      "number": 5410,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "## Description\n\nSeveral JSDoc comments in the core package have parameter names that don't match the actual function signatures, causing documentation warnings during the build process.\n\n## JSDoc Issues Found\n\n### 1. DatabaseAdapter.getRoomsByIds\n- **File**: `packages/core/src/database.ts`\n- **Issue**: JSDoc says `@param roomId` but the parameter is `roomIds` (plural)\n- **Current JSDoc**:\n```typescript\n/**\n * Retrieves the room ID for a given room, if it exists.\n * @param roomId The UUID of the room to retrieve.\n * @returns A Promise that resolves to the room ID or null if not found.\n */\nabstract getRoomsByIds(roomIds: UUID[]): Promise<Room[]  < /dev/null |  null>;\n```\n\n### 2. DatabaseAdapter.createRooms\n- **File**: `packages/core/src/database.ts`\n- **Issue**: JSDoc mentions `@param roomId` but the method only takes `rooms: Room[]`\n- **Current JSDoc**:\n```typescript\n/**\n * Creates a new rooms with an optional specified ID.\n * @param roomId Optional UUID to assign to the new room.\n * @returns A Promise that resolves to the UUID of the created rooms.\n */\nabstract createRooms(rooms: Room[]): Promise<UUID[]>;\n```\n\n### 3. DatabaseAdapter.setCache\n- **File**: `packages/core/src/database.ts`\n- **Issue**: JSDoc incorrectly lists `@param params` when the method takes `key` and `value` as separate parameters\n- **Current JSDoc**:\n```typescript\n/**\n * Sets a value in the cache with the given key.\n * @param params Object containing the cache key and value\n * @param key The key to store the value under\n * @param value The string value to cache\n * @returns Promise resolving to true if the cache was set successfully\n */\nabstract setCache<T>(key: string, value: T): Promise<boolean>;\n```\n\n### 4. decryptedCharacter\n- **File**: `packages/core/src/specs/v2/settings.ts`\n- **Issue**: JSDoc documents `@param runtime` but this parameter is not used in the function\n- **Current JSDoc**:\n```typescript\n/**\n * Decrypts sensitive data in a Character object\n * @param {Character} character - The character object with encrypted secrets\n * @param {IAgentRuntime} runtime - The runtime information needed for salt generation\n * @returns {Character} - A copy of the character with decrypted secrets\n */\nexport function decryptedCharacter(character: Character, runtime: IAgentRuntime): Character {\n```\n\n### 5. v1.formatMessages\n- **File**: `packages/core/src/specs/v1/messages.ts`\n- **Issue**: JSDoc lists `@param messages` and `@param actors` as separate parameters, but the function takes a single object parameter\n- **Current JSDoc**:\n```typescript\n/**\n * Format messages into a string\n * @param messages - list of messages\n * @param actors - list of actors\n * @returns string\n */\nexport const formatMessages = ({ messages, actors }: { messages: Memory[]; actors: Actor[] }) => {\n```\n\n### 6. v2.encryptedCharacter\n- **File**: `packages/core/src/specs/v2/settings.ts` (likely)\n- **Issue**: Similar to decryptedCharacter, JSDoc mentions `@param runtime` that's not used\n\n## Build Warnings\n\nThese issues cause the following warnings during documentation build:\n```\n@elizaos/docs:dev: [warning] The signature DatabaseAdapter.getRoomsByIds has an @param with name \"roomId\", which was not used\n@elizaos/docs:dev: [warning] The signature DatabaseAdapter.createRooms has an @param with name \"roomId\", which was not used\n@elizaos/docs:dev: [warning] The signature DatabaseAdapter.setCache has an @param with name \"params\", which was not used\n@elizaos/docs:dev: [warning] The signature decryptedCharacter has an @param with name \"runtime\", which was not used\n@elizaos/docs:dev: [warning] The signature v1.formatMessages has an @param with name \"messages\", which was not used\n@elizaos/docs:dev: [warning] The signature v1.formatMessages has an @param with name \"actors\", which was not used\n@elizaos/docs:dev: [warning] The signature v2.encryptedCharacter has an @param with name \"runtime\", which was not used\n```\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nUpdate all JSDoc comments to accurately reflect the actual function parameters. This will improve documentation accuracy and eliminate build warnings.\n\n## Priority\n\nMedium - These are documentation issues that don't affect functionality but do impact documentation quality and cause build warnings.",

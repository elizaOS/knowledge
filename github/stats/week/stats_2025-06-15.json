      "author": "sicco-moonbeam",
      "number": 5142,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "**Describe the bug**\n\nThe elizaos test command incorrectly assumes that E2E tests must be run from within the ElizaOS monorepo structure, even when running tests for standalone projects created with `elizaos create`. This prevents running E2E tests in standalone projects that are meant to extend ElizaOS functionality.\n\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Create a new ElizaOS project\n```elizaos create my-project```\n\n2. Run the e2e tests:\n\n```npm run test:e2e```\n\n3. Error: Could not find monorepo root. Make sure to run tests from within the Eliza project.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nThe elizaos test command should:\n1. Recognize standalone projects created with elizaos create\n2. Run E2E tests in the project's e2e/ directory\n3. Not require the full ElizaOS monorepo structure\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nN/A\n\n**Additional context**\n\n- Error is reliably reproducible with any \"out-of-the-box\" project created with @elizaos/cli\n\n",

      "body": "**Describe the bug**\n\nIn using the `plugin-evm` transfer function we expect to see a followup message with either the success or failure of the transaction.\n\nIn the plugin's `transfer.ts` callback, we see the following:\n\nhttps://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/blob/6bf9c4c54b9e1a558c7fb092f071f2e374435887/src/actions/transfer.ts#L133\n\n```typescript\n if (callback) {\n        callback({\n          text: `Successfully transferred ${paramOptions.amount} tokens to ${paramOptions.toAddress}\\nTransaction Hash: ${transferResp.hash}`,\n          content: {\n            success: true,\n            hash: transferResp.hash,\n            amount: formatEther(transferResp.value),\n            recipient: transferResp.to,\n            chain: paramOptions.fromChain,\n          },\n        });\n      }\n... (other error logging as well)\n```\n\nWe see the following in our logs (added additional debugging console.log statements):\n\n```bash\nLOG:in the transfer action\nCALLBACK IN EVM_TRANSFER_TOKENS [AsyncFunction (anonymous)]\nin the transferResponse try block\ntransferResponse try block completed {\n  hash: '0xd2680982067e0258612119a58497208428613debcd314d667bd758b93ea86ed8',\n  from: '0x7850f8a9825d6dadfF5621300ee11f2dED76b76b',\n  to: '0x25709998B542f1Be27D19Fa0B3A9A67302bc1b94',\n  value: 20000000000000000n,\n  data: '0x'\n}\n[2025-06-09 19:25:35] INFO: [Eliza] Agent generated response for message.

Processing the transaction now.\",` in the Eliza chat interface.\n\nWe would expect to see a followup message with the success (or failure) text from the callback in the `transfer.ts` function.\n\nWe also triggered an unsuccessful transaction and did not receive a followup error message which the callback suggests we should see.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n- Bare Eliza scaffolded as a fresh project with the `plugin-anthropic` and `plugin-evm` added:\n\n```bash\n    \"@elizaos/cli\": \"^1.0.6\",\n    \"@elizaos/core\": \"^1.0.6\",\n    \"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\": \"^1.0.0\",\n    \"@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap\": \"^1.0.6\",\n    \"@elizaos/plugin-evm\": \"file:../plugin-evm\",\n    \"@elizaos/plugin-knowledge\": \"^1.0.1\",\n    \"@elizaos/plugin-openai\": \"^1.0.3\",\n    \"@elizaos/plugin-sql\": \"^1.0.6\",\n    \"zod\": \"3.24.2\"\n```\n\nand the following Character config:\n\n```typescript\n name: 'Eliza',\n  plugins: [\n    '@elizaos/plugin-sql',\n    ...(process.env.EVM_PRIVATE_KEY ? ['@elizaos/plugin-evm'] : []),\n    ...(process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY ? ['@elizaos/plugin-anthropic'] : []),\n    ...(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY ?

['@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap'] : []),\n  ],\n  settings: {\n    secrets: {},\n    chains: {\n      evm: ['sepolia'],\n    },\n    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,\n    ANTHROPIC_SMALL_MODEL: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-latest',\n    ANTHROPIC_LARGE_MODEL: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-latest',\n  },\n\n```\nOur private key and RPC are configured and work as the transfer is successful.\n\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nBased on the callback in `transfer.ts` we expect to see a followup message indicating the success or failure of the transfer call.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06dae3fa-9b2c-4e49-b660-42f2d9f9837f)\n\nAt this stage, the transfer succeeds but this is the last message we received.\n\nWe would expect that there would be a followup message after this indicating the success or the failure, including (or similar to) the text in the `transfer.ts` callback (in the `plugin-evm` plugin):\n\n`Successfully transferred ${paramOptions.amount} tokens to ${paramOptions.toAddress}\\nTransaction Hash: ${transferResp.hash}`\n\n**Additional context**\n\nWe're under the impression that this is a core callback issue and not with the `plugin-evm` itself as we're seeing similar behavior with a barebones example using the `plugin-mcp`. This is a more direct and more easily reproducible example to file.\n",

      "body": "**Describe the bug**\n\nI am trying to get rag working and following docs, but that code is not implemented in 1.0.6.  It appears to be commented as a placeholder in \n \n**To Reproduce**\n\nsettings: {\n    secrets: {},\n    ragKnowledge: true,\n  },\n  knowledge: [\n    {\n      directory: 'knowledge/foobar',\n      shared: true,\n    },\n  ],\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nI expect that it would parse on startup and it was not doing that, as it used to do.  So, I looked into code and found this... summary from claude....\n\nMissing Implementation Locations\n\n  1. AgentRuntime Initialization Missing Knowledge \n  Processing\n\n  File: /packages/core/src/runtime.ts (lines 494-651)\n  - The AgentRuntime.initialize() method should process\n  character.knowledge but doesn't\n  - No call to any knowledge processing function during\n  agent startup\n\n  2. TODO Comment Confirms Missing Implementation\n\n  File: /packages/core/src/specs/v1/index.ts (line 50)\n  // TODO: Implement the remaining adapters: ... - \n  knowledge / memory\n  This is a developer comment explicitly stating that\n  knowledge processing is not implemented yet.\n\n  3. Bootstrap Plugin Missing KNOWLEDGE Provider\n\n  File: /packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/index.ts\n  - Multiple message examples reference providers: \n  ['KNOWLEDGE'] in character files\n  - But the bootstrap plugin doesn't export any KNOWLEDGE \n  provider\n  - Provider list is incomplete - missing the knowledge\n  provider entirely\n\n  4. RagService Interface Exists But No Implementation\n\n  File: /packages/core/src/runtime.ts (lines 52-61)\n  interface RagServiceDelegator extends Service {\n    getKnowledge(message: Memory, scope?: { roomId?: UUID;\n   worldId?: UUID; entityId?: UUID }):\n  Promise<KnowledgeItem[]>;\n    _internalAddKnowledge(item: KnowledgeItem, options?:\n  any, scope?: any): Promise<void>;\n  }\n  The interface exists but no actual implementation of\n  this service.\n\n  5. Missing Functions\n\n  - processCharacterKnowledge() - Referenced in docs but\n  doesn't exist anywhere\n  - No knowledge file reading/processing logic\n  - No connection between character.knowledge array and\n  embedding system\n\n  Developer Comments Confirming This\n\n  The codebase has explicit TODO comments indicating that\n  knowledge/memory functionality is intentionally \n  unfinished. The character examples even reference\n   a KNOWLEDGE provider that doesn't exist, suggesting\n  this was planned but never implemented.\n\n",

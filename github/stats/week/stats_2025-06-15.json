      "body": "**Describe the bug**\n\nI am trying to get rag working and following docs, but that code is not implemented in 1.0.6.  It appears to be commented as a placeholder in \n \n**To Reproduce**\n\nsettings: {\n    secrets: {},\n    ragKnowledge: true,\n  },\n  knowledge: [\n    {\n      directory: 'knowledge/foobar',\n      shared: true,\n    },\n  ],\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nI expect that it would parse on startup and it was not doing that, as it used to do.  So, I looked into code and found this... summary from claude....\n\nMissing Implementation Locations\n\n  1. AgentRuntime Initialization Missing Knowledge \n  Processing\n\n  File: /packages/core/src/runtime.ts (lines 494-651)\n  - The AgentRuntime.initialize() method should process\n  character.knowledge but doesn't\n  - No call to any knowledge processing function during\n  agent startup\n\n  2. TODO Comment Confirms Missing Implementation\n\n  File: /packages/core/src/specs/v1/index.ts (line 50)\n  // TODO: Implement the remaining adapters: ... - \n  knowledge / memory\n  This is a developer comment explicitly stating that\n  knowledge processing is not implemented yet.\n\n  3. Bootstrap Plugin Missing KNOWLEDGE Provider\n\n  File: /packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/index.ts\n  - Multiple message examples reference providers: \n  ['KNOWLEDGE'] in character files\n  - But the bootstrap plugin doesn't export any KNOWLEDGE \n  provider\n  - Provider list is incomplete - missing the knowledge\n  provider entirely\n\n  4. RagService Interface Exists But No Implementation\n\n  File: /packages/core/src/runtime.ts (lines 52-61)\n  interface RagServiceDelegator extends Service {\n    getKnowledge(message: Memory, scope?: { roomId?: UUID;\n   worldId?: UUID; entityId?: UUID }):\n  Promise<KnowledgeItem[]>;\n    _internalAddKnowledge(item: KnowledgeItem, options?:\n  any, scope?: any): Promise<void>;\n  }\n  The interface exists but no actual implementation of\n  this service.\n\n  5. Missing Functions\n\n  - processCharacterKnowledge() - Referenced in docs but\n  doesn't exist anywhere\n  - No knowledge file reading/processing logic\n  - No connection between character.knowledge array and\n  embedding system\n\n  Developer Comments Confirming This\n\n  The codebase has explicit TODO comments indicating that\n  knowledge/memory functionality is intentionally \n  unfinished. The character examples even reference\n   a KNOWLEDGE provider that doesn't exist, suggesting\n  this was planned but never implemented.\n\n",

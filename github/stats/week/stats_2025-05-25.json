      "author": "0x-Tek",
      "number": 4769,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "When you send a message, two messages get added to the chat immediately: one from the user and a second from the \"system\" with a loading indicator. \nBut if the API call fails (like due to no internet), both fake messages stay in the chat as if nothing went wrong. There’s no rollback, no error handling on the UI so it looks like the message was sent when it actually wasn’t.\n\nTo Reproduce:\n\n1.Open the chat page (eliza/client/src/components/chat.tsx)\n\n2.Disconnect from the internet or block the request to the send message endpoint.\n\n3.Type a message and hit Enter.\n\n4.You’ll see your message and a “loading” message instantly.\n\n5.Even though the request fails, both messages stay on screen.\n\nExpected behavior\nIf the message fails to send, the temporary messages should be removed automatically. The user should also get feedback (like a toast or error icon) to let them know it didn’t work.\n\nAdditional context\nTo fix it, I added a tempId to identify and clean up fake messages properly. Now if the message fails, those temporary entries get removed from the cache.\n\n\nIn chat.tsx, update the type:\n```\ntype ExtraContentFields = {\n    user: string;\n    createdAt: number;\n    isLoading?: boolean;\n    tempId?: string; // ✅ for cleanup\n};\n\n```\nReplace handleSendMessage with:\n```\nconst handleSendMessage = (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    if (!input) return;\n\n    const tempId = `${Date.now()}-${Math.random()}`;\n    const attachments: IAttachment[] | undefined = selectedFile\n        ? [\n              {\n                  url: URL.createObjectURL(selectedFile),\n                  contentType: selectedFile.type,\n                  title: selectedFile.name,\n              },\n          ]\n        : undefined;\n\n    const tempMessages: ContentWithUser[] = [\n        {\n            text: input,\n            user: \"user\",\n            createdAt: Date.now(),\n            attachments,\n            isLoading: true,\n            tempId,\n        },\n        {\n            text: input,\n            user: \"system\",\n            createdAt: Date.now(),\n            isLoading: true,\n            tempId,\n        },\n    ];\n\n    queryClient.setQueryData(\n        [\"messages\", agentId],\n        (old: ContentWithUser[] = []) => [...old, ...tempMessages]\n    );\n\n    sendMessageMutation.mutate({\n        message: input,\n        selectedFile,\n        tempId,\n    });\n\n    setSelectedFile(null);\n    setInput(\"\");\n    formRef.current?.reset();\n};\n```\n\nAnd update the mutation like this:\n```\nconst sendMessageMutation = useMutation({\n    mutationKey: [\"send_message\", agentId],\n    mutationFn: ({\n        message,\n        selectedFile,\n    }: {\n        message: string;\n        selectedFile?: File | null;\n        tempId: string;\n    }) => apiClient.sendMessage(agentId, message, selectedFile),\n    onSuccess: (newMessages: ContentWithUser[], variables) => {\n        const { tempId } = variables;\n        queryClient.setQueryData(\n            [\"messages\", agentId],\n            (old: ContentWithUser[] = []) => [\n                ...old.filter((msg) => msg.tempId !== tempId),\n                ...newMessages.map((msg) => ({\n                    ...msg,\n                    createdAt: Date.now(),\n                })),\n            ]\n        );\n    },\n    onError: (error, variables) => {\n        const { tempId } = variables;\n        queryClient.setQueryData(\n            [\"messages\", agentId],\n            (old: ContentWithUser[] = []) =>\n                old.filter((msg) => msg.tempId !== tempId)\n        );\n\n        toast({\n            variant: \"destructive\",\n            title: \"Unable to send message\",\n            description: error.message,\n        });\n    },\n});\n```\n",

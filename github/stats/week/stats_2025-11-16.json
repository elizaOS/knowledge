      "body": "We need to migrate the Eliza monorepo and all plugins from Zod v3 to Zod v4.\n\n* Stan has already initiated \\~20–25 PRs across referenced plugins to bump dependencies (core, bootstrap, langchain/ai/vercel, etc.) to the latest compatible Zod v4 versions.\n* Some plugins currently have mismatched peer dependencies; migration only works if all packages are upgraded consistently.\n* Newer versions of the AI SDK also rely on Zod v4, so all LLM plugins must be updated to the latest ai-sdk.\n\nThis migration is a blocking dependency upgrade: partial migration causes runtime and type errors. We need a coordinated effort to upgrade and test the full set of \\~40 plugins.\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n\n* Update package.json in all monorepo packages to depend on zod@^4.\n* Update all plugins (bootstrap, sql, LLM plugins, etc.) to use Zod v4 schemas.\n* Resolve peer dependency mismatches across packages.\n* Upgrade all AI SDK–based packages to versions that use Zod v4.",

Uses CSS `display: contents` to collapse wrapper spacing while preserving all content and functionality.\r\n\r\n**Key improvements:**\r\n- Bullet gaps: 24.5px → 2px (-91%)\r\n- List item gaps: 30.5px → 8px (-73%)\r\n- Header-to-bullets: 28.5px → 4px (-83%)\r\n- List-to-paragraph: 145.5px → 16px (-89%)\r\n- **Total spacing error eliminated: 178.5px → 0px**\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- ✅ Bug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- ✅ Improvements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- ✅ My changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\nThe changes are internal CSS improvements with no API or configuration changes.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the CSS changes in `packages/client/src/index.css` (lines 184-278)\r\n2. Review the component update in `packages/client/src/components/ai-elements/response.tsx` (line 12)\r\n3.

Ask a question that generates nested lists, for example:\r\n   - \"Explain the key features of this system\"\r\n   - \"Create a list view with example data showing nested workflow progress\"\r\n\r\n6. Verify:\r\n   - ✅ Compact, readable spacing between list items\r\n   - ✅ Tight spacing (4px) between headers and their following lists\r\n   - ✅ No overlapping text\r\n   - ✅ Proper visual hierarchy maintained\r\n   - ✅ No console errors\r\n   - ✅ Smooth scrolling works correctly\r\n\r\n### Tested Scenarios\r\n- ✅ Complex nested lists (numbered and bulleted)\r\n- ✅ Mixed content (paragraphs, lists, headings)\r\n- ✅ Scrolling and overflow behavior\r\n- ✅ Accessibility (screen reader, keyboard navigation)\r\n- ✅ No layout breakage in any scenario\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n<img width=\"3840\" height=\"2080\" alt=\"before\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/459f89bf-c623-4ad4-aa36-ce4a0f997033\" />\r\n*Excessive spacing between elements, particularly noticeable in nested lists*\r\n\r\n### After\r\n<img width=\"3840\" height=\"2080\" alt=\"after\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4addcb5-5dab-45fb-8e0f-e5dda4885d11\" />\r\n*Compact, readable spacing matching design targets and Claude web interface*\r\n\r\n# Technical Details\r\n\r\n## Files Changed\r\n- `packages/client/src/index.css` (+109 lines)\r\n- `packages/client/src/components/ai-elements/response.tsx` (1 line modified)\r\n\r\n## Key Technical Approach\r\n\r\nUses CSS `display: contents` to make Streamdown's wrapper divs \"transparent\" to layout:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.markdown-content > div {\r\n  display: contents !important;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis removes wrapper divs from the box tree while preserving DOM structure and semantics, eliminating the spacing contribution from Tailwind's `space-y-4` class.\r\n\r\n## Browser Compatibility\r\n\r\n| Browser | Version | Status |\r\n|---------|---------|--------|\r\n| Chrome | 58+ (May 2017) | ✅ Supported |\r\n| Firefox | 37+ (March 2015) | ✅ Supported |\r\n| Safari | 11.1+ (March 2018) | ✅ Supported |\r\n| Edge | 79+ (January 2020) | ✅ Supported |\r\n\r\nCovers >95% of modern browser users.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**PR Title:**\r\n```\r\nfix(client): Fix excessive spacing in markdown rendered content\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Branch details:**\r\n- Base branch: `develop`\r\n- Compare branch: `fix/markdown-spacing-compact` (from gaiaaiagent/GAIA)",

Existing OpenRouter configurations continue to work unchanged.\r\n- **Test Coverage**: Unit tests updated to reflect new behavior (embedding support enabled for OpenRouter)\r\n- **Configuration**: Follows the same pattern as existing providers (OpenAI, Google, Ollama) for both interactive and non-interactive modes\r\n- **Validation**: Uses existing `isValidOpenRouterKey` function to validate API key format (`sk-or-` prefix)\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds comprehensive OpenRouter support for embeddings in the ElizaOS CLI:\r\n\r\n1. **Updates `hasEmbeddingSupport`** to include `'openrouter'` as a model with built-in embedding support\r\n2. **Adds OpenRouter to `getAvailableEmbeddingModels`** as a fallback option when the primary AI model doesn't support embeddings (e.g., Claude)\r\n3. **Implements setup configuration** in both `setupAIModelConfig` and `setupEmbeddingModelConfig` to handle:\r\n   - Interactive mode: Prompts users for OpenRouter API key\r\n   - Non-interactive mode: Writes placeholder configuration with helpful comments\r\n4. **Updates unit tests** to reflect that OpenRouter now has embedding support\r\n\r\n**Technical Details:**\r\n- Adds OpenRouter configuration with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_MODEL`, and `OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS`\r\n- Leverages OpenRouter's unified API access to multiple embedding models (including OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small)\r\n- Reuses existing `promptAndStoreOpenRouterKey` helper function from `get-config.ts`\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- [x] Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Improvements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n- [x] Updates (test updates to reflect new behavior)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this?

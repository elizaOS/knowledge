      "title": "LOG_LEVEL from .env Not Working in 1.0.6",
      "author": "harperaa",
      "number": 5005,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "   Bug Report: thanks to claude code....\n\n  Issue Summary\n\n  LOG_LEVEL set in .env files is ignored, but works when\n  set via command line environment variables.\n\n  Root Cause\n\n  Timing/Order of Operations Problem: The core logger is\n  initialized during module import (before .env loading)\n  and never rechecks environment variables.\n\n  Technical Details\n\n  Problem Code Locations:\n\n  1. Early Logger Initialization\n  (packages/core/src/logger.ts):\n  // Lines 148-152 - Logger configured at module import \n  time\n  const isDebugMode = (process?.env?.LOG_LEVEL ||\n  '').toLowerCase() === 'debug';\n  const effectiveLogLevel = isDebugMode ? 'debug' :\n  process?.env?.DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL || 'info';\n\n  2. Late .env Loading\n  (packages/cli/src/commands/start.ts):\n  // Lines 334-380 - .env loaded much later in start \n  command\n  const loadEnvConfig = () => {\n    // ... .env file processing happens here\n  }\n\n  Problematic Sequence:\n\n  1. Node.js starts → CLI imports modules\n  2. logger.ts imported → reads process.env.LOG_LEVEL \n  (empty) → configures 'info' level\n  3. Much later: start command executes\n  4. Much later: .env file loaded → LOG_LEVEL set in\n  process.env\n  5. Logger already configured, never rechecks LOG_LEVEL\n\n  Why Command Line Works:\n\n  Command line env vars are set before Node.js starts, so\n  they're available during early logger initialization.\n\n  Evidence\n\n  - ✅ Command line: LOG_LEVEL=debug elizaos start → Debug\n   logs appear\n  - ❌ .env file: LOG_LEVEL=debug → Debug logs don't\n  appear\n  - ❌ Runtime check: Logger configuration is static after\n   module import\n\n  Code Snippets\n\n  Logger reads LOG_LEVEL too early:\n  // packages/core/src/logger.ts:151-152\n  const isDebugMode = (process?.env?.LOG_LEVEL ||\n  '').toLowerCase() === 'debug';\n  const effectiveLogLevel = isDebugMode ? 'debug' :\n  process?.env?.DEFAULT_LOG_LEVEL || 'info';\n\n  But .env loading happens later:\n  // packages/cli/src/commands/start.ts:334-380  \n  const loadEnvConfig = () => {\n    // Environment loading happens in start command, after\n   logger init\n  }\n\n  Proposed Fix\n\n  Make logger initialization lazy/dynamic - defer\n  LOG_LEVEL reading until after .env files are loaded, or\n  add a mechanism to reconfigure logger when environment\n  changes.\n\n  This is a clear architectural issue where static module\n  initialization happens before dynamic environment\n  loading.",

      "author": "harperaa",
      "number": 5004,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "**Describe the bug**\n\nI am trying to get rag working and following docs, but that code is not implemented in 1.0.6.  It appears to be commented as a placeholder in \n \n**To Reproduce**\n\nsettings: {\n    secrets: {},\n    ragKnowledge: true,\n  },\n  knowledge: [\n    {\n      directory: 'knowledge/foobar',\n      shared: true,\n    },\n  ],\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nI expect that it would parse on startup and it was not doing that, as it used to do.  So, I looked into code and found this... summary from claude....\n\nMissing Implementation Locations\n\n  1. AgentRuntime Initialization Missing Knowledge \n  Processing\n\n  File: /packages/core/src/runtime.ts (lines 494-651)\n  - The AgentRuntime.initialize() method should process\n  character.knowledge but doesn't\n  - No call to any knowledge processing function during\n  agent startup\n\n  2. TODO Comment Confirms Missing Implementation\n\n  File: /packages/core/src/specs/v1/index.ts (line 50)\n  // TODO: Implement the remaining adapters: ... - \n  knowledge / memory\n  This is a developer comment explicitly stating that\n  knowledge processing is not implemented yet.\n\n  3. Bootstrap Plugin Missing KNOWLEDGE Provider\n\n  File: /packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/providers/index.ts\n  - Multiple message examples reference providers: \n  ['KNOWLEDGE'] in character files\n  - But the bootstrap plugin doesn't export any KNOWLEDGE \n  provider\n  - Provider list is incomplete - missing the knowledge\n  provider entirely\n\n  4. RagService Interface Exists But No Implementation\n\n  File: /packages/core/src/runtime.ts (lines 52-61)\n  interface RagServiceDelegator extends Service {\n    getKnowledge(message: Memory, scope?: { roomId?: UUID;\n   worldId?: UUID; entityId?: UUID }):\n  Promise<KnowledgeItem[]>;\n    _internalAddKnowledge(item: KnowledgeItem, options?:\n  any, scope?: any): Promise<void>;\n  }\n  The interface exists but no actual implementation of\n  this service.\n\n  5. Missing Functions\n\n  - processCharacterKnowledge() - Referenced in docs but\n  doesn't exist anywhere\n  - No knowledge file reading/processing logic\n  - No connection between character.knowledge array and\n  embedding system\n\n  Developer Comments Confirming This\n\n  The codebase has explicit TODO comments indicating that\n  knowledge/memory functionality is intentionally \n  unfinished. The character examples even reference\n   a KNOWLEDGE provider that doesn't exist, suggesting\n  this was planned but never implemented.\n\n",

      "number": 5009,
      "body": "## Summary\n- Adds automatic lockfile cleanup when falling back to GitHub installations\n- Prevents circular dependency issues during npm-to-GitHub fallback scenarios\n\n## Changes\n- **New `removeFromBunLock()` function**: Safely removes package entries from bun.lock using `bun remove`\n- **New `executeInstallationWithFallback()` function**: Handles npm installation with automatic GitHub fallback and lockfile cleanup\n- **Updated `installPlugin()` function**: Uses the new fallback mechanism for registry-based installations\n\n## How it works\n1. Attempts npm installation first\n2. If npm fails and GitHub fallback is available:\n   - Calls `removeFromBunLock()` to clean up any partial lockfile entries\n   - Attempts GitHub installation with clean lockfile\n3. Prevents circular dependency errors that can occur with stale lockfile entries\n\n## Test plan\n- [ ] Test npm installation success (should work as before)\n- [ ] Test npm installation failure with GitHub fallback available\n- [ ] Verify lockfile cleanup occurs before GitHub installation\n- [ ] Test with and without existing bun.lock file\n- [ ] Verify no regression in existing installation flows",

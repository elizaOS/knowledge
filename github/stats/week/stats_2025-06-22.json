      "body": "\n**Describe the bug**\nI am creating a plugin to manage the Biconomy wallet with Chainlink automation & functions. It is hard to use Eliza as the agent that only supports one message, then stop using plugins and do everything from the AI model and simulate on-chain action, although I added all the actions to use it correctly.\n\n\nThe ElizaOS framework (v0.0.12) has significant reliability issues when developing custom plugins. The primary issues include:\n1. Action triggers frequently return responses from the AI model itself rather than executing the defined handler functions\n2. The debugging tools are non-functional, making troubleshooting nearly impossible\n3. Error handling is minimal or absent, with cryptic error messages like \"message: \"(Error) Message content or data is missing \" without proper stack traces. I know it from my code, but with no debugger, now I am supposed to use the `logger.debug` everywhere and redo steps, which almost take forever\n4. Database connection failures occur without clear resolution paths\n```\n[2025-06-24 15:24:48] ERROR: [CUSTOM MIGRATOR] Database connection failed: Aborted().

The plugin-evm integration is particularly problematic, with the agent consistently struggling to differentiate between executing actual on-chain transactions and merely simulating them\nThese issues severely impact our timeline for the Chainlink Chromium hackathon project.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Create a custom plugin with defined actions (e.g., our smart-wallet-plugin with CREATE_BICONOMY_WALLET action)\n2. Attempt to trigger the action through the agent interface\n3. Observe that the system returns a generic AI response instead of executing the handler function. \n4. When errors occur, observe that the error messages lack context or actionable information\n5. Attempt to use the debugging tools and observe that they fail to provide useful information\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\n1. When an action is triggered, the corresponding handler function should execute reliably\n2. Error messages should provide clear context, including the specific issue, location, and potential resolution\n3. Debugging tools should function properly, allowing developers to trace execution flow\n4. Database connections should be reliable or provide clear error messages with resolution steps\n5. Documentation should accurately reflect the current API and provide troubleshooting guidance\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38ef9343-0280-4f09-8c55-adb474b02f9b)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc2aa091-595f-4d37-b2f6-69d701c2d3c8)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03a06bd6-4c58-4da8-9b23-2b7f27b31fea)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc025bc6-5f57-43c7-a1ac-c7ab9612420c)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d117bec6-5960-4c6d-9028-2210a0616bf1)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1dfbc39f-c6c1-46ba-9550-4dcddd0cff4d)\n\n**Additional context**\n\nWe upgraded from v0.0.11 (which had message loading issues) to v0.0.12, but continue to experience significant development challenges. The framework's instability is particularly problematic given our tight timeline for the Chainlink Chromium hackathon. The most frustrating aspect is the inconsistency between documentation examples and actual runtime behaviour, especially regarding action handling and plugin integration.\n\nConclusion: All I want is a way to make sure actions are getting triggered instead of the AI model replying to me with a simulation with 0 on-chain action\n",

      "body": "I've been struggling to setup a project from scratch for over 10 days now so I've decided to open an issue here. \n\nI've tried using all the possible options:\n- `eliza-starter` repo: First I tried with this one. After many unsuccessful attempts, I managed to get this up and running. However, the repo is now archived so I've decided to find another option. There should at least be a notice somewhere in the README explaining why the repo was archived as it is a bit confusing to come back to the repo you used yesterday and find it archived.\n- `eliza` (this) repo. It references an old video from a few months ago that doesn't help very much as a lot of stuff has changed in the meantime. I tried following the README:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git\ngit checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)\ncp .env.example .env\n```\nThen I set the `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` variable in `.env`. This is just my best guess for the variable name using the `eliza-starter` repo as there's no word on how to set up an agent using Gemini in the `.env` itself or in the docs.\nThen I execute the rest of the commands:\n```\nbun install\nbun run build\nbun start\n```\nHere the agent starts and I navigate to http://localhost:3000 to try and text my agent. However, the error is `A context size of 8192 is too large for the available VRAM` as the model is started locally and my Gemini API key is ignored. \n- CLI tool: I create a new project by running `elizaos create my-agent` and choose the standard options, including the OpenAI LLM. Long story short, this one fails me as well because I can't in God's name figure out how to start the model using my desired provider or change it afterwards.\n\nTL;DR There's a lack of synchronisation between the official documentation, this repo, and the CLI tool. It is very difficult to figure out where to look up the issues you have and find an answer to them.\n\nThis is just a fraction of the issues I've had along the way, all while just trying to set up a simple project.",

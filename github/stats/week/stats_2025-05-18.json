      "author": "kunleulysses",
      "number": 4486,
      "repository": "elizaos/eliza",
      "body": "Environment:\nOS: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (on VPS)\nNode.js Version: v23.11.0 (installed via NVM)\npnpm Version: v9.15.0\nElizaOS Installation Method: Manual Monorepo Clone (git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git)\nElizaOS Version: Checked out to latest tag (Likely v0.25.9 based on agent package version in logs)\n\nKey Packages:\n@elizaos/agent: v0.25.9\n@elizaos/core: Likely v0.25.9 (based on agent)\n@elizaos/plugin-twitter: 0.25.6-alpha.1 (or version installed via @latest)\n@elizaos/plugin-anthropic: 1.0.0-alpha.0 (or version installed via @latest)\nHardware: VPS with 3GB RAM\n\nProblem Description:\nThe ElizaOS agent process successfully initializes its core components but hangs indefinitely immediately after the Direct Client REST API binds to its port (e.g., 3000). This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \"anthropic\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\nClean VPS environment.\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \"clients\": [\"twitter\"], \"plugins\": [\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\", \"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\"], \"modelProvider\": \"anthropic\", and a specific \"model\": \"claude-3-haiku-20240307\". Include Twitter interaction settings under settings.twitter.\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.agent.json pointing to the character file.\nInstall dependencies: pnpm install.\nEnsure correct plugins are installed and linked to the agent package:\npnpm remove @elizaos/plugin-local-ai (if present)\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-anthropic@latest -F @elizaos/agent\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-twitter@latest -F @elizaos/agent\npnpm install\nBuild the project: pnpm build.\nStart the agent: pnpm start --characters=\"characters/flappy.character.json\".\n\nExpected Result:\nThe agent starts fully, logs confirm Twitter login and timeline handling begins, and subsequent AI tasks utilize the Anthropic API via the loaded plugin. The process remains active and responsive.\n\nActual Result:\nThe agent process hangs indefinitely after the SUCCESS: REST API bound to... log message. No further logs related to Twitter client initialization, AI provider interaction, or timeline handling appear. The process doesn't exit or crash.\n\n\n``` Relevant Logs:\n\n[2025-05-08 01:16:54] SUCCESS: REST API bound to 0.0.0.0:3000.

      "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nThis is a problem in that I'm trying to build a platform agnostic core package but eliza has no way of injecting specific platforms into it. It also seems like I will have to pollyfill some node.js libraries to use elizav2 core package\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nV2 is super clean but it really needs a platform abstraction. \n\n```typescript\ninterface Platform {\n  name: string\n  readFile?: typeof fs.readFile\n  ...etc\n}\n\nclass NodePlatform implements Platform {\n  name: 'NODEJS'\n  readFile fs.readFile\n  ..etc\n} \n```\n\nSuch that now \n- the entire core package has no platform specific logic in it. Less complexity\n- no imports (except typescript types)  in core package reference a node.js module. No need to polyfill\n- Flexible to provide our own platform for say bun if bun has a node incompatability causing issue in eliza or being in the browser but emulating a file system, etc.\n\nThis is a common pattern in other libraries such as [effect.ts](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/platform)\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\nAnother option would be to create seperate packages core-web, core-node. But this leads to a lot of code duplication.\n",

When used for L1 Ethereum transactions (staking, bridging), this can lead to inaccurate gas estimations, potentially causing transactions to be underpriced (fail) or overpriced.\r\n*   **Medium: Missing Heimdall Governance:** The P1 functionality for Polygon-specific governance (interacting with Heimdall) is not implemented. Current governance actions target EVM-based smart contracts. Users expecting native Polygon governance via Heimdall will not find this functionality.\r\n*   **Low: User-Facing `withdrawRewards` Action Stub:** The LLM-enabled `withdrawRewards` action is a non-functional stub. The core logic exists via the programmatic `WITHDRAW_REWARDS_L1` action and the `PolygonRpcService`.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR initializes the foundational structure and boilerplate for the new `@elizaos/plugin-polygon`. It establishes a functional, correctly configured, and buildable plugin skeleton that adheres to current ElizaOS conventions.\r\n\r\nKey functionalities included:\r\n*   **Plugin Core**: `package.json`, TypeScript configuration, main plugin definition (`src/index.ts`) with lifecycle methods, and registration with ElizaOS.\r\n*   **Configuration**: Handles essential configurations like L1/L2 RPC URLs, private key, and PolygonScan API key, with validation using `zod`. Includes `.env.example`.\r\n*   **L1 Staking (Ethereum)**:\r\n    *   `PolygonRpcService` implements interactions with L1 staking contracts (`StakeManager`, `ValidatorShare`) for delegation, undelegation (partial via `sellVoucher_new` in service), reward withdrawal, and fetching validator/delegator information.\r\n    *   User-facing LLM-enabled actions and direct programmatic actions for these operations.\r\n*   **L1 Native Bridge Deposit (Polygon PoS Bridge)**:\r\n    *   `PolygonRpcService` implements deposits to the L1 `RootChainManager` contract.\r\n    *   Actions for initiating bridge deposits.\r\n*   **L2 Interactions (Polygon PoS)**:\r\n    *   Basic L2 interactions like fetching balances, block numbers via `PolygonRpcService`.\r\n    *   Actions for these operations.\r\n*   **Checkpoint Status**:\r\n    *   `PolygonRpcService` implements checks against the L1 `RootChainManager` to verify L2 block checkpoint status.\r\n    *   Actions for this functionality.\r\n*   **EVM-Based Governance Stubs**:\r\n    *   Actions (`PROPOSE_GOVERNANCE_POLYGON`, `VOTE_GOVERNANCE_POLYGON`) are implemented to interact with EVM-compatible governor smart contracts (e.g., OpenZeppelin Governor) using `viem`.\r\n*   **Providers**: Includes a `PolygonWalletProvider` (using `viem`) for EVM wallet interactions and exposing wallet details.\r\n*   **Services**: `PolygonRpcService` (using `ethers.js`) for core L1/L2 EVM logic and `GasService` for L2 gas price fetching (PolygonScan).\r\n*   **Documentation**: A comprehensive `README.md` for the plugin.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there are no linked issues explaining why. If there is a related issue, it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nThis work establishes the dedicated `@elizaos/plugin-polygon` as outlined in the \"Implement Polygon Plugin MVP\" epic. The goal is to create a focused plugin capable of handling Polygon-specific interactions (L1 staking, native bridge, Heimdall governance) that go beyond the scope of a generic EVM plugin. This PR lays the groundwork for these features, with many EVM-based L1/L2 interactions already functional.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf documentation change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation. (The plugin includes its own `README.md` which serves as initial documentation for its features and setup).\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1.  **`packages/plugin-polygon/README.md`**: For an overview of the plugin's intended features and setup.\r\n2.  **`packages/plugin-polygon/src/index.ts`**: For the main plugin definition, configuration handling, and registration of components.\r\n3.  **`packages/plugin-polygon/src/services/PolygonRpcService.ts`**: To understand the core logic for L1 staking, L1 bridging, and L2 interactions.\r\n4.  **`packages/plugin-polygon/src/services/GasService.ts`**: To review the L2 gas oracle integration.\r\n5.  Key action files like `packages/plugin-polygon/src/actions/delegate.ts` (L1 staking) and `packages/plugin-polygon/src/actions/proposeGovernance.ts` (EVM Governance).\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone: Automated tests are acceptable.\r\n-->\r\nManual testing is recommended for this initial integration, focusing on the implemented P1 functionalities. Automated tests for configuration loading were considered in the ticket but not explicitly verified as present in this review.\r\n\r\n**Setup:**\r\n1.  Navigate to the `packages/plugin-polygon` directory.\r\n2.  Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`.\r\n3.  Populate the `.env` file with valid:\r\n    *   `POLYGON_RPC_URL` (Polygon PoS RPC endpoint)\r\n    *   `ETHEREUM_RPC_URL` (Ethereum Mainnet RPC endpoint for L1)\r\n    *   `PRIVATE_KEY` (for a wallet with funds on both L1 and L2 for testing)\r\n    *   `POLYGONSCAN_KEY` (API key for PolygonScan)\r\n    *   `HEIMDALL_RPC_URL` (placeholder, as Heimdall features are not yet implemented)\r\n",

If PolygonScan has an outage or changes its API contract in an unexpected way, the service will use the RPC fallback. The fallback itself depends on the configured Polygon RPC node.\r\n*   **RPC Node Dependency (Fallback):** The fallback mechanism relies on the availability and correctness of the configured Polygon RPC node.\r\n*   **ABI Placeholders:** `PolygonRpcService.ts` currently uses placeholder ABIs (`\"[]\"`) for staking and bridge-related contracts. One line (`await this.stakeManagerContractL1.currentEpoch();`) that would test a contract call during initialization was commented out to prevent errors due to these empty ABIs, this have been fixed in the commit but needs to be commented out to reproduce test results at the moment. This does not affect the `GasService` functionality directly, but it's a known state of a related service.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a robust gas price estimation service for the Polygon (PoS) network within the `plugin-polygon`. The service, `GasService.ts`, fetches gas price recommendations (Safe, Average, Fast priority fees, and Base Fee) primarily from the PolygonScan Gas Oracle API. If the API is unavailable, the API key is missing, or the response is problematic, it gracefully falls back to using the standard `eth_gasPrice` method (via `provider.getFeeData()`) from the configured L2 Polygon RPC node.\r\n\r\nThe service ensures consistent data types (bigint for Wei values) and handles various response formats from PolygonScan, including prioritizing `BaseFee` (in MATIC/ETH) over `suggestBaseFee` (in Gwei) if both are present or one is invalid.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n**Features** (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nA good starting point would be `packages/plugin-polygon/src/services/GasService.ts` to understand the core logic, followed by `packages/plugin-polygon/src/services/__tests__/GasService.test.ts` to see how it's tested. Also, review the changes in `packages/plugin-polygon/src/services/PolygonRpcService.ts` for the `getL2Provider()` method and the ABI placeholder modifications.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nAutomated integration tests are provided and cover the main scenarios:\r\n\r\n1.  **Successful PolygonScan API fetch and parse:**\r\n    *   Ensures EIP-1559 style fees are fetched and parsed correctly.\r\n    *   Verifies `fallbackGasPrice` is null.\r\n    *   Checks that `estimatedBaseFee` and at least one priority fee tier are valid positive bigints.\r\n2.  **Fallback to RPC `eth_gasPrice` when PolygonScan API key is missing:**\r\n    *   Simulates a missing API key.\r\n    *   Verifies that EIP-1559 fee fields are null.\r\n    *   Ensures `fallbackGasPrice` is a valid positive bigint.\r\n\r\n**To run the tests:**\r\n1. Ensure a root `.env` file is configured with valid `POLYGONSCAN_KEY`, `POLYGON_RPC_URL`, `ETHEREUM_RPC_URL`, and `PRIVATE_KEY`.\r\n2. Navigate to the `packages/plugin-polygon` directory.\r\n3. Run `bun run build` to build the package.\r\n4. Run `npx vitest run --globals src/services/__tests__/GasService.test.ts` to execute the integration tests.\r\n\r\nThe tests include `console.log` output for the fetched estimates in both scenarios, allowing for manual inspection of the live data returned.\r\n",

When used for L1 Ethereum transactions (staking, bridging), this can lead to inaccurate gas estimations, potentially causing transactions to be underpriced (fail) or overpriced.\r\n*   **Medium: Missing Heimdall Governance:** The P1 functionality for Polygon-specific governance (interacting with Heimdall) is not implemented. Current governance actions target EVM-based smart contracts. Users expecting native Polygon governance via Heimdall will not find this functionality.\r\n*   **Low: User-Facing `withdrawRewards` Action Stub:** The LLM-enabled `withdrawRewards` action is a non-functional stub. The core logic exists via the programmatic `WITHDRAW_REWARDS_L1` action and the `PolygonRpcService`.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n1. **Plugin Foundation (#450):** \r\n   - Establishes the plugin package structure with proper configuration and boilerplate\r\n   - Implements configuration handling for RPC URLs, private keys, and API keys\r\n   - Creates the provider structure and plugin lifecycle methods\r\n\r\n2. **Staking Read Operations (#453):**\r\n   - Integrates StakeManager and ValidatorShare ABIs for interacting with L1 staking contracts\r\n   - Implements `getValidatorInfo(validatorId)` to fetch validator status, total stake, and commission rate\r\n   - Implements `getDelegatorInfo(validatorId, delegatorAddress)` to get delegator stake and pending rewards\r\n   - Creates robust error handling for contract interactions\r\n\r\n3. **Staking Write Operations (#454):**\r\n   - Implements `delegate(validatorId, amountWei)` for staking MATIC/POL to validators\r\n   - Implements `undelegate(validatorId, sharesAmountWei)` for initiating the unbonding process\r\n   - Implements `withdrawRewards(validatorId)` for claiming accumulated staking rewards\r\n   - Implements `restakeRewards(validatorId)` as a convenience function\r\n   - Handles transaction creation, gas estimation, signing, and broadcasting\r\n\r\n\r\nKey functionalities included:\r\n*   **Plugin Core**: `package.json`, TypeScript configuration, main plugin definition (`src/index.ts`) with lifecycle methods, and registration with ElizaOS.\r\n*   **Configuration**: Handles essential configurations like L1/L2 RPC URLs, private key, and PolygonScan API key, with validation using `zod`. Includes `.env.example`.\r\n*   **L1 Staking (Ethereum)**:\r\n    *   `PolygonRpcService` implements interactions with L1 staking contracts (`StakeManager`, `ValidatorShare`) for delegation, undelegation (partial via `sellVoucher_new` in service), reward withdrawal, and fetching validator/delegator information.\r\n    *   User-facing LLM-enabled actions and direct programmatic actions for these operations.\r\n*   **L1 Native Bridge Deposit (Polygon PoS Bridge)**:\r\n    *   `PolygonRpcService` implements deposits to the L1 `RootChainManager` contract.\r\n    *   Actions for initiating bridge deposits.\r\n*   **L2 Interactions (Polygon PoS)**:\r\n    *   Basic L2 interactions like fetching balances, block numbers via `PolygonRpcService`.\r\n    *   Actions for these operations.\r\n*   **Checkpoint Status**:\r\n    *   `PolygonRpcService` implements checks against the L1 `RootChainManager` to verify L2 block checkpoint status.\r\n    *   Actions for this functionality.\r\n*   **EVM-Based Governance Stubs**:\r\n    *   Actions (`PROPOSE_GOVERNANCE_POLYGON`, `VOTE_GOVERNANCE_POLYGON`) are implemented to interact with EVM-compatible governor smart contracts (e.g., OpenZeppelin Governor) using `viem`.\r\n*   **Providers**: Includes a `PolygonWalletProvider` (using `viem`) for EVM wallet interactions and exposing wallet details.\r\n*   **Services**: `PolygonRpcService` (using `ethers.js`) for core L1/L2 EVM logic and `GasService` for L2 gas price fetching (PolygonScan).\r\n*   **Documentation**: A comprehensive `README.md` for the plugin.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there are no linked issues explaining why. If there is a related issue, it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nThis work establishes the dedicated `@elizaos/plugin-polygon` as outlined in the \"Implement Polygon Plugin MVP\" epic. The goal is to create a focused plugin capable of handling Polygon-specific interactions (L1 staking, native bridge, Heimdall governance) that go beyond the scope of a generic EVM plugin. This PR lays the groundwork for these features, with many EVM-based L1/L2 interactions already functional.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf documentation change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation. (The plugin includes its own `README.md` which serves as initial documentation for its features and setup).\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n### Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. **`packages/plugin-polygon/README.md`**: For an overview of the plugin's intended features and setup.\r\n2. **`packages/plugin-polygon/src/index.ts`**: For the main plugin definition, configuration handling, and registration of components.\r\n3. **`packages/plugin-polygon/src/services/PolygonRpcService.ts`**: To understand the core logic for L1 staking, L1 bridging, and L2 interactions.\r\n4. **`packages/plugin-polygon/src/services/GasService.ts`**: To review the L2 gas oracle integration.\r\n5. **Key staking files:**\r\n   - `packages/plugin-polygon/src/abi/`: To verify the StakeManager and ValidatorShare ABIs are properly included\r\n   - `packages/plugin-polygon/src/actions/delegate.ts`: For L1 staking operations\r\n   - `packages/plugin-polygon/src/actions/getValidatorInfo.ts` and `getDelegatorInfo.ts`: For staking read operations\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone: Automated tests are acceptable.\r\n-->\r\nManual testing is recommended for this initial integration, focusing on the implemented P1 functionalities. Automated tests for configuration loading were considered in the ticket but not explicitly verified as present in this review.\r\n\r\n**Setup:**\r\n1.  Navigate to the `packages/plugin-polygon` directory.\r\n2.  Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`.\r\n3.  Populate the `.env` file with valid:\r\n    *   `POLYGON_RPC_URL` (Polygon PoS RPC endpoint)\r\n    *   `ETHEREUM_RPC_URL` (Ethereum Mainnet RPC endpoint for L1)\r\n    *   `PRIVATE_KEY` (for a wallet with funds on both L1 and L2 for testing)\r\n    *   `POLYGONSCAN_KEY` (API key for PolygonScan)\r\n    *   `HEIMDALL_RPC_URL` (placeholder, as Heimdall features are not yet implemented)\r\n",

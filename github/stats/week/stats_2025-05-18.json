If PolygonScan has an outage or changes its API contract in an unexpected way, the service will use the RPC fallback. The fallback itself depends on the configured Polygon RPC node.\r\n*   **RPC Node Dependency (Fallback):** The fallback mechanism relies on the availability and correctness of the configured Polygon RPC node.\r\n*   **ABI Placeholders:** `PolygonRpcService.ts` currently uses placeholder ABIs (`\"[]\"`) for staking and bridge-related contracts. One line (`await this.stakeManagerContractL1.currentEpoch();`) that would test a contract call during initialization was commented out to prevent errors due to these empty ABIs, this have been fixed in the commit but needs to be commented out to reproduce test results at the moment. This does not affect the `GasService` functionality directly, but it's a known state of a related service.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a robust gas price estimation service for the Polygon (PoS) network within the `plugin-polygon`. The service, `GasService.ts`, fetches gas price recommendations (Safe, Average, Fast priority fees, and Base Fee) primarily from the PolygonScan Gas Oracle API. If the API is unavailable, the API key is missing, or the response is problematic, it gracefully falls back to using the standard `eth_gasPrice` method (via `provider.getFeeData()`) from the configured L2 Polygon RPC node.\r\n\r\nThe service ensures consistent data types (bigint for Wei values) and handles various response formats from PolygonScan, including prioritizing `BaseFee` (in MATIC/ETH) over `suggestBaseFee` (in Gwei) if both are present or one is invalid.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n**Features** (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nA good starting point would be `packages/plugin-polygon/src/services/GasService.ts` to understand the core logic, followed by `packages/plugin-polygon/src/services/__tests__/GasService.test.ts` to see how it's tested. Also, review the changes in `packages/plugin-polygon/src/services/PolygonRpcService.ts` for the `getL2Provider()` method and the ABI placeholder modifications.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nAutomated integration tests are provided and cover the main scenarios:\r\n\r\n1.  **Successful PolygonScan API fetch and parse:**\r\n    *   Ensures EIP-1559 style fees are fetched and parsed correctly.\r\n    *   Verifies `fallbackGasPrice` is null.\r\n    *   Checks that `estimatedBaseFee` and at least one priority fee tier are valid positive bigints.\r\n2.  **Fallback to RPC `eth_gasPrice` when PolygonScan API key is missing:**\r\n    *   Simulates a missing API key.\r\n    *   Verifies that EIP-1559 fee fields are null.\r\n    *   Ensures `fallbackGasPrice` is a valid positive bigint.\r\n\r\n**To run the tests:**\r\n1. Ensure a root `.env` file is configured with valid `POLYGONSCAN_KEY`, `POLYGON_RPC_URL`, `ETHEREUM_RPC_URL`, and `PRIVATE_KEY`.\r\n2. Navigate to the `packages/plugin-polygon` directory.\r\n3. Run `bun run build` to build the package.\r\n4. Run `npx vitest run --globals src/services/__tests__/GasService.test.ts` to execute the integration tests.\r\n\r\nThe tests include `console.log` output for the fetched estimates in both scenarios, allowing for manual inspection of the live data returned.\r\n",

(The plugin includes its own `README.md` which serves as initial documentation for its features and setup).\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n### Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. **`packages/plugin-polygon/README.md`**: For an overview of the plugin's intended features and setup.\r\n2. **`packages/plugin-polygon/src/index.ts`**: For the main plugin definition, configuration handling, and registration of components.\r\n3. **`packages/plugin-polygon/src/services/PolygonRpcService.ts`**: To understand the core logic for L1 staking, L1 bridging, and L2 interactions.\r\n4. **`packages/plugin-polygon/src/services/GasService.ts`**: To review the L2 gas oracle integration.\r\n5. **Key staking files:**\r\n   - `packages/plugin-polygon/src/abi/`: To verify the StakeManager and ValidatorShare ABIs are properly included\r\n   - `packages/plugin-polygon/src/actions/delegate.ts`: For L1 staking operations\r\n   - `packages/plugin-polygon/src/actions/getValidatorInfo.ts` and `getDelegatorInfo.ts`: For staking read operations\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone: Automated tests are acceptable.\r\n-->\r\nManual testing is recommended for this initial integration, focusing on the implemented P1 functionalities. Automated tests for configuration loading were considered in the ticket but not explicitly verified as present in this review.\r\n\r\n**Setup:**\r\n1.  Navigate to the `packages/plugin-polygon` directory.\r\n2.  Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`.\r\n3.  Populate the `.env` file with valid:\r\n    *   `POLYGON_RPC_URL` (Polygon PoS RPC endpoint)\r\n    *   `ETHEREUM_RPC_URL` (Ethereum Mainnet RPC endpoint for L1)\r\n    *   `PRIVATE_KEY` (for a wallet with funds on both L1 and L2 for testing)\r\n    *   `POLYGONSCAN_KEY` (API key for PolygonScan)\r\n    *   `HEIMDALL_RPC_URL` (placeholder, as Heimdall features are not yet implemented)\r\n",

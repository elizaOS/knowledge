      "body": "**Describe the bug**\n\nThe elizaos test command incorrectly assumes that E2E tests must be run from within the ElizaOS monorepo structure, even when running tests for standalone projects created with `elizaos create`. This prevents running E2E tests in standalone projects that are meant to extend ElizaOS functionality.\n\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Create a new ElizaOS project\n```elizaos create my-project```\n\n2. Run the e2e tests:\n\n```npm run test:e2e```\n\n3. Error: Could not find monorepo root. Make sure to run tests from within the Eliza project.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nThe elizaos test command should:\n1. Recognize standalone projects created with elizaos create\n2. Run E2E tests in the project's e2e/ directory\n3. Not require the full ElizaOS monorepo structure\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nN/A\n\n**Additional context**\n\n- Error is reliably reproducible with any \"out-of-the-box\" project created with @elizaos/cli\n\n",

      "author": "wtfsayo",
      "number": 5629,
      "body": "## 🔧 Enhanced Module Resolution for Consistent Local-First Loading\n\nThis PR addresses critical module resolution issues by enhancing the existing ModuleLoader system to provide the same local-first guarantees as server-manager.ts, ensuring consistent module loading across all CLI operations.\n\n### 🎯 Problem Statement\n\nThe CLI was experiencing inconsistent module resolution between different components:\n- **server-start.ts** was using ModuleLoader but without explicit local-first guarantees\n- **server-manager.ts** had proper local-first environment setup for spawned processes\n- **Inconsistent behavior** between development and production environments\n- **Potential singleton pattern issues** due to mixed global/local module loading\n\n### 🚀 Key Changes\n\n#### 1. **Enhanced ModuleLoader System** (`packages/cli/src/utils/module-loader.ts`)\n- **NEW: Environment Setup**: Added `setupEnvironment()` method that mirrors server-manager.ts logic\n- **NEW: Explicit Local Detection**: Checks if local module exists before resolution\n- **NEW: Enhanced Logging**: Clear feedback about which installation is being used\n- **IMPROVED: Validation**: Warns if expected local module resolves to global\n\n#### 2. **Consistent Architecture**\n- **ModuleLoader** → For in-process module loading with local-first guarantees\n- **server-manager.ts** → For spawned process environment setup with local-first guarantees\n- **Both systems** → Use same approach: check local existence, prioritize local, set environment variables\n\n#### 3. **Environment Variable Management**\nEnhanced ModuleLoader now sets up environment like server-manager.ts:\n- `NODE_PATH = \"{project}/node_modules:{existing_NODE_PATH}\"`\n- `PATH = \"{project}/node_modules/.bin:{existing_PATH}\"`\n\n### 🧪 Testing and Validation\n\n- ✅ **Build System**: All builds pass with enhanced ModuleLoader\n- ✅ **Local Module Detection**: Correctly identifies and uses local @elizaos packages\n- ✅ **Environment Setup**: Properly configures NODE_PATH and PATH variables\n- ✅ **Logging**: Clear feedback about local vs global module usage\n- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: All existing APIs maintained\n\n### 📈 Impact and Benefits\n\n#### **Development Experience**\n- **Consistent Behavior**: Same module resolution logic across all CLI operations\n- **Local-First Approach**: Always prioritizes project's exact dependency versions\n- **Clear Feedback**: Explicit logging about which installation is being used\n- **Better Debugging**: Enhanced error messages with installation guidance\n\n#### **Architecture Improvements**\n- **Unified Strategy**: Both in-process and spawned processes use same local-first approach\n- **Singleton Safety**: Prevents multiple instances of core modules\n- **Environment Consistency**: Standardized module resolution across all operations\n- **Maintainability**: Centralized local-first logic in ModuleLoader\n\n### 🔍 Implementation Details\n\n#### **Enhanced Module Loading Strategy**\nModuleLoader now includes explicit local-first checks:\n```typescript\nconst localModulePath = path.join(this.projectPath, 'node_modules', moduleName);\nconst isLocalModule = existsSync(localModulePath);\n\nif (isLocalModule) {\n  logger.info(`Using local ${moduleName} installation`);\n} else {\n  logger.info(`Using global ${moduleName} installation`);\n}\n```\n\n#### **Environment Enhancement (NEW)**\nAdded setupEnvironment() method:\n```typescript\nprivate setupEnvironment(): void {\n  // Add local node_modules to NODE_PATH\n  const localModulesPath = path.join(this.projectPath, 'node_modules');\n  if (existsSync(localModulesPath)) {\n    process.env.NODE_PATH = `${localModulesPath}${path.delimiter}${process.env.NODE_PATH || ''}`;\n  }\n\n  // Add local .bin to PATH\n  const localBinPath = path.join(this.projectPath, 'node_modules', '.bin');\n  if (existsSync(localBinPath)) {\n    process.env.PATH = `${localBinPath}${path.delimiter}${process.env.PATH || ''}`;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 🛠 Technical Notes\n\n- **Enhanced, Not Replaced**: ModuleLoader was enhanced rather than replaced\n- **Consistent Approach**: Both ModuleLoader and server-manager.ts use same local-first logic\n- **Environment Variables**: Proper PATH and NODE_PATH setup for consistent resolution\n- **Explicit Validation**: Checks that local modules are actually being used when expected\n- **Comprehensive Logging**: Clear feedback about module resolution decisions\n\n### 📦 Files Changed\n\n- `packages/cli/src/utils/module-loader.ts` - Enhanced with local-first guarantees\n- `packages/cli/src/commands/start/actions/server-start.ts` - Uses enhanced ModuleLoader\n\nThis enhancement ensures that **all** @elizaos modules are resolved locally first, whether they're being loaded in the current process (ModuleLoader) or in spawned processes (server-manager.ts), providing a consistent and reliable development experience.",

Changes are additive and backward-compatible:\r\n- New streaming API is opt-in via `stream: true` parameter\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nAdds streaming support for `TEXT_SMALL` and `TEXT_LARGE` model types, allowing plugins to return text incrementally as it's generated. Also fixes several issues in the CLI test runner.\r\n\r\n**Core changes:**\r\n- Add `TextStreamResult` interface with `textStream` async iterable\r\n- Add `stream?: boolean` parameter to `GenerateTextParams`\r\n- Add `supportsStreaming()` type guard for model types\r\n- Update `runtime.useModel()` to handle streaming responses\r\n\r\n**CLI test fixes:**\r\n- Fix `startAgents` API signature (array of `{character, plugins}` objects)\r\n- Fix `TestRunner` to exclude `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` from plugin detection\r\n- Fix unit test mock function name (`getDefaultCharacter`)\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- Bug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation:\r\n- Document the new streaming API for plugin developers\r\n- Update model type documentation with streaming support info\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. `packages/core/src/types/model.ts` - New streaming types\r\n2. `packages/core/src/runtime.ts` - Runtime streaming support\r\n3. `packages/cli/src/utils/test-runner.ts` - Bootstrap exclusion fix\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "Hi ElizaOS team,\n\nI’m trying to complete the AI16Z → ElizaOS migration, but I’m running into two major issues and Discord support has become unreliable due to impersonators. I need help from the real development team to determine the correct path.\n\nMy situation:\n\n• I purchased AI16Z tokens on Oct 26 using my Phantom wallet.\n• I then moved them to my Tangem wallet for safety.\n• On Nov 11 (snapshot date), the tokens were held inside my Tangem wallet.\n• The migration portal shows my Phantom wallet as “0 eligible” (expected since Phantom didn’t hold them during snapshot).\n• I cannot connect my Tangem wallet to the migration portal because WalletConnect does not support Tangem.\n• My Tangem wallet was created using key cards only, so I do not have a seed phrase to export into Phantom.\n\nThe Discord server is currently compromised — multiple impersonators posing as support are entering tickets and attempting to direct users to send tokens manually. Because of this, I cannot rely on Discord support or email responses that appear to be spoofed.\n\nWhat I need from the real team:\n\nConfirmation of whether Tangem-held tokens during the snapshot are eligible for migration.\nWhether a manual backend whitelist update is possible so my Phantom wallet can perform migration safely.\nIf not, what the official and safe method is for users whose eligible snapshot wallet cannot connect to the portal (Tangem case).\nAny announcements regarding potential whitelist updates or support for non-exportable wallets.\nI have NOT sent my tokens anywhere and I have NOT interacted with any unofficial links. My tokens are safe. I’m only seeking official guidance from the verifiable team here on GitHub.\n\nThank you — I appreciate your time. I prefer to resolve this safely through GitHub to avoid Discord impersonation issues.\n\nActivity\n",

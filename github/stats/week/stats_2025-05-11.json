It does **not** address:\n\n1. Custom builds that rely on custom plugins  \n2. The **Lite** edition of ElizaOS  \n3. The high amount of resources for building the image locally\n\nAs a result, new users that want to build on top of eliza setups have to cobble together their own instructions, and everyone pays the penalty of long, heavy Docker builds.\n\n#### Proposal\n* **Docs:** Expand the guide to cover custom plugin workflows *and* the Lite edition.  \n* **Docker:** Ship a lean Dockerfile that uses the new `elizaos/cli` (see <https://eliza.how/docs>).  Based on bun package manager, allowing users to exectute the command `elizaos create --type project` and get a dockerfile that create a soft image.\n  \n",

      "body": "# Relates to\r\n\r\nIssue: https://github.com/Sifchain/sa-eliza/issues/450\r\n\r\nThis PR relates to the ticket: \"Ticket: Initialize Eliza Plugin Structure and Configuration (Polygon)\" (Part of Epic: Implement Polygon Plugin MVP)\r\n\r\n<!-- This risks section must be filled out before the final review and merge. -->\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n*   **Medium: L1 Gas Estimation Inaccuracy:** The current `GasService` primarily uses L2 (PolygonScan) gas oracles. When used for L1 Ethereum transactions (staking, bridging), this can lead to inaccurate gas estimations, potentially causing transactions to be underpriced (fail) or overpriced.\r\n*   **Medium: Missing Heimdall Governance:** The P1 functionality for Polygon-specific governance (interacting with Heimdall) is not implemented. Current governance actions target EVM-based smart contracts. Users expecting native Polygon governance via Heimdall will not find this functionality.\r\n*   **Low: User-Facing `withdrawRewards` Action Stub:** The LLM-enabled `withdrawRewards` action is a non-functional stub. The core logic exists via the programmatic `WITHDRAW_REWARDS_L1` action and the `PolygonRpcService`.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR initializes the foundational structure and boilerplate for the new `@elizaos/plugin-polygon`. It establishes a functional, correctly configured, and buildable plugin skeleton that adheres to current ElizaOS conventions.\r\n\r\nKey functionalities included:\r\n*   **Plugin Core**: `package.json`, TypeScript configuration, main plugin definition (`src/index.ts`) with lifecycle methods, and registration with ElizaOS.\r\n*   **Configuration**: Handles essential configurations like L1/L2 RPC URLs, private key, and PolygonScan API key, with validation using `zod`. Includes `.env.example`.\r\n*   **L1 Staking (Ethereum)**:\r\n    *   `PolygonRpcService` implements interactions with L1 staking contracts (`StakeManager`, `ValidatorShare`) for delegation, undelegation (partial via `sellVoucher_new` in service), reward withdrawal, and fetching validator/delegator information.\r\n    *   User-facing LLM-enabled actions and direct programmatic actions for these operations.\r\n*   **L1 Native Bridge Deposit (Polygon PoS Bridge)**:\r\n    *   `PolygonRpcService` implements deposits to the L1 `RootChainManager` contract.\r\n    *   Actions for initiating bridge deposits.\r\n*   **L2 Interactions (Polygon PoS)**:\r\n    *   Basic L2 interactions like fetching balances, block numbers via `PolygonRpcService`.\r\n    *   Actions for these operations.\r\n*   **Checkpoint Status**:\r\n    *   `PolygonRpcService` implements checks against the L1 `RootChainManager` to verify L2 block checkpoint status.\r\n    *   Actions for this functionality.\r\n*   **EVM-Based Governance Stubs**:\r\n    *   Actions (`PROPOSE_GOVERNANCE_POLYGON`, `VOTE_GOVERNANCE_POLYGON`) are implemented to interact with EVM-compatible governor smart contracts (e.g., OpenZeppelin Governor) using `viem`.\r\n*   **Providers**: Includes a `PolygonWalletProvider` (using `viem`) for EVM wallet interactions and exposing wallet details.\r\n*   **Services**: `PolygonRpcService` (using `ethers.js`) for core L1/L2 EVM logic and `GasService` for L2 gas price fetching (PolygonScan).\r\n*   **Documentation**: A comprehensive `README.md` for the plugin.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there are no linked issues explaining why. If there is a related issue, it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nThis work establishes the dedicated `@elizaos/plugin-polygon` as outlined in the \"Implement Polygon Plugin MVP\" epic. The goal is to create a focused plugin capable of handling Polygon-specific interactions (L1 staking, native bridge, Heimdall governance) that go beyond the scope of a generic EVM plugin. This PR lays the groundwork for these features, with many EVM-based L1/L2 interactions already functional.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf documentation change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation. (The plugin includes its own `README.md` which serves as initial documentation for its features and setup).\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1.  **`packages/plugin-polygon/README.md`**: For an overview of the plugin's intended features and setup.\r\n2.  **`packages/plugin-polygon/src/index.ts`**: For the main plugin definition, configuration handling, and registration of components.\r\n3.  **`packages/plugin-polygon/src/services/PolygonRpcService.ts`**: To understand the core logic for L1 staking, L1 bridging, and L2 interactions.\r\n4.  **`packages/plugin-polygon/src/services/GasService.ts`**: To review the L2 gas oracle integration.\r\n5.  Key action files like `packages/plugin-polygon/src/actions/delegate.ts` (L1 staking) and `packages/plugin-polygon/src/actions/proposeGovernance.ts` (EVM Governance).\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone: Automated tests are acceptable.\r\n-->\r\nManual testing is recommended for this initial integration, focusing on the implemented P1 functionalities. Automated tests for configuration loading were considered in the ticket but not explicitly verified as present in this review.\r\n\r\n**Setup:**\r\n1.  Navigate to the `packages/plugin-polygon` directory.\r\n2.  Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`.\r\n3.  Populate the `.env` file with valid:\r\n    *   `POLYGON_RPC_URL` (Polygon PoS RPC endpoint)\r\n    *   `ETHEREUM_RPC_URL` (Ethereum Mainnet RPC endpoint for L1)\r\n    *   `PRIVATE_KEY` (for a wallet with funds on both L1 and L2 for testing)\r\n    *   `POLYGONSCAN_KEY` (API key for PolygonScan)\r\n    *   `HEIMDALL_RPC_URL` (placeholder, as Heimdall features are not yet implemented)\r\n",

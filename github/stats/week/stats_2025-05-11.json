The high amount of resources for building the image locally\n\nAs a result, new users that want to build on top of eliza setups have to cobble together their own instructions, and everyone pays the penalty of long, heavy Docker builds.\n\n#### Proposal\n* **Docs:** Expand the guide to cover custom plugin workflows *and* the Lite edition.  \n* **Docker:** Ship a lean Dockerfile that uses the new `elizaos/cli` (see <https://eliza.how/docs>).

When used for L1 Ethereum transactions (staking, bridging), this can lead to inaccurate gas estimations, potentially causing transactions to be underpriced (fail) or overpriced.\r\n*   **Medium: Missing Heimdall Governance:** The P1 functionality for Polygon-specific governance (interacting with Heimdall) is not implemented. Current governance actions target EVM-based smart contracts. Users expecting native Polygon governance via Heimdall will not find this functionality.\r\n*   **Low: User-Facing `withdrawRewards` Action Stub:** The LLM-enabled `withdrawRewards` action is a non-functional stub. The core logic exists via the programmatic `WITHDRAW_REWARDS_L1` action and the `PolygonRpcService`.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR initializes the foundational structure and boilerplate for the new `@elizaos/plugin-polygon`. It establishes a functional, correctly configured, and buildable plugin skeleton that adheres to current ElizaOS conventions.\r\n\r\nKey functionalities included:\r\n*   **Plugin Core**: `package.json`, TypeScript configuration, main plugin definition (`src/index.ts`) with lifecycle methods, and registration with ElizaOS.\r\n*   **Configuration**: Handles essential configurations like L1/L2 RPC URLs, private key, and PolygonScan API key, with validation using `zod`. Includes `.env.example`.\r\n*   **L1 Staking (Ethereum)**:\r\n    *   `PolygonRpcService` implements interactions with L1 staking contracts (`StakeManager`, `ValidatorShare`) for delegation, undelegation (partial via `sellVoucher_new` in service), reward withdrawal, and fetching validator/delegator information.\r\n    *   User-facing LLM-enabled actions and direct programmatic actions for these operations.\r\n*   **L1 Native Bridge Deposit (Polygon PoS Bridge)**:\r\n    *   `PolygonRpcService` implements deposits to the L1 `RootChainManager` contract.\r\n    *   Actions for initiating bridge deposits.\r\n*   **L2 Interactions (Polygon PoS)**:\r\n    *   Basic L2 interactions like fetching balances, block numbers via `PolygonRpcService`.\r\n    *   Actions for these operations.\r\n*   **Checkpoint Status**:\r\n    *   `PolygonRpcService` implements checks against the L1 `RootChainManager` to verify L2 block checkpoint status.\r\n    *   Actions for this functionality.\r\n*   **EVM-Based Governance Stubs**:\r\n    *   Actions (`PROPOSE_GOVERNANCE_POLYGON`, `VOTE_GOVERNANCE_POLYGON`) are implemented to interact with EVM-compatible governor smart contracts (e.g., OpenZeppelin Governor) using `viem`.\r\n*   **Providers**: Includes a `PolygonWalletProvider` (using `viem`) for EVM wallet interactions and exposing wallet details.\r\n*   **Services**: `PolygonRpcService` (using `ethers.js`) for core L1/L2 EVM logic and `GasService` for L2 gas price fetching (PolygonScan).\r\n*   **Documentation**: A comprehensive `README.md` for the plugin.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there are no linked issues explaining why. If there is a related issue, it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nThis work establishes the dedicated `@elizaos/plugin-polygon` as outlined in the \"Implement Polygon Plugin MVP\" epic. The goal is to create a focused plugin capable of handling Polygon-specific interactions (L1 staking, native bridge, Heimdall governance) that go beyond the scope of a generic EVM plugin. This PR lays the groundwork for these features, with many EVM-based L1/L2 interactions already functional.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf documentation change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation. (The plugin includes its own `README.md` which serves as initial documentation for its features and setup).\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1.  **`packages/plugin-polygon/README.md`**: For an overview of the plugin's intended features and setup.\r\n2.  **`packages/plugin-polygon/src/index.ts`**: For the main plugin definition, configuration handling, and registration of components.\r\n3.  **`packages/plugin-polygon/src/services/PolygonRpcService.ts`**: To understand the core logic for L1 staking, L1 bridging, and L2 interactions.\r\n4.  **`packages/plugin-polygon/src/services/GasService.ts`**: To review the L2 gas oracle integration.\r\n5.  Key action files like `packages/plugin-polygon/src/actions/delegate.ts` (L1 staking) and `packages/plugin-polygon/src/actions/proposeGovernance.ts` (EVM Governance).\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone: Automated tests are acceptable.\r\n-->\r\nManual testing is recommended for this initial integration, focusing on the implemented P1 functionalities. Automated tests for configuration loading were considered in the ticket but not explicitly verified as present in this review.\r\n\r\n**Setup:**\r\n1.  Navigate to the `packages/plugin-polygon` directory.\r\n2.  Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`.\r\n3.  Populate the `.env` file with valid:\r\n    *   `POLYGON_RPC_URL` (Polygon PoS RPC endpoint)\r\n    *   `ETHEREUM_RPC_URL` (Ethereum Mainnet RPC endpoint for L1)\r\n    *   `PRIVATE_KEY` (for a wallet with funds on both L1 and L2 for testing)\r\n    *   `POLYGONSCAN_KEY` (API key for PolygonScan)\r\n    *   `HEIMDALL_RPC_URL` (placeholder, as Heimdall features are not yet implemented)\r\n",

      "body": "# Ticket: Implement Core EVM RPC Wrappers & Basic Reads (Polygon Plugin)\r\n\r\n**Ticket Type:** Dev Ticket  \r\n**Priority:** P1  \r\n**Epic:** Implement Polygon Plugin MVP  \r\n**Assignee:** Harsh Modi  \r\n**Reporter:** AI Assistant  \r\n**Dependencies:** plugin-setup ticket (relies on initialized structure and configuration)\r\n\r\n## 1. Summary\r\n\r\nThis ticket has been completed. We successfully established the foundational communication layer with Polygon PoS (L2) and Ethereum (L1) networks via JSON-RPC, leveraging the existing functionalities within the @elizaos/plugin-evm. We identified, adapted, and integrated standard EVM RPC wrappers and client setup logic from the EVM plugin into the Polygon plugin's context, and implemented the initial set of basic Polygon-specific read operations using these adapted wrappers.\r\n\r\n## 2. Detailed Description & Completed Tasks\r\n\r\n### Identified and Reused EVM Logic:\r\n- Thoroughly reviewed the @elizaos/plugin-evm implementation, particularly its RPC client implementation using viem.\r\n- Identified core service, provider, and utility functions responsible for blockchain interactions.\r\n- Leveraged the EVM plugin's approach to chain configuration and client initialization.\r\n\r\n### Adapted & Integrated RPC Client Setup:\r\n- Integrated RPC client setup logic into the PolygonRpcProvider class.\r\n- Successfully implemented dual provider management:\r\n  - L1Provider for Ethereum Mainnet (using ETHEREUM_RPC_URL)\r\n  - L2Provider for Polygon PoS network (using POLYGON_RPC_URL)\r\n- Created clear provider selection logic based on network type (L1/L2).\r\n\r\n### Adapted & Integrated RPC Method Wrappers:\r\n- Integrated wrapper functions for standard EVM JSON-RPC methods.\r\n- Refactored these functions to handle dual L1/L2 providers with proper typing.\r\n- Preserved and enhanced error handling with TypeScript type assertions.\r\n- Added caching mechanisms to reduce redundant RPC calls.\r\n\r\n### Implemented Basic Read Functions:\r\n- Successfully implemented all required read functionalities:\r\n  - `getCurrentBlockNumber()`: Returns latest block number from Polygon.\r\n  - `getBlockDetails(identifier)`: Returns detailed block information.\r\n  - `getTransactionDetails(txHash)`: Returns transaction details and receipt.\r\n  - `getNativeBalance(address)`: Returns MATIC balance for an address.\r\n  - `getErc20Balance(tokenAddress, accountAddress)`: Returns token balance.\r\n- Added additional utility functions:\r\n  - `getErc20Metadata(tokenAddress)`: Returns token symbol and decimals.\r\n  - `estimateGas(tx)`: Estimates gas for transactions.\r\n  - `getGasPrice()`: Gets current gas price.\r\n\r\n### Type Definitions:\r\n- Added comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and types.\r\n- Used `as const` for contract ABIs to ensure proper typing.\r\n- Fixed deep type instantiation issues with appropriate type assertions.\r\n\r\n### Testing:\r\n- Created standalone test files that don't depend on @elizaos/core.\r\n- Implemented comprehensive tests for all key functionalities.\r\n- Added proper error handling for expected test failures.\r\n\r\n## 3. Acceptance Criteria (All Met)\r\n\r\n✅ Core RPC client setup logic successfully integrated and adapted to manage distinct L1 (Ethereum) and L2 (Polygon PoS) providers.\r\n\r\n✅ Standard EVM JSON-RPC wrapper functions successfully integrated and functional within the Polygon plugin.\r\n\r\n✅ Functions `getCurrentBlockNumber`, `getBlockDetails`, `getTransactionDetails`, `getNativeBalance`, `getErc20Balance` implemented and functional.\r\n\r\n✅ `getErc20Balance` successfully retrieves the balance for known ERC20 tokens on Polygon (tested with USDC).\r\n\r\n✅ Error handling for RPC communication and invalid inputs is functional.\r\n\r\n✅ Code includes relevant type definitions and adheres to project linting/formatting standards.\r\n\r\n✅ Tests verify the functionality of the core read operations using the adapted wrappers and dual-provider setup.\r\n\r\n## 4. Implementation Details\r\n\r\n### Key Components:\r\n\r\n1. **PolygonRpcProvider**: Core provider class that manages connections to both L1 and L2 networks.\r\n   - Initializes public and wallet clients for both networks.\r\n   - Provides methods for network-specific operations.\r\n   - Implements caching for frequently accessed data.\r\n\r\n2. **PolygonRpcService**: Service layer that exposes provider functionality to the plugin.\r\n   - Extends the Service class from @elizaos/core.\r\n   - Manages provider lifecycle.\r\n   - Provides simplified interfaces for blockchain operations.\r\n\r\n3. **Configuration**: Updated to use configurable RPC URLs.\r\n   - Default URLs set to Infura endpoints.\r\n   - Allows overriding via environment variables or runtime settings.\r\n\r\n### Technical Improvements:\r\n\r\n1. **TypeScript Fixes**:\r\n   - Added `as const` to ERC20 ABI and other contract ABIs.\r\n   - Used type assertions to resolve deep instantiation errors.\r\n   - Fixed sendTransaction method parameter handling.\r\n\r\n2. **Performance Optimizations**:\r\n   - Implemented multi-level caching with configurable expiry times.\r\n   - Reduced redundant RPC calls for frequently accessed data.\r\n\r\n3. **Error Handling**:\r\n   - Enhanced error messages for better debugging.\r\n   - Added proper error type assertions.\r\n   - Implemented graceful fallbacks for common error scenarios.\r\n\r\n## 5. Testing Results\r\n\r\nAll tests pass successfully, verifying:\r\n- RPC connectivity to both Ethereum and Polygon networks\r\n- Block number and details retrieval\r\n- Transaction details retrieval\r\n- Native token balance checking\r\n- ERC20 token interactions (balance and metadata)\r\n- Gas price estimation\r\n\r\n## 6. Next Steps\r\n\r\nThis implementation provides a solid foundation for subsequent features:\r\n- Staking operations on Polygon\r\n- Bridge operations between L1 and L2\r\n- Governance interactions\r\n- Advanced token operations\r\n",

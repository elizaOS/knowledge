The script helps developers understand why local CLI delegation might not be working and provides automatic fixes for common problems.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Checks environment variables, local CLI installation, project structure, and process arguments\n- **Auto-fix Mode**: Can automatically install missing dependencies and suggest fixes\n- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides color-coded output showing exactly what would cause delegation to fail\n- **Help Documentation**: Built-in help system explaining usage and common issues\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n# Run debug analysis\nbun scripts/debug-cli-delegation.js\n\n# Attempt to fix common issues\nbun scripts/debug-cli-delegation.js --fix\n\n# Show help\nbun scripts/debug-cli-delegation.js --help\n```\n\n## Key Checks\n\n- Local @elizaos/cli installation presence and validity\n- Environment variables that would skip delegation (test mode, CI, etc.)\n- Process arguments that affect delegation\n- Project structure and package.json configuration\n- Whether currently running from local CLI\n\n## Benefits\n\n- Reduces debugging time for CLI delegation issues\n- Provides clear guidance on fixing common problems\n- Helps maintain consistent development experience\n- Supports both manual analysis and automated fixes\n\n## Testing\n\nThe script has been tested with various scenarios:\n- Missing local CLI installation\n- Test/CI environments\n- Different process arguments\n- Various project configurations\n\nFixes #[issue-number] (if applicable)",

The changes improve test reliability and portability without affecting core application logic.\n\n# Background\n\n## What does this PR do?\n\nThis PR addresses two critical issues in the `scripts/debug-cli-delegation.test.ts` file:\n\n1.  **Refactors `scripts/debug-cli-delegation.ts`**: Exports key functions from the debug script, making them directly testable.\n2.  **Updates `scripts/debug-cli-delegation.test.ts`**:\n    *   Modifies tests to directly import and call the exported functions, eliminating the need to spawn subprocesses.\n    *   Replaces the hardcoded GitHub Actions CI path (`/home/runner/work/eliza/eliza`) with dynamic `process.cwd()` or a passed `cwd` parameter, improving local development compatibility.\n    *   Adds mocking for the `@elizaos/core` logger to ensure isolated testing.\n\n## What kind of change is this?\n\nBug fixes, Improvements\n\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\n\nThe previous test setup for the debug script suffered from:\n1.  **Ineffective Mocks**: Mocks for filesystem operations were not inherited by spawned subprocesses, leading to inconsistent test results.\n2.  **Hardcoded CI Path**: The `cwd` for subprocesses was hardcoded, causing tests to fail outside of the specific CI environment.\n\nThis refactoring resolves these issues by enabling direct function testing and ensuring environment portability.\n\n# Documentation changes needed?\n\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\n\n# Testing\n\n## Where should a reviewer start?\n\n`scripts/debug-cli-delegation.test.ts` and `scripts/debug-cli-delegation.ts`.\n\n## Detailed testing steps\n\n1.  Run the updated test file: `bun test scripts/debug-cli-delegation.test.ts`\n2.  Verify all tests pass.\n3.  Confirm the debug script still runs correctly as a standalone executable: `bun scripts/debug-cli-delegation.ts` (and with `--fix`, `--help` flags).\n\n---\n<a href=\"https://cursor.com/background-agent?bcId=bc-6d9e8ed1-1066-45fe-846d-aa9bdf5e62a2\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-cursor-dark.svg\">\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-cursor-light.svg\">\n    <img alt=\"Open in Cursor\" src=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-cursor.svg\">\n  </picture>\n</a>\n<a href=\"https://cursor.com/agents?id=bc-6d9e8ed1-1066-45fe-846d-aa9bdf5e62a2\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-web-dark.svg\">\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-web-light.svg\">\n    <img alt=\"Open in Web\" src=\"https://cursor.com/open-in-web.svg\">\n  </picture>\n</a>\n\n<sub>[Learn more](https://docs.cursor.com/background-agent/web-and-mobile) about Cursor Agents</sub>",

Settings only apply as defaults and can still be overridden per call.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for configuring model parameters (temperature, maxTokens, frequencyPenalty, presencePenalty) at the character level.

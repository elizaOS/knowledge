  "content": "elpulpo0: Merged two PRs this month, including a bug fix for a README link in the plugin-multiversx package (#2985, +573/-1 lines) and a feature addition for Access Token Management to the MultiversX Plugin (#2810, +94/-23 lines). Has one open PR (#2808) related to Access Token Management that appears to be a precursor to the merged work. Activity was sporadic, contributing on just 2 days this month, with changes primarily focused on configuration files, code, and documentation."

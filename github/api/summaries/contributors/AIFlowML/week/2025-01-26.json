  "content": "AIFlowML: Conducted a massive code cleanup effort, merging 98 PRs that primarily fixed linting issues across numerous plugins, with significant changes to code structure (+1.46M/-157K lines). The work shows a methodical approach to standardizing code quality, with most PRs following similar patterns of fixing specific plugins (like #3106 \"fix: plugin-apro\", #3104 \"fix: plugin-aptos\", etc.). Consistently active throughout the week, AIFlowML also provided a few code reviews and comments while maintaining focus on the systematic improvement of the plugin ecosystem."

While volume is high, it is distributed across many peripheral plugins rather than concentrated in a single core module.\n- **Work Structure:** 0% Issue Linkage (LOW). Work is submitted without referencing tracked issues, indicating an informal or external task management workflow.\n- **Review Dependencies:** Primary review dependency on @wtfsayo (43 reviews) and @odilitime (42 reviews), creating a specific approval bottleneck."

  "content": "denizekiz: Made a small but important dependency update in PR #753, updating the agent-client to version 0.0.16 with minimal code changes (+1/-1 lines). Identified and reported two issues (#679 regarding empty recentPosts and #794 about search.ts not working), both of which were subsequently closed. Contributed on a single day this month, focusing exclusively on configuration updates."

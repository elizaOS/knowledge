  "content": "fibonacci998: Opened one PR (#1129) focused on adding a GitHub client to the core agent, with corresponding issue #1130 which was subsequently closed. Made modest code changes across 6 files (+45/-15 lines) with an even split between feature work and bug fixes. Activity was limited to a single day this month, with changes primarily affecting code files (67%) and configuration files (33%)."

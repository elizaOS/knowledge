  "content": "okmoontx: Opened one PR (#2102) to add a StakeWise plugin, with significant code changes across 2,354 files (+185,816/-55,365 lines). Activity was sporadic, occurring on only 4 days this month, with contributions primarily focused on configuration files (47%) and code (29%). The substantial line count changes suggest a major feature addition or codebase restructuring effort, though no PRs were merged during this period."

Work scope broadened to include the `elizaos/spartan` repository for client-side extensions.\n- **Current:** Recent activity (November 2025) concentrates on trading automation (Jupiter, Auto Trader) and social platform clients (Reddit, Truth Social).\n\n## Organizational Signals\n- **Repo Ownership:** **HIGH**. Holds 50% of merged PRs in `elizaos/spartan` (4/8 PRs), indicating a primary maintainer role for that specific repository.\n- **Work Structure:** **MEDIUM**. 0% of merged PRs link to tracked issues, suggesting an informal or rapid-development workflow independent of the issue tracker.\n- **Review Dependencies:** **HIGH**. 64% of reviews come from @wtfsayo, creating a specific approval bottleneck."

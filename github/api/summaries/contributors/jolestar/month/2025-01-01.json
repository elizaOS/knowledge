  "content": "jolestar: Opened one PR (#2377) focused on enabling non-ASCII characters in the knowledge system, which remains open with modest code changes (+11/-6 lines) across 4 files. Created and closed issue #2376 related to \"RAG/Knowledge for No ascii characters,\" showing a direct connection between issue identification and implementation work. Activity was limited to a single day this month, with contributions split between code and test files."

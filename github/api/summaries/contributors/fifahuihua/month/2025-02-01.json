  "content": "fifahuihua: Proposed renaming the plugin-apro to plugin-ATTPs through two open PRs (#3351, #3299) with substantial code changes (+1796/-45 lines across 43 files). Created two issues (#2793, #3298) related to adding and renaming the plugin, both of which are now closed. Activity was limited to just 2 days this month, with changes primarily focused on code (41%), tests (29%), and configuration files (24%)."

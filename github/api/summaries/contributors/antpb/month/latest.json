  "content": "antpb: Fixed compatibility issues for non-Node.js environments with three merged PRs (#508, #709, #703), addressing worker compatibility by switching from tiktoken to js-tiktoken (+401/-101 lines) and properly handling fastembed imports. Created two related issues (#506, #507) that were subsequently closed after the fixes were implemented. Contributed significant code changes (+459/-122 lines across 9 files) during sporadic activity over just 2 days this month, with a primary focus on bugfixes and environment compatibility improvements."

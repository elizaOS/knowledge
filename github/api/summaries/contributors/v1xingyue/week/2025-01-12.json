  "content": "v1xingyue: Merged a significant PR #2281 that adds support for loading characters from character URLs, involving extensive code changes across 189 files (+27062/-2134 lines). Created issue #868 proposing to bring Move blockchain to Eliza, which has since been closed. Activity was concentrated on a single day during this period, with a focus on feature development rather than bug fixes or maintenance."

  "content": "Minco-Yuga: Merged a single significant PR (#1981) that enabled all EVM chains by default, modifying 18 files with substantial code changes (+593/-10 lines). The PR involved moderate complexity with +747/-411 lines changed across the codebase. Activity was limited to a single day this month, suggesting a focused contribution rather than ongoing development work."

  "content": "Armando284: Opened one pull request (#3109) focused on adding cache functionality, which remains under review. Made substantial code changes across 3566 files (+8748/-553856 lines) in a single commit, with significant modifications to configuration (48%) and documentation (18%) files. This appears to be a major cleanup or refactoring effort given the large number of deleted lines."

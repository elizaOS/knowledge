  "content": "cpereiramt: Initiated work on a Notion plugin with an open PR #3548 \"Feat: Initial configuration of notion plugin\" that modified 10 files (+360/-1 lines). Created and closed issue #3547 \"Plugin for notion.so\" which led to the implementation work. Activity was limited to a single day this month, with contributions split evenly between feature development and bug fixing, primarily touching code and configuration files."

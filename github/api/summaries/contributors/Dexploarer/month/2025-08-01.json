  "content": "Dexploarer: Focused on introducing a major new AI Gateway feature to the ElizaOS ecosystem this month. This significant initiative is captured across four open pull requests, highlighted by the core implementation in `elizaos/eliza#5806` which adds universal access to over 100 AI models. The supporting work, which includes adding the plugin to the registry (`elizaos-plugins/registry#203`, `#204`), involved substantial changes across 49 files (+5464/-451 lines). Dexploarer's efforts were concentrated entirely on new feature development, modifying both application code and configuration files."

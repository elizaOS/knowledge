  "content": "hexcow: Fixed two small but important async-related bugs in the tweet scraping functionality through PRs #3960 and #3796, each changing just a single line of code. Both fixes addressed missing await statements in the getTweets method, showing attention to detail in asynchronous code handling. Activity was limited to just 2 days this month, with both PRs being merged within about 4 hours of submission."

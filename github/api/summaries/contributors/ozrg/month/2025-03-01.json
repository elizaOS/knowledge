  "content": "ozrg: Made a single bugfix contribution this month with PR #3987, which fixed a missing comma between regex expressions (+1/-1 lines). The PR data shows an unusual discrepancy between the reported overall line changes (+51954/-24047) and the actual code changes (+1/-1), suggesting this might have been a small but important fix in a large file or repository."

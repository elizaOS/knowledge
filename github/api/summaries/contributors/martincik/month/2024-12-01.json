  "content": "martincik: Made a single focused contribution this month by merging PR #843 which fixed an issue with the NPM package by including the postinstall script (+7/-0 lines). The PR was relatively small but important for package functionality, modifying only configuration files. This represents martincik's only activity during the period, showing a targeted contribution to improve the project's distribution setup."

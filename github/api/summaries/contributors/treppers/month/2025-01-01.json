  "content": "treppers: Merged one significant PR (#2095) that fixed plugin loading from character.json files, involving substantial code changes (+104,047/-50,957 lines). Also opened PR #2097 to add model_id to Together for image generation. Activity was sporadic, with contributions on only one day this month, focusing equally on feature development and bug fixes across code and configuration files."

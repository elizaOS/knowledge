  "content": "yuucyf: Engaged with the project through issue discussions, creating two questions about technical aspects (#1887 regarding the plugin system and #1939 about action's validate function), both of which were subsequently closed. Contributed to ongoing conversations by adding 10 comments across various issues. No code contributions or pull requests during this period, with activity concentrated on a few days rather than sustained engagement throughout the month."

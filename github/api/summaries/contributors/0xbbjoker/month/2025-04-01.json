  "content": "0xbbjoker: Led a significant cleanup effort by removing multiple plugins from the monorepo (PRs #4386, #4398, #4399, #4400, #4402, #4406) which accounted for over 26,000 lines removed. Enhanced Telegram functionality with substantial additions (PR #4128: +3604/-902 lines) and fixed several critical issues including an Anthropic JSON parsing bug (PR #4222) and database transaction deadlock (PR #4142). Contributed consistently across 13 days this month, merging 21 PRs with a mix of feature enhancements, bug fixes, and codebase maintenance while also providing reviews and comments on other PRs."

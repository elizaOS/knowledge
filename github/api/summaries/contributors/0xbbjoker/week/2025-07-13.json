  "content": "0xbbjoker: Focused on enhancing the plugin ecosystem in `elizaos/eliza`, delivering a significant new feature with the addition of a backend-only plugin quick-starter template (#5589) that added over 1200 lines of code. They also improved an existing integration by making the Ollama plugin conditional (#5594) and began a refactor to migrate prompts to a new format (#5623). Their efforts were primarily concentrated on bug fixes and refactoring, with a secondary focus on feature work."

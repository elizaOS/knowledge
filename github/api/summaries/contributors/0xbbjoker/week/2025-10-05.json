  "content": "0xbbjoker: Drove a significant architectural refactor across the Eliza ecosystem, merging 11 PRs focused on modernizing core components and plugins. They led this effort by introducing a new `MessageService` interface in a massive PR (#6048, +18k/-11k lines) and migrating the system to UUID-only agent identification (#6036). This work, primarily focused on bug fixes and feature implementation, also involved updating multiple plugins like Discord, Telegram, and Twitter to a new message handling runtime."

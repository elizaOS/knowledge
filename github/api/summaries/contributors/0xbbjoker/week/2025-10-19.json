  "content": "0xbbjoker: This week, 0xbbjoker enhanced functionality and stability across the Eliza ecosystem by merging three pull requests. They resolved a significant crash in the Telegram plugin (elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram#19) and introduced new features for flexible deployment modes (elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#44) and an optional embedding service (elizaos/eliza#6075). Their work showed a strong emphasis on quality, with half of all file modifications dedicated to tests, supporting a mix of bug fixes and new feature development."

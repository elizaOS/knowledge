  "content": "0xbbjoker: Focused on expanding plugin capabilities this week, merging three PRs that delivered new features and a bug fix. They notably added text embedding model support in a significant PR for the OpenRouter plugin (plugin-openrouter#17) and implemented a static provider for listing documents in the knowledge plugin (plugin-knowledge#45). Their work, which also included two peer review approvals, was primarily centered on bug fixes and feature development, with a secondary focus on documentation."

  "content": "0xbbjoker: Led a major cleanup effort by removing multiple plugins from the monorepo through 12 PRs (#4386, #4398, #4399, #4400, #4402, #4406, #4427, #4428, #4434, #4436, #4437, #4439) that collectively removed over 45,000 lines of code. Fixed several issues including an import problem for derive key provider (#4385) and migration copying (#4401), while also contributing a blog post for Twitter agent setup (#4425) and proposing new plugins with 4 open PRs (#4378, #4407, #4412, #4413)."

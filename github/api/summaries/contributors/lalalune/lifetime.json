Work appears to be driven by internal roadmap or direct architectural requirements rather than public issue tracking.\n- **Review Dependencies (HIGH):** Primary reviewers include automated systems (@cursor, @github-advanced-security) and @odilitime. The reliance on automated review tools for large refactors is notable."

  "content": "lalalune: Led a major codebase restructuring effort with 6 merged PRs, most notably deleting all plugins (#3342, -344k lines) and refactoring generation to follow a handler pattern (#3376, +2.3k/-6k lines). Also fixed the default character issue (#3345, +530/-3 lines) and worked on removing the verifiable inference concept (#3344), while continuing work on consolidating RAG knowledge in an open PR (#3347)."

  "content": "lalalune: Led a major codebase cleanup by merging PR #2852 \"Replace pnpm with Bun\" which removed over 104k lines while adding 3.8k lines. Created 6 issues related to V2 architecture improvements (all now closed), focusing on knowledge consolidation, embeddings, and dependency removal. Currently working on two draft PRs for model refactoring and agent splitting, continuing the substantial codebase restructuring effort."

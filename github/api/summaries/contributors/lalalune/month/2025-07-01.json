They merged four substantial pull requests, introducing action chaining (#5436) and creating new packages for configs (#5508) and test utilities (#5507), which involved large-scale code changes. Lalalune also has a strong pipeline of new capabilities underway with seven open pull requests for features like vision and planning plugins.

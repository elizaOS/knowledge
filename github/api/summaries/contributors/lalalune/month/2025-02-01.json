  "content": "lalalune: Led a massive codebase restructuring effort with 11 merged PRs, most notably deleting all plugins in PR #3342 (-344k lines) and implementing a dynamic plugin loading system. Focused on architectural changes including refactoring generation (#3376), adding a rolodex feature (#3725), and restructuring room state (#3602), collectively modifying over 9,000 files (+179k/-1M lines). Created 8 issues (all now closed) outlining key architectural changes for V2, including unified messaging and plugin-based architecture, while maintaining a consistent work pattern across 13 days this month."

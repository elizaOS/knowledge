  "content": "lalalune: Made a substantial contribution to the `jeju` repository this month by adding new applications. They merged a single, large-scale pull request, `elizaos/jeju#1`, which introduced over 71k lines of code to accomplish this. In addition to this significant feature work, lalalune also planned future efforts by opening issues for new agents and load testing in the `jeju` repository (`#2`, `#3`, `#4`). Their work consisted of a mix of new feature development, refactoring, and tests."

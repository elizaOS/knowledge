  "content": "lalalune: Led significant codebase restructuring efforts, most notably merging PR #2852 to replace pnpm with Bun (+3818/-105039 lines) and maintaining several draft PRs focused on refactoring models and splitting agent functionality. Created 14 issues outlining architectural changes for a \"V2\" version, including consolidating RAG knowledge (#2918), moving text splitting into core (#2917), and implementing runtime changes for models (#2858). Modified 2647 files with substantial code removal (+51490/-235159 lines) across 23 commits, demonstrating a major cleanup and restructuring initiative. Activity pattern shows focused work on specific days rather than continuous engagement, with contributions primarily centered on architectural improvements and feature work."

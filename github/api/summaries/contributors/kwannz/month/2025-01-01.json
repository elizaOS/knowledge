  "content": "kwannz: Opened two PRs this month: #2130 for photo upload functionality and #2094 for Twitter photo support, with both still in progress. Made substantial code changes across 77 files (+4603/-5750 lines) with a primary focus on documentation (47%) and equal parts code and configuration work (24% each). Activity was sporadic, contributing on only 3 days this month, with most effort directed toward non-feature work (80%)."

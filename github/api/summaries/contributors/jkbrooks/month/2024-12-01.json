Opened one PR (#1051) to revert a previous change and created two now-closed issues (#305 and #764) related to the Eliza ecosystem and trading system refactoring. Made modest code changes (+49/-69 lines) across 6 files, evenly distributed across feature work, bugfixes, tests, and configuration, with half of the modified files being test-related."

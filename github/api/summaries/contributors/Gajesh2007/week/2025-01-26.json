  "content": "Gajesh2007: Opened a significant pull request (#2926) to integrate EigenDA into Eliza, which involved extensive code changes across 2,074 files (+237,613/-13,090 lines). Contributed one code review with comments, focusing primarily on bugfixes (50%) and working with both code and configuration files equally (40% each). Activity was concentrated on a single day this week, with the PR representing a substantial implementation effort based on the large number of files modified."

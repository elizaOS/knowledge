  "content": "defitricks: Made minor but helpful fixes with two PRs this month, including a merged PR (#2370) that fixed a typo in the import statement for the Solana AgentKit plugin (+4/-4 lines) and an open PR (#2374) addressing a typo in the Romanian README. Activity was sporadic, with contributions on just one day focusing entirely on bugfixes across both code and documentation files."

Created three issues (#1270, #1271, #1560) related to image generation providers and agent capabilities, all of which were closed. Currently has an open PR (#1276) to add Livepeer as an image provider, showing a pattern of focused work on image generation functionality despite sporadic activity on only 3 days this month."

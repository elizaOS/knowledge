  "content": "netdragonx: Opened a significant pull request (#2771) to add mail plugin functionality for IMAP and SMTP, making substantial code changes with +303,138/-60,959 lines across 3,499 files. Activity was spread across 10 days of the month, with the majority of work (75%) focused on new feature development rather than bug fixes. The extensive line count changes suggest a major feature addition, with most modifications affecting code files (64%) and configuration files (23%)."

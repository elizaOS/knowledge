  "content": "affaan-m: Merged two PRs this week, including a significant update to the web search plugin export (#1688) that added over 10,700 lines while removing 1,700+ lines, and a smaller bootstrap plugin export update (#1836) with roughly balanced additions and deletions. Activity was concentrated on just two days of the week, with contributions exclusively focused on code changes."

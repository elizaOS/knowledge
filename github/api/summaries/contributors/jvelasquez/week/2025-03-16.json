  "content": "jvelasquez: Opened two refactoring PRs (#4019 and #4018) focused on removing submodules, with PR #4019 specifically targeting \"unneeded submodules and workflow\" and PR #4018 removing the \"characters submodule.\" The refactoring work involved modest code changes across 18 files (+0/-4 lines), primarily affecting configuration files (78%) and tests (11%), with activity concentrated on a single day this week."

  "content": "Hopium21: Made a single contribution this month with PR #3707, which addressed grammar fixes and added a guard to the createVerifiableLogApiRouter function (+3/-3 lines). The PR was relatively small but took about 55 hours to merge, modifying 3 files across both code and documentation. Activity was limited to a single day this month."

  "content": "wtfsayo: Drove significant platform enhancements in the `elizaos/eliza` repository, merging 29 pull requests focused on core architecture and stability. This work was highlighted by the implementation of standardized service types and interfaces in a major feature PR (#5565, +5811/-1865 lines) and an enhancement to the module loader for local-first guarantees (#5629). These efforts, along with a migration to Bun's native EventTarget API (#5609) and numerous bug fixes, show a primary focus on bug fixes, testing, and refactoring across code, tests, and configuration files."

  "content": "wtfsayo: Drove significant feature development across the Eliza OS ecosystem, merging 12 pull requests this month. Their most impactful contribution was the implementation of a new Jobs API for agent messaging in `elizaos/eliza#6098`, a substantial effort adding over 5,300 lines of code. Additionally, they integrated Streamdown and cross-platform crypto services (`elizaos/eliza#6082`) and added an Eigen TEE wrapper to the CLI (`elizaos/eliza#6065`). Based on their commits, their work was primarily focused on bug fixes and new feature development, with code changes also touching tests and refactoring."

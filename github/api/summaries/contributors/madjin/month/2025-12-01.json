They implemented and fixed a new RSS feed feature (#172, #175) and also managed a substantial dependency update by upgrading the AI SDKs in a large PR (#170) with over 3300 new lines. Their work was a mix of bug fixes, feature implementation, and significant maintenance, touching both code and configuration files."

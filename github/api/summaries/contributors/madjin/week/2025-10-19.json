The most impactful contribution was the implementation of an MVP Badge System for contributor achievements in a substantial PR (#161, +3978/-77 lines), complemented by the addition of adaptive rate limiting (#160) and badge progress indicators (#162). This activity shows a clear concentration on feature work, with changes primarily affecting code files."

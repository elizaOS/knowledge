  "content": "ppsimatikas: Opened one PR (#3572) to add an Xtreamly plugin for Eliza, with significant code changes totaling +13,877/-368,759 lines across 2,564 files. Activity was sporadic, occurring on only 2 days this month, with work split between feature development (60%) and bug fixes (40%). The substantial line removal suggests a major cleanup or refactoring effort, primarily affecting code files (44%), configuration (25%), and tests (19%)."

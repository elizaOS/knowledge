  "content": "ChristopherTrimboli: Made targeted contributions on a single day this month, merging two small PRs: #3876 fixing a missing moment rollup external (+3/-0 lines) and #3875 adding core types (+1/-1 lines). Both PRs were configuration-focused, with an even split between feature work and bug fixing. The changes were minimal but precise, totaling just 5 lines of code changes across 2 files."

  "content": "Jesscha: Identified and addressed an issue with Anthropic's JSON mode object generation by creating issue #3017 and subsequently merging PR #3018 to fix the default mode handling for Anthropic. The PR made significant changes with +998/-905 lines, changing the default mode to \"auto\" rather than attempting to use JSON mode inappropriately. Activity was sporadic this month, focused entirely on this single Anthropic-related improvement."

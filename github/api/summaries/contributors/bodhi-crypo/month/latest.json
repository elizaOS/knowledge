  "content": "bodhi-crypo: Made two small but targeted fixes this month, merging PR #2668 to correct the sentientAI description in the depin plugin and PR #1916 to fix the SUMMARIZE prompt in the Discord client. Both changes were minimal (+1/-1 lines each) but addressed specific issues in documentation and prompts. Activity was sporadic, with contributions on just 3 days of the month."

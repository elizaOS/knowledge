  "content": "standujar: Drove significant architectural improvements across the `elizaos` ecosystem, merging 7 PRs this week. Their most impactful contributions were two major features in `elizaos/eliza`: a large-scale refactor of core config and plugin modules (#6037) and a simplification of the CLI (#6060), which together introduced over 7,400 lines of new code. Alongside this feature work, they also resolved key bugs, including an agent plugin reloading issue (#6040), with their efforts balanced across bug fixes, refactoring, and extensive testing."

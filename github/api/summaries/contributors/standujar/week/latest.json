  "content": "standujar: Focused on enhancing core infrastructure and UI consistency, most notably executing a massive architectural refactor in elizaos/eliza (#6366) to extract domain stores from the SQL plugin, which involved modifying over 200 files. They also improved the documentation site's interface by ensuring markdown renders correctly in profile summary cards (#202) and maintained high code quality through 11 detailed peer reviews. Their work this week primarily centered on large-scale refactoring and critical bugfixes to improve system modularity and data presentation."

  "content": "standujar: This month, standujar made substantial contributions across the `elizaos` ecosystem, focusing on core system stability, refactoring, and introducing new capabilities. They implemented a new Unified API for serverless Node.js environments (elizaos/eliza#6201) and delivered several complex fixes, most notably optimizing the pre-1.6.5 migration and RLS handling in the SQL plugin (elizaos/eliza#6215), which involved over 28k lines of changes. In addition to merging seven pull requests, they have eight open PRs that introduce significant new features like JWT authentication and widespread streaming support. Their work was distributed across bug fixes, feature development, and refactoring, with a strong emphasis on code and test files."

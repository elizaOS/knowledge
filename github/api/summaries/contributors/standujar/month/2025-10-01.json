  "content": "standujar: Drove significant architectural improvements and feature development across the elizaOS ecosystem, merging 28 pull requests. Key contributions include a major refactor of the core config and plugin modules (elizaos/eliza#6037), the implementation of PostgreSQL Row-Level Security for multi-tenancy (elizaos/eliza#6101), and the creation of a unified messaging API (elizaos/eliza#6095). They also addressed critical bugs, such as fixing agent plugin reloading (elizaos/eliza#6040), and improved multiple plugins like `plugin-solana` and `plugin-discord`. This activity shows a primary focus on core feature development, large-scale refactoring, and addressing bugs across the platform."

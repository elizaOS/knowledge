  "content": "Arrowana: Merged a single PR (#1882) titled \"feat: Use recommended settings in jupiter swap\" with modest code changes (+7/-4 lines). The PR data shows a discrepancy between the summary line count (+7/-4) and the detailed line count (+32118/-37030), suggesting this may have involved configuration changes or dependency updates rather than direct code modifications. Activity was limited to a single day this month."

  "content": "shlokkhemani: Merged one substantial PR (#1944) focused on adding embedding tests, contributing +39,603/-39,583 lines across 1,251 modified files. The PR \"chore: add embedding tests\" represents their only activity this month, showing a focused effort on test coverage. Despite the large line count changes, the net addition was relatively small (+201/-0), suggesting this work involved significant test restructuring rather than entirely new code."

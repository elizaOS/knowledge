  "content": "lincheoll: Made significant contributions by merging PR #3435 that fixed how stringKnowledge is stored in knowledge when ragKnowledge is used, involving substantial code changes across 38 files (+5175/-3140 lines). Created three issues (#3300, #3434, #3441) related to build errors, ragKnowledge handling, and long message errors, all of which were subsequently closed. Contributed to discussions by commenting on two issues, showing focused but sporadic activity on bug fixing during the month."

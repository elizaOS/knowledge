  "content": "kyle-veniceai: Merged a single PR (#3428) that removed the \"--no-frozen-lockfile\" flag from the Dockerfile, making a minimal but important change with just +1/-1 lines of code. This maintenance PR had a significant impact on the codebase, removing over 370,000 lines while adding about 22,600 lines, likely due to lockfile regeneration."

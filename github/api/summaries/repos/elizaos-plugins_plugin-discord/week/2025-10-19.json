  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's development focused on both foundational enhancements and rapid response to critical user-facing issues. A significant work-in-progress feature involved migrating core message handling to a new runtime method, aiming to improve the plugin's architecture. Concurrently, the team addressed a critical CLI installation bug that was preventing users from running the tool, culminating in a new version release that successfully resolved the problem.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThis period saw progress on enhancing the plugin's core functionality.\n\n- **Core Message Handling Migration:** Work began on a significant internal improvement by migrating the plugin's message handling logic to use `runtime.handleMessage()`. This ongoing effort, tracked in PR [#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/21), represents a key step in modernizing the plugin's interaction with the core framework.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management was centered on resolving a high-priority bug reported by the community.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** A critical bug was resolved where the ElizaOS CLI failed to locate the `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` module after a global installation ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6088)). The issue was fixed with the release of `v1.6.3`, and the resolution was confirmed by users.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened during this period. The primary active issue ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6088)) was successfully closed, leaving no major active blockers.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration was evident in the rapid triage and resolution of the CLI installation bug. Several users reported encountering the issue, and community members actively discussed workarounds before the official fix was deployed. The feedback loop was completed when users confirmed that the `v1.6.3` release resolved the problem, demonstrating effective communication between the development team and the user community."

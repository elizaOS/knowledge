  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Weekly Report (Jan 18 - 24, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week, development activity for the Discord plugin focused on maintenance and release synchronization within the ElizaOS ecosystem. The primary achievement was the transition to version `1.3.7`, ensuring the plugin remains compatible with the latest core framework updates. While the volume of changes was concentrated on a single day of reporting, the update represents a critical step in maintaining the modularity and stability of the agent framework's Discord integration.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Release Management & Dependency Synchronization\nThe core focus of the week's technical work was preparing the plugin for its latest stable release. This ensures that users and developers are working with the most up-to-date dependencies and framework improvements.\n*   **Version Bump and Core Alignment:** The project successfully transitioned from version `1.3.6` to `1.3.7`. This update specifically targeted the `@elizaos/core` dependency to maintain parity with the broader ElizaOS ecosystem.\n*   **Environment Stability:** As part of the release process, the `bun.lock` file was refreshed to ensure consistent and reproducible builds across different development environments ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and there were no active discussions on existing issues with significant community engagement (3+ comments) during this timeframe. The project appears to be in a stable state following the recent version update.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was centered on maintainer-led release engineering. The activity surrounding PR [#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44) demonstrates a commitment to the project's philosophy of iterative improvement and modularity, ensuring that the Discord plugin remains a reliable component of the decentralized AI framework. The lack of new reported issues suggests a period of stability for the current user base."

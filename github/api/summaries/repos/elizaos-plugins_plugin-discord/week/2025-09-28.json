  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Weekly Report (Sep 28 - 4, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's development focused on enhancing the agent's contextual awareness and interaction logic within Discord. Significant progress was made in improving how the plugin processes complex messages, with new support for embeds and message references. A major refactoring effort was completed to integrate a new `MentionContext` interface, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated character name detection. Additionally, a new feature was proposed to give users more granular control over when the agent responds, continuing the theme of making agent interactions more intelligent and configurable.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on refactoring core logic and expanding message processing capabilities.\n\n### Enhanced Message Processing\nTo improve the richness of information the plugin can handle, support was added for processing embed titles and descriptions, as well as context from referenced (replied-to) messages. This update also included improvements to the `clientReadyPromise` and the `DISCORD_LISTEN_CHANNEL_MESSAGE` event, making message handling more robust ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/17)).\n\n### Core Refactoring for Mention Context\nA significant refactor was implemented to adopt a new `MentionContext` interface from a feature branch in the Eliza core ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/19)). This change, affecting `src/service.ts` and `src/messages.ts`, addresses previous challenges with fuzzy matching for character name detection and standardizes how mention context is handled throughout the plugin.\n\n### New Feature Proposal\nA new pull request was opened to introduce a `shouldRespondToCharacterName` setting ([#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/18)). This feature aims to provide users with finer control over the agent's responsiveness, specifically allowing them to configure whether the agent should reply to messages that mention a character's name.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, and there were no notable updates on existing active issues. The project's issue tracker remained quiet during this period.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity was steady, with a clear focus on foundational improvements. The work on `MentionContext` ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/19)) highlights close collaboration with the core ElizaOS team, as the changes were dependent on a feature branch in the main repository. This indicates strong coordination between the plugin and core framework development efforts. The progression from enhancing message data ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/17)) to refactoring context handling ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/19)) and proposing new interaction controls ([#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/18)) shows a methodical approach to improving the plugin's capabilities."

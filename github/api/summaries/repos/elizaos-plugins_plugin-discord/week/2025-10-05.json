  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts focused on enhancing the stability and maintainability of the Discord plugin. A critical runtime bug that caused initialization failures was resolved, significantly improving the plugin's reliability. Concurrently, repository maintenance was automated with the introduction of Renovate to streamline dependency management. Collaborative debugging on a key issue led to the identification of a bug in a specific version of `@elizaos/core`, providing a clear resolution path for affected users.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on bug fixes and foundational improvements for future development.\n\n- **Critical Bug Fix**\n  A significant bug causing a runtime error during plugin startup was addressed in [#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/22). The error occurred when the `DISCORD_LISTEN_CHANNEL_IDS` environment variable was not set, causing a crash. The fix introduces a null check to ensure the plugin initializes smoothly regardless of this setting.\n\n- **Repository Maintenance & Refactoring**\n  To improve long-term project health, a Renovate configuration was added in [#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/20) to automate dependency updates. Additionally, forward-looking work began with a new Work-In-Progress pull request ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/21)) to migrate the plugin to use the core `runtime.handleMessage()` function.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nNo new issues were opened or closed this week, but a significant active issue saw major progress.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  The primary focus was on the active issue **`Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61` ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6031))**. Extensive discussion and collaborative troubleshooting led to a detailed root cause analysis. It was determined that the problem was not with the Discord plugin itself, but with `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1, which was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files. The recommended solution is for users to upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or a later version.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe discussion around issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6031) highlighted strong community engagement. Users `matteo-brandolino`, `0xbbjoker`, `wtfsayo`, and `claude` collaborated to diagnose the complex import errors. The detailed analysis provided by the community was instrumental in identifying the root cause within the core framework and proposing a clear path to resolution for all users, demonstrating a healthy and technically proficient contributor base."

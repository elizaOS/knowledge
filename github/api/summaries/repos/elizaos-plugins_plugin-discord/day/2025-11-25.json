  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Daily Update (Nov 25, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing the robustness of Discord command registration by implementing a fix that allows the process to continue even if individual command registrations fail. A new issue was also opened regarding the integration of OpenAI-compatible APIs.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Discord Command Registration Reliability\nA fix was implemented to ensure that the Discord slash command registration queue continues processing even if a specific command registration encounters an error. This improves the resilience of the command deployment process by logging failures and proceeding with subsequent registrations. ([#26](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/26))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Request for OpenAI-compatible API Integration\nA new issue was opened requesting the addition of an option to use OpenAI-compatible APIs, allowing users to specify an API host and key, rather than being limited to OpenRouter. ([#6168](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6168))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues had more than 3 comments today."

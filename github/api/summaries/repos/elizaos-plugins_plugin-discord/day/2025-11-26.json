  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Daily Update (Nov 26, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant code refactoring, including the implementation of structured logging across the repository and cleanup of service-related code for improved clarity and maintainability.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Structured Logging Implementation\nThe repository underwent a major refactoring to standardize all logs into a structured format, aligning with the eliza monorepo's logging standards. This included adding ESLint with a specific rule for structured logging and a `lint:check` script for CI. ([#27](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/27))\n\n### Service Code Cleanup and Clarity\nEfforts were made to remove dead or commented code within the Discord service. Clarifying comments were added, particularly around interaction handling and channel ID notes, without introducing any functional changes. ([#28](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/28))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#29](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/29), titled \"Slash command permissions,\" was opened. Its current status and progress are pending review.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

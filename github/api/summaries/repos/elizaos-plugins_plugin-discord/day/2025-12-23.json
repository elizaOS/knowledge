  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Daily Update (Dec 23, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW\nToday's development focused on critical bug fixes for TypeScript type errors and significant refactoring of message handling. Enhancements were also made to the permission system and server/message fallback handling.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### TypeScript Type Error Resolution & Event Handling\nSeveral TypeScript type errors were resolved, particularly concerning typed event handlers. This included adding a `DiscordRegisterCommandsPayload` interface and using generic types for `registerEvent` to improve type safety and consistency across the service. The `useModel` transcription call was also fixed to correctly pass `Buffer` instead of `File`. ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/38))\n\n### Message Handling Refinements\nA substantial refactoring effort was undertaken to update message handling mechanisms. This involved removing an unused development dependency and making numerous changes across various action files to streamline message processing. ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32))\n\n### Permission System and Fallback Handling Enhancements\nThe plugin received an updated permission system and improved server/message fallback handling. This included implementing fast-path emoji extraction, explicit-request detection, and LLM fallback for reactions, alongside refined emoji normalization. ([#34](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/34))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/39): Fixes the use of `messageServerId` instead of the deprecated `serverId`.\n- [#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/37): Addresses TypeScript type errors specifically within the service and voice modules.\n- [#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/36): Introduces a multi-bot voice architecture with audio channels and progressive updates.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### User Feedback and Chat Management\nTwo new issues were opened today focusing on user interaction and chat management. These include the ability to summarize chat names for better organization and the implementation of a feedback button for users to submit their thoughts.\n- Chat Renaming ([#6278](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6278))\n- Add feedback button ([#6280](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6280))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues had more than 3 comments today."

This included adding a new interface for Discord command registration payloads and ensuring correct type usage in `registerEvent` and `useModel` calls. ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/38))\n\n### Message Handling Refactoring and Dependency Cleanup\nUpdated message handling logic and removed an unused development dependency, streamlining the codebase and preparing for future integrations. This refactoring touched numerous files related to actions, attachments, and service utilities. ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32))\n\n### Permission System and Fallback Handling Enhancements\nIntroduced a new permission system and improved server/message fallback handling. This work also included refinements to reaction processing, such as fast-path emoji extraction, explicit-request detection, and LLM fallback for reactions. ([#34](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/34))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n*   **Fixes and Architectural Improvements**:\n    *   [#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/39) fix: use messageServerId instead of deprecated serverId\n    *   [#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/37) fix: resolve TypeScript type errors in service and voice modules\n    *   [#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/36) Add multi-bot voice architecture with audio channels and progressive updates\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n*   **Feature Requests**:\n    *   [#6278](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6278) Chat Renaming: Request to summarize chat names.\n    *   [#6280](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6280) Add feedback button: Request to add a button for users to submit feedback.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n*   **Chat Renaming** ([#6278](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6278)): CodeRabbit AI has provided an auto-generated issue plan, offering to create an implementation plan and prompts for a coding agent. The plan is currently pending creation.\n*   **Add feedback button** ([#6280](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6280)): Similar to the chat renaming issue, CodeRabbit AI has generated an auto-plan, offering to create an implementation plan and prompts. The plan is awaiting creation."

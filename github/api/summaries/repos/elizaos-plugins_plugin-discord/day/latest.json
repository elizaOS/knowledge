  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Daily Update (Jan 14, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw the opening of a new pull request focused on voice utilities and fixes, alongside the creation of a new issue detailing a reflection evaluator failure.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo completed work was reported for this day.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#42](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/42), titled \"voice-pr: utilities & other fixes,\" was opened. This PR likely introduces new utilities and addresses various fixes related to voice functionalities within the plugin.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\nNo issues were closed on this day.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\nA new issue, [#6364](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6364), was opened, reporting that the \"Reflection evaluator fails with 'Entity not found' - UPDATE_CONTACT requires entity initialization.\" The issue details that `UPDATE_CONTACT` fails because `ensureConnection()` is not called before saving facts, leading to \"No ownership data found for world\" messages. A proposed fix involves a modification within `reflection.ts` before `UPDATE_CONT`.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Reflection Evaluator Failure\nIssue [#6364](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6364) highlights a critical bug where the reflection evaluator fails due to an \"Entity not found\" error when `UPDATE_CONTACT` is called. The root cause is identified as `ensureConnection()` not being invoked prior to saving facts. The latest comment from \"thewoweffect\" expresses appreciation for the team's work."

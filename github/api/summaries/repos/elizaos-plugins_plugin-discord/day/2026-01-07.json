  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord Daily Update (Jan 7, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw the closure of an old issue regarding Discord slash commands, with a new pull request opened to align the plugin with the ElizaOS unified API. Discussions continued on a critical publishing failure issue.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#41](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/41), was opened to address the use of `handleMessage` instead of `sendMessage` for the ElizaOS unified API.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Slash Command Extensibility\nIssue [#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/15), concerning the disappearance of join and leave slash commands, was closed. The resolution involved making the system extensible, allowing developers to add slash commands as needed.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Publishing Failure Investigation\nDiscussion continued on issue [#40](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/40) regarding the failure to publish version v1.3.4, leading to a jump to v1.3.5. The latest comments indicate that version 1.3.6 has been attempted for publication, though no action is visible yet. Analysis of past publishing failures on December 23rd revealed TypeScript errors related to `EventPayloadMap` and `DiscordRegisterCommandsPayload` types, as well as incompatible types for event handlers. The `package.json` dependencies for `@elizaos/config` (1.6.5) and `@elizaos/core` (^1.7.0) are also being reviewed."

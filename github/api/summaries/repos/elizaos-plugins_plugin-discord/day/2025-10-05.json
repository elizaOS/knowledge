Discussions continued on an active issue regarding import errors with Eliza CLI 1.61, with a user providing a detailed analysis of potential type definition file problems.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Dependency Management Automation\nA new Renovate configuration has been added to automate dependency updates and maintenance for the repository. This aims to improve the efficiency of keeping dependencies current and secure. ([#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/20))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/20), titled \"chore: add renovate configuration,\" was opened. This PR introduces the configuration for Renovate, a dependency update automation tool.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed on Oct 5, 2025.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened on Oct 5, 2025.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6031))\nDiscussion continued regarding import errors in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61. User matteo-brandolino suggested that the issue might stem from missing source files referenced by type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically in version 1.6.1. They noted that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the problem, indicating a potential bug specific to that version. This follows an earlier comment from 0xbbjoker who requested the user to try running `bun x tsc --noEmit` to diagnose if it's an IDE-specific issue, as they could not reproduce it on a fresh installation."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Weekly Report (Aug 10 - 16, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week saw a significant expansion of the plugin's core capabilities alongside crucial stability improvements. A comprehensive suite of new utility functions was introduced to streamline developer interactions with the Solana blockchain, from balance checking to direct swaps. Concurrently, development focused on hardening the plugin by resolving a critical publishing failure that prevented new versions from reaching npm and providing clear guidance on resolving common testing errors. These efforts have made the plugin both more powerful and more reliable for developers.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week focused on enhancing functionality and improving internal consistency.\n\n- **Expanded Solana Interaction Utilities**\n  A major feature enhancement added a wide array of utility functions to simplify common Solana tasks. This includes tools for identifying address types, retrieving token accounts, checking balances, resolving metadata addresses, and validating addresses. Notably, this update also integrates direct swap execution via `plugin-jupiter`, significantly increasing the plugin's utility for DeFi applications ([#10](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/10)).\n\n- **Service Configuration Refinement**\n  To improve clarity and consistency within the ElizaOS framework, the plugin's internal service configuration was updated. The service was explicitly renamed to `chain_solana`, a change that standardizes its identification but may require adjustments in existing integrations ([#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/8)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe focus this week was on resolving critical bugs and providing developer support.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  - A critical publishing bug was fixed where the `elizaos publish --npm` command would report success but fail to publish to the registry. The issue was traced to incorrect package naming and an outdated plugin template ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/5754)).\n  - Guidance was provided to resolve a recurring testing error related to WebSocket connections. The solution involves correctly mocking WebSockets before service imports to prevent attempts at live connections during tests ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/5770)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  No new issues were reported, and there were no active issues with significant ongoing discussion noted in the reports.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe provided development reports did not highlight any specific PRs or issues with a high degree of community discussion or collaboration during this period."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Daily Update (Oct 8, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw continued discussion and investigation into a critical import issue affecting the Eliza CLI, with community members actively contributing to diagnosis.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo new technical developments were reported for this day.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Investigation into Eliza CLI Import Errors [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6031)\nDiscussion continued regarding an issue where imports in `index.ts` fail when creating a new project using `elizaos create`. The user `matteo-brandolino` provided their OS as Arch Linux and confirmed that the issue persists with `elizaos create`. The issue appears to be specific to `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1, with earlier and later versions reportedly working correctly. The user `matteo-brandolino` suggested that the problem might stem from missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in the published `1.6.1` package, referencing source files that are not included in the installed package. This theory was further supported by `claude`'s detailed diagnosis, which concluded that version 1.6.1 of `@elizaos/core` was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files, making the issue version-specific and environment-independent. `claude` recommended users upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later and suggested the ElizaOS team consider deprecating v1.6.1."

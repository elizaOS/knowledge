The conversation clarified that `generate` would specifically refer to text generation, suggesting a renaming to `generateText` for clarity. A proposal was made for a `generateText(input: string, options?: GenerateTextOptions)` function, with options for including character personality and specifying model type. This approach aims to be future-proof for potential additional return types."

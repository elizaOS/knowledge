  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Daily Update (Nov 12, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day's development focused on enhancing the plugin's testing infrastructure and TypeScript strictness, migrating to Bun-centric testing, and improving SOL swap handling.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Type Checking and Build Process\nThe project moved towards stricter TypeScript with pre-build typechecking, including the addition of `tsconfig.typecheck.json` and modifications to `tsconfig.build.json` and `tsconfig.json`. This change aims to improve code quality and catch type-related issues earlier in the development cycle. ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/22))\n\n### Migration to Bun-centric Testing\nThe testing framework was updated to utilize Bun, replacing Vitest. This involved changes in `package.json` and the test files themselves, specifically in `__tests__/actions/swap.test.ts` and `__tests__/tsconfig.test.ts`. This shift streamlines the testing environment. ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/22))\n\n### Improved SOL Swap Handling and Configuration Tests\nImprovements were made to SOL swap handling within `src/actions/swap.ts` and `src/index.ts`. Additionally, configuration guard tests were added, enhancing the robustness of the plugin's core functionalities. ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/22))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

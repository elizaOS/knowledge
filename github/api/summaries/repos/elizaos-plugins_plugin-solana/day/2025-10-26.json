  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Daily Update (Oct 26, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on a critical bug fix addressing a race condition in the Solana Wallet Service and a routine version bump.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Solana Wallet Service Race Condition Fix\nA significant bug was resolved that prevented the `SolanaWalletService` from initializing correctly due to a race condition. The fix involves lazy loading `SolanaService`, ensuring it's available when `SolanaWalletService` attempts to initialize, thereby preventing the \"Solana Service is required for Solana Wallet Service\" error ([#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/18)).\n\n### Version Update\nThe project version was bumped to 1.2.6. This is a chore update with no functional changes ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/19)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Unified Messaging API Implementation\nIssue [#6096](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6096), \"Implement unified messaging API through ElizaOs Wrapper,\" was created today. A comment from \"linear\" at 2025-10-26T22:45:55Z references a pull request ([https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6095](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6095)) which is likely related to the implementation of this API. This issue was subsequently closed on 2025-10-27T11:57:32Z."

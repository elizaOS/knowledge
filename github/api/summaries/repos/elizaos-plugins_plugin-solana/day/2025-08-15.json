  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Daily Update (Aug 15, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing the `plugin-solana` with a suite of new utility functions for Solana interactions and addressing critical publishing issues. Significant progress was made in improving the plugin's functionality and resolving user-reported problems.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Solana Utility Functions\nA significant set of new utility functions were added to streamline interactions with the Solana blockchain. These include `getAddressType`, `getTokenAccountsByKeypair`, `getBalanceByAddr`, `getMetadataAddress`, `getTokenSymbol`, `isValidSolanaAddress`, and `executeSwap` (leveraging `plugin-jupiter`). These additions aim to provide developers with a more comprehensive toolkit for Solana-based operations. ([#10](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/10))\n\n### Service Configuration Updates\nThe plugin's internal service configuration was updated, specifically setting the chain/service and renaming the service to `chain_solana`. This change, while potentially breaking for some, standardizes the service naming convention. ([#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/8))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Resolution of Plugin Publishing Failures\nA critical issue where the `elizaos publish --npm` command reported success but failed to publish to npm was resolved. The root cause was identified as a scoped package name issue and an outdated plugin template. The solution involved updating the package name to be unscoped and ensuring the `package.json` matched the current template structure. ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/5754))\n\n### Guidance on Plugin Testing Errors\nGuidance was provided for a user encountering consistent testing errors during plugin development. The advice focused on checking mock setup, using consistent mocking libraries, adding debugging, and isolating tests to identify the root cause, particularly for WebSocket-related issues. ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/5770))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Persistent Testing Errors in Plugin Development ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/5770))\nThe user, 1BDO, reported persistent errors (5-7 times) during plugin testing, specifically with `bun test`. The latest comment from 1BDO confirms that a WebSocket mock fix, involving moving the mock setup before imports, successfully resolved the issue. The user also expressed satisfaction with Eliza's \"ASK AI\" documentation, finding it superior to GPT-5 for Eliza-related queries. Previously, 0xbbjoker provided detailed troubleshooting steps, including checking mock setup, using consistent mocking libraries, adding debugging, and isolating tests, suggesting the issues were deterministic and fixable with proper mock configuration.\n\n### Critical Plugin Publishing Failures ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/5754))\nThe issue regarding `elizaos publish --npm` reporting false success was closed today. The user, monilpat, confirmed that the suggested fix from yungalgo, which involved addressing a legacy plugin naming change (specifically, removing the `@elizaos` scope from the package name and updating the `package.json` to match the current template), successfully resolved the publishing problem. yungalgo's detailed explanation highlighted that the issue stemmed from a scoped package name requiring an npm organization that didn't exist or lacked publish access, and an outdated plugin template."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Monthly Report (October 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nOctober was a month of significant architectural enhancements and critical stability fixes for the Solana plugin. Development focused on modernizing core functionalities, highlighted by a major push to integrate Token-2022 support. The team also resolved several key bugs, including a widely discussed import issue related to Eliza CLI v1.6.1 and a race condition within the wallet service. Proactive improvements were made to the build process and wallet management, introducing lazy loading and new API endpoints to enhance flexibility and prepare the plugin for future multichain capabilities.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving stability, modernizing the tech stack, and expanding core Solana features.\n\n- **Token-2022 Integration:** A primary focus was upgrading the plugin to support the Token-2022 standard. Initial work introduced Token-2022-aware parsing, batch symbol backfill, and combined account discovery ([#14](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/14)). This was followed by further type fixes and metadata support ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/16)). Towards the end of the month, a broader refactor of the transaction system continued to build on these improvements ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/24)).\n\n- **Stability and Bug Fixes:** Several critical bugs were addressed to improve application resilience.\n    - A race condition that prevented the `SolanaWalletService` from initializing correctly was resolved by implementing lazy loading for the `SolanaService` ([#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/18)).\n    - TypeScript errors were fixed and logging was enhanced for better debugging, alongside improvements to ensure the application can run in standalone mode if trading services are down ([#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/15)).\n\n- **Build Process and Tooling Modernization:** Foundational improvements were made to the development and build pipeline.\n    - The build script was updated to use `Bun.build` directly, aligning its pattern with other plugins ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/17)).\n    - A significant effort began to enforce stricter TypeScript rules, enable build-time type checking, and transition the test suite from Vitest to Bun ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/22)).\n    - Renovate configuration was added to automate future dependency management ([#13](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/13)).\n\n- **API and Wallet Architecture Enhancements:** The plugin's architecture was made more flexible and accessible.\n    - Lazy loading for wallet keys was implemented ([#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/20), [#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/21)), allowing for dynamic wallet injection.\n    - New HTTP API routes were introduced to provide programmatic access to wallet functions, complete with TypeScript types for safe consumption by API clients ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/21)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month was characterized by collaborative debugging of a critical dependency issue and proactive design discussions.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** Issue [#6096](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6096) to \"Implement unified messaging API through ElizaOs Wrapper\" was opened and closed within a day, indicating a rapid and successful implementation cycle for this new feature.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - The most significant discussion revolved around **[#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6031) - Imports not found with Eliza CLI 1.6.1**. This issue, which impacted project creation, saw extensive community collaboration. The root cause was traced to missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in the `@elizaos/core@1.6.1` package. The recommended solution was to upgrade to a newer version, highlighting a critical dependency problem that affected plugin users.\n    - Design discussions continued in **[#5923](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/5923)** regarding a `generate` API, leading to a proposal to rename it to `generateText` for clarity and future-proofing.\n    - Other active investigations include a `dyld` error in the Twitter plugin ([#4180](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/4180)) and an incorrect date display on the weekly summary leaderboard ([#168](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/168)), showing ongoing attention to the broader user experience.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration was highly visible this month, particularly in problem-solving and feature design. The investigation into the Eliza CLI import error ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6031)) served as a strong example of healthy open-source dynamics. Community members like `matteo-brandolino` provided crucial diagnostic information, which, combined with analysis from maintainers and automated tools like `claude`, led to a swift resolution. This collaborative spirit was also evident in the proactive API design discussion in issue [#5923](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/5923), where feedback was incorporated before implementation began. The steady stream of pull requests and issue comments throughout October reflects a highly engaged and active maintenance team."

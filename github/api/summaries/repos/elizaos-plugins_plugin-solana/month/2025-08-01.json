  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nAugust was a productive month focused on enhancing core functionality and improving developer experience for the Solana plugin. A significant expansion of utility functions provides developers with a more comprehensive toolkit for blockchain interactions. Concurrently, work was done to resolve a critical npm publishing bug that was impeding releases. These efforts collectively advanced the plugin's capabilities and stability.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nDevelopment work this month centered on adding new features and standardizing the plugin's configuration.\n\n- **Enhanced Solana Utility Functions:** A major feature update introduced a suite of new utility functions to streamline common Solana operations. The additions include `getAddressType`, `getTokenAccountsByKeypair`, `getBalanceByAddr`, `getMetadataAddress`, `getTokenSymbol`, `isValidSolanaAddress`, and `executeSwap` (which leverages `plugin-jupiter`), significantly expanding the plugin's capabilities ([#10](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/10)).\n\n- **Service Configuration Standardization:** To improve consistency across the ElizaOS ecosystem, the internal service configuration was updated. The service was renamed to `chain_solana` to align with standard naming conventions ([#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/8)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month focused on resolving critical bugs and providing support for developer testing.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n    - **Plugin Publishing Failures Resolved:** A critical issue preventing successful npm publishing was fixed. The `elizaos publish --npm` command would report success while failing silently. The root cause was an incorrect scoped package name (`@elizaos`) and an outdated plugin template. The resolution involved updating the `package.json` to use an unscoped name, unblocking the release process ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/5754)).\n    - **Plugin Testing Errors Resolved:** A user experiencing persistent errors with `bun test` received guidance that led to a resolution. The problem was traced to a WebSocket mock that needed to be set up before other imports. The issue was successfully closed after the user confirmed the fix ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/5770)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened during this period, and all previously active issues were resolved and closed.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration was evident in the resolution of key issues this month.\n\n- The publishing failure in issue [#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/5754) was resolved through collaboration between user `monilpat` and contributor `yungalgo`, who provided the detailed diagnosis and fix.\n- Similarly, the testing errors in issue [#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/5770) were addressed through troubleshooting advice from `0xbbjoker` and follow-up from user `1BDO`.\n- User `1BDO` also provided positive feedback on Eliza's \"ASK AI\" documentation, noting its effectiveness for resolving Eliza-specific queries compared to general-purpose models."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter Weekly Report (Jan 25 - 31, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week, development focused on improving the integration's transparency and alignment with the OpenRouter ecosystem. The primary advancement involved enhancing request metadata to support better attribution tracking. By implementing standardized headers, the plugin is moving toward better visibility within the OpenRouter rankings and dashboard, ensuring that ElizaOS-driven traffic is correctly identified and credited.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Attribution and Metadata Enhancement\nThe core technical focus this week was on refining how the plugin identifies itself during API requests to OpenRouter.\n*   **Header Support for Attribution:** A significant update was initiated to include `X-Title` and `HTTP-Referer` headers in outgoing requests. This change allows developers using the plugin to identify their specific agent applications and provides OpenRouter with the necessary context to track usage origins. This is a key step for projects seeking to appear in OpenRouter's activity leaderboards or utilize specific developer analytics ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/23)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n### New & Active Issues\n*   **Tracking and Visibility:** The active focus remains on the implementation of PR [#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/23). There is an ongoing effort to ensure that these attribution headers are correctly implemented across all model calls to prevent data fragmentation in the OpenRouter dashboard.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe activity this week centered on a new feature request aimed at ecosystem integration. The opening of PR [#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/23) indicates a push from the community to move beyond basic connectivity toward a more professionalized and trackable implementation of the OpenRouter plugin. This reflects a growing interest in how ElizaOS agents are perceived and ranked within the broader AI provider landscape."

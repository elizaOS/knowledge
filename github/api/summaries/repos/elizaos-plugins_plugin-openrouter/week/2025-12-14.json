  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter Weekly Report (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's development focused on enhancing the core capabilities of the OpenRouter plugin. The most significant achievement was the introduction of streaming text generation support, enabling real-time output and improving user experience. This feature was accompanied by the implementation of comprehensive test coverage to ensure plugin reliability. Concurrently, planning for future architectural improvements has begun, with active discussions around a new data pipeline design.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on a single, impactful pull request that refined the plugin's functionality.\n\n### Streaming Support and Test Coverage\nA major update in PR [#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21) introduced key changes to the plugin. The primary new feature is support for streaming text generation, allowing for more dynamic and responsive interactions. To bolster stability and future development, comprehensive test coverage was also implemented. As part of this refinement, tools support was removed from the plugin.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this week was focused on future planning rather than resolving existing bugs.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported. However, a significant discussion is underway in issue [#187](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/187) regarding an RFC for data pipeline architecture improvements. The team is currently seeking input on the proposed implementation plan to define priorities for this future work.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was centered on strategic planning for the project's architecture. The discussion on issue [#187](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/187) highlights the team's process for seeking input on significant architectural decisions. Notably, the workflow included an auto-generated issue plan from CodeRabbit AI, demonstrating the integration of AI tooling to assist in planning and development."

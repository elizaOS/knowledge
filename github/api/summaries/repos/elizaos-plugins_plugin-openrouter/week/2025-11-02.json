  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter Weekly Report (Nov 2 - 8, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's development activity centered on a significant functional expansion for the OpenRouter plugin. The primary achievement was the integration of support for text embedding models. This enhancement broadens the plugin's capabilities beyond text generation, aligning with the ElizaOS goal of creating adaptable and modular AI systems. The work involved adding new handlers and updating configuration utilities to accommodate this new model type.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThe focus this week was on introducing a new feature to the plugin.\n\n- **Text Embedding Model Integration**\n  A major feature was merged to enable the use of `TEXT_EMBEDDING` models through the OpenRouter plugin. This work, completed in PR [#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/17), involved creating a dedicated handler for text embedding requests, updating the plugin's core model definitions, and modifying configuration utilities to recognize new `OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_` environment settings. This lays the groundwork for agents to perform tasks requiring semantic understanding and vector-based operations.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nBased on the reports from this week, there was no activity related to issues.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, and there were no significant discussions on existing issues.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe available development reports for this week did not indicate any significant community discussions or collaborative activity on pull requests or issues. The primary focus was on the internal development and integration of the text embedding feature."

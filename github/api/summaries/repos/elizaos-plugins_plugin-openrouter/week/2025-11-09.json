  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter Weekly Report (Nov 9 - 15, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's activity centered on feature enhancement and proactive issue management. A new pull request was introduced to add more granular control over text generation with an `onStepFinish` callback. A potential high-impact bug concerning the Web UI blocking endpoints was reported and is now under investigation, despite its rapid closure. Additionally, the ongoing dashboard redesign effort attracted interest from a new contributor, signaling healthy community engagement with future project goals.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week focused on proposing a new feature to improve the text generation experience.\n\n- **Enhanced Text Generation Control**\n  A new feature was proposed in PR [#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/18) to add an `onStepFinish` callback to text generation functions. This change aims to give developers more granular feedback and control during the step-by-step process of AI text generation.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management involved investigating a potential bug and continued discussion on a major redesign initiative.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  - Issue [#6138](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6138), which reported that disabling the Web UI blocked all endpoints, was closed shortly after being opened. However, the closure was due to it being opened prematurely, and the underlying issue remains under investigation.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - The most significant new issue was [#6138](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6138). Contributor humuhimi is investigating the report and noted that the issue will be reopened with a corresponding PR if the bug is confirmed.\n  - The long-term \"My Agents\" dashboard redesign, tracked in issue [#6119](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6119), saw renewed activity with a new contributor expressing interest in helping with the implementation. This issue outlines a significant body of future work, including a new Figma-based layout and sidebar navigation.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\n- A new contributor, Rassakia, joined the discussion on the dashboard redesign ([#6119](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6119)), indicating growing interest in the project's UI/UX development.\n- Collaborative triage was evident in issue [#6138](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6138), where humuhimi and standujar actively communicated to clarify the status of the potential bug."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter Daily Update (Oct 5, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day's development focused on infrastructure improvements with the addition of Renovate configuration. An active issue regarding import errors in `index.ts` with Eliza CLI 1.61 continued to be investigated.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Infrastructure Improvements\n- A new pull request was opened to add Renovate configuration, which will help automate dependency updates and maintenance. ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/16))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- **Renovate Configuration Added**: A new pull request, [#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/16), was opened to introduce Renovate configuration to the repository. This is a chore-related task aimed at improving automated dependency management.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n- None\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n- None\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Module Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6031))\nDiscussion continued on the issue where imports are not found in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61. @matteo-brandolino suggested that the problem might stem from type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically referencing source files not included in the published package. They noted that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the issue. @0xbbjoker requested running `bun x tsc --noEmit` to further diagnose, suspecting an IDE TSC compiler issue. @matteo-brandolino provided the output of this command, showing numerous `TS2305` errors related to missing exported members from `@elizaos/core` in various files, reinforcing the initial assessment of type definition problems."

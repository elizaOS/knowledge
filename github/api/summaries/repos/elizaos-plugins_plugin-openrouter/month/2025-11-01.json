  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nNovember's development was focused on a significant functional expansion for the OpenRouter plugin. The primary achievement was the integration of support for text embedding models, a crucial step in enhancing the plugin's versatility. This update broadens the range of AI tasks the plugin can handle, directly supporting the ElizaOS mission of creating adaptable and modular AI systems. While development was concentrated, this new capability lays the groundwork for more sophisticated agent behaviors that rely on semantic understanding and vector-based operations.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month centered on adding a new model type to the plugin's capabilities.\n\n-   **Text Embedding Model Integration**\n    A new feature was introduced to support `TEXT_EMBEDDING` models. This enhancement enables the plugin to leverage embedding models available through OpenRouter for tasks like semantic search and text similarity. The implementation in PR [#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/17) involved creating a dedicated handler for text embedding, registering the new model type within the plugin's definitions, and updating configuration utilities to recognize `OPENROUTER_EMBEDDING_` settings.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nBased on the provided reports, there was no activity related to issues in the repository during November.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this month.\n-   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, and there were no noteworthy discussions on existing issues.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe development activity recorded in November was focused on the single feature implementation for text embedding support.

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nAugust was a month focused on stability and addressing critical bugs. A significant effort was dedicated to investigating a plugin crash caused by the `pdfjs-dist` dependency. While no new features were added, a key fix was implemented to standardize logger compatibility across the codebase. Progress was partially hampered by build failures in upstream dependencies like `@elizaos/core` and the Eliza CLI, which are currently blocking further testing and development within this plugin.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving the plugin's reliability and maintainability through targeted bug fixes.\n\n- **Logger Compatibility Fix:** A fix was merged to standardize error logging throughout the plugin ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/38)). This effort, touching multiple files including `actions.ts`, `docs-loader.ts`, and `service.ts`, ensures logging is more consistent and readable, which is crucial for future debugging efforts.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe issue tracker saw activity focused on identifying and diagnosing critical bugs, both within the plugin and in core ElizaOS components.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in August.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - **Plugin Stability:** A high-priority issue was opened concerning a plugin crash related to `pdfjs-dist` ([#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/37)). Initial investigation to reproduce the `TypeError: process.getBuiltinModule is not a function` error was unsuccessful, and the team is awaiting more detailed information from the issue reporter to proceed.\n    - **Upstream Blockers:** Development and testing are currently impacted by build failures in other parts of the ElizaOS ecosystem. These include a build failure in `@elizaos/core` ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5738)) that prevents the `bun run clean` command from succeeding, and an Eliza CLI build failure ([#5734](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5734)) related to a TypeScript error. These external issues must be resolved to unblock testing of more complex scenarios for the knowledge plugin.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this month was characterized by responsive debugging and cross-team communication. The investigation into the `pdfjs-dist` crash ([#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/37)) shows active engagement between developers and the issue reporter. Furthermore, the identification of an upstream blocker during a \"morning call\" ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5738)) highlights the team's awareness of and communication about inter-dependencies within the broader ElizaOS project."

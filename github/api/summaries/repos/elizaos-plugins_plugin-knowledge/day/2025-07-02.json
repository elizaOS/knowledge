  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Daily Update (Jul 2, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on refining configuration handling and improving Base64 string detection. A significant refactoring was completed to streamline runtime configuration, and a new configuration option was added.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Configuration and Runtime Refinements\nThe plugin's configuration and runtime initialization have been significantly refactored to ensure that configuration occurs only once when the singleton object is created. This improves efficiency and addresses previous issues related to dynamic configuration. A new configuration option was also introduced. ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/32))\n\n### Enhanced Base64 Detection\nThe `looksLikeBase64` utility function has been made smarter to prevent misidentification of small Markdown files as Base64 strings. This bug fix improves the accuracy of Base64 string detection within the plugin. ([#30](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/30))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Configuration and Environment Variable Issues Resolved\nAn issue detailing various configuration problems, including incorrect environment variable usage (`LOAD_DOCS_ON_STARTUP` vs. `CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED`) and dynamic provider concerns, has been closed. A related pull request ([#30](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/30)) was created to address the `looksLikeBase64` aspect of this issue. ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/31))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Twitter Client Initialization Error\nA new issue reports an error during Twitter client initialization when creating or starting an agent using the Twitter plugin. Users are experiencing a \"client initialization error\" despite successful authentication. ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/31))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### `@elizaos/cli` test command incorrectly requires monorepo root for standalone projects ([#5142](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5142))\nThe issue, which describes the `elizaos test` command incorrectly requiring a monorepo root for standalone projects, has been investigated by Claude. Claude's analysis confirms that the issue has been resolved. The current implementation no longer contains the specific error message, uses graceful fallback logic for monorepo root detection, and robustly identifies standalone projects. The `elizaos test` command now works correctly for both monorepo and standalone contexts.\n\n### EVENT MESSAGE SENT not working ([#5216](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5216))\nThe issue reports that `sendAgentResponseToBus` does not emit `EventType.MESSAGE_SENT` when sending payloads to the central server API endpoint. A recent comment asks if the bootstrap plugin was added, suggesting a potential dependency or setup issue.\n\n### fix: ensure `bun run test` works consistently across all packages ([#5218](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5218))\nThis issue, concerning inconsistent `bun run test` behavior across packages, has been marked as completed. A comment from @wtfsayo confirms that the work has been done, and @ai16z-demirix had previously taken ownership of the task.\n\n### Migrate remaining CLI input methods to use @clack/prompts for consistency ([#5295](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5295))\nThis issue aims to standardize CLI input methods to use `@clack/prompts`. @Ifechukwudaniel expressed interest in working on it, and @wtfsayo encouraged them to proceed and submit a PR. A PR ([#5359](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/5359)) has been submitted for review.\n\n### Twitter Client Initialization Error ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/31))\nUsers are reporting a \"client initialization error\" with the Twitter plugin despite successful authentication. Several users confirm experiencing the same problem. One user noted that the issue might be related to limitations of free subscriptions preventing access to the Home Timeline. Another user mentioned that the older method of authentication worked, but they are encountering issues with newer ElizaOS versions. A comment suggests that plugin-twitter version 1.0.14 might fix it, but then reports a new error related to inserting into \"memories\" table."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Daily Update (Jun 20, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's focus was on addressing user-reported issues, particularly around versioning and plugin loading. A key update was provided for the `elizaos update` command.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n- **CLI Update Guidance:**\n    - Provided a solution for the `elizaos update` command not working as expected, advising users to use `bun install -g @elizaos/cli@latest` for initial updates to ensure correct future update commands.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- None\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n- **CLI Update Command Resolution:**\n    - The issue where `elizaos update` was not correctly updating the CLI version has been closed, with a workaround provided to ensure users can get the latest CLI. ([#5198](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5198))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n- None\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n- **Web Client Version Mismatch:**\n    - Discussion continues on the web client displaying an incorrect version compared to the CLI and core. A user reported that the issue persists even with `v1.0.11`, showing `1.0.10` in the web client and requesting an update. Previously, it was thought to be fixed, but new reports indicate it's still an active problem. ([#4924](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/4924))\n- **Checking Loaded Plugins:**\n    - Guidance was provided on how to check currently loaded plugins in the agent's log output, specifically looking for a log entry that lists \"Final plugins being loaded.\" ([#4931](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/4931))"

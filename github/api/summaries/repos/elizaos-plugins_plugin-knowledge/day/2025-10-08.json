  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Daily Update (Oct 8, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day's activity focused on diagnosing and discussing a type import issue within the Eliza CLI, specifically concerning `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, tests, or other work were completed today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Investigation into Eliza CLI Import Errors [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6031)\nDiscussion continued regarding the \"Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61\" issue. @matteo-brandolino provided details about their operating system (Arch Linux) and confirmed that the problem persists when running `bun x tsc --noEmit`, indicating widespread type import errors across multiple files. @0xbbjoker suggested that the issue might be related to the IDE's TypeScript compiler and mentioned that they could not reproduce the problem on their end with a fresh setup. @matteo-brandolino further speculated that the issue might stem from malformed type definition files in `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1, noting that both older (1.5.15) and newer versions of the package do not exhibit the same problem. @claude was tasked with diagnosing the issue."

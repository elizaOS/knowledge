  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Daily Update (Jun 19, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, a significant feature was added to the `plugin-knowledge` repo, enabling custom LLM integration with caching. Additionally, a long-standing issue regarding callback responses from plugin actions was closed after successful verification.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced LLM Integration with Caching\nA new feature has been implemented to allow the use of custom LLM providers for document processing. This includes configurable caching and provider selection, significantly improving flexibility and performance for knowledge processing. ([#13](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/13))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Resolution of Plugin Action Callback Issues\nThe issue where callbacks from plugin actions were not reaching the end-user response in chat has been resolved and closed. This fix ensures that success or failure messages from plugin actions, such as `plugin-evm` transfers, are properly communicated back to the user. ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5017))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Customizable Root Logger Configuration\nDiscussions continue on allowing downstream projects to customize the root logger configuration. The issue highlights that current projects cannot modify transports, only create child loggers. A comprehensive solution is being developed, including a delayed initialization system, a new logger configuration interface, and CLI integration to apply custom settings during startup. An example configuration with CloudWatch, file, and HTTP transports is also being prepared. ([#5183](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5183))"

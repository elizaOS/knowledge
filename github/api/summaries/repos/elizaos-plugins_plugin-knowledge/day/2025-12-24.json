  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Daily Update (Dec 24, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, the `plugin-knowledge` repository saw a significant feature addition with configurable rate limits for high-throughput APIs. Several new issues were also opened, primarily focusing on UI/UX and documentation improvements.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced API Rate Limiting\nA new feature was introduced to add configurable rate limits for high-throughput APIs. This includes an option to completely disable rate limiting and settings for `MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`, `REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`, `TOKENS_PER_MINUTE`, and `BATCH_DELAY_MS`. Default limits were also increased fivefold for high-throughput APIs. ([#49](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/49))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Agent Chat and Conversation Management\nTwo new issues were opened concerning agent chat functionality. One addresses the need for opening the most recent conversation when accessing an agent from the dashboard ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6281)). The other highlights a bug where conversations are duplicated when switching between agents ([#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6282)).\n\n### UI/UX and Documentation Improvements\nTwo additional issues were created to address user experience and documentation. One reports spacing issues in numbered lists ([#6283](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6283)), and the other calls for a fix to monorepo documentation ([#6284](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6284)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Agent Chat and Conversation Management\nIssues [#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6281) and [#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6282) both received initial comments from `coderabbitai`, which automatically generated an implementation plan and prompts for coding agents. These comments also provided links to similar and related issues within the ElizaOS ecosystem and suggested assignees for the tasks.\n\n### UI/UX and Documentation\nSimilarly, issues [#6283](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6283) and [#6284](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6284) also received automated comments from `coderabbitai`, outlining implementation plans, providing examples, and suggesting assignees. Issue [#6284](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6284) also linked to a related, merged pull request concerning monorepo documentation."

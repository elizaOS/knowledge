  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Daily Update (Dec 24, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, the `plugin-knowledge` repository saw a significant feature addition with configurable rate limits for high-throughput APIs. Several new issues were also opened, primarily focusing on UI/UX and documentation improvements.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced API Rate Limiting\nA new feature was introduced to add configurable rate limits for high-throughput APIs. This includes an option to completely disable rate limiting and settings for `MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`, `REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`, `TOKENS_PER_MINUTE`, and `BATCH_DELAY_MS`. Default limits were also increased fivefold for high-throughput APIs. ([#49](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/49))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Agent Chat and Conversation Management\nTwo new issues were opened regarding agent chat functionality. One addresses the need for opening the most recent conversation when accessing an agent from \"My Agents/Dashboard\" ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6281)). The other highlights a bug where conversations are duplicated when switching between agents ([#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6282)).\n\n### UI/UX and Documentation Improvements\nA new issue was created to address spacing problems in numbered list items ([#6283](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6283)). Additionally, a task was opened to fix monorepo documentation ([#6284](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6284)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Agent Chat and Conversation Management\nIssues [#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6281) and [#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6282) both received initial comments from `coderabbitai`, which automatically generated an implementation plan and prompts for a coding agent. Issue [#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6281) suggests `borisudovicic` and `linear` as assignees and lists several related issues in the `elizaOS/eliza` repository. Similarly, issue [#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6282) also suggests `borisudovicic` and `linear` as assignees, identifies [#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6281) as a possible duplicate, and lists other related issues.\n\n### UI/UX and Documentation Improvements\nIssue [#6283](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6283) regarding spacing in numbered items also received an auto-generated plan from `coderabbitai`, suggesting `borisudovicic` as an assignee and linking to several related issues. Issue [#6284](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6284) concerning monorepo documentation also had an auto-generated plan from `coderabbitai`, suggesting `yungalgo` as an assignee and referencing a merged PR in `elizaOS/eliza` related to simplifying monorepo commands and updating documentation."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Daily Update (Jul 1, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw the resolution of a critical bug related to unique ID generation for memories. Discussions continued on documentation improvements, deployment strategies for Eliza agents, and standardizing CLI input methods.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Bug Fixes and Stability\n- A critical bug where `processKnowledgeAction` generated the same `clientDocumentId` for every memory was closed. This ensures unique identification for new memories, improving data integrity and system stability. ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/16))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Deployment Strategies for Eliza Agents\nDiscussions continued on the best ways to deploy custom Eliza agents ([#5244](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5244)). @bealers shared their work on \"elizify,\" a project aiming for easy, secure, and reproducible Eliza installations, including a `docker compose up` solution and a goal for one-click Coolify install. @wtfsayo suggested Railway and Render as potential platforms. @kamalbuilds highlighted challenges with existing options like Fleek and Relay for custom agents. The latest comment from @claude indicates progress on creating `railway.json` and Render blueprint files, along with a `DEPLOYMENT.md` guide, to address this issue.\n\n### Documentation Overhaul\nThe ongoing discussion for a documentation overhaul to create separate tracks for simple users and developers ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5234)) saw a new comment from @Ifechukwudaniel requesting assignment to the issue. Earlier, @Megamindmaster provided extensive feedback from a new user's perspective, highlighting inconsistencies in environment variables across different files and the difficulty for non-developers to set up example JSON files like Jarvis.\n\n### CLI Input Method Consistency\nThe issue of migrating remaining CLI input methods to use `@clack/prompts` for consistency ([#5295](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5295)) also received a new comment from @Ifechukwudaniel requesting assignment. @wtfsayo encouraged contributors to work on it and submit a PR.\n\n### Test Consistency Across Packages\nThe issue concerning inconsistent `bun run test` functionality across all packages ([#5218](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5218)) saw a new comment from @ai16z-demirix, who stated they have started working on it and made progress on phase 1, taking responsibility for the complete issue."

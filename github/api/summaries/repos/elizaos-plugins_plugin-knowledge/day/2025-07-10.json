  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Daily Update (Jul 10, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day's development focused on code maintenance, specifically refactoring for improved type safety and dependency updates. Discussions continued on existing issues related to plugin loading and client authentication.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Codebase Refinements and Dependency Updates\nA significant refactoring effort was completed to enhance code quality and ensure compatibility with the latest packages. This included updating dependencies, improving type safety, and streamlining logging within the `KnowledgeService` class. ([#33](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/33))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Loading Failures\nDiscussions continued regarding the `Plugin-local-ai` failing to load on Windows ([#5499](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5499)). On July 10th, a user reported experiencing the same issue on Mac with `v1.2.0`, suggesting that using hosted models is the primary workaround. The issue was later marked for deprecation of the local-ai plugin in favor of Ollama, with a note that local-ai might work on a second startup.\n\n### Twitter Client Authentication Issues\nThe issue of `Failed to create Twitter Client` ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/36)) persisted, with a user on July 10th confirming they were experiencing the same error. This issue was later resolved with the 1.2.0 update."

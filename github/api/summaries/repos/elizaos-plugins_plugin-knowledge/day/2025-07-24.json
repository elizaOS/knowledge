  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Daily Update (Jul 24, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw significant progress in expanding plugin capabilities with new provider support and initial work on knowledge graph optimization. A critical logging compatibility issue for Bun builds was also addressed.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **New Provider Integration:**\n    *   Added Ollama as a supported provider for `plugin-knowledge` and embeddings, expanding the range of available models and services. [#34](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/34)\n*   **Knowledge Graph Optimization Initiative:**\n    *   Initiated work on optimizing the knowledge graph, aiming to improve performance and efficiency. [#35](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/35)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n*   [#35](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/35) feat: optimize knowledge graph - This PR focuses on optimizing the knowledge graph.\n*   [#34](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/34) Add Ollama as a supported provider for plugin-knowledge and embeddings - This PR introduces Ollama support for knowledge and embeddings.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n*   **Bun Build Compatibility for Logging:**\n    *   Issue [#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5673) addresses `pino-pretty` errors in export builds from Bun, proposing to replace `pino` with `adze`.\n    *   A detailed plan for migrating from `pino` to `adze` has been outlined, including analysis of current `pino` usage, research into `adze` API, and steps for implementation.\n    *   The migration is reported as \"code-complete,\" with `adze@^2.2.8` replacing `pino@^9.6.0` and `pino-pretty@^13.0.0`.\n    *   An `ElizaLogger` class has been created to wrap `adze` with a `pino`-compatible API, ensuring zero breaking changes for 182 files using the logger.\n    *   Key features like custom log levels, `InMemoryDestination`, environment variable support, Sentry integration, and agent context binding have been preserved.\n    *   Next steps involve running `bun install`, `bun test`, and `bun build` to fully verify the migration."

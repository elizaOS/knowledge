  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Daily Update (Oct 5, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw minimal direct code contributions. The primary activity revolved around a newly opened pull request to add Renovate configuration and ongoing discussions on an active issue concerning import errors with Eliza CLI 1.61.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#41](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/41), was opened to add Renovate configuration, aiming to automate dependency updates.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Troubleshooting Eliza CLI 1.61 Import Errors\nDiscussions continued on [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6031), which reports import errors in `index.ts` when creating new projects with Eliza CLI 1.61. @matteo-brandolino suggested the issue might stem from missing type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically referencing source files that may not be included in the published package. They noted that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the problem. @0xbbjoker requested @matteo-brandolino to run `bun x tsc --noEmit` to further diagnose the issue, suspecting a potential IDE TSC compiler problem. @matteo-brandolino provided the output of the `tsc --noEmit` command, showing numerous `TS2305` errors related to missing exported members from `@elizaos/core` in various files, including `character.ts`, `frontend/index.tsx`, `index.ts`, and `plugin.ts`. They questioned if the issue was with their IDE's TSC compiler, given the problem's specificity to version 1.61."

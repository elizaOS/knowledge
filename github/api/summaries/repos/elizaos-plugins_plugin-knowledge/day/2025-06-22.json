  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Daily Update (Jun 22, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe primary focus today was on a critical bug fix addressing file upload issues within the knowledge plugin. This involved resolving duplicate middleware processing that caused \"Unexpected end of form\" errors, ensuring smoother file handling.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### File Upload Stability Improvement\nA significant bug causing \"Unexpected end of form\" errors during file uploads was resolved. This fix involved removing duplicate middleware processing of multipart form data, which was leading to double parsing and subsequent failures. The update also refined the file upload handling logic. ([#25](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/25))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### API Endpoint Verification and Troubleshooting\nDiscussions continued on [#5230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5230), which reports \"API endpoint not found\" errors across most endpoints, with only the `get agents` endpoint working.\n\nOn July 13, 2025, @wtfsayo requested @claude to verify the issue against current OpenAPI specifications and Postman files. @claude completed this task, providing a comprehensive analysis. The analysis concluded that the API implementation is fully functional and comprehensive, with all documented endpoints properly implemented. The reported 404 errors are likely due to deployment/configuration issues rather than missing endpoints.\n\n**Likely Root Causes Identified:**\n*   **Server Initialization Issues:** Potential failures during database connection, default server creation, or migration errors.\n*   **Environment Configuration:** Missing or incorrect environment variables (e.g., API keys, database URLs, CORS settings).\n*   **Port/Network Issues:** Server not binding to the expected port, firewall blocks, or load balancer/proxy misconfigurations.\n*   **Database Problems:** Corruption or connection failures with SQLite/PGLite or PostgreSQL.\n\n**Recommended Diagnostic Steps:**\n*   Check server health using `curl` commands for `/api/server/ping` and `/api/server/health`.\n*   Review server logs for specific error patterns related to database setup, migrations, and server initialization.\n*   Test authentication if enabled.\n*   Verify critical environment variables.\n\n**Recommendations for Resolution:**\n*   Enable debug logging (`LOG_LEVEL=debug`).\n*   Check the database directory (`.eliza/.elizadb`) for corruption.\n*   Verify network connectivity and port availability.\n*   Test endpoints individually, starting with health checks.\n*   Review authentication configuration.\n\nEarlier in the discussion, on July 3, 2025, @iQiexie noted that the documentation did not accurately represent the actual API, citing missing parameters in error responses for message sending and a non-existent `send-message` endpoint. On June 22, 2025, @ChristopherTrimboli stated that the documentation at `https://eliza.how/docs/rest/eliza-os-api` had been fully updated with the latest 1.0.10 APIs, including Socket messages, and asked for a re-check."

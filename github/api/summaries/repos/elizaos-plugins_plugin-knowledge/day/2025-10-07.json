  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Daily Update (Oct 7, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, the team focused on optimizing the knowledge graph within the ElizaOS plugin-knowledge system, enhancing performance and memory usage. Discussions continued on a critical import issue affecting the Eliza CLI.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Knowledge Graph Optimization\nSignificant work was completed to enhance the knowledge graph's efficiency and resource management. This included:\n- Improved knowledge retrieval algorithms.\n- Better memory management for large knowledge bases.\n- Optimized data structures for performance.\n([#35](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/35))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Eliza CLI Import Errors ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6031))\nDiscussions continued regarding the `Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61` issue.\n- **Root Cause Identified:** Claude's analysis confirmed that the problem is specific to `@elizaos/core@1.6.1`, which was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files. Essential exports like `logger` and `IAgentRuntime` are present in the source code but were not properly exposed in the published package's `.d.ts` files.\n- **Recommendations:** Users are advised to upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later. The ElizaOS team is recommended to consider deprecating v1.6.1 and implement publish-time validation to prevent similar issues.\n- **User Environment Details:** @matteo-brandolino provided their environment details (Node v24.9.0, Bun 1.2.22, Arch Linux) to assist with further investigation, confirming the issue is not specific to Windows.\n- **Ongoing Investigation:** @wtfsayo and @0xbbjoker are actively investigating the issue, with @0xbbjoker initially unable to reproduce it in a fresh environment."

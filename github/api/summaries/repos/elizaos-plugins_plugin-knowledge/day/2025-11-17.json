This involved updating `bun.lock`, `package.json`, and `src/documents-provider.ts` to return formatted available documents with count via new `values` fields and update error handling.

A user suggested that if Deepseek is OpenAI compatible, it might work by providing the API endpoint to the OpenAI plugin. Alternatively, it was confirmed that Deepseek can be used with `plugin-openrouter`, with a link provided for configuring custom models.

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Daily Update (Jun 18, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW\nThe day saw progress in addressing existing issues, with several bugs related to agent replies and room creation via REST API being resolved. A new pull request was opened to enhance frontend testing.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\nNo new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, tests added, or other work were completed and merged on this day.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- **Frontend Test Enhancements:** A new pull request, [#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/24), was opened to add frontend tests, including Cypress and additional end-to-end tests and scenarios.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n- **Agent Reply Behavior Fixes:** The issue of successive replies from agents on target users, [#4940](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/4940), was confirmed as fixed.\n- **REST API Room Creation Resolution:** The problem where creating a room via the REST API initially worked but then returned an empty rooms array, [#4955](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/4955), was resolved. The discussion highlighted the transition from \"rooms\" to \"channels\" and the need for a message to be sent to the room for the agent to register.\n- **Plugin Action Callback Resolution:** The issue where callbacks from plugin actions were not making it to the end-user response in chat, [#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5017), was addressed. The latest comments indicate that updates to the CLI and `plugin-evm` resolved the issue for some users, though `plugin-mcp` responses are still being verified.\n- **Bedrock Integration:** The request for Bedrock LLM integration, [#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5117), was closed with the release of a dedicated `plugin-bedrock`.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened on this day.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments remained open at the end of the day."

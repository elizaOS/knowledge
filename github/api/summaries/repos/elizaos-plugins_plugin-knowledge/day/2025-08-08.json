  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Daily Update (Aug 8, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on critical bug fixes, specifically addressing logger compatibility issues. Several new issues were reported, highlighting build failures and ongoing bug fixes in related ElizaOS components.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Logger Compatibility Fixes\n- Addressed and fixed an issue related to logger compatibility, standardizing error logging across the application for improved consistency and readability. ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/38))\n- This fix involved changes in `package.json`, `src/actions.ts`, `src/docs-loader.ts`, `src/llm.ts`, `src/routes.ts`, `src/service.ts`, and `src/tests.ts`.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were created today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Build Failures in Core Components\n- **🐛 Build failure in @elizaos/core causing bun run clean to fail** ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5738)): This issue, identified during a morning call, describes a failure in the `bun run clean` command due to TypeScript errors in the `@elizaos/core` package during the type definition build phase. The issue is confirmed to exist on the latest branch and is blocking testing of advanced mocking, natural language agent interaction, and dynamic plugin loading. The team is awaiting a fix to proceed with complex scenario testing.\n\n### Eliza CLI Build Failures\n- **Eliza CLI failed to build project** ([#5734](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5734)): This issue reports that the ElizaOS CLI fails to build projects, specifically due to a TypeScript error related to argument types in `src/index.ts`. A potential fix was identified, suggesting that a placeholder `%s` is missing in `logger.info` calls, which was confirmed to resolve the issue. It was also noted that this might have been fixed in version 1.4.x."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Daily Update (Oct 23, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, development focused on enhancing deployment flexibility by introducing configurable plugin factory modes and addressing a critical CLI module resolution issue.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Deployment Flexibility\n- Implemented a configurable plugin factory with core and headless modes, allowing for flexible deployment across different environments. ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/44))\n- Updated documentation and programmatic usage examples to reflect the new deployment modes. ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/44))\n- Added export tests to ensure the integrity of the new plugin factory. ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/44))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### CLI Module Resolution Error\nThe issue regarding `Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'` after installing the ElizaOS CLI ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6088)) was actively discussed and resolved. The problem was identified as a bundling issue in the published npm package. A new version (1.6.3) was released to fix this, and users confirmed the fix after re-installing the CLI. Earlier discussions included workarounds such as using the CLI from a local clone or running the CLI directly from its `dist` folder."

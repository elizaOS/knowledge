  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Weekly Report (Jul 27 - 2, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's activity focused on enhancing the stability and configuration of the knowledge plugin. A critical bug fix was implemented to correctly read knowledge paths from runtime settings, improving the flexibility of knowledge management. Additionally, a significant new issue was identified concerning missing auto-deployment CI files for migrated plugins, highlighting a need to address infrastructure gaps to ensure consistent deployment across the ecosystem.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nDevelopment work centered on bug fixes and improvements to core functionality.\n\n- **Knowledge Path & Document Loading:** A key bug was resolved that prevented the knowledge path from being read correctly from runtime settings, now allowing for more flexible character-based path configurations ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/36)). Alongside this fix, general improvements were made to the document loading process, touching several core files including `src/docs-loader.ts` and `src/service.ts`.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe focus in issue management was on identifying and beginning to address deployment pipeline problems.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** Based on the provided reports, no issues were closed this week.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** A new critical issue, [#5691](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5691), was opened regarding migrated plugins that are missing auto-deployment CI files. This prevents them from being deployed correctly and represents a potential blocker for other version 1.x plugins. Discussion on this issue has already begun, indicating it is an active priority.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration was evident in the quick response to newly identified infrastructure issues. The discussion on issue [#5691](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5691) saw `wtfsayo` and `@ai16z-demirix` begin to collaborate on a solution, demonstrating the team's active engagement in resolving deployment challenges."

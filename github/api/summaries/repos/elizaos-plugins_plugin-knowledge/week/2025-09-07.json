  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Weekly Report (Sep 7 - 13, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts centered on improving developer experience and resolving outstanding UI and tooling issues. Significant progress was made by closing three key issues related to CI testing, project containerization, and chat UI enhancements. A new pull request was opened to address a bug in the knowledge panel's loading behavior. Concurrently, strategic discussions continued on the integration of new AI providers, specifically exploring pathways to support privacy-focused services like Venice AI.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWhile no major features were merged, work has been submitted to address user interface bugs.\n\n*   **Knowledge Panel Fix**\n    *   A new pull request ([#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/39)) was opened to fix a loading issue within the knowledge panel, aiming to improve UI stability.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management was a primary focus, with several important issues being closed while discussions on future integrations progressed.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:**\n    *   **Developer Experience & Tooling:** Two issues were resolved to improve the development environment. The `project-starter` was successfully dockerized ([#5842](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5842)), and the functionality of CLI CI tests was confirmed ([#5714](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5714)).\n    *   **UI Enhancements:** A feature to display the action called and its result directly in the chat UI was completed ([#5831](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5831)), increasing transparency for users.\n\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   No new issues were opened this week.\n    *   Discussion remains active on **\"Feature: Native Venice AI Provider Integration\"** ([#5820](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5820)). A recent comment suggests that support for privacy-focused, uncensored AI providers could be achieved by either modifying the base URL for the existing OpenAI plugin or by utilizing the dedicated Venice plugin, providing a potential path forward for this feature.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was evident in the ongoing strategic discussions shaping the project's architecture. The conversation around Venice AI integration ([#5820](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5820)) highlights community input on technical direction, with contributor `wtfsayo` suggesting a practical approach for implementation. This indicates active engagement from the community in planning for future capabilities."

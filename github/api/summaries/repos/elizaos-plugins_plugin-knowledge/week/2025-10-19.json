  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts centered on improving the plugin's deployment flexibility and addressing a critical stability issue. A significant new feature introduced a configurable plugin factory, enabling the plugin to operate in both `core` and `headless` modes for greater environmental adaptability. Concurrently, the team swiftly resolved a critical CLI module resolution error that was preventing users from running the tool after installation. The fix was identified as a package bundling issue and was promptly patched and released in version 1.6.3, restoring full functionality for users.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week focused on a single, impactful enhancement to the plugin's architecture.\n\n### **Enhanced Deployment Flexibility**\n- To support a wider range of use cases, the plugin factory was updated to be configurable with `core` and `headless` modes. This change allows the plugin to be deployed in different environments, such as servers without a graphical interface. The work, completed in [#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/44), also included updates to documentation and the addition of export tests to ensure the integrity of the new factory modes.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this week was focused on resolving a high-priority bug affecting the command-line interface.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** A critical bug ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6088)) causing a `Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'` error for users of the ElizaOS CLI was resolved. The root cause was traced to a bundling problem in the published npm package. A new version of the CLI (1.6.3) was released to correct the issue.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported this week, and no other major issues remain active based on the latest reports.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration was evident in the rapid response to the CLI bug ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6088)). The issue saw active discussion as the team worked to identify the problem, with community members participating in the process. Users provided valuable feedback by confirming that the fix in the newly released version 1.6.3 successfully resolved the problem, demonstrating a healthy feedback loop between the developers and the user community."

A significant issue with knowledge panel loading was fixed, ensuring more reliable access to information. As part of this update, an in-app PDF viewer was integrated, providing users with native document viewing capabilities, including zoom and reset controls, directly within the interface.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n### Knowledge Panel and PDF Viewer Enhancements\nWork this week focused on a dual bug-fix and feature-enhancement effort to improve how users interact with knowledge assets.\n- A bug preventing the knowledge panel from loading correctly was resolved.\n- A new in-app PDF viewer was introduced, allowing users to view documents without leaving the application. The viewer includes zoom and reset functionalities for better usability.\n- To improve the user experience when a document is not available, the viewer now displays a \"PDF Not Available\" message. This work was completed in PR [#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/39).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThere was no activity on the issue tracker this week. No new issues were opened, and no existing issues were closed.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe week was quiet in terms of community discussion and collaboration.

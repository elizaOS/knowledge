  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Weekly Report (Jul 20 - 26, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts focused on expanding the plugin's integration capabilities and addressing core infrastructure challenges. A significant development was the addition of Ollama as a supported provider, broadening the ecosystem of available models. Concurrently, work began on a major initiative to optimize the knowledge graph for improved performance. A critical logging compatibility issue affecting Bun builds was also tackled through a comprehensive migration to a new logging library, ensuring build stability without introducing breaking changes.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this period centered on new features and critical infrastructure improvements.\n\n*   **Provider Expansion**\n    *   Support for Ollama was integrated as a new provider for both `plugin-knowledge` and embeddings. This new feature expands the range of services and models available to users ([#34](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/34)).\n\n*   **Knowledge Graph Optimization**\n    *   Initial work has commenced on optimizing the knowledge graph. This new initiative, tracked in PR [#35](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/35), aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of knowledge storage and retrieval.\n\n*   **Logging System Migration for Build Compatibility**\n    *   To resolve a critical build error with `pino-pretty` in Bun environments, a migration from `pino` to `adze` was undertaken. The work, tracked in issue [#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5673), is now code-complete. An `ElizaLogger` wrapper class was created to maintain a `pino`-compatible API, preventing breaking changes across 182 files. The next steps involve final verification through testing and building.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n*   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened. The primary focus remains on active issue [#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5673), which addresses the logging library's incompatibility with Bun builds. A detailed plan has been executed, with the migration to `adze` now complete and pending final testing.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe provided daily reports did not contain specific information regarding community collaboration, contributor discussions, or team dynamics for this period."

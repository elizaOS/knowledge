  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Weekly Report (Dec 21 - 27, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's activity centered on enhancing the robustness of the platform's APIs and addressing user-facing issues. A significant new feature introduced configurable rate limiting for high-throughput APIs, providing greater control and stability. Concurrently, several new issues were opened and triaged, focusing on improving agent chat conversation management, fixing UI display bugs, and updating monorepo documentation. This reflects a dual focus on backend scalability and front-end user experience refinement.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThe primary development effort this period was focused on improving API performance and stability.\n\n### Enhanced API Rate Limiting\nA new feature was merged to add configurable rate limits for high-throughput APIs, enhancing system stability under heavy load. This update introduces settings for `MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`, `REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`, `TOKENS_PER_MINUTE`, and `BATCH_DELAY_MS`, along with an option to disable rate limiting entirely. As part of this change, the default limits for high-throughput APIs were increased fivefold to better accommodate demanding use cases ([#49](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/49)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed this week. However, several new issues were opened and moved into the active state, with initial planning already underway.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:** No issues were resolved in this period.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** Four new issues were opened and are now active:\n    -   **Agent Chat Behavior:** Two issues were reported concerning agent conversation management. One addresses the need for agent chats to open the most recent conversation ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6281)), while the other flags a bug where conversations are duplicated when switching between agents ([#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6282)).\n    -   **UI and Documentation:** A UI bug causing spacing problems in numbered lists was identified ([#6283](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6283)). A task was also created to fix the monorepo documentation ([#6284](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6284)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe triage process for all newly opened issues ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6281), [#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6282), [#6283](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6283), [#6284](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6284)) demonstrated a workflow leveraging AI tooling. CodeRabbit AI provided auto-generated issue plans, suggested potential assignees, and linked to related issues or pull requests. This indicates an established process for accelerating initial issue analysis and planning."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's development focused on enhancing agent capabilities within the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. A new feature was introduced to improve how agents identify and select reference documents, making context utilization more efficient. Concurrently, a bug was reported and acknowledged concerning incorrect date displays on user profile summaries, which has been flagged for investigation.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n### RAG System Enhancements\nTo improve how agents interact with available knowledge, a new static provider was implemented to list RAG documents ([#45](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/45)). This feature allows agents to see document metadata—such as filename, type, and size—without loading the full content, enabling more efficient identification of relevant materials.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n### New & Active Issues\n- A bug was reported where weekly summary dates on user profiles are displaying incorrectly, showing \"13th-19th July 2025\" for most users. The team has acknowledged this issue and will investigate a fix ([#168](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/168)).\n\n### Closed Issues\nNo issues were closed during this period.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports for this week did not contain specific details on community collaboration, such as high-discussion pull requests or new contributor activity."

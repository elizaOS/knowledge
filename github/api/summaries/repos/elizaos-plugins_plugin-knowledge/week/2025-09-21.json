The primary achievement was a significant upgrade of the AI SDK dependencies to their v2 versions, ensuring the plugin remains compatible with the latest provider libraries. In parallel, the entire test suite was migrated from Vitest to the Bun test framework, aiming to streamline the testing process and improve performance. While the week was quiet in terms of new features or bug fixes, this foundational work is crucial for future development and stability.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nAll development activity this week was consolidated into a single effort to upgrade the project's tooling and dependencies.\n\n- **Infrastructure and Dependency Modernization:** A major update was completed to bring the project's dependencies and testing framework up to date. This involved upgrading the AI SDK packages for `@ai-sdk/anthropic`, `@ai-sdk/google`, and `@ai-sdk/openai` from v1 to v2. To maintain compatibility, the `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider` was also updated. As part of this refactoring, the test suite was migrated from Vitest to Bun, leveraging its integrated capabilities for a more streamlined testing process ([#40](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/40)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThere was no activity related to issues this week.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, and there were no notable discussions on existing issues.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nBased on the development reports, this was a quiet week for community interaction.

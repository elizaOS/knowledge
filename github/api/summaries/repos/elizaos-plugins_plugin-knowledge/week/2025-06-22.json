  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge Weekly Report (Jun 22 - 28, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week, development focused on enhancing the core stability and data integrity of the knowledge plugin. Key bug fixes were merged to resolve critical file upload errors ([#25](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/25)) and prevent duplicate data entries by implementing deterministic IDs ([#27](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/27)). Concurrently, significant community discussion centered on user experience challenges, including difficulties with custom plugin development, project setup, and deployment strategies. These conversations have spurred new initiatives around improving documentation and creating standardized deployment guides for platforms like Railway and Render.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on improving the reliability of the knowledge plugin's core functionalities.\n\n- **File Handling and Data Integrity:**\n  - A critical bug causing \"Unexpected end of form\" errors during file uploads was fixed by removing duplicate middleware processing ([#25](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/25)).\n  - To improve data consistency, deterministic IDs were implemented to prevent the creation of duplicate document and knowledge items ([#27](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/27)).\n  - Following the file upload fixes, a new pull request was opened to roll back the underlying library to Multer, suggesting ongoing refinement in this area ([#28](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/28)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe community was highly active in reporting and diagnosing issues, highlighting key areas for improvement in the broader ElizaOS ecosystem.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  - A configuration issue causing a \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\" error was resolved. The fix involved correctly adding `@elizaos/plugin-openai` to the agent's character file, allowing the agent to function as expected ([#5279](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5279)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - **Plugin Development & Functionality:** A major theme this week was the difficulty in developing and running custom plugins. Users reported a `ZodError` when the knowledge context is enabled ([#26](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/26)), interference from the `ATTACHMENTS` provider on custom callbacks ([#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/4947)), and challenges getting on-chain agents to use plugins consistently ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5260)).\n  - **Deployment and Setup:** Users opened new issues detailing significant difficulties in setting up projects from scratch ([#5249](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5249)) and seeking best practices for deploying custom agents ([#5244](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5244)).\n  - **API and Documentation:** An investigation into \"API endpoint not found\" errors ([#5230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5230)) concluded that the cause is likely deployment or configuration issues, not missing endpoints. This, along with other feedback, reinforced the need for a documentation overhaul to create separate tracks for users and developers ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5234)).\n  - **Client-Side Bugs:** An ongoing issue with the web client displaying an incorrect version number (`v1.0.10` instead of `v1.0.11`) persists, reportedly causing UI freezes and excessive API requests ([#4924](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/4924)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThis week saw strong collaborative efforts between maintainers and the community to diagnose complex issues.\n- In issue [#5230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5230), a detailed analysis from user `claude` provided a comprehensive breakdown of potential root causes for API errors, shifting the focus from code bugs to environmental configuration.\n- The discussion around deployment strategies ([#5244](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5244)) was a highlight of community collaboration, with users `wtfsayo` and `claude` suggesting platforms and `bealers` offering their \"elizify\" project as a one-click installation solution.\n- Users like `gnomonprime` provided valuable insights into the root causes of issues with the Twitter plugin ([#26](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/26), [#29](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/29)), demonstrating a technically engaged user base actively contributing to problem-solving."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai Daily Update (Oct 9, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day's development focused on addressing a critical import issue within the `@elizaos/core` package, specifically concerning version 1.6.1, which was identified as having malformed TypeScript declaration files. A new pull request was also opened to enhance voice features by handling Buffer and Node.js streams.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Addressing Core Package Import Issues\nA significant issue regarding imports not being found in `index.ts` with Eliza CLI 1.61 was thoroughly investigated and ultimately resolved. The root cause was identified as missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1. Users are advised to upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later to avoid this problem. The ElizaOS team is considering deprecating v1.6.1 and implementing publish-time validation to prevent similar issues in the future. [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6031)\n\n### Enhancing Voice Feature Compatibility\nA new pull request has been opened to improve the plugin's voice features by adding support for Buffer and Node.js streams. This enhancement aims to provide more flexible and robust handling of audio data for voice-related functionalities. [#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/18)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- **fix: handle Buffer and Node.js streams for voice features** ([#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/18)): This pull request aims to improve the plugin's voice capabilities by allowing it to process audio data from Buffer and Node.js streams, enhancing flexibility for various voice-related operations.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Resolution of Core Package Import Errors\nThe issue \"Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61\" ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6031)) was closed today. The problem was diagnosed as a build/publish pipeline issue specific to `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1, where TypeScript declaration files were missing or malformed. The resolution involves users upgrading to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later, as the issue was not related to user configuration but rather a faulty package release.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n- None\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6031))\nThe discussion on this issue concluded with the identification of the root cause: `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1 was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files. The issue was confirmed to be version-specific and environment-independent. A user, matteo-brandolino, reported that a clean reinstall resolved the type errors, suggesting that the problem was indeed with the package itself rather than their local setup. wtfsayo confirmed that no specific fix was made on their end, attributing the resolution to node/package type resolution issues. Recommendations include upgrading to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later, considering deprecating v1.6.1, and adding publish-time validation to prevent future occurrences."

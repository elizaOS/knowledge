  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai Daily Update (Dec 23, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, the `plugin-openai` repository saw the addition of streaming support for text generation, a significant feature enhancement. This update also included new tests to ensure stability.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Text Generation with Streaming Support\nStreaming support for text generation was added, allowing for real-time output delivery as content is produced. This feature is dependent on a merge in the main ElizaOS repository. ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21))\n\n### Core Module Updates\nSeveral core modules, including `src/models` and `src/utils`, were updated as part of the streaming support implementation. This involved changes to `bun.lock`, `package.json`, `src/index.ts`, `src/models/text.ts`, `src/models/audio.ts`, `src/models/image.ts`, `src/models/object.ts`, `src/utils/config.ts`, and `src/utils/events.ts`. ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### User Experience Enhancements\nTwo new issues were opened today focusing on improving the user experience. These include a request to summarize chat names for better organization ([#6278](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6278)) and the addition of a feedback button to allow users to submit feedback ([#6280](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6280)). Both issues have initial comments from CodeRabbit AI, providing an auto-generated plan mode for implementation.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues have more than 3 comments."

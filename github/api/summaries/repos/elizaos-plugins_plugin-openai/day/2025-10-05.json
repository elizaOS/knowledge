A new pull request was opened to add Renovate configuration. Discussions continued on an active issue regarding import errors with Eliza CLI 1.61.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request, [#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/17), was opened to add Renovate configuration, which automates dependency updates.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.61\nDiscussions continued on [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6031) regarding import errors in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61.\n- **matteo-brandolino** suggested on October 5th that the issue might stem from missing type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically referencing source files that may not be included in the published package. They noted that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the problem, suggesting a potential bug specific to version 1.6.1.\n- **0xbbjoker** previously suggested running `bun x tsc --noEmit` to diagnose the issue, indicating it might be an IDE TSC compiler problem as they could not reproduce it with a fresh installation."

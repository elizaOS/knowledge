  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai Daily Update (Oct 29, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on a significant refactoring of the OpenAI plugin into a modular architecture, alongside a crucial bug fix for tokenization utility.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Modular Architecture Refactor\nThe OpenAI plugin underwent a major refactoring, transforming a monolithic 1,253-line file into a well-organized modular structure. This change aligns the plugin with the established `plugin-openrouter` pattern, splitting responsibilities into focused modules for improved maintainability and scalability. ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/19))\n\n### Tokenization Utility Fix\nA TypeScript type error in the tokenization utility was resolved. The fix ensures correct tokenization fallback by utilizing `getEncoding` with `TiktokenEncoding` and bumps the version to 1.5.18. ([#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/20))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

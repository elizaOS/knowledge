  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai Weekly Report (Dec 21 - 27, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's development was centered on a significant feature enhancement for the OpenAI plugin. The primary achievement was the addition of streaming support for text generation, enabling real-time content delivery. This core update required modifications to several modules and is now awaiting integration with the main ElizaOS repository. Concurrently, new issues were opened to improve user experience, focusing on chat organization and user feedback mechanisms.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThe main development effort this week focused on improving the text generation capabilities of the plugin.\n\n- **Streaming Support for Text Generation:** A major update introduced streaming support for text generation, allowing the plugin to deliver output as it is being generated rather than waiting for the full response. This work, captured in PR [#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21), involved updates to core modules including `src/models` and `src/utils`. Full integration of this feature is pending a corresponding merge in the main ElizaOS repository.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this week focused on capturing new user experience enhancements, with no issues being closed.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed during this period.\n- **New & Active Issues:** Two new issues were opened to improve the user experience. Issue [#6278](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6278) proposes summarizing chat names for better organization, while [#6280](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/issues/6280) requests the addition of a user feedback button. Both issues received initial planning comments from CodeRabbit AI, indicating an automated triage process is in place.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nBased on the available data, collaboration this week was characterized by focused, feature-driven development. The introduction of new user-centric issues suggests a feedback loop is being established. The use of CodeRabbit AI on new issues points to the project's reliance on automated tooling to streamline the initial stages of issue management and implementation planning."

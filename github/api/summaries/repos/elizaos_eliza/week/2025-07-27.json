A major initiative to standardize all documentation and testing on `bun:test` was completed, enhancing codebase uniformity. Significant progress was made in clearing backlogs, with the closure of a comprehensive documentation review, several video production tasks, and a batch of plugin-related issues. Looking forward, new work has been proposed to enhance CLI tooling, introduce character-based model configurations, and improve the plugin development lifecycle, signaling a continued focus on both core functionality and usability.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThe primary completed work this week focused on improving the quality and consistency of the project's documentation and testing foundation.\n\n- **Documentation and Testing Standardization:** A key pull request was merged to standardize all project documentation and tests to exclusively use `bun:test` ([#5681](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5681)). This effort ensures a consistent testing framework across all packages, from the `cli` and `client` to `core` and `docs`. A minor typo in the documentation was also corrected ([#5679](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5679)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe week saw a significant cleanup of outstanding issues alongside the introduction of new items targeting developer experience and plugin functionality.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n    - **Documentation & Content:** A major \"Full Docs Nitpick Review\" was completed, marking a milestone in documentation quality ([#5665](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5665)). Progress on community-facing content was also evident with the closure of issues for introductory videos on the CLI, first agents, and multi-agent setups ([#5666](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5666), [#5667](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5667), [#5668](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5668)).\n    - **Plugin Maintenance:** A batch of issues for the `aave`, `clanker`, `defi-llama`, and `moon-well` plugins were resolved ([#5645](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5645), [#5646](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5646), [#5647](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5647), [#5648](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5648)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - **Developer Experience:** New issues were opened to address friction in the development workflow, including a problem with the `elizaos dev` command in plugin folders ([#5687](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5687)) and missing or incorrect CI configurations for plugin deployment ([#5690](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5690), [#5691](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5691)).\n    - **Plugin & Agent Functionality:** A significant new issue was created to track enhancements for the plugin autocoder, involving workflows, prompt engineering, and test validation ([#5685](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza"

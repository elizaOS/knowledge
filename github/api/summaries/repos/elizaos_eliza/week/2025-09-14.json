  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Sep 14 - 20, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week was characterized by a strong focus on stability, bug fixing, and enhancing the developer experience. Significant effort was dedicated to improving the Command Line Interface (CLI), particularly by resolving cross-platform compatibility issues on Windows and refining the update notification mechanism. Key plugins and project templates received critical fixes, while CI/CD workflows were optimized for better efficiency. The team also wrapped up preparations for the ETH Tokyo Workshop, clearing the way for new technical initiatives, including a proposed major cleanup of the core build system.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on hardening existing systems and improving reliability across the framework.\n\n- **CLI Stability and Cross-Platform Improvements:** A major push was made to enhance the CLI's robustness. This included comprehensive fixes for Windows CI tests, such as resolving issues with file paths and process management ([#5982], [#5981]). The `elizaos dev` command was also improved for better detection of client development servers in complex repository structures ([#5979]), and redundant migration steps during agent startup were addressed ([#5978]).\n\n- **Refined Update Mechanism and Build Process:** The CLI's update checker was fixed to correctly respect a user's distribution channel (e.g., stable, alpha), preventing inappropriate update prompts ([#5980]). The overall build process was strengthened through fixes for client bundling, dev-loop restarts, and stricter TypeScript type-checking to prevent builds with errors ([#5985]).\n\n- **Plugin and Template Fixes:** Several bugs impacting usability were resolved. An issue preventing images from the OpenRouter plugin from displaying in the web client was fixed by transforming file paths to API URLs ([#5890]). The SQL plugin received a missing `uuid` dependency ([#5977]), and project starter templates were updated to allow JSON imports, fixing a common compilation failure ([#5975]).\n\n- **CI/CD Enhancements:** To improve resource management and ensure code reviews are always current, concurrency control was added to the Claude code review workflow. This change automatically cancels previous runs when new commits are pushed to a pull request ([#5984]).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this week saw the resolution of key tasks and the introduction of significant new technical debt cleanup efforts.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** The primary task completed was the preparation for the ETH Tokyo Workshop ([#5955]), marking the end of that initiative. The issue of users on stable channels receiving update notifications for alpha versions ([#5971]) was also addressed and fixed.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - **Core Refactor:** A significant new issue was opened to undertake a full cleanup of the `/core` package, aiming to remove all hacks and forks, deliver a pure JS/TS build, and validate it across Node, Bun, and browser environments ([#5976]).\n    - **Documentation:** A new task was created to integrate the `build.eliza` page into the main documentation ([#5974]).\n    - **Ongoing Bugs:** A long-standing error (\"Failed query: insert into 'memories'\") when using the Twitter plugin with a SQL database ([#39]) remains active, with users continuing to report the problem and maintainers requesting details to reproduce it.\n    - **Community Discussion:** A debate continues in [#5857] regarding the perceived lack of documentation for the Web UI dashboard, highlighting a disconnect between user experience and maintainer assertions.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was evident in the focused effort to tackle stability issues. The discussion around the alpha update notifications in [#5971] showed a quick feedback loop, with `standujar` acknowledging the issue and implementing a fix. Active user-maintainer dialogue was also visible in the ongoing Twitter/SQL bug ([#39]), where maintainers are actively trying to gather information from affected users. The debate over documentation in [#5857] indicates an engaged community that is vocal about user experience, providing valuable, albeit critical, feedback to the project maintainers."

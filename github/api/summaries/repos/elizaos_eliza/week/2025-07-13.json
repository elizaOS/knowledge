  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week was characterized by a strong focus on enhancing core stability and improving the developer experience. The team successfully modernized core APIs by migrating from Node.js EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget, boosting performance and runtime compatibility. A significant number of critical bugs in the CLI and build process were resolved, leading to a more reliable development environment. Concurrently, major architectural groundwork was laid for future capabilities, including a detailed plan for a new Scenario Runner and a proposed solution for direct agent-to-agent communication. While internal systems saw marked improvement, persistent issues with the Twitter plugin remain a key challenge for the community.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on strengthening the framework's foundation, from the command line to the core APIs.\n\n-   **CLI Stability and Developer Experience:** The command-line interface received numerous fixes to improve usability. Key updates include ensuring the `elizaos start` command automatically builds the project ([#5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504)), implementing graceful shutdown for the `dev` server ([#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562)), and resolving a critical bug that prevented plugin actions from loading in published NPM packages ([#5624](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5624)). A new backend-only plugin template was also introduced to streamline development ([#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589]), and a bug causing incorrect `.elizadb` directory inheritance in nested projects was fixed ([#5618](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5618)).\n\n-   **Core API Modernization and Type Safety:** A significant refactoring effort saw the migration from Node.js EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget API, enhancing performance and ensuring future compatibility ([#5609](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5609]). This migration included comprehensive unit tests to maintain backward compatibility ([#5613](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5613]) and improvements to type safety by replacing `any` with more specific types ([#5611](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5611]). A new feature introduced standardized service types and a `getServicesByType()` method, improving modularity and extensibility ([#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565)).\n\n-   **Build and Module System Enhancements:** The build process was made more robust by fixing an issue where `tsup` would incorrectly wipe `vite` builds ([#5555](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5555]). The `ModuleLoader` was enhanced to ensure consistent local-first module resolution, mirroring server manager guarantees ([#5629](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5629]). To improve compatibility with the Bun runtime, the `node-fetch` dependency was removed from the bootstrap plugin in favor of Bun's native fetch ([#5607](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5607)).\n\n-   **Automation and Integration:** The Claude code review workflow was enhanced to run on every commit to a PR and was granted full bash and GitHub CLI access, expanding automation capabilities ([#5570](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5570]). Database reliability was improved with a fix for advisory lock acquisition in the SQL plugin ([#5572](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5572)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this week highlighted a mix of resolving long-standing bugs, planning major new features, and grappling with persistent external integration problems.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:** A significant number of bugs affecting the developer workflow were resolved. This includes fixes for the `elizaos start` command not building the project ([#5497](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5497]), incorrect directory handling during project creation ([#5606](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/issues/5606)), and various CLI versioning and plugin loading errors ([#4924](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4924), [#4997](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4997)). The completion of the v1-to-v2 character migrator ([#5452](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5452)) and the implementation of the service type system ([#4914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914)) marked the closure of important feature issues.\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   **Scenario Runner:** A major new feature was scoped out with a series of issues ([#5573](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5573) - [#5579](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5579)) detailing the creation of an `elizaos scenario run` command for sandboxed testing and evaluation.\n    -   **Agent-to-Agent Communication:** A highly active discussion ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584)) resulted in a comprehensive proposal for direct, synchronous communication between agents via a new OpenAI-compatible API endpoint, aiming to eliminate polling.\n    -   **Plugin and Agent Creation Bugs:** New issues were reported concerning agent creation failures on Windows ([#5603](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5603), [#5617](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5617]) and challenges with custom plugin schema migrations ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588]).\n    -   **Twitter Plugin Blocker:** The Twitter plugin continues to be a source of problems for users, with multiple active issues ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/31), [#38](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/38), [#39](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/39)) reporting initialization errors, API rate limits, and database insertion failures. These issues are a significant blocker for users wanting to build Twitter-integrated agents.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThis week saw strong collaborative engagement on several fronts. The detailed proposals and in-depth analysis within issues like agent-to-agent communication ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584)) and plugin schema migrations ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588)) demonstrate a deeply involved community working through complex architectural challenges. The use of AI-assisted analysis, noted as \"Claude\" in issue discussions, appears to be an integral part of the development and triage process. Furthermore, the consistent \"+1\" comments and follow-up reports from multiple users on the Twitter plugin issues highlight an active user base that is engaged in reporting and tracking bugs."

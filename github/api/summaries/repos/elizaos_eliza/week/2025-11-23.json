  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Nov 23 - 29, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's activity was characterized by foundational improvements to the core framework and a significant influx of new issues aimed at enhancing the user experience. A critical bug in the core TypeScript declarations was resolved, improving type-checking stability. Concurrently, a new effort began to standardize logging across major components. The majority of the week's focus, however, was on planning future work, with a large volume of new issues opened to refine the Agent Builder, streamline the UI, and expand payment options, including Stripe and crypto integration.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week focused on improving the stability and maintainability of the core system.\n\n- **Core Infrastructure and Stability:** A critical bug causing build failures with `instanceof` checks on generic types was fixed by introducing an `isPlainObject` type guard in `runtime.ts` ([#6170](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6170)). Separately, a new refactoring effort was initiated to standardize logging across the Core, CLI, and Server components, aiming for more consistent and manageable log output ([#6169](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6169)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:** A key security-related issue concerning entity-level Row-Level Security (RLS) was closed, marking a resolution to that problem ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** A substantial number of new issues were opened, outlining a clear roadmap for near-term development focused on user-facing features and usability. Key themes include:\n    - **Agent Builder & Studio Enhancements:** A series of proposals were made to improve the agent creation process, including optimizing model selection speed, fixing media tab functionality, and adding toggles to manage agent capabilities for faster responses ([#6185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6185), [#6186](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6186), [#6190](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6190)).\n    - **UI/UX and Navigation:** Several issues target a cleaner user interface by consolidating navigation, decluttering the sidebar, and creating a distinct visual theme for \"Build Mode\" ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173), [#6174](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6174), [#6176](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6176)).\n    - **Payment System Expansion:** New feature requests were filed to integrate Stripe Checkout for billing, enable crypto payments for credits, and improve the UI for credit balance display ([#6184](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6184), [#6191](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6191), [#6177](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6177)).\n    - **API Integration:** A user-requested feature was opened to add an OpenAI-compatible API option, allowing for more flexible model hosting beyond OpenRouter ([#6168](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6168)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity interaction was evident this week through a user-driven feature request for an OpenAI-compatible API ([#6168](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6168)), which prompted a clarifying question from a team member. While a large number of new issues were created, the reports indicate no issues with more than three comments, suggesting that extensive public discussion has not yet begun on these new items. The influx of issues primarily focuses on improving the end-user and developer experience, signaling a strong feedback loop between users and the development team."

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Dec 28 - 3, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week was characterized by a dual focus on enhancing core stability and refining the user experience. Key developments included a critical fix to ensure all streaming LLM calls are logged to the database, modernization of the CLI toolchain to use Bun-native processes, and standardization of server routes. On the frontend, significant progress was made in resolving bugs and improving the agent chat interface, from fixing conversation duplication to implementing chat renaming. The week also saw the opening of several forward-looking issues that signal a push towards more advanced architectural patterns, including Chain-of-Thought reasoning and a major refactor of the messaging API.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week focused on improving backend reliability, modernizing the development environment, and enhancing documentation.\n\n- **Core Runtime & Backend Stability:**\n  - A critical bug was fixed where streaming LLM calls were not being logged, ensuring complete and accurate recording of agent interactions ([#6296](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6296)).\n  - Server message routes were standardized to align with the `api-client`, resolving inconsistencies that caused calls to non-existent routes and improving overall system reliability ([#6285](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6285)).\n\n- **CLI Toolchain Modernization:**\n  - In a move to align with project guidelines and improve performance, outdated process execution libraries (`execa`, `child_process`) were replaced with Bun-native alternatives like `Bun.spawn` across the CLI toolchain ([#6289](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6289)).\n\n- **Documentation Enhancements:**\n  - The project's documentation received significant updates. A comprehensive README was added for the `@elizaos/plugin-dummy-services` package ([#6290](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6290)).\n  - Installation instructions were updated, broken links were fixed, and important flags were added to the build system documentation to improve the developer onboarding experience ([#6288](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6288)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this week focused on closing out numerous UI/UX bugs while opening new discussions on significant architectural improvements for the future.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  - **Agent Conversation & UI:** A major effort was made to improve the chat experience. Closed issues include a fix for duplicated conversations when switching agents ([#6282](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6282)), ensuring clicks on an agent open the most recent chat ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6281), [#6295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6295)), and implementing chat renaming functionality ([#6278](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6278)).\n  - **Dashboard & User Feedback:** The dashboard was cleaned up by removing an unnecessary token button ([#6287](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6287]), and a new feedback button was added to improve user engagement ([#6280](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6280)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - **Future Architecture:** Several significant issues were opened, pointing to the project's next evolution. These include a proposal to add core support for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning streaming ([#6294](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6294)), a discussion on implementing advanced TypeScript patterns like decorators and dependency injection ([#6292](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6292)), and a call to refactor the messaging API to address architectural flaws like message double-processing ([#6298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6298)).\n  - **Ongoing Support:** The discussion on wallet connection challenges for migration ([#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211)) remains active, with community members providing detailed potential solutions for users struggling with the process.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nWhile no new contributors were explicitly mentioned, collaboration was evident in the active support provided on community-facing issues. The ongoing discussion in issue [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211) shows a healthy dynamic of users helping one another with detailed troubleshooting steps. The creation of several high-level architectural issues ([#6292](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6292), [#6294](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6294), [#6298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6298)) suggests active strategic planning among core team members. Furthermore, new pull requests for backend hot reloading ([#6293](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6293)) and unified communication hooks ([#6300](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300)) indicate that work is underway to improve the developer workflow, setting the stage for future collaboration."

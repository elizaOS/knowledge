A large batch of issues targeting the agent builder UI, dashboard loading times, and core platform functionality were resolved with impressive speed. A key technical achievement was the introduction of generic type support for custom event handlers, enhancing type safety and the developer experience for plugins ([#6277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6277)). While development focused heavily on closing existing issues, new reports toward the end of the week have shifted focus to improving agent chat behavior and fixing related bugs.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThe week's primary completed code contribution focused on improving the core framework's robustness and developer experience.\n\n- **Core Runtime Enhancement:** A significant improvement was merged to add generic type support for custom event handlers in the core runtime ([#6277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6277)). This change allows plugins to define typed event payloads, which improves type safety and code clarity when developing custom events. A new pull request was also opened to improve message service handlers for asynchronous operations and cloud optimization ([#6279](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6279)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe week saw a rapid cycle of issue identification and resolution, particularly around the user interface and platform performance.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** A substantial number of issues were closed, reflecting a major effort to improve the platform's front-end and backend.\n    - **Agent Builder & UI/UX:** A large set of recently opened issues to refine the agent builder were resolved. This included moving the avatar button ([#6273](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6273)), ensuring a consistent \"Create Agent\" button ([#6274](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6274)), adding a warning for unsaved changes ([#6275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6275)), and implementing smaller refinements like tooltips and inline buttons ([#6270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6270), [#6271](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6271)).\n    - **Dashboard & Performance:** Several critical performance and design issues were addressed. Work was completed to reduce long dashboard loading times ([#6248](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6248)), test database performance improvements ([#6250](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6250)), and redesign the dashboard as the primary landing experience ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n    - **Platform Functionality:** Key platform-level issues were resolved, including replacing polling with true SSE streaming ([#5930](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5930)), fixing a MessageBusService error that prevented agents from responding ([#6140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6140)), and improving the smoothness of agent responses ([#6269](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6269)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** New issues opened this week point to the next areas of focus.\n    - **Agent Chat Behavior:** Several new bugs were reported related to the chat experience, including conversations being duplicated when switching between agents ([#6282](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6282)) and chat not opening the most recent conversation from the dashboard ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6281)).\n    - **User Experience & Feedback:** New issues were created to add a user feedback button ([#6280](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6280)) and to address a user's concern about a long wait for account recovery ([#6267](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6267)).\n    - **Documentation:** Efforts to improve documentation continue with a new issue to fix the monorepo setup guide ([#6284](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6284)) and a new PR to update Cursor/Twitter agent docs ([#6265](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6265)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThis week demonstrated a highly efficient and responsive development cycle. A large cluster of UI/UX issues for the agent builder were identified on December 22nd and were subsequently resolved and closed by the next day. This rapid turnaround from issue identification to resolution suggests a tight feedback loop and clear prioritization within the"

Significant effort was directed toward competitive research and strategic planning for multi-platform messaging infrastructure, including Discord, Telegram, and WhatsApp integrations. The project also unblocked development by resolving AI Gateway credit issues and began exploring advanced automation layers via N8N integration and serverless multi-tenant support.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThe week’s technical work centered on fixing critical CLI pathing issues and establishing the foundational security and infrastructure for the upcoming Eliza App.\n\n### Core CLI & Framework Fixes\n- **Project Generation Restoration:** Resolved a critical failure in the `elizaos create` command caused by a broken wrapper. A temporary fix was deployed via `bun -i g @elizaos/cli` while a permanent fix was implemented ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388)).\n- **Import Pathing:** Updated `elizaos.js` to use package aliases for import statements, ensuring more robust pathing across different environments ([#6389](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6389)).\n\n### Infrastructure & Security\n- **Security Documentation:** Initiated the creation of a `SECURITY.md` file to establish formal vulnerability reporting protocols ([#6428](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6428)).\n- **AI Inference Unblocked:** Successfully topped up AI Gateway credits, resolving a total block on AI inference and development tasks ([#6393](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6393)).\n- **Plugin Capabilities:** Finalized the integration of the **GitHub Plugin** for repository management ([#6406](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6406)) and the **Code Execution Plugin**, which allows agents to write and run code natively ([#6408](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6408)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe project saw a surge in new issues related to the strategic shift toward a consumer-facing application and expanded plugin ecosystem.\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **Competitor Research:** The team completed deep-dive analyses into Claudebot and the Poke app to inform the Eliza App's onboarding and user experience ([#6394](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6394), [#6395](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6395)).\n- **QA Readiness:** Recruitment for consumer testers was finalized, setting the stage for a structured bug backlog and user feedback loop ([#6420](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6420)).\n\n### New & Active Issues\n- **Messaging Infrastructure:** Extensive planning is underway for a generic webhook service to handle stateless messaging (WhatsApp, Telegram, Twilio) and an N8N workflow engine integration for complex automation ([#6429](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6429), [#6430](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6430)).\n- **Performance Bottlenecks:** A 3-second initialization delay for MCP plugins on Vercel was identified as a priority for investigation, likely related to WebSocket handshakes ([#6432](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6432)).\n- **UX & Onboarding:** New initiatives were launched to fix redirect issues during sign-in ([#6392](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6392)) and to implement \"Poke-style\" conversation-based onboarding ([#6413](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6413)).\n- **Model Alignment:** Discussions are ongoing regarding model naming conventions to ensure \"Ultra\" correctly maps to \"Opus\" and \"Pro\" to \"Sonnet\" ([#6390](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6390)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was characterized by rapid troubleshooting and cross-functional research. The resolution of the `elizaos create` issue ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388)) showcased tight coordination between users and maintainers, with `standujar` providing immediate workarounds and linking subsequent PRs for documentation and code fixes. The team-wide participation in competitive research indicates a highly synchronized effort to align the project's roadmap with market standards for AI agent experiences. Significant planning for multi-tenant support and secrets management ([#6410](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6410)) suggests the contributor base is preparing for a more complex, service-oriented architecture."

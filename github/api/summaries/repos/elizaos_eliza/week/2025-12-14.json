Key technical work centered on critical bug fixes, including a robust optimization of the SQL plugin to ensure smooth schema migrations for users updating from older versions. Concurrently, a large volume of new issues were opened, outlining a comprehensive roadmap for a major UI/UX overhaul. This initiative aims to simplify the user journey, from onboarding and agent creation to replacing technical jargon with more accessible language, signaling a clear focus on usability and broader adoption.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWhile no new features were merged, crucial work was completed to improve the stability and reliability of the core system and its development environment.\n\n- **SQL Plugin Migration and Optimization:** To ensure backward compatibility and a seamless update process, the SQL plugin was enhanced to handle smooth data migration from pre-1.6.5 (camelCase) schemas to the current standard ([#6215](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6215)). This effort also included optimizations for Row-Level Security (RLS) handling and the addition of comprehensive test coverage to guarantee idempotency.\n\n- **CLI and Testing Infrastructure Fixes:** Development reliability was improved by addressing test failures. A key fix resolved an API signature mismatch in the CLI's end-to-end tests that was causing command failures ([#6207](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6207)). Additionally, a unit test mock function was corrected to ensure accurate character retrieval testing.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe week saw a flurry of activity in issue tracking, with a clear emphasis on planning future work related to user experience and new capabilities.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** Two recently opened UI issues were quickly resolved, improving the plugin selection process. The changes provide better visual feedback on selection ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235)) and implement a more intuitive toggle behavior, replacing the previous plus button ([#6236](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6236)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** A significant number of new issues were created, collectively forming a detailed plan for a user-centric redesign. Key themes include:\n    - **Onboarding and Dashboard:** Proposals to redesign the dashboard to prioritize agent creation ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222), [#6225](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6225)) and implement guided onboarding overlays for new users ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221)).\n    - **Simplifying Terminology:** A concerted effort to improve accessibility by replacing technical terms in the UI, such as \"Knowledge\" with \"Files\" ([#6237](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6237]), removing \"RAG\" in favor of plain language ([#6240](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6240)), and using \"Services\" instead of \"MCP\" ([#6241](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6241)).\n    - **Agent Management UX:** Numerous suggestions were made to streamline agent interaction, including renaming \"Save\" to \"Deploy\" ([#6232](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6232]), adding quick-action menus to agent cards ([#6234](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6234)), and improving the file upload process ([#6238](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6238)).\n    - **Future Capabilities:** Planning for major new features has begun, with issues opened to implement web search functionality ([#6246](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6246)) and to create a guide for AI agent payments ([#6244](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6244)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports do not indicate a high degree of discussion on specific PRs or issues. However, the large, coordinated creation of dozens of UI/UX-focused issues on a single day suggests a focused product or design review session occurred. This activity has generated a clear and detailed backlog for upcoming development sprints. The rapid closure of two UI issues just a day after their creation demonstrates a responsive and agile development process."

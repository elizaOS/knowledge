  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Sep 21 - 27, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts centered on enhancing system stability and improving the developer experience. Key achievements include resolving a critical infinite restart loop in the CLI, stabilizing Docker image builds within the CI pipeline, and addressing a significant plugin loading failure. A community-reported issue concerning the `zod` dependency was swiftly investigated and resolved by upgrading the library across the project. These targeted fixes and updates have resulted in a more robust, reliable, and maintainable development environment for all contributors.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week focused on bug fixes, dependency management, and strengthening the CI/CD pipeline.\n\n- **Build & CI/CD Stability**\n  - The CI pipeline for Docker image builds was significantly stabilized by pinning the Bun version, enabling Buildx with caching, and adding better diagnostics and cleanup steps ([#5997](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5997)).\n  - Issues with TypeScript declaration generation were resolved by adjusting build configurations, ensuring more reliable type builds for the server ([#5993](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5993)).\n\n- **Dependency Management**\n  - The Zod validation library was upgraded to its latest major version across the CLI, Core, plugins, and starter templates. This addresses a critical plugin loading issue and modernizes the project's validation capabilities ([#5994](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5994)).\n\n- **Bug Fixes & Developer Experience**\n  - A critical bug causing an infinite development restart loop in the CLI was fixed by adding recursion prevention and improving client directory detection ([#5991](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5991)).\n  - The environment variable for the PGLite data directory was standardized across examples, the CLI, and the SQL plugin, improving configuration consistency ([#5987](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5987)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  - An issue where Discord DM functionality stopped working was resolved. The problem was traced to missing channel configurations in the `.env` file, and adding them restored the expected behavior ([#5810](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5810)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - A significant new issue was reported where multiple plugins failed to load due to a problem with `zod/v4` after an update ([#5995](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5995)). Community discussion confirmed the issue persisted even on clean installs. This report was a key driver for the Zod dependency upgrade ([#5994](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5994)), which has since addressed the problem.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThis week highlighted a positive and effective feedback loop between the community and project maintainers. The detailed report of the `zod/v4` plugin loading failure in issue [#5995](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5995), including confirmation that the bug affected clean installations, provided crucial information. This user-provided context enabled a swift response, leading directly to the Zod upgrade in PR [#5994](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5994) and resolving the issue for the wider community."

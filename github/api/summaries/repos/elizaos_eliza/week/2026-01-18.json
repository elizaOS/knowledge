Significant progress was made in defining the ecosystem's social layer through new agent discovery and public linking standards. Key technical milestones included the introduction of a dynamic execution engine prototype and the resolution of a critical race condition in credit management. These efforts reflect a dual focus on architectural evolution and the refinement of the user-facing ElizaCloud experience.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Core Architecture & V2.0.0 Evolution\nThe project is moving toward a more flexible core with the introduction of a dynamic execution engine for V2.0.0 ([#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384)). This work specifically targets improved context handling and testing. Additionally, early-stage development has begun on a Python-based RLM (Reinforcement Learning Model) provider prototype ([#6383](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6383)), signaling an expansion of the framework's cross-language capabilities.\n\n### Infrastructure & Build Optimization\nEfficiency was a priority this week as the team optimized `turbo.json` ([#6349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6349)). By refining build task inputs, the project has improved caching mechanisms, which will lead to faster rebuilds and a more streamlined CI/CD pipeline for contributors.\n\n### Stability & Bug Fixes\n- **Streaming Reliability:** A critical Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition in streaming endpoint credit deductions was resolved. The team implemented a \"deduct-before, reconcile-after\" pattern to ensure financial integrity during high-concurrency streaming ([#6338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6338)).\n- **Database Schema Fix:** A SQL error involving embedding dimensions was corrected. The system previously defaulted to a 1536-dimension column even when OpenAI embeddings were disabled; the fix ensures the database correctly respects the 384-dimension fallback for local or alternative embeddings ([#6380](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6380)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **Agent Discovery & Identity:** The project finalized the standards for public agent presence. This includes the integration of an agent discovery module on the landing page and dashboard ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302)) and the standardization of public agent URLs using the `elizacloud.ai/chat/[username]` format ([#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)).\n\n### New & Active Issues\n- **UX & Dashboard Usability:** New reports highlight friction in the dashboard and app builder. Specifically, a navigation bug prevents users from returning to the original window when clicking outside creation boxes ([#6382](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6382)). \n- **App Builder Workflow:** There is an ongoing discussion regarding the removal of the current timer functionality in the app builder in favor of a manual refresh request window to improve the developer experience ([#6385](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6385)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was characterized by high-level architectural planning and rapid response to infrastructure bugs. The transition toward V2.0.0 is driving significant internal momentum, as evidenced by the draft PRs for the Python core and the new execution engine. While most issues saw direct resolution, the feedback regarding the App Builder and Dashboard indicates an active loop between users and maintainers to refine the platform's usability as it scales toward a more public-facing \"ElizaCloud\" model."

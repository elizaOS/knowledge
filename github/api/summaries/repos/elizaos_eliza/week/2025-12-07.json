  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week was characterized by a strong focus on improving codebase health and stability. Major efforts were dedicated to dependency management, extensive refactoring, and resolving TypeScript build errors across the monorepo. Alongside this foundational work, the team addressed a critical security bug in character secret encryption and closed numerous UI/UX issues, significantly enhancing the user experience. However, a recurring theme emerged from the community regarding migration challenges and a lack of support for Tangem wallets, highlighting a key area for future attention.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n- **Codebase Health and Stability:** A significant push was made to reduce technical debt. This included a monorepo-wide dependency update to resolve version conflicts ([#6210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6210)), a large-scale code cleanup to remove dead code, fix types, and refactor \"slop\" across multiple packages ([#6213](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6213)), and a comprehensive fix for TypeScript build errors throughout the project ([#6218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n- **Security Enhancement:** A critical bug was fixed in the encryption process for character secrets, ensuring the correct order of operations for improved security ([#6217](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n- **New Features & Integrations:** Work began on several new fronts with pull requests opened to enhance streaming support in text generation ([#6212](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6212)), integrate Eliza Cloud services more tightly with the CLI ([#6216](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6216)), and fix the Telegram bot for Railway deployment ([#6214](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6214)). Two additional PRs were opened targeting `main` ([#6219](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6219), [#6220](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6220)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:** A large number of issues were resolved, leading to tangible improvements:\n    - **UI/UX & Documentation:** The documentation site was overhauled with a new UI and API explorer ([#6128](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6128)). The user interface was streamlined by consolidating \"Chat\" and \"Creator\" into \"My Agents\" ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173]), adding an \"Unsaved Changes\" warning ([#6183](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6183)), and fixing the landing page \"Enter\" key behavior ([#6180](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6180)).\n    - **Backend & Plugin Functionality:** Fixes were implemented for the Image/Video tab's backend connection ([#6186](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6186)) and an issue with `plugin-sql` file creation was confirmed resolved ([#6204](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6204)). An inquiry about Deepseek API integration was also closed with a workaround provided ([#6156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6156)).\n    - **Cloud Services:** Issues related to the cloud affiliate system ([#6172](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6172)) and redirecting billing to Stripe ([#6184](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6184)) were closed.\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - **Wallet & Migration Challenges:** A significant user pain point was highlighted through a new issue ([#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211)) and continued discussion on an existing one ([#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158)). Both report problems with snapshot eligibility for users who held tokens in a Tangem wallet, indicating a gap in the migration process.\n    - **Persistent Plugin Bug:** The long-standing Twitter integration database error ([#39](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/39)) received a new comment confirming the issue persists in recent versions of `elizaos` and the `twitter-plugin`, signaling that the problem is not yet resolved.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity feedback was a key driver this week, particularly in identifying persistent bugs and ecosystem gaps. User reports in issues [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211), [#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158), and [#39](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/39) provided valuable information on real-world usage, specifically concerning the AI16Z → ElizaOS migration and plugin stability. The recurring topic of Tangem wallet support across multiple issues suggests a coordinated concern within a segment of the user base that requires attention."

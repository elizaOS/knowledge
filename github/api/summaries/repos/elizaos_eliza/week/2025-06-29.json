Concurrently, the Command Line Interface (CLI) received significant enhancements, including a full migration to `@clack/prompts` for a consistent developer experience and the introduction of an AI-powered tool to aid in plugin upgrades. Foundational stability was a key theme, with critical bug fixes addressing large file uploads on the server, chat stability on the client, and CI test reliability. While development velocity was high, persistent issues with the Twitter plugin and new reports of Windows compatibility problems highlight key challenges for the team.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week focused on enhancing usability, improving developer tooling, and ensuring core stability.\n\n-   **Comprehensive UI/UX Overhaul**\n    *   A major effort was undertaken to align the client UI with new design specifications. This included a complete redesign of the homepage agent card layout from vertical to horizontal ([#5351](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5351), [#5344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5344)), a refactor of the Chat component and bubbles ([#5349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5349)), and a redesigned sidebar for better structure ([#5373](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5373)).\n    *   Numerous smaller refinements were made, such as adding an agent actions dropdown ([#5403](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5403)), improving dark theme colors ([#5345](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5345)), and renaming the \"Actions\" tab to \"Model Calls\" for clarity ([#5390](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5390)).\n\n-   **CLI Enhancements & Developer Experience**\n    *   The CLI was fully migrated to use `@clack/prompts` for all input methods, creating a modern and consistent user experience ([#5359](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5359)).\n    *   Environment variable management was refactored for better maintainability ([#5326](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5326]), and the `create` command was fixed to display correct project types ([#5321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5321)).\n    *   A new AI-powered migration tool was introduced to help developers upgrade plugins from v0.x to v1.x ([#5311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5311)).\n\n-   **Critical Bug Fixes & Stability Improvements**\n    *   **Server:** A critical bug preventing the saving of large character files was resolved by increasing the Express JSON payload limit to 2MB ([#5308](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5308)). A duplicate middleware was also removed to reduce overhead ([#5384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5384)).\n    *   **Client:** Key fixes were deployed for a group chat crash ([#5406](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5406)), incorrect DM channel creation logic ([#5411](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5411)), and a scrolling issue on the environment settings page ([#5312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5312)).\n    *   **Testing & CI:** `plugin-sql` integration tests were stabilized by using isolated databases ([#5327](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5327)), and CI memory allocation was standardized to improve reliability ([#5387](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5387)).\n\n-   **Plugin Ecosystem & Documentation**\n    *   A pull request was opened to add support for xAI Grok models via a new `@elizaos/plugin-grok` ([#5338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5338)).\n    *   Documentation was improved to clarify that `plugin-bootstrap` is mandatory for basic agent functionality ([#5309](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5309)) and to correct the REST API documentation to match the server's implementation ([#5380](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5380)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe project saw significant progress in resolving developer experience issues while uncovering new platform-specific and plugin-related challenges.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    *   Key developer workflow blockers were resolved, including inconsistent `bun run test` behavior across packages ([#5218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5218]) and enabling client hot reloads in development ([#4889](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4889)).\n    *   The effort to standardize the CLI experience by migrating all inputs to `@clack/prompts` was completed ([#5295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5295)).\n    *   The critical server-side issue preventing users from saving large character files was fixed ([#5268](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5268)).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Twitter Plugin Failure:** The most pressing active issue is the \"Client Initialization Error\" with `plugin-twitter` ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/31)). Multiple users have confirmed this bug, which prevents autonomous agent operation on Twitter and appears to be a significant blocker.\n    *   **Windows Compatibility:** A new issue was reported regarding plugin loading failures on Windows ([#5407](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5407)), compounding existing concerns about Windows stability ([#5161](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5161)).\n    *   **Future Direction:** Important strategic discussions are active, including a major documentation overhaul for different user personas ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5234]), best practices for deploying Eliza agents ([#5244](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5244)), and a proposal to implement a gamified badge system for contributor recognition ([#140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/140)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThis week demonstrated a vibrant and collaborative development environment. The coordinated effort to implement the UI redesign suggests strong alignment between design and engineering. Community engagement was particularly visible in the issue tracker, where multiple users provided"

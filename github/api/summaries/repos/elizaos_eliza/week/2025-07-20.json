Key achievements include a major refactoring of prompts to an XML format for improved LLM reliability, critical security hardening of the `plugin-training` module, and the resolution of several CLI and plugin-related bugs. Concurrently, a wave of new issues laid the groundwork for future development, with a strong emphasis on expanding DeFi plugin capabilities and creating comprehensive video and written documentation.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on improving the reliability, security, and usability of the core system and its plugins.\n\n-   **Core Framework Refinement:** A significant effort was completed to migrate all JSON-based prompts to an XML format across the codebase. This refactoring aims to enhance the reliability of responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) and impacts core entities and the bootstrap plugin ([#5623](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5623)).\n\n-   **Plugin Security & Stability:** The `plugin-training` module received critical security updates to prevent command injection vulnerabilities by validating model parameters and correcting prompt escaping ([#5663](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5663), [#5661](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5661)). Stability was also improved by fixing the dataset path for HuggingFace uploads and preventing the use of undefined models ([#5662](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5662), [#5660](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5660)). A key bug in the `@elizaos/config` package was also fixed, ensuring correct file exports for dependent plugins ([#5635](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5635)).\n\n-   **CLI and Tooling Improvements:** Several bugs affecting the developer experience were addressed, including fixes for CLI test failures due to missing dependencies ([#5641](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5641)) and incorrect JSON string handling in the SQL base plugin ([#5628](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5628)).\n\n-   **Documentation and Agent Capabilities:** To aid developers, a new `AGENT.md` file was added as a quick reference guide for agent development ([#5669](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5669]), and existing documentation was clarified ([#5642](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5642)). The default Eliza character was also enhanced with new examples to support Twitter posting functionality ([#5652](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5652)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe project saw a significant influx of new issues, signaling active community engagement and outlining a clear roadmap for future work, while several key user-facing problems were resolved.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:** Important user experience issues were resolved, including a fix for the `elizaos create` command that was placing the `.elizadb` directory in the wrong location ([#5616](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5616)). A critical support issue was closed after guiding a user to resolve an unresponsive agent by correctly setting the `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` environment variable ([#5664](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5664)).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** A major trend this week was the request for new Web3 capabilities, with a suite of issues opened for DeFi-related plugins including Aave, Morpho, Clanker, and Defi-Llama ([#5643](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5643)-[#5647](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5647)). A significant strategic effort was initiated to overhaul project documentation, with new issues planning a full documentation review and the production of introductory videos ([#5665](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5665)-[#5668](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5668)). Other notable proposals include enhancing the `llm_judge` evaluator with multi-level assessments ([#5637](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5637)). Several new bugs were also reported, highlighting issues with the scenario runner and CLI dependency management ([#5639](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5639), [#5640](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5640), [#5657](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5657)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe week's activity indicates a healthy and engaged community. The large number of new feature requests, particularly for DeFi plugins, suggests that users are actively trying to expand ElizaOS into new domains. The detailed planning for documentation and video tutorials shows a proactive approach to improving accessibility for new contributors and users. Furthermore, the prompt resolution of user-reported issues, such as the Google API key problem, demonstrates a responsive and supportive maintainer team focused on addressing community needs."

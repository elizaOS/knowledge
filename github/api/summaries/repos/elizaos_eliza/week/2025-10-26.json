  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Oct 26 - Nov 1, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week was characterized by significant enhancements to ElizaOS's core infrastructure and agent reliability. Development focused on creating a more robust and scalable foundation, highlighted by the introduction of a unified messaging API and a new Jobs API to streamline agent communication. The project's multi-tenancy capabilities were substantially improved with the implementation of PostgreSQL Row-Level Security. Concurrently, the team addressed several critical bugs related to configuration management and agent state persistence, ensuring greater stability across the framework.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on foundational API development, infrastructure hardening, and critical bug fixes.\n\n- **Agent Communication & API Enhancements**\n  A major effort was completed to streamline how clients and systems interact with agents. A unified messaging API, `elizaOS.sendMessage()`, was implemented to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability across all clients ([#6095](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6095)). Complementing this, a new Jobs API was introduced to handle one-off, stateless agent messaging, allowing external systems to send a single message and poll for a response without a persistent session ([#6097](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6097), [#6098](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6098)). A related pull request was also opened to add x402 payment middleware to this new API ([#6099](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6099)).\n\n- **Infrastructure, Security, and Cloud Integration**\n  To bolster security and scalability in shared environments, PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) was implemented to enforce strict data isolation between tenants ([#6101](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6101)). For cloud users, a new `elizaos login` CLI command was added to facilitate authentication with ElizaOS Cloud services ([#6100](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6100)). Server stability in production was also improved by adding public health check endpoints, resolving issues with load balancer health monitoring ([#6103](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6103)).\n\n- **Critical Bug Fixes & Stability**\n  Several important bugs were resolved to improve the framework's reliability:\n  - A fix was merged to ensure agent settings persist across restarts, preventing the loss of runtime-generated configurations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n  - An issue causing global `.env` variables to be ignored when character-specific secrets were present was corrected, ensuring proper configuration merging ([#6102](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6102)).\n  - A bug preventing the creation of DM channels in the GUI client was fixed by ensuring the correct server ID is used ([#6105](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6105)).\n\n- **Feature Improvements**\n  Flexibility was enhanced by allowing custom options to be added to an `Action` via an index signature ([#6104](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6104)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  Key issues were resolved this week, reflecting the progress in development. The effort to improve testing and reliability, including adding smoke tests for CLI commands, was completed ([#5935](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5935)). The issue tracking the implementation of the unified messaging API was also closed following its successful merge ([#6096](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6096)). A smaller UI task to add Discord and Farcaster navigation buttons was also completed ([#6089](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6089)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  The week was light on new issues, with the most significant one ([#6096](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6096)) being resolved within a day. An active issue ([#168](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/168)) concerning incorrect dates on weekly summaries displayed on user profile leaderboards was acknowledged, with contributor `standujar` confirming they are investigating the bug.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe development pace this week demonstrated an efficient workflow, particularly in addressing both planned features and critical bugs. The rapid progression of the unified messaging API from a newly opened issue ([#6096](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6096)) to a closed one within 24 hours highlights a responsive and focused development cycle. Similarly, the quick turnaround on the agent settings persistence bug ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)), which was merged two days after being opened, shows a commitment to maintaining core stability. The public acknowledgment and investigation of a community-reported bug ([#168](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/168)) by a maintainer further illustrates an active and engaged triage process."

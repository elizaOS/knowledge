Key technical milestones included a 40% reduction in warm start times through atomic upserts and parallelization, alongside the introduction of a WebAssembly (WASM) agent runtime proposal. The team also prioritized developer experience and reliability, implementing robust retry logic for multi-step workflows and refining the CLI to prevent environment leakage and dependency versioning issues.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Runtime & Database Performance\nThe core focus of the week was streamlining agent initialization and database interactions to reduce latency.\n*   **Initialization Speed:** Optimized `runtime.initialize()` by implementing atomic upserts and parallelizing independent operations. This resulted in a 30% reduction in cold start times and a 40% reduction in warm start times [#6342](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6342).\n*   **Embedding Optimization:** Introduced the `EMBEDDING_DIMENSION` configuration, allowing agents to skip a ~500ms API call during initialization by manually defining dimensions [#6357](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6357).\n*   **SQL Refactoring:** Initiated a refactor of the `plugin-sql` module to extract domain stores from the `BaseDrizzleAdapter`, improving modularity [#6366](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6366).\n\n### Workflow Reliability & New Runtimes\nEnhancements were made to how agents handle complex tasks and how the framework can be deployed.\n*   **Multi-Step Workflows:** Improved the reliability of complex interactions by adding robust retry logic (up to 5 retries) for XML parsing and enhancing parameter extraction [#6286](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6286).\n*   **WASM Support:** A new proposal was submitted to introduce a WebAssembly (WASM) agent runtime, expanding the environments where ElizaOS agents can operate [#6363](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6363).\n\n### Tooling & Developer Experience\nSeveral fixes were implemented to stabilize the development environment and CLI tools.\n*   **CLI & Security:** Addressed a security concern by preventing shell environment variable leakage into agent secrets [#6360](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6360) and ensured new projects default to the 'latest' version of `@elizaos` dependencies [#6362](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6362).\n*   **Build Stability:** Fixed an issue in `dev-watch` mode that caused infinite rebuild loops [#6361](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6361).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n### Closed Issues\n*   **Performance & DB Patterns:** Resolved issues regarding redundant lookups and cartesian products in database queries. Implemented UPSERT patterns using `onConflictDoNothing()` to replace inefficient check-then-insert logic [#6334](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6334), [#6335](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6335).\n*   **UI/UX Refinements:** Standardized UI element sizes and improved the mobile agent builder with default capitalization for agent names [#6344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6344), [#6346](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6346).\n*   **User Onboarding:** Enhanced the dashboard by clarifying public/private icons and converting \"Sign up\" prompts into clickable hyperlinks to streamline registration [#6352](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6352), [#6353](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6353).\n\n### New & Active Issues\n*   **Reflection Evaluator Failure:** A new bug was reported where the reflection evaluator fails with an \"Entity not found\" error if `UPDATE_CONTACT` is triggered without an established connection [#6364](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6364).\n*   **Payment Integration:** A significant guide was opened detailing the implementation of autonomous AI agent payments using Circle and Coinbase APIs, signaling a move toward deeper Web3 financial integration [#6365](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6365).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe community showed strong interest in expanding the ecosystem's utility and documentation. New contributions included `plugin-blockrun` for x402 micropayments [#6355](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6355) and a comprehensive set of core documentation guides [#6356](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6356). Collaboration was also evident in the cross-language support efforts, with active testing and fixes being applied to Python examples for the `v2.0.0` release [#6358](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358)."

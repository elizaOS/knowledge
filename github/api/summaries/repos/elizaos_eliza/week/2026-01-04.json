A major achievement was the introduction of the unified `useElizaChat` hook, simplifying client-side development across multiple transport protocols. Concurrently, critical stability improvements were made to the SQL plugin, resolving crashes and connection issues. The latter half of the week saw a massive effort to close out a backlog of UI/UX and agent management issues, greatly enhancing the platform's usability. As these user-facing issues were resolved, a new set of deeper challenges around performance, concurrency, and optimization were identified, setting the stage for the next phase of development.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThe week's technical work focused on improving client-side architecture, bolstering backend stability, and upgrading CI/CD pipelines.\n\n-   **Client & Transport Layer Unification**\n    -   A new `useElizaChat` hook was introduced to provide a unified interface for client interactions across HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket transports. This simplifies development and ensures consistency by aligning transport naming conventions between the client and server packages ([#6300](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300)).\n\n-   **SQL Plugin Stability and Reliability**\n    -   A series of critical fixes were merged to improve the stability of the SQL plugin. These addressed runtime crashes and connection problems by adding pool configuration, an error handler, and fixing PGLite shutdown issues ([#6323](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6323)). Other fixes resolved failures in PostgreSQL `SET LOCAL` commands ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)]) and corrected a bug related to a `serverId` change impacting `plugin-bootstrap` and `plugin-sql` ([#6333](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6333)]).\n\n-   **CI & Automation Enhancements**\n    -   The project's CI workflows were upgraded to use the stable v1 Claude action and the Opus 4.5 model. New automated workflows for security and maintenance were also added ([#6324](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6324)]). To improve integration, the CI was configured to allow the Cursor bot to trigger Claude workflows ([#6328](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6328)]).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe week saw a major push to resolve existing issues while also identifying a new class of performance-related challenges.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    -   **Core SDK & API Architecture:** Foundational work was completed with the closure of issues related to the core Eliza hooks (`useEliza`, `useElizaChat`), agent lifecycle management hooks, and SDK-first browser instantiation ([#5928](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5928), [#5966](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5966), [#5929](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5929)]). Architectural issues in the Messaging API were also resolved ([#6298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6298)]).\n    -   **Massive UI/UX & Agent Management Cleanup:** A significant number of user-facing issues were resolved. This includes improvements to agent creation ([#6306](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6306), [#6307](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6307)]), chat interface behavior ([#6308](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6308), [#6309](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6309), [#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310)]), conversation management ([#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311), [#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)]), agent discoverability ([#6319](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6319), [#6321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6321)]), and public agent interactions ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312), [#6313](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6313)]). JWT authentication needs were also addressed ([#6327](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6327)]).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   **Critical Blockers:** Two high-priority issues were identified: a \"Model not found\" error blocking API-based agent usage ([#6331](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6331)]) and excessive memory consumption by the Turbo build tool ([#6332](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6332)]).\n    -   **Next-Gen Performance & Reliability:** A new wave of issues signals a shift towards deeper optimization. These include proposals for runtime initialization parallelization ([#6334](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6334)]), using UPSERT database patterns ([#6335](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6335)]), parallelizing message processing ([#6337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6337)]), and fixing a TOCTOU race condition in credit deduction ([#6338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6338)]).\n    -   **Ongoing Discussions:** Older issues regarding NPM publish failures ([#40](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/40)]) and the deprecation of slash commands ([#15](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/15)]) continue to see discussion, indicating persistent challenges in the release process and design decisions.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe week's activity reveals a mature and strategic development process. The initial days were dedicated to identifying and documenting issues, followed by a mid-week burst of focused development on core infrastructure. The end of the week saw a coordinated effort to clear a large backlog of user-facing issues, demonstrating a strong commitment to improving the end-user experience. The immediate creation of a"

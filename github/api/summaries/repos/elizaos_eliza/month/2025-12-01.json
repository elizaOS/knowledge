  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (December 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nDecember was a month of foundational improvements and strategic planning. Development focused on enhancing core stability through significant server refactoring, dependency updates, and widespread TypeScript error resolution. This backend work was complemented by a major push to refine the user experience, with numerous UI/UX issues closed and a comprehensive set of new issues opened to guide a future overhaul of the agent creation workflow and dashboard. Key new capabilities were introduced, including a unified serverless API and streamlined ElizaOS Cloud integration in the CLI, setting the stage for greater scalability and ease of use.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThis month's efforts were balanced between strengthening the existing codebase and introducing new, strategic features.\n\n-   **Core Stability and Modernization:**\n    -   A major server refactoring optimized the codebase and reorganized API endpoints and services ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).\n    -   Server reliability was enhanced by properly configuring Socket.IO timeouts and implementing explicit HTTP server timeouts ([#6198](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6198)).\n    -   A comprehensive effort resolved TypeScript build errors across numerous packages, including `core`, `server`, `client`, and `cli`, ensuring type safety and code stability ([#6218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n    -   All monorepo dependencies were updated to their latest versions, resolving compatibility conflicts, particularly with `drizzle-orm` ([#6210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6210)).\n\n-   **New Features & Integrations:**\n    -   A unified API for serverless Node.js environments was implemented, streamlining core functionalities for broader deployment options ([#6201](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6201)).\n    -   The CLI was enhanced to make ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider, featuring a new browser-based login flow to simplify API key setup ([#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).\n    -   Work began on JWT authentication and user management ([#6200](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6200)) and parallel action execution ([#6209](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6209)).\n\n-   **Plugin and CLI Enhancements:**\n    -   The SQL plugin was significantly improved with smooth schema migration for backward compatibility, optimized Row-Level Security (RLS) handling, and auto-creation of PGLite directories ([#6215](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6215), [#6202](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6202)).\n    -   Standalone examples were modernized to use the new `messageService.handleMessage()` API, deprecating the old event system ([#6202](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6202)).\n    -   An API signature mismatch in the CLI's end-to-end tests was corrected, restoring test reliability ([#6207](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6207)).\n\n-   **Bug Fixes and Code Quality:**\n    -   A critical security bug in character secret encryption was fixed to ensure the correct order of operations ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n    -   Markdown rendering issues causing inconsistent spacing in the client UI were resolved ([#6159](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6159), [#6197](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6197)).\n    -   A substantial code cleanup removed technical debt by fixing `any`/`unknown` types, eliminating dead code, and removing unnecessary `try-catch` blocks ([#6213](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6213)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month was characterized by clearing a backlog of UI/UX tickets and defining a clear roadmap for future front-end development.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    -   **UI/UX Simplification:** A large number of issues were resolved to streamline the user interface. This included consolidating sidebar navigation ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)), cleaning up user info ([#6174](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6174)), implementing a distinct \"Build Mode\" theme ([#6177](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6177)), adding an \"Unsaved Changes\" warning ([#6183](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6183)), and improving plugin selection feedback ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235), [#6236](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6236)).\n    -   **Bug Fixes:** Critical bugs were addressed, including a container deployment failure ([#6187](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6187)), server connection timeouts ([#6198](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6198)), and an issue preventing the SQL plugin from starting without a pre-existing directory ([#6204](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6204)).\n    -   **Documentation:** The long-standing documentation issue was closed with the launch of a new public docs UI featuring an API explorer ([#6128](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6128)).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   **Strategic UI/UX Overhaul:** A significant batch of over 20 issues was opened on Dec 15, outlining a comprehensive plan to improve user onboarding and agent management. Key proposals include a redesigned dashboard ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)), guided onboarding overlays ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221)), and simplifying terminology like \"RAG\" to \"Files\" ([#6237](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6237), [#6240](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6240)).\n    -   **Future Features:** The groundwork for future development was laid with new issues for implementing streaming support ([#6206](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6206)) and web search functionality ([#6246](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6246)).\n    -   **Community & Web3 Challenges:** Users reported challenges with the AI16Z → ElizaOS migration, specifically concerning snapshot eligibility for tokens held in Tangem wallets ([#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158), [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211)). This highlights a key area of concern for the Web3 portion of the community.\n    -   **Persistent Bugs:** The long-standing Twitter plugin database error ([#39](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/39)) remains active, with a new comment confirming the issue persists in recent versions, indicating a challenging underlying problem.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this month was evident in both strategic planning and community support. The large, coordinated creation of UI/UX issues on December 15 suggests a focused effort by the core team to define the project's next steps for front-end development. Concurrently, active discussions around token migration and wallet support ([#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158), [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211)) demonstrate the project's responsiveness to direct feedback from its Web3 user base. Finally, community members continued to collaborate on diagnosing persistent, older issues like the Twitter plugin bug ([#39](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/39)), showcasing ongoing engagement in maintaining the ecosystem's health."

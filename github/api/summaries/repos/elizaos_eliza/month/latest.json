  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (January 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nJanuary kicked off with a significant strategic planning effort, laying the groundwork for the next phase of public agent functionality and user experience. This was evidenced by a large influx of new issues defining a clear roadmap for agent discovery, interaction, and monetization. While much of the activity was centered on planning, key technical progress was also made, including a performance-enhancing refactor of the core message service ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)). The month's activities signal a focused shift towards enhancing the platform's public-facing features and preparing for a busy development cycle.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nDevelopment work this month focused on backend performance improvements and routine maintenance, while new work began on plugin bug fixes.\n\n- **Core Service Optimization:** A significant refactoring effort was completed in the default message service to optimize provider handling within the `MultiStep` functionality. This performance improvement ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)) enhances execution speed without altering functional outcomes.\n\n- **Plugin Fixes:** Work commenced on addressing a bug in the `plugin-sql`, with a pull request ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)) opened to use `sql.raw()` for `SET LOCAL`. This change prevents unintended parameterization issues.\n\n- **Project Maintenance:** As part of standard annual upkeep, the copyright year in the project's MIT License was updated to 2026 ([#6301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6301)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe beginning of the month saw a major effort in issue creation, outlining a comprehensive vision for the platform's evolution, particularly around public agents and user experience.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** A large volume of new issues was opened, mapping out substantial future work. Key themes include:\n    - **Public Agent Ecosystem:** A suite of features was proposed to build out a robust public agent environment. This includes an agent discovery module with search and sorting ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302]), a standardized URL format ([#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304]), the ability for users to fork public agents ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305]), and mechanisms for knowledge transfer ([#6303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6303)).\n    - **User Experience & Interface:** Numerous issues were created to refine the user experience. These range from specific UI tweaks like adjusting the chat box size ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310]) and improving chat summary relevance ([#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311]), to fixing bugs related to conversation deletion ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322]) and page scrolling ([#6318](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6318]).\n    - **Monetization & Access Control:** New strategies for platform growth were proposed, including limiting messages for unauthenticated users ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312)) and adjusting the initial free credit amount ([#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315)).\n\nNo issues saw significant discussion during this period, indicating that these new items are in the initial triage and assignment phase.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe activity this month points to a highly coordinated planning effort from the core team. The large, thematically-linked batch of issues created on January 2nd suggests a focused session to define project priorities. This proactive planning provides a clear and structured direction for all contributors heading into the new year. While there were no heavily debated issues, this initial burst of activity sets the stage for future collaboration as development on these new features begins."

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 26, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw a critical bug fix in the `elizaos.js` import statement and the closure of several key issues, including topping up AI Gateway credits and initial competitive analysis research. A significant number of new issues were opened, focusing heavily on plugin integrations, infrastructure, and UX for the Eliza App.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core Bug Fixes\n- An import statement in `elizaos.js` was updated to use a package alias, resolving a potential pathing issue ([#6389](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6389)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Critical Infrastructure & Research Blockers Resolved\n- AI Gateway credits were topped up, unblocking all AI inference and development work ([#6393](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6393)).\n- Initial competitive analysis findings from Claudebot and Poke research were compiled ([#6396](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6396)).\n- Research into a hosted Claudebot-like experience was explored ([#6423](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6423)).\n\n### Plugin Integration & QA Readiness\n- The integration of the GitHub Plugin was closed, indicating progress on code and repository management capabilities ([#6406](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6406)).\n- The integration of a Code Execution Plugin was closed, enabling Eliza to write and execute code ([#6408](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6408)).\n- Recruitment for consumer testers was completed, preparing for user feedback and bug backlog generation ([#6420](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6420)).\n\n### Plugin Submission Review\n- The Coin Railz x402 Micropayment Services plugin submission was closed, indicating a decision or completion regarding its integration ([#6148](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6148)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Core Application & User Experience\n- A redirect issue was identified where logged-out users are not directed to the correct continuation process after sign-up/in ([#6392](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6392)).\n- An issue was reported regarding no answer from the agent builder ([#6391](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6391)).\n- Clarification was sought regarding the naming convention for Opus and Sonnet models ([#6390](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6390)).\n- Research tasks were created for all team members to deep dive into Claudebot ([#6394](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6394)) and analyze the Poke app ([#6395](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6395)).\n- New UX initiatives include implementing a Poke-style onboarding flow ([#6413](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6413)) and conversation-based onboarding ([#6414](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6414)).\n- A simple Eliza App landing page with a single CTA is planned ([#6412](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6412), [#6427](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6427)).\n\n### Plugin Integrations\n- Several new plugin integrations are planned, including Discord ([#6398](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6398)), Telegram ([#6397](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6397)), SMS/iMessage

([#6404](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6404)), and Calendar ([#6405](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6405)).\n- Dynamic plugin loading based on user needs is also being considered ([#6403](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6403)).\n\n### Infrastructure & Agent Development\n- Infrastructure tasks include implementing user session isolation ([#6409](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6409)), secrets management for user services ([#6410](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6410)), and a memory persistence system ([#6411](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6411)).\n- Deployment of Discord as an AWS service ([#6424](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6424)) and Telegram webhook registration ([#6425](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6425)) are planned.\n- A universal Eliza character file is to be created for the default agent ([#6402](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6402)).\n- Verification of the agent running and connected to all social platforms is a new task ([#6426](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6426)).\n- Verification of serverless multi-tenant support for the Eliza App is also a new issue ([#6415](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6415)).\n\n### Feature Enhancements & Quality Assurance\n- New features include multi-user/room awareness

- sonnet? Is this right?**\n  - The discussion clarifies that \"Ultra\" should correspond to \"Opus\" and \"Pro\" to \"Sonnet,\" suggesting a swap in the current naming convention. This indicates a need for internal alignment on model terminology."

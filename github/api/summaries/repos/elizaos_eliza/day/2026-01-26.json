  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 26, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw a critical bug fix in the `elizaos.js` import statement. There was also significant activity in issue creation, focusing on plugin integrations, research, infrastructure, and UX for the Eliza App, alongside the closure of several key issues including a blocker for AI Gateway credits.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **CLI Import Statement Fix**\n    *   Updated the import statement in `elizaos.js` to use a package alias (`@elizaos/cli`) instead of a direct path, improving module resolution and consistency ([#6389](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6389)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened

([#6393](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6393)).\n    *   Completed the compilation of competitive analysis findings from Claudebot and Poke research ([#6396](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6396)).\n    *   Closed the exploration task for building a hosted Claudebot-like experience ([#6423](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6423)).\n\n*   **Plugin Integration & QA Readiness**\n    *   Integrated the GitHub Plugin to enable code and repository management

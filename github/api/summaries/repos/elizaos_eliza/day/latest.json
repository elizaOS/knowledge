  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 9, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing the `plugin-sql` package with Neon serverless support and improved RLS security, alongside critical bug fixes for backend hot reloading and PGLite compatibility.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### SQL Plugin Enhancements & Security\nThe `plugin-sql` package received significant updates, including the addition of Neon serverless database support and improvements to Row-Level Security (RLS). This work involved adding a dedicated adapter for Neon and refining RLS security measures. Additionally, a bug preventing `pgcrypto` extension installation for PGLite was fixed, eliminating unnecessary warning logs. ([#6343](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6343), [#6339](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6339))\n\n### Backend Development Workflow Improvements\nA crucial bug fix was implemented to enable comprehensive hot reload functionality for backend development. This ensures that modifications to TypeScript files in watched packages automatically trigger a rebuild of the CLI and a server restart with health verification, streamlining the development process. ([#6293](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6293))\n\n### Robust Testing for SQL Plugin\nTesting for the `plugin-sql` package was strengthened by integrating `withEntityContext()` into RLS tests, replacing raw `pg.Client` usage. Furthermore, `ENABLE_DATA_ISOLATION=true` was added to CI, enhancing test isolation and ensuring that potential parameterization bugs are caught. ([#6330](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6330))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#6351](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6351) V2.0.0: This PR likely introduces significant changes related to a new major version release.\n- [#6349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6349) chore: Optimize build task inputs in turbo.json: This PR aims to improve build performance by optimizing TurboRepo configurations.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### User Experience and Interface Improvements\nSeveral new issues highlight areas for improving the user experience within the ElizaOS platform. These include refining the input fields for personality traits and topics of interest by removing the '+' button for a cleaner interface ([#6350](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6350)). Additionally, there's a need to enhance the visibility and clarity of public/private agent statuses in the dashboard by repositioning icons and adding hover-over descriptions ([#6352](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6352)).\n\n### Onboarding and Navigation Flow\nIssues were raised concerning the onboarding and navigation experience for new and returning users. Specifically, the \"Sign up for free\" prompt in agent messages should be a clickable hyperlink to facilitate user registration ([#6353](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6353)). Furthermore, the login/signup process should redirect users back to their previous agent chat session instead of the dashboard, improving continuity ([#6354](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6354)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

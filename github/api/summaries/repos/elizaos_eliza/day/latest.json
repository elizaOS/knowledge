  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 5, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday saw significant progress with the introduction of unified client hooks supporting multiple transport protocols and critical bug fixes in the SQL plugin, alongside CI workflow enhancements.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Unified Client Hooks and Multi-Transport Support\n*   Introduced a new `useElizaChat` hook in the client package for unified interaction across HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket transports.\n*   Aligned transport naming conventions between `api-client` and `server` packages for consistency ([#6300](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300)).\n\n### SQL Plugin Stability and Reliability Improvements\n*   Fixed an issue where PostgreSQL `SET LOCAL` commands failed due to incorrect parameterization by using `sql.raw()` ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).\n*   Addressed critical issues in `plugin-sql`, including adding pool configuration, an error handler, and fixing PGLite shutdown problems to prevent runtime crashes and connection issues ([#6323](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6323)).\n\n### CI Workflow Enhancements and Automation\n*   Upgraded all Claude-powered CI workflows to use the stable v1 action and the Opus 4.5 model ([#6324](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6324)).\n*   Added two new automated workflows for security and maintenance ([#6324](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6324)).\n*   Configured CI to allow the Cursor bot to trigger Claude workflows, improving integration and automation ([#6328](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6328)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n*   [#6330](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6330) `test(plugin-sql): use withEntityContext in RLS tests + isolation in CI`: This PR focuses on enhancing the testing of the SQL plugin, specifically for Row-Level Security (RLS) and isolation in CI environments.\n*   [#6329](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6329) `feat(plugin-sql): add CachedDatabaseAdapter with LRU caching and serv…`: This PR introduces a new `CachedDatabaseAdapter` to the SQL plugin, incorporating LRU caching for improved performance.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Core Hooks and SDK-first Development\n*   The implementation of core Eliza hooks, including `useEliza` and `useElizaChat`, has been completed ([#5928](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5928)).\n*   Support for instantiating Eliza directly in the browser via hooks (SDK-first mode) and separate server hooks for REST/SSE integration has been achieved ([#5966](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5966)).\n\n### Lifecycle Management and Messaging API Refinements\n*   Hooks for agent lifecycle management (e.g., `useAgentList`, `useStartAgent`, `useStopAgent`) have been implemented ([#5929](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5929)).\n*   Architectural issues in the Messaging API, such as double processing and transport alignment, have been resolved ([#6298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6298)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Frontend Testing and Authentication Needs\n*   A new issue has been opened to provide a mock client for frontend testing, eliminating the need for a live server during development ([#6326](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6326)).\n*   The need for JWT authentication and robust user management has been identified and logged as a new issue ([#6327](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6327)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

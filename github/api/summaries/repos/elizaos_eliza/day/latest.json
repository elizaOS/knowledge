  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 7, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on a critical bug fix for plugin-bootstrap and plugin-sql related to server ID changes. Several new issues were opened concerning runtime optimization, database query patterns, and message processing, while a significant number of UI/UX and agent management issues were closed.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Plugin Stability and Compatibility\nA bug fix was implemented to address issues in `plugin-bootstrap` and `plugin-sql` related to a `serverId` to `messageServerId` change, ensuring proper functionality of actions and providers. This resolves user reports of version 1.7.0 not working.\n- Fixed `plugin-bootstrap` and `plugin-sql` actions/providers for `serverId` to `messageServerId` change ([#6333](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6333))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request, [#6339](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6339), was opened to skip the `pgcrypto` extension for PGLite in `plugin-sql`.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### UI/UX and Agent Interaction Improvements\nSeveral issues related to the user interface and agent interaction were closed, enhancing the overall user experience.\n- Resolved issues with agent creation, including username requirements and blank name fields ([#6306](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6306), [#6307](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6307)).\n- Addressed display issues such as removing agent avatars in the chat menu and ensuring agent responses start from the top ([#6308](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6308), [#6309](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6309)).\n- Implemented dynamic sizing for the chat box and improved chat summaries ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310), [#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311)).\n- Fixed scrolling issues on the page and agent sorting functionality ([#6318](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6318), [#6319](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6319)).\n- Resolved the need to refresh after deleting conversations ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)).\n\n### Agent Management and Authentication\nImprovements were made to agent management and authentication processes.\n- Enhanced knowledge transfer for public agents ([#6303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6303)).\n- Implemented limits on messages for non-signed-up users and separated public agent states ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312), [#6313](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6313)).\n- Adjusted free credit amounts and streamlined the wallet connection process ([#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315), [#6317](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6317)).\n- Addressed agent \"following\" functionality and JWT authentication/user management ([#6321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6321), [#6327](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6327)).\n\n### Database and Extension Fixes\nA specific database extension issue was resolved.\n- Skipped the `pgcrypto` extension for PGLite in `plugin-sql` ([#6340](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6340)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Performance and Optimization\nNew issues were opened to address various performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities within the framework.\n- Optimize runtime initialization by adding missing checks, removing double lookups, and exploring parallelization for independent operations ([#6334](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6334)).\n- Implement UPSERT patterns for database queries to replace check-then-insert logic and optimize entity retrieval ([#6335](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6335)).\n- Investigate provider batching for `composeState` ([#6336](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6336)).\n- Explore parallelization for message processing, including saving messages, getting user state, and processing attachments ([#6337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6337)).\n\n### Race Condition and Feature Development\nA critical race condition was identified, and a new feature was proposed.\n- Fix TOCTOU (Time-Of-Check-To-Time-Of-Use) race condition in credit deduction for streaming endpoints using a \"deduct-before, reconcile-after\" pattern ([#6338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6338)).\n- Propose an \"Apps promotion feature\" ([#6341](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6341)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Slash Commands Functionality\nIssue [#15](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/15) discusses the disappearance of \"join\" and \"leave\" slash commands. The latest comment from `odilitime` confirms that the functionality has been made extensible, allowing developers to add custom slash commands if desired. This suggests a shift towards a more modular approach for command management.\n\n### Discord Plugin Publication Failure\nIssue [#40](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/40) concerns the failure to publish Discord plugin version v1.3.4, leading to a jump to v1.3.5. `odilitime` provided a detailed update, noting that v1.3.3 is the last successfully published version on NPM. The investigation into the publishing failures on December 23rd revealed TypeScript errors related to `EventPayloadMap` and `DiscordRegisterCommandsPayload` in `src/service.ts`, indicating type incompatibility issues during the build process. The current `package.json` dependencies on `elizaos/config 1.6.5` and `elizaos/^1.7.0` are also being reviewed as part of the investigation."

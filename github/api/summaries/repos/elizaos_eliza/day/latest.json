This streamlines client-side interaction with the ElizaOS agent. ([#6300](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300))\n*   Aligned transport naming conventions between the `api-client` and `server` packages for consistency. ([#6300](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300))\n\n### SQL Plugin Stability and Reliability Improvements\n*   Fixed an issue in the `plugin-sql` where PostgreSQL `SET LOCAL` commands failed due to incorrect parameterization, now using `sql.raw()` to prevent \"syntax error at or near $1\". ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316))\n*   Addressed critical issues in `plugin-sql`, including adding pool configuration, an error handler, and fixing PGLite shutdown problems to prevent runtime crashes and connection issues. ([#6323](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6323))\n\n### CI Workflow Enhancements and Claude Integration\n*   Upgraded all Claude-powered CI workflows to use the stable v1 action and the Opus 4.5 model, improving AI-driven code reviews and security checks. ([#6324](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6324))\n*   Added two new automated workflows for security and maintenance jobs to the CI pipeline. ([#6324](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6324))\n*   Configured CI workflows to allow the Cursor bot to trigger Claude-related actions, enhancing automated code review processes. ([#6328](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6328))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n*   [#6330](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6330) `test(plugin-sql): use withEntityContext in RLS tests + isolation in CI`: This PR aims to improve testing for the SQL plugin, specifically for Row-Level Security (RLS), by incorporating `withEntityContext` and ensuring isolation in CI.\n*   [#6329](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6329) `feat(plugin-sql): add CachedDatabaseAdapter with LRU caching and serv…`: This PR proposes adding a `CachedDatabaseAdapter` to the SQL plugin, featuring LRU caching, which is expected to enhance performance.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Core Hooks and SDK-first Development\n*   The core hooks implementation, including `useEliza` and `useElizaChat`, has been completed. ([#5928](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5928))\n*   The SDK-first hooks mode, allowing direct instantiation of Eliza in the browser via hooks, has been fully supported. ([#5966](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5966))\n\n### Messaging API Refinements\n*   Issues related to double processing and transport alignment within the Messaging API have been resolved. ([#6298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6298))\n\n### Agent Lifecycle and Utilities\n*   Lifecycle management hooks, such as `useAgentList`, `useStartAgent`, and `useStopAgent`, have been implemented. ([#5929](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5929))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Frontend Testing and Authentication\n*   A new issue has been opened to provide a mock client for frontend testing, eliminating the need for a live server during development. ([#6326](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6326))\n*   The need for JWT authentication and robust user management has been identified and opened as a new issue. ([#6327](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6327))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

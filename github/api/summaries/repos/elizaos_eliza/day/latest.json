  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Dec 23, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing core functionality with generic type support for custom event handlers, improving code robustness. Several issues related to dashboard performance, agent builder refinements, and UI/UX improvements were closed, indicating significant progress in these areas.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core Runtime Enhancements\nA significant bug fix was implemented to add generic type support for custom event handlers in the core runtime. This allows plugins to define typed event payloads, improving type safety and developer experience.\n- Generic type parameter added to `registerEvent` for custom events.\n- Enables plugins to define typed event payloads extending `EventPayload`.\n- Includes a new unit test to validate the functionality.\n([#6277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6277))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- **Asynchronous Message Handling and Cloud Optimization**: A new pull request aims to improve message service handlers to perform asynchronous operations and optimize for cloud platforms ([#6279](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6279)).\n- **Generic Type Support for Event Handlers**: A pull request was opened to add generic type support for custom event handlers in the core, which has already been merged and completed ([#6276](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6276)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Dashboard and Performance Optimizations\nSeveral issues related to dashboard loading times and database performance were addressed and closed, indicating a focus on improving user experience and backend efficiency.\n- Reduced dashboard loading time, addressing concerns about 10-15 second load times ([#6248](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6248)).\n- Tested Railway database for performance improvements, switching from Neon ([#6250](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6250)).\n- Redesigned the dashboard as the primary landing experience to clarify agent and app creation, and monetization ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).\n- Prioritized apps on the dashboard to highlight their deployment value ([#6225](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6225)).\n\n### Agent Builder and UI/UX Improvements\nMultiple issues focused on refining the agent builder interface and overall user experience were resolved.\n- Fixed stale room state after character edits, which previously caused 403 errors and required page refreshes ([#6260](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6260)).\n- Added post-agent-creation next steps to guide users on deploying agents in apps ([#6226](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6226)).\n- Moved the avatar button to position #4 in the agent builder for better flow ([#6273](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6273)).\n- Ensured consistency of the \"Create Agent Button\" across \"My Agents\" and \"Dashboard\" ([#6274](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6274)).\n- Implemented a warning for unsaved changes when users attempt to leave agent edit mode ([#6275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6275)).\n- Refined the agent builder interface ([#6268](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6268)).\n- Added a tooltip for the system prompt ([#6270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6270)).\n- Implemented an inline \"send message\" button ([#6271](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6271)).\n- Added Topics/Adjectives to a form ([#6272](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6272)).\n\n### Platform and Content Updates\nSeveral issues related to platform features, content, and branding were closed.\n- Replaced polling with true SSE streaming for real-time updates, ensuring offline fallback and React error boundary support, and adding typed events ([#5930](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5930)).\n- Updated the Brandkit on GitHub to sync with the most recent version ([#6091](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6091)).\n- Resolved an error where the MessageBusService reported \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_LARGE,\" which prevented agents from responding ([#6140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6140)).\n- Implemented inline image/video generation within chat bubbles ([#6189](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6189)).\n- Added a chat interface to the landing page to route users based on their goals ([#6223](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6223)).\n- Elevated \"Apps\" to a first-class product section with its own dedicated area ([#6224](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6224)).\n- Changed UI terminology from \"MCP\" to \"Services\" to encompass broader integrations ([#6241](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6241)).\n- Addressed documentation updates ([#6264](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6264)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### User Experience and Feedback\nNew issues have been opened to enhance user interaction and gather feedback.\n- **Chat Renaming**: A new issue proposes summarizing chat names for better organization ([#6278](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6278)).\n- **Feedback Mechanism**: An issue was created to add a feedback button for users to submit their input ([#6280](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6280)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

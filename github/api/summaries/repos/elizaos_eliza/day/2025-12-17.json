Several new issues were opened focusing on performance and usability.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n- **Dependency Management & Performance Optimization:**\n    - Removed 10 unused dependencies to reduce bundle size and maintenance burden, identifying root causes in Taskmaster AI setup, SQLite implementation, and summaries page markdown processing. ([#173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/173))\n    - Implemented adaptive rate limiting for 60% faster multi-repo ingestion, integrating a feature from M3-org/op-hiscores and fixing pipeline workflow step ordering. ([#159](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/159))\n    - Resolved a Next.js upgrade blocking RSC serialization error by adding 'use client' to `StatCardsDisplay.tsx`. ([#176](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/176))\n\n- **User Interface & Experience Enhancements:**\n    - Implemented guided onboarding overlays and added placeholder text to empty input fields for improved user guidance. ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6228](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6228))\n    - Enhanced agent interaction by allowing text input while the agent is processing and enabling avatar creation and save/deploy actions via chat. ([#6229](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6229), [#6230](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6230), [#6231](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6231))\n    - Improved clarity and navigation with button renames (\"Save\" to \"Deploy\", \"Build\" to \"Edit\") and the addition of a three-dot menu to agent cards. ([#6232](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6232), [#6233](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6233), [#6234](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6234))\n\n- **Agent Builder & Knowledge Management Refinements:**\n    - Streamlined file uploads by increasing the visibility of the \"Choose Files\" button and removing the two-step upload process. ([#6238](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6238), [#6239](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6239))\n    - Renamed the \"Knowledge\" section to \"Files\" and replaced \"RAG\" terminology with plain language for better user understanding. ([#6237](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6237), [#6240](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6240))\n    - Fixed avatar mismatch issues and ensured chat suggestions in edit mode correctly modify the agent builder rather than triggering agent responses.

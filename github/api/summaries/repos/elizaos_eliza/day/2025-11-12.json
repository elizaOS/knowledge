  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 12, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on integrating ElizaOS references into the runtime and fixing a critical bug related to environment variable loading, ensuring agents correctly access settings.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core Runtime Enhancements\nAn ElizaOS reference was added to the runtime, improving the core framework's foundational elements. This change is non-breaking and relates to a unified messaging API. ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111))\n\n### Environment Variable Handling Fix\nA significant bug was addressed where environment variables were not correctly loaded from `process.env` when not defined in a `.env` file. This fix ensures that `runtime.getSetting()` functions as expected, preventing agents from using undefined variables. ([#6141](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6141))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

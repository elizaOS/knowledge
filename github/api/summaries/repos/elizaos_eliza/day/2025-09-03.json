  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 3, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing the monorepo's stability and release processes. Key achievements include unifying NPM release workflows, updating Bun to its latest version, and significant bug fixes across the CLI and core components, improving logging and port handling.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Streamlined Release Workflows and Infrastructure Updates\nEfforts were made to standardize and improve the monorepo's release infrastructure. This included unifying all NPM release workflows to follow a consistent pattern, ensuring a more maintainable and predictable release pipeline ([#5877](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5877)). Additionally, Bun was updated to its latest version (1.2.21) across the entire monorepo, addressing inconsistencies and outdated versions in various packages and workflows ([#5874](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5874)).\n\n### Enhanced CLI Testing and Stability\nSignificant work went into improving the robustness of the CLI. A new GitHub Actions workflow was introduced to test published alpha versions of the CLI package, ensuring cross-platform compatibility ([#5873](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5873)). Several critical bug fixes were implemented, including resolving port detection issues for automatic fallback in the CLI ([#5876](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5876)) and simplifying the alpha CLI tests to focus on basic smoke tests for better reliability ([#5875](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5875)).\n\n### Core Component Refinements and Bug Fixes\nThe core components received attention to improve their stability and functionality. A bug affecting the logger's debug level and style was fixed, enhancing terminal readability and ensuring debug logs function correctly ([#5849](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5849)). A dependency issue with `crypto-browserify` in the `@elizaos/core` package was resolved, preventing build failures ([#5872](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5872)). An unhandled promise in Action Update within `plugin-bootstrap` was also addressed ([#5870](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5870)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Core Functionality and Scenario Enhancements\nTwo key issues related to core functionality and scenario testing were closed. This includes the successful implementation of Dynamic Prompting for multi-turn conversations in ElizaOS scenarios, enabling more sophisticated testing of agent behavior ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819)). Additionally, progress was made on moving to a pure core, ensuring its functionality and preparing for browser support and streaming ([#5766](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5766)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Publishing Visibility\nDiscussion continues on the issue of a successfully published plugin not being visible in the PR ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)). The user confirmed publishing `plugin-delta@0.1.0` to NPM using `elizaos publish --npm`. However, the plugin is not appearing in the registry's pull requests. A core team member clarified that the `--npm` flag only publishes to NPM and bypasses the registry and GitHub steps. They advised the user to remove the registry clone from their organization, re-run `elizaos publish` without the `--npm` flag, and be aware of potential naming conflicts if the package already exists on NPM. The user has since created a PR to the registry.\n\n### Clarifying Rate Limiting Documentation\nThe issue regarding clarifying documentation about the Basic Tier requirement to avoid rate limiting errors ([#40](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/40)) saw an update. A rate limiter has been implemented to only request posts if the monthly read limit has not been reached, addressing the concern about excessive API calls."

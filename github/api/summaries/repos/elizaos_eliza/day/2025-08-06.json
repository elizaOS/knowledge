  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 6, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW\nToday's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure, improving database support, and expanding API capabilities. Significant progress was made in ensuring E2E test coverage across all starter templates and integrating the new Sessions API.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure & Coverage\nEfforts were made to ensure robust testing across the ElizaOS ecosystem. A critical bug fix enabled End-to-End (E2E) testing for all starter templates, addressing previous inconsistencies and improving integration validation for developers ([#5720](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5720)).\n\n### API Client Expansion and Core Cleanup\nThe API client was updated to include support for the new Sessions API, providing a simplified interface for managing stateful conversations ([#5717](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5717)). Additionally, a significant cleanup operation removed unused plugin specification systems from the core package, reducing technical debt ([#5724](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5724)).\n\n### Improved Database Support\nThe system now includes better support for `plugin-mysql`, allowing for its use before `plugin-sql` is enforced, which improves flexibility in database configurations ([#5718](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5718)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- **Feature Development**: A new pull request, [#5723](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5723), was opened to add a comprehensive scenario testing system, indicating future enhancements to testing capabilities.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed on Aug 6, 2025.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n- **Documentation & Communication Gaps**: A new issue, [#5722](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5722), highlights that the `CHANGELOG.md` has not been updated since January and questions the whereabouts of the ElizaOS blog.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n- **`pdfjs-dist` Crashing Plugin**: Issue [#37](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/37) reports a `pdfjs-dist` error causing plugin crashes, specifically a `TypeError: process.getBuiltinModule is not a function`. User `0xbbjoker` attempted to reproduce the issue by clearing agent memories, stopping/restarting the agent with debug logging, and confirmed that document loading and panel functionality worked on their end. They requested more setup details from the reporter, `znahas`, including how documents are loaded and if specific PDFs are involved."

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Dec 9, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day's development focused on significant code cleanup and refactoring, removing technical debt across various packages to improve code quality and maintainability.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Extensive Codebase Cleanup and Refactoring\nA substantial effort was made to remove \"slop\" from the codebase, including fixing `any` and `unknown` types, eliminating unnecessary `try-catch` blocks, removing sloppy comments, and deleting dead files and code. This cleanup touched numerous files across `api-client`, `cli`, and `app` packages, enhancing overall code quality and maintainability. ([#6213](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6213))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request, [#6214](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6214), was opened to address fixing the Telegram bot for Railway deployment.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed on this date.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported on this date.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Twitter Integration Database Error\nIssue [#39](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/39) continues to be active, concerning a Twitter error related to SQL database operations, specifically an `insert into \"memories\"` query failing due to a foreign key constraint violation. The latest comment from `soyrubio` confirms the issue persists when using PostgreSQL with `elizaos v1.5.15` and `twitter-plugin v1.2.22`, indicating the problem is still present in recent versions. Previous discussions highlighted a temporary workaround of deleting `.elizadb` before startup and confirmed the issue with `plugin 1.2.21` and `elizaOS 1.5.10`."

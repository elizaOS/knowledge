  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 3, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on code cleanup within the `plugin-sql` package, specifically removing unused schema factory code. Discussions continued on migrating to Zod v4 and troubleshooting import issues with Eliza CLI 1.61.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Codebase Cleanup and Optimization\n*   Removed unused `SchemaFactory` code and its associated integration tests from the `plugin-sql` package, streamlining the codebase. ([#6029](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6029))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Zod v4 Migration Progress\nDiscussion on migrating all dependencies and plugins to Zod v4 ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) continued, with `standujar` providing an update on initiating approximately 20-25 pull requests across various plugins to bump dependencies to the latest compatible Zod version.\n\n### Eliza CLI 1.61 Import Issues\nTroubleshooting for import errors in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) is ongoing. `0xbbjoker` confirmed the issue was not reproducible on their end with version 1.6.1 and provided steps for a clean rebuild. `matteo-brandolino` clarified that the issue occurs in a newly created project and persists despite the project running as expected with `elizaos start`, suggesting a potential type-related problem with the `@elizaos/core` package specific to their setup."

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 7, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on critical bug fixes, particularly addressing issues with `plugin-bootstrap` and `plugin-sql` related to server ID changes and PGLite compatibility. Several new issues were opened to optimize runtime initialization and database queries, alongside the closure of numerous UI/UX and agent management issues.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Plugin Bug Fixes and Compatibility\nA significant bug fix was implemented in `plugin-bootstrap` to address issues arising from a `serverId` to `messageServerId` change, impacting actions and providers. Additionally, a minor fix was applied to `plugin-sql`'s schema. This resolves user reports of version 1.7.0 not working as expected.\n[#6333](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6333)\n\n### Database and Runtime Optimization Initiatives\nNew pull requests and issues highlight a strong focus on performance. Efforts are underway to optimize runtime initialization through parallelization and atomic upserts, and to skip the `pgcrypto` extension for PGLite in `plugin-sql`.\n[#6339](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6339), [#6342](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6342)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#6339](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6339): Fix for `plugin-sql` to skip the `pgcrypto` extension when using PGLite.\n- [#6342](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6342): Optimization for runtime initialization, focusing on parallelization and atomic upserts.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Agent Management and User Experience Improvements\nSeveral issues related to agent creation, management, and user interaction have been closed. This includes ensuring unique usernames for agents, handling blank agent names, and improving the display of agent avatars and responses.\n[#6306](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6306), [#6307](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6307), [#6308](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6308), [#6309](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6309), [#6319](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6319), [#6321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6321), [#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322)\n\n### Chat Interface and Feature Refinements\nEnhancements to the chat interface and core features were completed, such as dynamic chat box sizing, improved chat summaries, limiting messages for non-signed-up users, and separating public agent states for better user flow.\n[#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310), [#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311), [#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312), [#6313](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6313)\n\n### Wallet Integration and Authentication\nIssues related to wallet connection flow and authentication have been addressed, including direct navigation to wallet options and the implementation of JWT authentication and user management.\n[#6317](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6317), [#6327](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6327)\n\n### Minor Fixes and Adjustments\nOther closed issues include a fix for `plugin-sql` to skip the `pgcrypto` extension for PGLite, a reduction in free credit amounts, and improvements to page scrolling.\n[#6340](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6340), [#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315), [#6318](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6318)\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Performance and Optimization\nNew issues have been opened to focus on optimizing various aspects of the system, including runtime initialization, database query patterns (UPSERT), provider batching, and message processing parallelization.\n[#6334](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6334), [#6335](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6335), [#6336](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6336), [#6337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6337)\n\n### Security and Reliability\nA critical issue was identified regarding a TOCTOU race condition in credit deduction for streaming endpoints, requiring an \"deduct-before, reconcile-after\" pattern for a fix.\n[#6338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6338)\n\n### New Features\nA new feature request has been created for \"Apps promotion\".\n[#6341](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6341)\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Discord Plugin Publication Failure\nIssue [#40](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/40) concerns the failure to publish Discord plugin version v1.3.4, leading to a jump to v1.3.5. The latest comment from `odilitime` on Jan 7, 2026, indicates that v1.3.6 was attempted but not published. Analysis of logs shows v1.3.3 as the last successfully published version on NPM. The comment details specific TypeScript errors encountered during publish attempts on Dec 23rd, related to type mismatches for `EventPayloadMap` and `DiscordRegisterCommandsPayload`, and issues with `params` being of type `unknown`. The `package.json` dependencies for `elizaos/config` (1.6.5) and `elizaos/^1.7.0` are also noted."

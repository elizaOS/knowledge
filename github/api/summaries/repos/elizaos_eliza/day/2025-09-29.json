  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 29, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing agent run visualization, improving package publishing reliability, and strengthening security by restricting local environment access in production.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Agent Run Visualization\nA new interactive timeline component has been added to provide detailed insights into agent execution flow and performance metrics, significantly improving the visualization of agent runs. ([#6016](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6016))\n\n### Improved Package Publishing and Security\nThe package publishing process on NPM was made more robust by adding public access configuration and extending the release workflow to handle individual package publishing. Additionally, a production guard was implemented to prevent exposing or mutating local `.env` via API in production environments. ([#6012](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6012), [#6014](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6014))\n\n### Dependency Updates\nThe `zod` package was upgraded to version `4.1.11` across the monorepo to align package resolutions and ensure consistency. ([#6015](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6015))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Discord Plugin Configuration\nA new configuration option is requested for the Discord plugin to allow the agent to respond only when explicitly mentioned or called by its configured name. ([#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013))\n\n### Plugin Directory Command Issues\nThere is a reported issue where `elizaos dev` and `elizaos start` commands are not working as expected within plugin directories, preventing the loading of plugins with test characters. ([#6017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6017))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

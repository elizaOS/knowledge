  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 20, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on critical bug fixes, including aligning server tests with ElizaOS API changes and enhancing CLI functionality. Significant progress was also made in closing several long-standing issues.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **Server Test Alignment and Modernization**: Server tests and routers were aligned with new ElizaOS interfaces, clarifying plugin auto-injection behavior. Middleware, loader, socket, and utility tests were deflaked and modernized, improving overall server stability and reliability ([#6135](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6135)).\n*   **CLI OpenRouter Embedding Support**: The ElizaOS CLI now includes native embedding support for OpenRouter, simplifying integration by removing the need for separate embedding provider configurations ([#6142](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6142)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n*   **Dependency Migration and Billing Logic Implementation**: The migration of all dependencies and plugins to Zod v4 was completed ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)). Additionally, the container billing logic, including monthly cron deductions, container pausing, and email notifications, has been fully implemented ([#6124](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6124)).\n*   **UI and Wallet Integration Issues Resolved**: The Figma UI implementation on the cloud has been completed ([#6153](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6153)). An issue regarding Snapshot Eligibility and Tangem Wallet Connection has also been closed ([#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n*   **New UI Component Requests**: Two new UI component requests have been opened: one for \"Buttons (Yes + No)\" ([#6162](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6162)) and another for \"PnL Cards\" ([#6163](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6163)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

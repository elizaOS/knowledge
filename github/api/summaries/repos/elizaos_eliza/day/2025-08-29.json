  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 29, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on critical bug fixes, addressing issues with TypeScript declarations in the npm package and resolving build failures for new projects created with `elizaos create`. A significant issue regarding image generation in Discord was also actively discussed and troubleshooting steps provided.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **Build System and Package Fixes:**\n    *   Fixed TypeScript declarations in the npm package by pointing `package.json` to existing generated types, resolving broken re-exports ([#5846](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5846)).\n    *   Resolved `elizaos create` command build failures for new projects by moving starter build scripts locally, preventing \"Cannot find module\" errors ([#5845](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5845)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n*   **Benchmark Suite Closure:**\n    *   The issue tracking the creation of a repeatable benchmark suite for Eliza v2 vs. v3, aimed at measuring accuracy, latency, and cost, has been closed ([#5764](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5764)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n*   **Discord Image Generation Troubleshooting:**\n    *   Discussion continued on the issue of generated images not appearing in Discord, despite showing in the web UI ([#5809](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5809)).\n    *   Detailed troubleshooting steps were provided, covering Discord bot permissions (EMBED\\_LINKS, ATTACH\\_FILES, SEND\\_MESSAGES), bot setup in server roles, environment variable configuration (`DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID`, `DISCORD_API_TOKEN`), plugin loading in `character.ts`, log checking, and correct bot invitation URL with necessary permissions.\n    *   The user confirmed they would try the suggested solutions."

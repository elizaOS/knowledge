  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 27, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, ElizaOS focused on enhancing core messaging infrastructure with a unified API, introducing a new Jobs API for one-off agent messaging, and implementing a CLI command for cloud authentication.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Unified Messaging and Agent Communication\nA unified messaging API (`elizaOS.sendMessage()`) was implemented to streamline communication across all ElizaOS clients, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability. This is complemented by a new Jobs API for one-off agent messaging, allowing external systems to send single messages and poll for responses without persistent sessions, ideal for stateless integrations.\n- [#6095](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6095)\n- [#6098](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6098)\n\n### CLI Cloud Authentication\nA new `elizaos login` CLI command was added to enable cloud authentication, facilitating integration with ElizaOS Cloud services.\n- [#6100](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6100)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#6101](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6101) feat: Add PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) multi-tenant isolation\n- [#6099](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6099) feat(server): Add x402 payment middleware to Jobs API\n- [#6097](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6097) feat: Add Jobs API for one-off agent messaging\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Unified Messaging API Implementation\nThe issue concerning the implementation of a unified messaging API through the ElizaOS Wrapper has been closed, with a related pull request addressing the requirement.\n- [#6096](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6096)\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

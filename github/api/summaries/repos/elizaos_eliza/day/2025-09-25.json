  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 25, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw significant refactoring efforts aimed at improving runtime initialization and service registration coordination, alongside addressing critical issues related to dependency migration and CLI simplification.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core Runtime Refactoring\nMultiple pull requests were opened to refactor the core runtime, focusing on making initialization idempotent and enhancing service registration. This includes replacing the service initialization queue with an embedding model promise for better coordination.\n- [#6004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6004)\n- [#6002](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6002)\n- [#6001](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6001)\n\n### Documentation and Typo Fixes\nA minor documentation fix was introduced to correct a typo, ensuring accuracy in project documentation.\n- [#6000](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6000)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#6004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6004): This PR focuses on refactoring the core runtime to ensure idempotent initialization and improved coordination of service registration.\n- [#6002](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6002): This PR aims to replace the existing service initialization queue with an embedding model promise, streamlining the initialization process.\n- [#6001](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6001): Similar to #6004, this PR also addresses making runtime initialization idempotent and enhancing service registration coordination.\n- [#6000](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6000): This PR is a documentation enhancement to fix a typo.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### CLI Refactoring and Simplification\nThe issue concerning the refactoring of the Eliza CLI was closed. The discussion highlighted the need to simplify the CLI by delegating logic to project directories and streamlining its role to configuration and execution. The proposed solution involves a clear distinction of responsibilities between the server package, CLI, and starter projects.\n- [#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)\n\n### Dependency Migration and Plugin Compatibility\nAn issue related to `zod/v4` not loading and causing several plugins to fail was closed. The problem was resolved by manually adding `zod` using `bun add zod`, indicating a dependency management issue that was temporarily fixed.\n- [#5995](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5995)\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Unhandled Exceptions in Runtime Initialization\nA new issue was reported regarding unhandled exceptions when `getAgents()` fails in `runtime.ts`, specifically if the agents table is missing. This indicates a potential robustness issue during `AgentRuntime` initialization.\n- [#6003](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6003)\n\n### Zod v4 Migration Across Monorepo\nA new issue was opened to track the migration of all dependencies and plugins within the Eliza monorepo from Zod v3 to Zod v4. This is a significant undertaking, with initial steps already taken to update dependencies in various plugins.\n- [#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

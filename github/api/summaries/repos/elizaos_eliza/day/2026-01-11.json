  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 11, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, the ElizaOS team focused on addressing several existing issues, particularly around runtime optimization, database query patterns, and various UI/UX improvements. Additionally, two new pull requests were opened, introducing core documentation guides and a new plugin for x402 micropayments.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo completed work was reported for this period.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nTwo new pull requests were opened today:\n- [#6356](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6356) introduces core documentation guides, aiming to improve the project's documentation.\n- [#6355](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6355) adds a new plugin, `plugin-blockrun`, to support x402 micropayments.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Performance and Database Optimization\nSeveral issues related to performance and database interactions were closed. This includes optimizing runtime initialization by adding missing checks and removing redundant lookups, and exploring parallelization for independent operations [#6334](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6334). Additionally, efforts were made to implement UPSERT patterns for database queries, replacing check-then-insert with `onConflictDoNothing()` and optimizing `getEntitiesByIds()` to avoid cartesian products [#6335](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6335).\n\n### UI/UX and Content Refinements\nA series of user interface and experience issues were addressed. This includes standardizing the size of certain UI elements [#6344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6344), resolving intermittent web search functionality problems [#6345](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6345), and implementing default capitalization for agent names in the mobile agent builder [#6346](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6346). Furthermore, new copy was introduced for both the agent edit [#6347](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6347) and agent builder [#6348](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6348) sections.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\nNo new issues were reported for this period.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments were reported for this period."

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 11, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, the ElizaOS team focused on addressing several existing issues, particularly around runtime optimization, database query patterns, and various UI/UX improvements. Additionally, new development began on core documentation and a plugin for x402 micropayments.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo completed work was reported for Jan 11, 2026.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nTwo new pull requests were opened today:\n- [#6356](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6356) introduces core documentation guides, aiming to enhance the project's documentation.\n- [#6355](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6355) adds a new feature, `plugin-blockrun`, to support x402 micropayments.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Performance and Database Optimization\nSeveral issues related to performance and database interactions were closed. This includes optimizing runtime initialization by adding missing checks and removing redundant lookups, as well as exploring parallelization of independent operations [#6334](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6334). Additionally, efforts were made to implement UPSERT patterns for database queries, replacing check-then-insert operations with `onConflictDoNothing()` and optimizing `getEntitiesByIds()` to prevent cartesian products [#6335](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6335).\n\n### UI/UX and Agent Builder Improvements\nMultiple user interface and user experience issues were addressed. This includes standardizing the size of display boxes [#6344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6344), resolving intermittent web search functionality problems [#6345](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6345), and implementing changes to the agent builder on mobile to default agent names to start with a capital letter [#6346](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6346).\n\n### Content and Copy Updates\nUpdates were made to the textual content within the application. This involved implementing new copy for the agent edit interface [#6347](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6347) and the agent builder interface [#6348](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6348).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\nNo new issues were reported for Jan 11, 2026.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments were reported for Jan 11, 2026."

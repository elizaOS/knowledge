  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 31, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on critical bug fixes, primarily addressing TypeScript declaration optimizations and resolving a significant CLI NPM deployment path issue. These fixes enhance the stability and usability of the ElizaOS framework.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core Package Stability Improvements\nSignificant efforts were made to enhance the stability of the core package. This included optimizing TypeScript declarations to improve build efficiency and ensure correct type inference within the npm package.\n- Optimized TypeScript declarations in the npm package: [#5848](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5848)\n\n### CLI Deployment and Path Resolution Fixes\nA critical issue affecting the CLI's global installation via npm was resolved. This fix ensures that the CLI can correctly locate its modules after being published and installed, preventing \"Cannot find module\" errors.\n- Fixed CLI NPM Deployment Path Resolution Issue: [#5852](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5852)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#5855](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5855): Fixes related to plugin import verification, aiming to address failures on Ubuntu/macOS.\n- [#5854](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5854): Addresses the use of Node.js crypto in the Node build to unblock Ubuntu/macOS CLI tests.\n- [#5853](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5853): Resolves a module resolution error within the `copyTemplate` function.\n- [#5851](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5851): Aims to resolve build warnings and CSS syntax errors.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### CLI Project Creation Failure\nA new issue was reported regarding a \"path not found\" error when attempting to create a new project using the CLI, indicating a module resolution problem during project initialization.\n- path not found: [#5856](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5856)\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### V3 Goals Discussion\nDiscussions continued on the V3 Goals, with a focus on streaming functionality. A user inquired about the status of streaming and its importance for reducing response latency. A detailed analysis by \"claude\" outlined the feasibility and backward compatibility of each V3 goal, providing implementation recommendations and a migration strategy. The analysis categorized goals by risk and suggested an incremental migration approach.\n- V3 Goals: [#4720](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4720)\n\n### Streaming Response Implementation\nUpdates were provided on the optional stream responses feature. A user confirmed implementing streaming support by modifying core files, noting that it's not yet an official solution but demonstrates feasibility.\n- Add optional Stream responses to handle streaming: [#5060](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5060)\n\n### Discord Image Generation Issue\nThe issue of generated images not appearing in Discord was further investigated. A user confirmed that permissions were correct and that image generation works in the web UI but not in Discord, despite the bot describing the image. Debugging steps and potential causes related to Discord bot permissions and configuration were previously provided.\n- Image Generation not working in Discord: [#5809](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5809)"

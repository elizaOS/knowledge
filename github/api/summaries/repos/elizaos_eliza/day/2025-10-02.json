  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 2, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw the introduction of a new feature to enhance agent response logic and the reporting of an issue concerning module imports in new Eliza CLI projects.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request, [#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030), was opened to add a `mentionContext` interface and improve the `shouldRespond` logic, aiming to refine how agents interact and respond within conversations.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n- **CLI Import Issues**: A new issue, [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031), was reported regarding \"Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61\". This issue describes `Module '\"@Elizaos/core\"' has no exported member 'logger'` and `IAgentRuntime'` errors when creating a new project using `elizaos create`.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n- **CLI Import Issues Investigation**: On [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031), user 0xbbjoker reported that the issue does not reproduce on their setup with Eliza CLI 1.6.1 and provided troubleshooting steps including clearing `node_modules` and reinstalling dependencies. User matteo-brandolino confirmed that the project was newly created with `elizaos create` and works when running `elizaos start`, suggesting the problem might be related to type definitions from `@elizaos/core` specific to their environment."

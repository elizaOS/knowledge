  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 8, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, the ElizaOS team focused on significant code quality improvements, dependency standardization, and migration to `bunx`. Key achievements include comprehensive code formatting, removal of obsolete files, and critical bug fixes related to XML parsing and logging. Several maintenance chores were also completed, updating package versions.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Codebase Refinement and Standardization\nThe team implemented comprehensive code formatting and linting improvements across the entire ElizaOS codebase to enhance code quality, consistency, and maintainability ([#5740](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5740)). Additionally, obsolete `llms.txt` was removed, and all internal package dependencies were standardized to use the workspace protocol, streamlining dependency management ([#5744](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5744)).\n\n### Build System and XML Parser Enhancements\nMigration from `npx` to `bunx` was completed in GitHub workflows and package scripts, improving build efficiency. The XML parser was also enhanced, replacing an unsafe fallback regex with a linear scan to avoid potential issues ([#5742](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5742), [#5741](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5741)).\n\n### Logging System Fixes\nMissing `pino` logger refactors were addressed, converting logger calls across the repository to object-first structured logging. This aligns with `pino` typings and fixes TypeScript/DTS errors, improving type-safety and log structure without functional behavior changes ([#5737](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5737)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Release Workflow Fixes\nA critical issue where the release workflow incorrectly replaced `@elizaos` packages with version numbers in the monorepo was identified and closed ([#5730](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5730)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Build and Development Environment Issues\nA build failure in `@elizaos/core` was reported, causing `bun run clean` to fail due to TypeScript errors during the DTS build phase ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738)). This issue is currently blocking testing of advanced mocking, natural language agent interaction, and dynamic plugin loading.\n\n### Cloud-Related Bug Fixing\nA new issue was opened to track and fix bugs within `eliza-cloud` ([#5747](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5747)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Eliza CLI Project Build Failure\nThe issue regarding the ElizaOS CLI failing to build projects ([#5734](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5734)) remains active. The problem was identified as missing placeholders in `logger.info` calls within project templates, which was fixed by adding `%s` as per Pino documentation. The latest comment suggests that this issue might be resolved in version 1.4.x."

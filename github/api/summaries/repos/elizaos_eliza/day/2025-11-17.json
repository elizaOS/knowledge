  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 17, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day's development focused on a critical dependency migration, updating LangChain from v0.3 to `@langchain/textsplitters v1.0` to ensure compatibility and leverage newer functionalities. This update addressed a long-standing deprecation issue, enhancing the stability of the `@elizaos/core` package.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Dependency Migration and Core Updates\nThe core package underwent a significant update, migrating from the deprecated LangChain v0.3 to `@langchain/textsplitters v1.0`. This involved replacing the `langchain` dependency with `@langchain/textsplitters` in `@elizaos/core`, updating import paths, and removing outdated LangChain resolutions from plugin starter packages. This change ensures the project utilizes current and supported libraries. ([#6152](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6152))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request was opened to bump the `glob` dependency from `11.0.3` to `11.1.0` within the `/packages/core` directory, specifically in the `npm_and_yarn` group. ([#6157](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6157))\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### LangChain Deprecation Resolution\nThe issue concerning the deprecation of LangChain v0.3 and the need to migrate to a newer version or `langchain-classic` was successfully closed. This was resolved by the migration to `@langchain/textsplitters v1.0`. ([#6145](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6145))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### DeepSeek API Integration Inquiry\nA new feature request was opened to explore the possibility of using the DeepSeek API with ElizaOS. The user inquired if it's possible to integrate DeepSeek, potentially through an OpenAI-compatible endpoint or the `plugin-openrouter`. ([#6156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6156))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nThere are no active issues with more than 3 comments."

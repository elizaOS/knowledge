  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 10, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant improvements in monitoring, debugging, and backend infrastructure for agent runs tracking. Several critical bug fixes were also implemented, enhancing overall stability and compatibility.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Monitoring and Debugging Capabilities\nEfforts were made to improve the observability and debuggability of the ElizaOS framework. This includes integrating Sentry's Vercel AI for better error tracking on deployments and refining client-side debugging with sourcemaps and preserved function names. The Sentry browser SDK was also removed from the core package to optimize size and prevent conflicts.\n- [#5963](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5963)\n- [#5962](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5962)\n- [#5961](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5961)\n\n### Backend Infrastructure for Agent Runs Tracking\nA major feature implemented today is the backend support for tracking agent runs. This involves adding structured logging and necessary API client services, laying the groundwork for comprehensive monitoring of agent activities.\n- [#5953](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5953)\n\n### Critical Bug Fixes and Compatibility Improvements\nSeveral bugs were addressed to enhance the stability and compatibility of the system. These fixes include resolving type compatibility issues in the API client, correcting TypeScript build errors in the `plugin-bootstrap` package, and refining action notification logic for client chat messages.\n- [#5960](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5960)\n- [#5959](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5959)\n- [#5957](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5957)\n\n### Dependency Updates\nThe `vite` dependency in the client package was updated to a newer version, ensuring the use of the latest features and bug fixes from the Vite ecosystem.\n- [#5946](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5946)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Core System Stability and Logging\nTwo key issues related to the core system's stability and logging mechanisms were resolved. This includes fixing a broken logger and addressing an implementation detail for Tau-Bench in v2.\n- [#5886](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5886)\n- [#5765](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5765)\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Documentation and Workshop Preparation\nNew issues were opened to address documentation improvements, including a broken LLM link and a general push to clear out docs-related issues. Preparation for the ETH Tokyo Workshop was also initiated.\n- [#5954](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5954)\n- [#5955](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5955)\n- [#5956](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5956)\n\n### Browser Support and Plugin Integration\nA new issue was created to fully wrap up browser support. Additionally, several issues were opened to track the integration of new plugins from the `elizaos-plugins` organization, including `plugin-quickswap`, `plugin-alethea`, `plugin-rofl`, `plugin-polymarket`, `plugin-polygon-zkevm`, and `plugin-polygon`.\n- [#5958](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5958)\n- [#5947](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5947)\n- [#5948](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5948)\n- [#5949](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5949)\n- [#5950](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5950)\n- [#5951](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5951)\n- [#5952](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5952)\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

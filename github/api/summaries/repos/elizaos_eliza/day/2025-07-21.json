  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 21, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing agent capabilities with new examples, critical bug fixes for data handling and CLI stability, and a significant refactoring to standardize prompt formats. Documentation was also improved with key component clarifications.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core Agent Functionality & Data Handling Improvements\nA new feature was added to include post examples in the default Eliza character, which is crucial for enabling Twitter posting functionality ([#5652](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5652)). A critical bug fix addressed issues with JSON string handling in SQL base operations, ensuring proper insertion of `content` and `metadata` as `jsonb` types ([#5628](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5628)).\n\n### CLI Stability and Development Workflow Enhancements\nSignificant progress was made in stabilizing the CLI development environment by fixing test failures related to missing dependencies and improving server subprocess output handling ([#5641](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5641)). An unused development script was also removed, cleaning up the codebase ([#5651](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5651)).\n\n### Prompt System Refactoring and Documentation\nA comprehensive refactoring effort completed the migration of all JSON prompts to an XML format across the codebase, aiming to improve LLM response reliability ([#5623](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5623)). Additionally, documentation for CLAUDE.md was enhanced to provide critical clarifications on ElizaOS components like Services, Providers, Actions, and Evaluators ([#5642](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5642)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nThree new pull requests were opened:\n- [#5659](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5659) `feat: enhance-logging-rebased`: This PR aims to enhance logging capabilities.\n- [#5658](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5658) `fix: update zod to 3.25 so v3 is there`: This PR addresses a dependency issue by updating the Zod library.\n- [#5650](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5650) `feat: Add Clanker Plugin with SDK v4.0.0 Integration`: This PR introduces a new Clanker Plugin with SDK v4.0.0 integration.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n### CLI Project Creation Fix\nThe issue where the `.elizadb` directory was being created in the wrong location (current working directory instead of inside the project folder) when running `elizaos create` was resolved ([#5616](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5616)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### Core System and Scenario Runner Bugs\nTwo critical bug tickets were opened for the scenario runner: one to audit and fix runtime dependencies for evaluators ([#5640](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5640)) and another to address a bypass issue in the environment provider integration ([#5639](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5639)).\n\n### New Plugin Development and DeFi Integrations\nSeveral new issues were created to track the development of various DeFi-related plugins, including Aave ([#5646](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5646)), Morpho ([#5644](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5644)), Clanker ([#5645](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5645)), Defi-llama ([#5647](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5647)), and Moon-well ([#5648](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5648)). A base agent for \"clank tank\" was also proposed ([#5643](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5643)).\n\n### Documentation and CLI Tooling Enhancements\nNew documentation tasks include adding references for the web socket API ([#5653](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5653)) and MCP plugin docs ([#5654](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5654)), as well as updating action-chaining documentation ([#5656](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5656)). CLI tooling improvements are also being tracked, such as updating the `create-eliza` command for npm deployment ([#5655](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5655)) and addressing a `zod` module error when publishing newly created plugins ([#5657](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5657)). An issue was also opened to add docs for sending messages as an agent via webhooks/routes in plugins ([#5649](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5649)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

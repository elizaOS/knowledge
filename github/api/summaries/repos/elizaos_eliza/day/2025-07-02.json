  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 2, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused heavily on significant UI/UX improvements, particularly redesigning agent cards and chat components to align with new Figma designs. Several bug fixes were also implemented, enhancing overall stability and user experience.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### UI/UX Redesign for Agent Cards and Homepage\nMajor visual overhauls were implemented for the client-side UI. The Agent Card was refined to closely match Figma designs, including layout changes from square/vertical to horizontal ([#5351](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5351), [#5344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5344)). The homepage layout for agent cards was also completely redesigned for a more modern look.\n\n### Chat Component Refactoring and Design Alignment\nThe Chat component, including chat bubbles and the chat view, underwent a significant refactor to align with new Figma designs ([#5349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5349)). This improves the visual consistency and user experience of chat interactions.\n\n### Agent Settings UI Updates and Theming\nThe Agent Settings UI was updated to match design specifications, featuring improved dark theme colors for better contrast and visual consistency ([#5345](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5345)). Form field styling was fixed with proper border radius and increased spacing, and form element order was restructured for better usability.\n\n### Client-Side Bug Fixes and Optimizations\nSeveral critical bug fixes were addressed, including updating the default Eliza avatar to a smaller, optimized size (512x512) to improve app load times ([#5350](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5350)). All TypeScript type issues in `home.tsx` were resolved to ensure complete type safety ([#5346](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5346)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- **Agent Card Refactor**: A new pull request, [#5347](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5347), was opened to continue the refactoring of agent cards.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Plugin and Test Consistency Improvements\nThe issue regarding upgrading BD tier 1-4 plugins was closed ([#5341](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5341)). Additionally, a significant fix was implemented to ensure `bun run test` works consistently across all packages in the monorepo, resolving issues with inconsistent developer experience ([#5218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5218)).\n\n### CLI Input Method Standardization\nAn issue tracking the migration of remaining CLI input methods to use `@clack/prompts` for consistency was closed ([#5295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5295)). This aims to standardize the CLI user experience.\n\n### Initial Setup and Configuration Issues\nSeveral issues related to initial setup and configuration were addressed and closed, including problems with `LOAD_DOCS_ON_STARTUP` and `CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED` settings, and dynamic provider issues ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/31)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Twitter Client Initialization Errors\nA new issue, [#31](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/31), was opened reporting errors during the creation/starting of agents using the Twitter plugin, specifically a client initialization error despite successful authentication.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### CLI Test Command Monorepo Requirement\nIssue [#5142](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5142) discusses the `@elizaos/cli` test command incorrectly requiring a monorepo root for standalone projects. The latest comment from `claude` (2025-07-13) indicates that this issue has been resolved. `claude`'s analysis confirms that the specific error message is no longer present, graceful fallback logic is in place, and standalone projects are properly detected, making the issue resolved.\n\n### Event Message Sent Not Working\nIssue [#5216](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5216) reports that `sendAgentResponseToBus` does not emit `EventType.MESSAGE_SENT` when sending payloads to the central server API endpoint. The latest comment from `wtfsayo` (2025-07-02) asks if the bootstrap plugin was added, suggesting a potential dependency or configuration issue.\n\n### Migrate CLI Input Methods to @clack/prompts\nIssue [#5295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5295) aims to standardize CLI input methods using `@clack/prompts`. While the issue was closed today, the latest comment from `SYMBaiEX` (2025-07-03) requests a review of PR #5359, indicating ongoing work or a recent completion related to this migration.\n\n### Twitter Client Initialization Error\nIssue [#31](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/31) (created today) reports a Twitter client initialization error. Multiple users (`yasir23`, `joaoCarvalho1000`, `RolandOne`, `Ovodo`, `nccuong-vikki`, `myst4`) have confirmed experiencing the same problem. `RolandOne` (2025-07-07) suggests that plugin-twitter version 1.0.14 might fix it but reports a new memory insertion error. `Ovodo` (2025-07-03) questions if this means autonomous Twitter agents are currently not possible and notes that older ElizaOS methods worked. `nccuong-vikki` (2025-07-03) speculates it might be due to limited features of free Twitter subscriptions preventing HomeTimeline fetching."

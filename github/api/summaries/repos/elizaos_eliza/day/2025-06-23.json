  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jun 23, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing API client capabilities with a new type-safe package, alongside critical bug fixes for testing infrastructure and documentation. Significant refactoring of CLI packages also contributed to a more streamlined codebase.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **Enhanced API Client with Type Safety:** A new `@elizaos/api-client` package was introduced, providing a comprehensive, type-safe client for the ElizaOS server API. This includes full TypeScript support and a clean, service-based architecture for various API endpoints, significantly improving developer experience and reducing potential errors. ([#5240](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5240))\n\n*   **CLI Package Streamlining and Refactoring:** The `packages/cli` module underwent significant cleanup, involving the streamlining of command-line options, dependency updates, and simplification of configuration files. This refactoring aims to remove legacy options and improve the overall maintainability of the CLI. ([#5237](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5237))\n\n*   **Critical Test Infrastructure and Documentation Fixes:** Several broken tests were restored following a directory detection centralization refactor, ensuring the reliability of the testing suite. Additionally, minor typographical errors in documentation and code comments were corrected, improving clarity and accuracy. ([#5245](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5245), [#5238](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5238))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n\n*   **Random Fixes:** A new pull request, [#5243](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5243), titled \"Random Fixes,\" was opened today. Its specific contents and progress are yet to be detailed.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\nNo issues were closed on Jun 23, 2025.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n*   **Project Setup and Initial Impressions:** A new issue, [#5249](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5249), was opened regarding difficulties in setting up a project from scratch, with the user reporting struggles over 10 days using various options like `eliza-starter`. The user is seeking assistance with project setup.\n\n*   **Agent Deployment Strategies:** Issue [#5244](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5244) was created to inquire about the best ways to deploy custom Eliza agents. Initial suggestions include Railway and Render.\n\n*   **Knowledge Plugin Configuration Error:** Issue [#26](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/26) reports an `AI_InvalidPromptError` when `CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED=true` is set, preventing the system from processing documents during startup. A comment indicates the user might be using the `load` function incorrectly.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n*   **Web Client Version Mismatch:** Issue [#4924](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4924) continues to be active, with the web client displaying an incorrect version compared to the CLI and core. The latest comment from June 23rd confirms the issue persists in `v1.0.11`, with the client showing `1.0.10` and requesting an update. Earlier comments noted repeated 429 errors from the GitHub API, potentially causing significant memory usage and infinite render loops, though some of these issues might have been resolved in later versions."

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 6, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on critical bug fixes across the CLI and plugin-bootstrap, addressing issues with npm package publishing, image generation, and CLI build stability. A new feature request for native web fetching capability for agents was also briefly opened and closed.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### CLI Stability and Publishing Fixes\nSeveral crucial bug fixes were implemented to enhance the stability and functionality of the CLI. This includes resolving an issue that caused incorrect construction of `npmPackages` values during the `elizaos publish` command, ensuring proper registry additions ([#5882](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5882)). Additionally, compilation errors during the CLI build process, specifically within the scenario command, were addressed to ensure successful TypeScript declaration generation ([#5887](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5887)).\n\n### Plugin Functionality Improvements\nA significant bug fix was deployed for the `plugin-bootstrap` to correct the image generation action. Previously, this action was generating agent images instead of images requested by the user. This fix ensures that image generation now correctly uses the user's request ([#5888](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5888)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Agent Web Interaction Capabilities\nA feature request for native web fetching capability for agents was opened and subsequently closed today ([#5889](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5889)). This request highlighted the current limitation of agents in fetching and analyzing web content from URLs, which restricts their ability to summarize articles, extract information, and analyze web pages.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### Agent Web Fetching Limitation\nA new issue was opened today requesting native web fetching capability for agents ([#5889](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5889)). This feature would enable agents to fetch and analyze web content from URLs, addressing current limitations in summarizing articles, extracting information, and analyzing web pages.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

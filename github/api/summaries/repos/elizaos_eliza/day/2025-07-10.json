  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 10, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant feature additions like action chaining and enhanced code review, alongside critical bug fixes across CLI, documentation, and UI, ensuring a more robust and user-friendly ElizaOS.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core Functionality & AI Workflow Enhancements\nA major feature, action chaining, was implemented, allowing for more complex and sequential agent behaviors by storing action states and return values. Additionally, the Claude code review workflow was significantly enhanced with ElizaOS-specific security and quality guidelines, improving code integrity.\n- [#5436](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5436)\n- [#5519](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5519)\n\n### CLI and Plugin Stability Improvements\nSeveral critical fixes were deployed to improve the stability and compatibility of the CLI and plugins. This includes resolving CLI test failures due to version mismatches, updating plugin-starter dependencies to use workspace versions, and ensuring strict TypeScript return type compliance for action handlers.\n- [#5515](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5515)\n- [#5514](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5514)\n- [#5512](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5512)\n\n### UI and Documentation Refinements\nUser experience was improved by fixing a confusing secret panel UX in the GUI, which previously showed misleading warnings. Documentation build errors were also resolved by removing references to deleted directories, ensuring accurate and up-to-date documentation.\n- [#5501](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5501)\n- [#5513](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5513)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nSeveral new pull requests were opened, indicating active development in new feature areas. These include:\n- [#5517](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5517) feat: pm2\n- [#5510](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5510) feat: training models on own data\n- [#5509](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5509) Add vision (camera and screen)\n- [#5506](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5506) Add planning plugin\n- [#5505](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5505) Add new types\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed on Jul 10, 2025.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nA new issue was reported concerning type errors in the Knowledge Plugin after updating to eliza-1.2.0.\n- [#5518](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5518) Knowledge Plugin: Lots of type errors since updating to eliza-1.2.0\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Plugin Loading and Compatibility Issues\nThe issue [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5499) regarding the `plugin-local-ai` failing to load on Windows (and Mac) is ongoing. The latest comment from `wtfsayo` suggests deprecating the `local-ai` plugin in favor of Ollama, though it's noted that `local-ai` might work on a second startup. `ChristopherTrimboli` previously provided a link to a fixed version (v1.2.1) of the plugin.\n\n### Twitter Client Authentication Failure\nIssue [#36](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/36) concerning the failure to create a Twitter Client (1.0.14) has been marked as fixed with the 1.2.0 update, as confirmed by `RolandOne`. Prior comments from `yasir23` and `joaoCarvalho1000` indicated that other users were experiencing the same error."

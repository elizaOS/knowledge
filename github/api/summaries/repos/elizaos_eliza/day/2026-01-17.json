  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 17, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on addressing several bug fixes related to authentication, event emission, and plugin stability, alongside introducing a new core runtime method. Several new pull requests were opened, and one issue was closed after investigation.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core Runtime Enhancements\nThe core runtime gained a new `unregisterAction` method, enhancing flexibility in managing agent actions. This feature was introduced in two separate pull requests, indicating its importance.\n- [#6375](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6375)\n- [#6372](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6372)\n\n### Authentication and Environment Variable Handling\nMultiple fixes were implemented to ensure proper loading of `.env` files in agent commands, crucial for authentication, and to validate directory paths in CLI operations.\n- [#6376](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6376)\n- [#6374](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6374)\n- [#6379](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6379)\n\n### Plugin and Server Stability Improvements\nEfforts were made to improve the stability of the `plugin-bootstrap` by ensuring entity connections before saving facts and to ensure the `MESSAGE_SENT` event is emitted correctly after sending to the central server.\n- [#6371](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6371)\n- [#6370](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6370)\n- [#6378](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6378)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#6379](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6379) fix(cli): validate directory path in ensureDir to prevent ENOENT error\n- [#6378](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6378) fix(server): emit MESSAGE_SENT event after sending to central server\n- [#6377](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6377) docs: add environment variables documentation\n- [#6376](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6376) fix(cli): load .env files in agent commands for authentication\n- [#6375](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6375) feat: add unregisterAction method to core runtime\n- [#6374](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6374) fix: load .env files in agent commands for authentication\n- [#6373](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6373) fix: send action callbacks to user in multi-step mode\n- [#6372](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6372) feat: add unregisterAction method to core runtime\n- [#6371](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6371) fix(plugin-bootstrap): ensure entity connection before saving facts in reflection evaluator\n- [#6370](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6370) fix(plugin-bootstrap): ensure entity connection before saving facts in reflection evaluator\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Reflection Evaluator Behavior Clarified\nIssue [#6364](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6364), concerning \"Entity not found\" errors in the reflection evaluator, was closed. It was determined that the reported behavior is not a bug but rather the intended design, where `ensureConnection()` is called, and entities are correctly searched within the room. The \"Entity not found\" scenario occurs when an agent attempts to create a relationship with someone not present in the room, which is handled gracefully.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Embedding and Database Configuration Discrepancy\nA new issue [#6380](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6380) reports that the `USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING` setting is not being respected, leading to the use of a 384-dimension zero vector fallback while the database adapter is hardcoded for a 1536-dimension column, causing SQL errors.\n\n### Prompt Character Limit\nIssue [#6381](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6381) highlights a request to eliminate the 500-character limit in the first application prompt.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Discord Integration Error\nIssue [#43](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/43) reports a `this.runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage' is undefined` error, indicating Discord is not working with the latest ElizaOS version. The latest comment suggests this issue is assumed to be fixed with a pending pull request in the `plugin-discord` repository, specifically when paired with `@elizaos/cli` version 1.7.1."

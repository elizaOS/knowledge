  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 16, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant CLI simplification by integrating server/core functionalities and crucial bug fixes in plugin error handling, alongside ongoing architectural refinements.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### CLI Simplification and Core Alignment\nThe CLI has undergone a major refactor to remove duplication by leveraging existing server and core functionalities. This involved deleting custom module loaders and streamlining various CLI commands, leading to a more cohesive and maintainable architecture. This change impacts numerous files across the `cli`, `core`, and `server` packages. ([#6060](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6060))\n\n### Plugin Error Handling Enhancement\nA critical bug fix was implemented to correctly handle ZodError issues in plugins. The change ensures that `error.issues` is used instead of `error.errors` for ZodError API compatibility, improving error handling consistency across `plugin-quick-starter`, `plugin-starter`, and `project-starter`. ([#6035](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6035))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#6068](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6068), was opened to introduce a feature for auto-injecting bootstrap and SQL plugins into the server.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Core Refactoring and Alignment\nIssue [#5933](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5933), \"Refactors & Core Alignment,\" was closed today. This issue aimed to refactor server code to use ElizaOS global functions, decouple bootstrap logic from the CLI, remove CLI \"server-start\" embedding, and clean up modular loaders and resolution hacks.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 27, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day focused on strategic planning with new issues opened for integrating N8N, developing generic webhook services, and improving messaging infrastructure. Research into competitor products and Twilio compliance was completed.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo new technical developments were completed today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request, [#6428](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6428), was opened to create a `SECURITY.md` file.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Competitor Analysis Completed\n- Research into Claudebot was completed, with all team members having set up and used the tool extensively to understand the competition ([#6394](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6394)).\n- An analysis of the Poke app, our form factor model, was completed by all team members, including onboarding and testing iMessage and Telegram flows ([#6395](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6395)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Workflow and Messaging Infrastructure Planning\n- A new issue was opened to integrate the N8N workflow engine as the primary automation layer for the Eliza App, leveraging its pre-built nodes for various services ([#6429](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6429)).\n- Planning for a generic webhook service for stateless messaging plugins (Telegram, WhatsApp, Twilio) was initiated, distinct from the stateful Discord Gateway ([#6430](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6430)).\n- Work on messaging infrastructure, including a UI settings card, webhook endpoints, database tables, and a routing service, was outlined ([#6431](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6431)).\n\n### Performance and Compliance Investigations\n- An issue was created to investigate and resolve a 3-second MCP plugin initialization delay on Vercel, potentially related to WebSocket handshake requirements ([#6432](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6432)).\n- Research into Twilio SMS regulatory compliance was initiated to verify existing account setup and understand message volume limitations ([#6433](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6433)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

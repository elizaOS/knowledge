  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 27, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day focused on critical bug fixes for the V2.0.0 a2a example, resolving protobuf compatibility and runtime errors. Several new infrastructure and plugin-related issues were opened, alongside the closure of two research-oriented issues.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### V2.0.0 A2A Example Bug Fixes\n- Fixed runtime errors in the Python and Rust a2a server examples, ensuring correct handling of protobuf messages. ([#6386](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6386))\n- Changes were isolated to the Python package and the a2a example server, minimizing risk.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request, [#6428](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6428), was opened to create a `SECURITY.md` file.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Competitive Research & User Experience Analysis\n- The team completed research on Claudebot, with all members setting up and using it to understand the competition. ([#6394](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6394))\n- An analysis of the Poke app was concluded, with team members documenting their experience as a form factor model. ([#6395](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6395))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Infrastructure & Messaging Services\n- A generic webhook service is proposed for stateless messaging plugins (Telegram, WhatsApp, Twilio). ([#6430](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6430))\n- Development of a messaging connection UI and routing service is planned, including dashboard settings and webhook endpoints. ([#6431](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6431))\n- Investigation and resolution of a 3-second MCP plugin initialization delay on Vercel due to WebSocket handshake requirements. ([#6432](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6432))\n\n### Plugin Integration & Compliance\n- Integration of the N8N workflow engine as the primary automation layer for Eliza App is proposed, enabling agents to create and execute workflows via natural language. ([#6429](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6429))\n- Research into Twilio SMS regulatory requirements and verification of the existing account setup. ([#6433](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6433))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n- **[Plugin] Integrate N8N Workflow Engine** ([#6429](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6429)): Discussion is active regarding the implementation of a `plugin-n8n`. A detailed proposal outlines four main components: N8N Service, Workflow Actions, Context Providers, and Task Workers. Deliverables include a complete package, database schema, specific actions (CREATE_WORKFLOW, EXECUTE_WORKFLOW, LIST_WORKFLOWS, DELETE_WORKFLOW), providers, documentation, and tests. The contributor is seeking approval to proceed with this feature."

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Feb 2, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, the team focused on infrastructure and billing, with several new issues opened to address payment systems, database migrations, and agent character file improvements. Significant progress was made on integrating messaging plugins and domain acquisition.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\nNo new technical developments were completed today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n### Messaging Plugin Integrations\nThe team successfully integrated the Telegram plugin into the Cloud infrastructure, allowing users to interact with Eliza via Telegram. Additionally, SMS/iMessage capabilities were set up for a native iOS messaging experience, fulfilling the goal of Eliza having a phone number. ([#6397](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6397), [#6399](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6399))\n\n### Domain Acquisition\nThe eliza.app domain was successfully purchased and configured, with DNS pointing to the deployment and an active SSL certificate. ([#6419](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6419))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### Infrastructure and Database Improvements\nNew issues were opened to address critical infrastructure needs, including making a gateway for webhooks, reconstructing Cloud database migrations using Drizzle Kit to prevent developer time loss, and provisioning a second Blue.io phone number to separate development and production environments. ([#6442](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6442), [#6444](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6444), [#6446](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6446))\n\n### Billing and Payment Systems\nDiscussions around billing led to new issues for implementing a credit/billing system for Eliza App users, including Stripe integration and credit warnings. A feature request was also created for a payment infrastructure plugin to enable agent-to-agent transactions. ([#6443](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6443), [#6445](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6445), [#6448](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6448))\n\n### Agent Character and Prompt Engineering\nAn issue was created to improve Eliza's character file and prompts based on initial testing feedback, with a note from Boris highlighting the need for edits. ([#6447](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6447))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Agent Character File & Prompt Engineering\nRenator13 commented on [#6447](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6447), suggesting that prompt engineering overhead is a \"Biological Trap\" and that agents should sync via logic, not prose, referencing MAE-1.0 and a BotNode.io blueprint for optimization."

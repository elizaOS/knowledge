Key bug fixes were implemented to improve the embedding model and the initialization process of the AgentRuntime class. These changes aim to streamline user experience and prevent potential issues in plugin management.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Bug Fixes in Local-AI Plugin\n- Fixed the embedding model functionality by replacing `fastembed` with a local embedding model, addressing issues for users relying on this feature. See [PR #4205](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4205).\n- Resolved a problem with the `runtime.registerPlugin` method to prevent duplicate initialization by adding status tracking to the AgentRuntime class. Refer to [PR #4189](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4189).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n- No issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### OpenAI Plugin Error\n- A new issue was reported regarding the OpenAI Plugin, where using the `gpt-4-vision-preview` model results in a 404 error. This issue highlights the need to address deprecated models in the plugin. More details can be found in [#4210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4210)."

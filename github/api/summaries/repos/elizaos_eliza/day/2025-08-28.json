A new issue was opened to dockerize `project-starter`.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core Enhancements and Browser Compatibility\nSignificant work was done to introduce browser compatibility to the core packages, ensuring broader applicability of ElizaOS components. This involved extensive file modifications across `packages/core`, `packages/api-client`, `packages/cli`, and `packages/client`. ([#5828](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5828))\n\n### Action Handling and CLI Fixes\nCritical bug fixes were implemented to correctly pass values between steps in multi-step actions, improving the reliability of complex agent behaviors. Minor fixes were also applied to the CLI test command, addressing issues with test naming and default tests in starter projects. ([#5841](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5841), [#5840](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5840))\n\n### Documentation and Dependency Updates\nComprehensive documentation was added to the standalone agent runner to improve developer understanding and usability. Additionally, the `vite` dependency in `packages/client` was bumped to a newer version. ([#5843](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5843), [#5838](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5838))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### Infrastructure and Deployment\nA new issue was opened to dockerize the `project-starter` to align its deployment capabilities with `project-tee-starter`. ([#5842](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5842))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Plugin Development and Integration\nDiscussion continues on the \"Add Token Metrics Plugin - Comprehensive Cryptocurrency Analysis Plugin\" issue ([#202](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/202)). The latest update confirms that a pull request has been raised at `elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/182` with changes made to package names based on previous review feedback. The team is awaiting further review."

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jun 24, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant API migrations, UI/UX improvements, and critical bug fixes, enhancing file upload capabilities and streamlining core functionalities.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### API and Client-Side Enhancements\nThe team completed a major migration of the admin API, impacting various services and client components to improve overall system architecture and maintainability. This was complemented by fixes to the character form's secrets panel and general UI/UX improvements.\n- Feature/phase4 admin api migration ([#5266](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5266))\n- fix: character form - secrets panel ([#5186](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5186))\n\n### File Upload and Attachment Processing Improvements\nSignificant progress was made in refining file upload functionalities, including a complete migration to `multer` for robust handling of media uploads and enhanced support for user-uploaded plain text files. Attachment processing logic was also improved to support local image URLs and include descriptions in prompts.\n- feat: adds support for user-uploaded plain text (.txt) files in the GUI. ([#5262](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5262))\n- fix: complete multer migration and resolve upload functionality ([#5252](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5252))\n- fix: processAttachments to Support Local Image URLs and Include Attachment Descriptions in Prompts ([#5257](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5257))\n\n### Codebase Refinements and CLI Stability\nRefactoring efforts focused on centralizing directory detection logic within the CLI for consistency and separating character and plugin configurations in starter packages. Additionally, critical fixes were implemented to address macOS CLI test failures, ensuring cross-platform stability.\n- refactor: centralize-directory-detection-logic ([#5246](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5246))\n- refactor: starter packages to separate character and plugin files ([#5256](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5256))\n- fix: Fix macOS CLI test failures by centralizing platform options ([#5250](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5250))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A fix for attachment tests was opened ([#5267](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5267)).\n- Two pull requests related to reverting or rolling back changes were opened: `fix: revert` ([#5261](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5261)) and `fix: rollback catbox` ([#5255](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5255)).\n- A feature for Jules agent development POC was initiated ([#5254](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5254)).\n- A fix for Windows plugin test timeouts and hanging issues was proposed ([#5253](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5253)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Resolved Upload Functionality\nThe issue regarding the broken upload feature after server API changes, specifically the migration from `multer` to `express-fileupload`, has been successfully addressed. This involved resolving mismatched endpoints between the client, API client package, and server.\n- Fix broken upload feature after server API changes (multer → express-fileupload migration) ([#5251](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5251))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Client-Side API Migration\nA new issue was opened to track the migration of `packages/client` to leverage the new `@elizaos/api-client` package, aiming for a type-safe and service-oriented API client.\n- 🔄 Migrate packages/client to leverage @elizaos/api-client ([#5259](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5259))\n\n### Custom Plugin Development Challenges\nA user reported difficulties in creating a custom plugin for an on-chain AI agent, specifically concerning the Biconomy wallet with Chainlink automation & functions. The agent currently only supports one message before stopping plugin usage, and there are issues with agent replies showing in the terminal but not the interface logs.\n- Create custom plugin for onchain AI agent ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5260))\n\n### Broken Upload Feature\nAn issue was identified where the upload feature in the frontend was broken due to recent server API changes, specifically a migration from `multer` to `express-fileupload`, leading to mismatched endpoints.\n- Fix broken upload feature after server API changes (multer → express-fileupload migration) ([#5251](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5251))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Custom Plugin Callback Interference ([#4947](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4947))\nThe issue where custom plugin callbacks are replaced by the `ATTACHMENTS` provider is still active. Recent discussions confirm this is a valid issue in the current codebase (v1.0.19). The root cause is identified in the message handler flow where the `ATTACHMENTS` provider modifies the state before it's passed to action callbacks, leading to interference. A fix is being implemented for version 1.2.4, which involves separating provider state composition from action callback processing. Users are advised to avoid attachment-related keywords in prompts or implement action validation as a workaround.\n\n### Documentation Overhaul ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5234))\nThe proposal for a documentation overhaul to create separate tracks for simple users and developers is an active discussion. Feedback highlights that the current documentation, while comprehensive, doesn't effectively serve both distinct user groups. A user commented on the difficulty for non-coders to navigate the existing documentation and examples, citing inconsistencies in environment variable settings and non-functional example JSON files. The need for documentation tailored to beginners who want to set up and edit characters without deep technical knowledge was emphasized."

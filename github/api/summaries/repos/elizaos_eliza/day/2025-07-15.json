  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 15, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, ElizaOS significantly enhanced its core service architecture with standardized interfaces and improved CLI tooling, including a new backend-only plugin template. Several critical bug fixes addressed environment handling, security, and build stability, ensuring a more robust and developer-friendly experience.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Service Architecture and Standardized Interfaces\nA major feature was implemented to introduce service types and standardized interfaces, along with a `getServicesByType()` method. This allows for retrieving multiple services of a specific type, improving modularity and extensibility for building abstract plugins.\n- [#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565)\n\n### CLI Improvements and New Plugin Template\nThe CLI received significant updates, including a new `plugin-quick-starter` template for creating backend-only plugins, streamlining development. CI tests for the CLI were also improved, and the system migrated to Bun's native process spawning for better performance.\n- [#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589)\n- [#5586](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5586)\n\n### Critical Bug Fixes for CLI and Core Stability\nSeveral important bug fixes were deployed, addressing issues such as improved `bunx` detection and removal of `npm` references in the CLI, correct `installModelPlugin` calls for local model resolution, and handling of port conflicts in the `dev` command. Security was also enhanced by removing plaintext passwords from test constants.\n- [#5599](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5599)\n- [#5598](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5598)\n- [#5597](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5597)\n- [#5592](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5592)\n\n### Refined Ollama Plugin Integration and Type Safety\nThe Ollama plugin integration was made conditional based on configuration, ensuring it only acts as a fallback when no other LLM exists. Additionally, TypeScript `any` type violations were resolved, and a duplicate `ActionResult` interface definition was removed, improving overall type safety and build stability.\n- [#5594](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5594)\n- [#5593](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5593)\n- [#5587](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5587)\n- [#5596](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5596)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- No new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Service Type System Implemented\nThe long-standing issue of implementing service types and test services has been closed. This feature allows for grouping services into types and provides a `getServicesByType()` method, significantly enhancing the framework's modularity and extensibility.\n- [#4914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914)\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Schema Migration Challenges\nA new issue highlights difficulties with custom plugin schema migrations, specifically noting that `DatabaseMigrationService` is not registered as a runtime service, leading to skipped migrations. Potential solutions involve proper plugin schema export, dependency declaration, and server-level plugin registration.\n- [#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588)\n\n### Environment Variable Parsing Issue\nAn issue was reported regarding environment variable reading when values are enclosed in quotes, indicating a potential parsing problem within the CLI or environment handling.\n- [#5590](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5590)\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Twitter Timeline Fetching and API Rate Limits\nDiscussions continue on the issue of failing to fetch the Home timeline, leading to 429 API limit errors. Users are experiencing \"Too Many Requests\" even with the latest version (1.2.16). The conversation revolves around whether a \"PRO\" (Basic) subscription to Twitter's API is required to avoid rate limits, with one user confirming that the $200/month tier works. The exact rate limit for this tier is being questioned.\n- [#38](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/38)"

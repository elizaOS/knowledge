  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 27, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nToday's development focused heavily on bug fixes across various packages, improving CI stability, and refining core functionalities. A new feature was added to enhance runtime event handling.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core Runtime and Event Handling Enhancements\n\n*   Introduced an `initPromise` property and ensured runtime is consistently included in emitted events, improving the robustness of event handling within the core system ([#5827](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5827)).\n*   Improved browser build exports and type definitions for the core package, resolving build issues and enhancing type accuracy ([#5832](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5832)).\n\n### CI Stability and Test Fixes\n\n*   Addressed and resolved multiple CI test failures in core packages and Cypress component tests, ensuring a more stable and reliable continuous integration pipeline ([#5835](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5835)).\n*   Corrected `logger.error` parameter order in the `imageGeneration` action within the `plugin-bootstrap` package, fixing TypeScript compilation errors ([#5833](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5833)).\n\n### Client-Side and CLI Improvements\n\n*   Updated the `AgentLog` type structure and fixed action viewer mapping in the client, enhancing the accuracy of agent activity display ([#5834](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5834)).\n*   Implemented lazy environment loading for the CLI to prevent confusing warnings during startup, improving the user experience ([#5829](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5829)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n\n*   [#5836](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5836) Main: This pull request is currently open and likely represents a merge or update to the main branch.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### CLI Test Stability\n\n*   Resolved an issue where Windows CI tests were failing due to incorrect path handling in CLI agent start commands, specifically when using the `--path` flag ([#5619](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5619)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Gateway and Protocol Enhancements\n\n*   Initiated an analysis of options for the MCP Gateway, including adding MCP servers and integrating an x402 layer ([#5830](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5830)).\n\n### UI/UX Improvements\n\n*   Proposed a new feature to display the called action and its result within the chat UI, aiming to provide users with more transparency on agent operations ([#5831](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5831)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

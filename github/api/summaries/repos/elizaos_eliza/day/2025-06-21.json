  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jun 21, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW\nToday's development focused heavily on improving the stability and reliability of the ElizaOS framework through significant bug fixes across server, SQL plugin, and bootstrap components. Efforts were concentrated on enhancing testing infrastructure and resolving issues related to character file imports.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Test Reliability and Infrastructure\nSignificant work was done to improve the testing infrastructure and reliability across core packages. This included re-enabling and fixing server tests, updating test runners, and refining mocking strategies. Additionally, unit tests for the SQL plugin were improved for better reliability and simplified setups.\n- [#5231](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5231)\n- [#5229](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5229)\n\n### Bootstrap Plugin Test and Code Cleanup\nThe bootstrap plugin received attention with fixes to its tests and general code cleanup, ensuring its stability and maintainability.\n- [#5227](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5227)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Resolution of Character File Import Issues\nAn issue preventing the import of character JSON files via the UI was resolved. The problem stemmed from changes in the expected format for `messageExamples` within character files, requiring \"user\" to be changed to \"name\" and the removal of `modelProvider`, `clients`, and `lore` sections.\n- [#5228](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5228)\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### API Endpoint Not Found Errors\nA new issue was reported regarding \"API endpoint not found\" errors across most server endpoints, with only the `get agents` endpoint functioning. This suggests a potential configuration or initialization problem rather than missing API implementations.\n- [#5230](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5230)\n\n### Documentation Overhaul Proposal\nA proposal was submitted to overhaul the documentation, suggesting separate tracks for simple users and developers to better serve distinct user groups.\n- [#5234](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5234)\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Wallet Address Fetching in Pipelines\nThe issue [#130](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/130) discusses moving wallet address fetching from the NextJS build process to the Pipelines workflow. The core challenge is that the current caching logic fetches data from GitHub during the NextJS build, which is not ideal. The discussion emphasizes that any code fetching data from GitHub or external APIs and storing it in the database should exclusively run within the Pipelines workflow."

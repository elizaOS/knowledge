  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 8, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe primary focus today was on defining the architecture for anonymous user support and free inference tiers. This involved detailed planning for identity management, quota systems, and integration points across the ElizaOS stack.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n### Anonymous ID and Free Inference Architecture Defined\nIssue [#6131](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6131), \"Support Tasks,\" was closed after a comprehensive architecture document was generated. This document details the implementation plan for anonymous user identities and a free-inference tier. Key aspects include:\n- **Identity System**: Fingerprint-based tracking with a 4-tier user system (Anonymous, Free, Authenticated, Premium).\n- **Quota Management**: Per-tier token limits, request rate limiting, and model access restrictions.\n- **Database Schema**: Introduction of `anonymous_users`, `inference_quotas`, and `inference_usage` tables.\n- **Service and Middleware**: Implementation of a `QuotaService` and integration of user identification and quota enforcement middleware.\n- **Frontend Integration**: Plans for browser fingerprinting and API client updates.\n- **Implementation Roadmap**: A phased approach covering foundation, integration, polish, and monitoring.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES"

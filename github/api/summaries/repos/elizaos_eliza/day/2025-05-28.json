  "content": "# ElizaOS Daily Update (May 28, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, significant progress was made in enhancing the .env file management for server environments, ensuring that secrets are properly merged from `process.env`. Additionally, support for parameterized routes in plugins was added, improving flexibility. Minor bug fixes and adjustments were also implemented, contributing to overall stability.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### .env File Management Enhancements\n- Added functionality to manually write the `.env` file to Fly.io to address bugs with `process.env` and merge loader ([#4808](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4808)).\n- Updated logic to merge `process.env` variables into the `.env` file, ensuring secrets are not ignored in server hosting environments ([#4806](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4806)).\n\n### Plugin and Route Improvements\n- Introduced support for parameterized routes in plugins, enhancing routing capabilities without altering existing behaviors ([#4817](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4817)).\n- Fixed various typos and improved test configurations related to TEE tests ([#4816](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4816), [#4807](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4807)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Integration Issue Resolved\n- Closed the issue regarding the inability to use the `@elizaos/plugin-evm` plugin, which was affecting integration with EVM-compatible chains ([#4803](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4803)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### E2E Testing and Configuration Challenges\n- Reported failures in end-to-end tests for the new sample project, indicating potential issues with the setup process ([#4814](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4814)).\n- Raised concerns about starting agent files without the CLI, questioning the removal of the `the-org` package from resources ([#4810](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4810)).\n- Encountered difficulties finding definition files for Node or Jest, impacting development ([#4805](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4805))."

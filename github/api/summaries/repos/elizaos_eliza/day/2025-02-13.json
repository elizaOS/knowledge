  "content": "# ElizaOS Daily Update (Feb 13, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, significant progress was made in enhancing the ElizaOS framework, particularly in the areas of feature development, documentation, and bug fixes. New features were added to improve plugin functionality, and documentation was updated to assist users. Additionally, a bug fix addressed a critical issue related to knowledge storage.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Feature Enhancements\n- Added local embedding support for the Anthropic plugin, enhancing its capabilities ([#3474](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3474)).\n- Introduced basic tests for the OpenAI plugin to ensure reliability ([#3466](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3466)).\n- Improved testing for the Anthropic plugin and OpenAI integration ([#3472](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3472)).\n\n### Documentation Updates\n- Updated the README to clarify the necessity of the \"0x\" prefix for EVM private keys, preventing user errors ([#3414](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3414)).\n- Enhanced the README to differentiate between the eliza-starter and eliza repositories ([#3453](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3453)).\n- Made incremental updates to client documentation and revamped the character file page ([#3410](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3410)).\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Fixed an issue where `stringKnowledge` was not being stored correctly when `ragKnowledge` was enabled, resolving a critical functionality problem ([#3435](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3435)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n- No issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Documentation Issues\n- Reported an incorrect image path in the Korean documentation page, causing images to fail to load ([#3479](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3479)).\n\n### Feature Requests\n- Proposed the addition of support for the exSAT blockchain as a new plugin to enhance ElizaOS capabilities ([#3473](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3473)).\n- Suggested the development of a DeFi Token Analysis Plugin to provide users with comprehensive analysis tools ([#3467](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3467)).\n\n### Build Issues\n- Identified a build failure on macOS 15.3 related to the installation of the @elizaos/plugin-pyth-data, likely due to a Zod import error ([#3469](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3469))."

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 9, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing the `plugin-sql` package with Neon serverless support and improved RLS security, alongside critical bug fixes for backend hot reloading and PGLite compatibility.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### SQL Plugin Enhancements & Security\nThe `plugin-sql` package received significant updates, including the addition of Neon serverless database support and improvements to Row-Level Security (RLS). This enhances the plugin's capabilities and strengthens data isolation. ([#6343](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6343))\n\n### Backend Development Workflow Improvements\nA comprehensive hot reload functionality was implemented for backend development, automatically rebuilding the CLI and restarting the server upon TypeScript file modifications in watched packages. This streamlines the development process. ([#6293](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6293))\n\n### Database Compatibility and Testing\nBug fixes addressed issues with `pgcrypto` extension installation for PGLite, eliminating unnecessary warning logs. Additionally, RLS tests were improved by utilizing `withEntityContext()` and enabling data isolation in CI, ensuring robust testing. ([#6339](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6339), [#6330](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6330))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#6351](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6351) V2.0.0: This PR likely introduces a new major version of the project.\n- [#6349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6349) chore: Optimize build task inputs in turbo.json: This PR aims to optimize the build process by refining task inputs in the `turbo.json` configuration.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### User Experience and Interface Improvements\nSeveral issues were opened to address user experience and interface elements. These include removing the '+' from personality traits and topics of interest fields for better UX ([#6350](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6350)), and improving the display and hover functionality of public/private icons in the dashboard ([#6352](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6352)).\n\n### Onboarding and Navigation Flow\nNew issues highlight areas for improving the user onboarding and navigation experience. This includes making \"Sign up for free\" a hyperlink in agent messages for non-signed-up users ([#6353](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6353)), and ensuring that logging in or signing up redirects users back to their previous agent chat session instead of the dashboard ([#6354](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6354)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

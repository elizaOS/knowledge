  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 18, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing module resolution for consistent local-first loading, fixing critical CLI bugs related to project creation and inheritance, and performing routine maintenance. Several new pull requests were opened, indicating ongoing feature development and bug fixes.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Module Resolution and Stability\nThe `ModuleLoader` system was significantly enhanced to ensure consistent local-first module resolution, mirroring the guarantees provided by `server-manager.ts`. This improvement aims to provide more reliable module loading across the ElizaOS framework. ([#5629](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5629))\n\n### CLI Bug Fixes and Project Creation Improvements\nCritical bugs in the CLI were addressed, specifically preventing the incorrect inheritance of `.elizadb` directories when creating nested ElizaOS projects. A minor typo in `plugin.ts` was also corrected. ([#5618](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5618), [#5632](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5632))\n\n### Routine Maintenance and Versioning\nA chore update to version `v1.2.12` was performed, involving updates across various packages and documentation files. This ensures the project remains up-to-date with the latest changes. ([#5630](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5630))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n*   [#5634](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5634): This PR aims to make API keys optional during the `npx elizaos create` process.\n*   [#5633](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5633): This feature targets the project directory for the `.elizadb` file, likely to improve project structure and avoid hoisting issues.\n*   [#5628](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5628): This PR proposes a fix for handling JSON strings within the SQL base.\n*   [#5635](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5635): This PR addresses an export issue within the `@elizaos/config` package.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### API Key and Configuration Issues Resolved\nSeveral issues related to API key requirements and configuration errors were closed. This includes resolving an error where messages could not be sent without an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` ([#4346](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4346)).\n\n### Project Creation and Directory Hoisting Fixes\nA significant bug where the `.eliza` directory was getting hoisted incorrectly during project creation has been resolved ([#5606](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5606)).\n\n### Minor Test and Development Issues\nSeveral minor issues, likely related to testing or initial development setup, were closed, including \"its working!\" ([#5625](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5625), [#5627](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5627)) and \"hello world\" ([#5626](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5626)). A duplicate issue regarding the Zapper plugin build was also closed ([#5600](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5600)).\n\n### `elizaos create` Command Alignment\nAn issue regarding the `elizaos create --type agent` command not aligning with the standard TypeScript character file approach was opened and subsequently closed on the same day, indicating a quick resolution ([#5631](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5631)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Agent Creation Command Discrepancy\nA new issue was opened and closed today concerning the `elizaos create --type agent` command. The problem highlighted was that this command currently copies a JSON character file, which is inconsistent with ElizaOS's standard practice of using type-safe TypeScript character files (`character.ts`). This creates confusion and misalignment with the project's architectural direction. ([#5631](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5631))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

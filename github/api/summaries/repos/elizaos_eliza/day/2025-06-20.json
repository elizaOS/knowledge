  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jun 20, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on expanding AI model support with Google Generative AI, optimizing CLI performance by lazy loading dependencies, and enhancing the client UI with agent settings and improved responsiveness. Significant progress was also made in bug fixes across various components and general code cleanup.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced AI and CLI Capabilities\nGoogle Generative AI (Gemini) support was integrated into the ElizaOS CLI, alongside refactored CLI prompts for improved clarity and reduced code duplication. Starter templates now lazy load test dependencies and the Discord plugin, significantly reducing initial project size and speeding up the `elizaos create` command.\n([#5217](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5217), [#5215](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5215), [#5214](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5214))\n\n### UI/UX Improvements and Agent Management\nNew agent settings were added to the client, allowing for better configuration and user experience. Documentation links now open in new tabs for improved navigation. Several UI bugs were addressed, including responsive issues with agent cards and the ability to save environment settings and edit/add new secrets in the secret panel.\n([#5202](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5202), [#5213](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5213), [#5223](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5223), [#5212](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5212), [#5210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5210), [#5209](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5209))\n\n### Core System Stability and Maintenance\nExtensive bug fixes were implemented, including the removal of all CI caching to prevent issues, correction of incorrectly scoped plugin names, and updates to CLI create option tests. The `__dirname` issue for ES modules in the copy-template utility was resolved. Significant code cleanup was performed in the `core` and `plugin-sql` packages, and CLI tests were removed from integration tests to avoid duplication.\n([#5225](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5225), [#5220](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5220), [#5219](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5219), [#5206](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5206), [#5224](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5224), [#5222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5222), [#5226](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5226))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#5221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5221) fix: look for client/dist in multiple locations\n- [#5205](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5205) fix: unit and integration tests\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### CLI Update Mechanism Resolved\nThe issue where `elizaos update` was not correctly updating the CLI version has been resolved. Users are now advised to use `bun install -g @elizaos/cli@latest` for initial global updates, which will then enable the correct update command for future versions.\n([#5198](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5198))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Message Event Not Emitting\nA new issue reports that the `sendAgentResponseToBus` function does not emit the `EventType.MESSAGE_SENT` event when sending payloads to the central server API endpoint.\n([#5216](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5216))\n\n### Inconsistent Test Execution\nAn issue has been opened regarding inconsistent `bun run test` behavior across packages in the monorepo, leading to an inconsistent developer experience and unreliable test execution.\n([#5218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5218))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Web Client Version Mismatch\nThe web client continues to display an incorrect version number, often lagging behind the actual CLI and core versions. This also triggers an update banner and, in previous versions, led to repeated 429 errors from the GitHub API due to excessive requests. While the 429 errors seem resolved, the version mismatch persists, with the client showing `v1.0.10` when the actual version is `v1.0.11`.\n([#4924](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4924))\n\n### Checking Loaded Plugins\nUsers are seeking a method to verify currently loaded plugins when an agent is running via `elizaos start`. A suggested workaround involves checking the agent's log output for a line indicating \"Final plugins being loaded.\"\n([#4931](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4931))"

The issue was quickly diagnosed as a broken wrapper, and a temporary workaround was provided. The problem was resolved, and the user confirmed it was working. Related PRs for fixing the wrapper and updating documentation were mentioned in the discussion ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### Project Generation Failure\nA new issue was opened reporting an error when attempting to generate a project using `elizaos create`, despite following the official documentation ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Project Generation Failure Discussion\nThe issue [#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388) saw active discussion. Initially, `standujar` inquired about the user's ElizaOS version and suggested using the latest (1.7.2). `Abdulkader-Safi` confirmed the issue persisted even after installation and provided an image. `standujar` then identified a broken wrapper and provided a temporary fix (`bun -i g @elizaos/cli`). `Abdulkader-Safi` confirmed the workaround was successful. Subsequently, `standujar` linked to a pull request for fixing the wrapper ([https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6389](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/6389)) and another for documentation updates ([https://github.com/elizaOS/docs/pull/83](https://github.com/elizaOS/docs/pull/83))."

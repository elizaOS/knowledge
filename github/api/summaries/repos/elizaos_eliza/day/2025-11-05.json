  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 5, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing runtime flexibility with a new migration skipping option and critical bug fixes for PostgreSQL entity serialization, ensuring robust data handling.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Runtime Control\n*   Introduced an optional `skipMigrations` parameter to the `initialize()` method within the `IAgentRuntime` interface, allowing conditional skipping of plugin migrations during runtime initialization. This provides greater control over the startup process. ([#6132](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6132))\n\n### PostgreSQL Entity Serialization Fixes\n*   Resolved issues with entity creation in PostgreSQL by normalizing the `names` field to consistently be an array before database operations. This includes converting `Set` objects to arrays. ([#6133](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6133))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n*   [#6134](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6134) fix(plugin-sql): correct types path in package.json exports - This PR aims to correct the types path within the `package.json` exports for the `plugin-sql` package.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

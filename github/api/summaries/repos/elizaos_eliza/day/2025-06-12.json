  "content": "# ElizaOS Daily Update (Jun 12, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development efforts focused on enhancing the ElizaOS framework with optimizations and bug fixes. Key improvements include better logging for the MessageBusService, optimizations for CLI project creation, and several critical bug fixes addressing plugin normalization and Content Security Policy issues. The team also updated documentation to reflect recent changes and deprecated features.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Feature Enhancements\n- Improved logging in the MessageBusService by adding the agent ID for better traceability ([#5088](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5088)).\n- Optimized CLI project creation performance in CI environments by implementing Bun's offline mode, reducing package download times ([#5087](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5087)).\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Normalized plugin names for consistency across the framework ([#5071](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5071)).\n- Updated Content Security Policy and error handling in API routes to mitigate potential iframe functionality issues ([#5058](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5058)).\n- Resolved multiple issues related to plugin management, including duplicate plugins and environment loading ([#5091](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5091), [#5090](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5090)).\n\n### Documentation Updates\n- Replaced deprecated CLI flags in documentation to ensure users have the correct usage examples ([#5078](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5078)).\n- Updated Twitter plugin documentation to reflect maintenance and changes in authentication methods ([#5046](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5046)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Resolved Plugin Creation Issue\n- Closed the issue regarding failure to create an entity for the agent, which was caused by errors during the initialization process ([#5095](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5095)).\n\n### Duplicate Plugin Display\n- Addressed and closed the issue of duplicate plugins appearing in the GUI settings, ensuring a cleaner user experience ([#5086](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5086)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Creation Errors\n- New issue reported regarding failure to create an entity for the agent when using the elizaos create command, indicating a need for further investigation into the initialization process ([#5095](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5095)).\n\n### Plugin Management Challenges\n- A new issue has been identified where the plugin list in the GUI displays duplicates, requiring a review of the plugin management logic ([#5086](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5086)).\n- Another issue was raised about agents not being recognized as participants in specific channels, suggesting a potential bug in message handling ([#5084](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5084))."

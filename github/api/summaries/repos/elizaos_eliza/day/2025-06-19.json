  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jun 19, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant CLI and server stability improvements, including critical bug fixes for testing environments and UI, alongside enhanced memory management for agents. Documentation was also refined, and core testing infrastructure expanded.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### CLI Stability and Testing Infrastructure Enhancements\nMultiple critical fixes were implemented to improve the CLI's reliability, particularly within test environments. This included resolving issues with template path resolution, ensuring single installation tests are not skipped, and migrating CLI tests to `bun-test` for better performance and consistency. These changes are crucial for a robust development workflow.\n- [#5201](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5201)\n- [#5200](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5200)\n- [#5199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5199)\n\n### Agent Memory Management and Server Code Refinements\nA new feature was added to allow clearing agent memories, providing better control over agent state. Concurrently, significant refactoring and cleanup were performed across the server codebase, enhancing runtime capabilities and improving overall code quality and maintainability. Database schema consistency was also addressed by standardizing ID types to UUIDs.\n- [#5187](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5187)\n- [#5204](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5204)\n- [#5189](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5189)\n\n### UI/UX Improvements and Documentation Overhaul\nUser interface issues related to scroll behavior in agent settings and environment panels were fixed, improving usability for long lists of data. A comprehensive documentation overhaul was also completed, consolidating redundant pages and refining the structure for better clarity and user experience.\n- [#5193](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5193)\n- [#5192](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5192)\n- [#5182](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5182)\n\n### Core Test Suite Expansion\nNew Bun tests were added to the core packages, significantly expanding test coverage and ensuring the stability and correctness of core functionalities. This contributes to a more reliable and robust foundation for the ElizaOS framework.\n- [#5188](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5188)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#5203](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5203) feat: enhance logging capabilities in CLI\n- [#5196](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5196) fix(plugin-sql): Add database error handler and validation\n- [#5195](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5195) Add files via upload\n- [#5194](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5194) Eliza (AGI)\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Callback and Response Issues Resolved\nAn issue where callbacks from plugin actions were not reaching the end-user response in chat has been closed. This fix ensures that plugin actions, such as those from `plugin-evm`, correctly provide feedback to the user. The resolution involved updates to the CLI and cleaning up old dependencies.\n- [#5017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5017)\n\n### CI Migration and CLI Update Issues Addressed\nTwo critical issues related to CI failures during the `vitest` to `bun:test` migration and problems with the `elizaos update` command have been closed. The CI failures were due to timeouts and caching, while the CLI update issue stemmed from an outdated global installation method. Solutions involved direct global installation commands and ongoing efforts to stabilize CI.\n- [#5197](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5197)\n- [#5198](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5198)\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### CI/CD Pipeline Instability\nA new issue highlights significant CI failures blocking the complete migration from `vitest` to `bun:test`. This includes timeout issues, cached `vitest` commands, and platform-specific problems, preventing the merge of critical migration PRs.\n- [#5197](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5197)\n\n### CLI Update Command Malfunction\nUsers are reporting that the `elizaos update` command is not functioning as expected. Despite the CLI indicating a successful update, the version number remains unchanged, suggesting an issue with the update mechanism itself.\n- [#5198](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5198)\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Customizable Root Logger Configuration\nThe issue [#5183](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5183) addresses the need for downstream projects to customize the root logger configuration. The latest comments indicate significant progress, with a comprehensive analysis and implementation plan completed. The proposed solution involves a delayed logger initialization system, a new `LoggerConfig` interface, and integration with the CLI to load project-level configurations. This will allow full customization of transports, formatters, and levels, ensuring backward compatibility. A Claude-generated PR is available for review."

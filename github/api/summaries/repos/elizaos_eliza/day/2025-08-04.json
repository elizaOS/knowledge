  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 4, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing CLI functionality with new debugging tools and API client integration, alongside critical bug fixes for component testing. Significant progress was also made on the Sessions API and addressing various environment and deployment-related issues.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced CLI Functionality and Debugging\nNew features were added to the CLI, including a comprehensive debug tool for diagnosing local CLI delegation issues, providing automatic fixes for common problems ([#5682](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5682)). Additionally, authentication support was integrated into CLI agent commands, and workspace dependencies were standardized using `@elizaos/api-client` to reduce code duplication ([#5709](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5709)).\n\n### Core System Improvements and Bug Fixes\nBootstrap event and logging mechanisms received improvements, utilizing proper runtime loggers and introducing a setting to turn off automatic LLM responses ([#5684](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5684)). A critical bug was fixed that prevented `elizaos test --type component` from passing for all project and plugin types generated by the CLI ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)).\n\n### Sessions API Development\nWork continued on the Sessions API, which provides a simplified interface for messaging between users and agents, abstracting away server, channel, and participant complexities ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nFour new pull requests were opened today:\n- [#5717](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5717): Introduces a client for the Sessions API.\n- [#5712](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5712): Aims to fix memory count and agent ID errors.\n- [#5711](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5711): Addresses an agent ID UUID conversion issue in the `getAgent` command.\n- [#5710](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5710): Focuses on fixing agent config output exclusion.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### CLI and Environment Configuration Fixes\nSeveral issues related to CLI commands and environment configurations were resolved. This includes fixes for `elizaos dev` not working in plugin folders without explicit `@elizaos/cli` dependency, and ensuring `start` and `dev` commands add `@elizaos/cli` as a dev dependency if missing ([#5687](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5687), [#5695](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5695)). A Zod issue with the `dev` command was also fixed ([#5696](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5696)).\n\n### Documentation and Deployment Improvements\nIssues concerning the migration of documentation to the monorepo setup were closed ([#5638](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5638)). Additionally, an issue related to Eliza Cloud Railway deployment was resolved ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)).\n\n### Agent and Scenario Enhancements\nA long-standing issue regarding setting up a rate-limited Eliza hosted LLM and embedding endpoint was closed, with discussions around LiteLLM and fallback mechanisms ([#5438](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5438)). The feature to add an `elizaos scenario run` command was also completed ([#5573](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5573)).\n\n### Plugin and Agent-Specific Resolutions\nIssues related to the Morpho plugin ([#5644](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5644)) and notes for the DevRel Agent ([#5676](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5676)) were closed. A newly created issue about not auto-inserting all environment stuff into `.env` was quickly closed ([#5713](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5713)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Critical Agent Stability and Authentication Concerns\nNew issues highlight critical problems with agent stability, including Eliza crashing when trying to respond due to an \"Attempted to assign to readonly property\" error ([#5706](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5706)). Another significant issue reports that the `elizaos agent` command fails for remote servers when `ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN` is set, indicating an authentication problem ([#5707](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5707)).\n\n### CLI Command and CI Test Failures\nProblems with basic CLI commands were reported, specifically `elizaos dev` and `elizaos agent list` not working as expected ([#5708](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5708)). There are also new issues indicating failures in CLI CI tests ([#5714](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5714)) and core CI tests, with the tee starter breaking ([#5715](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5715)).\n\n### Documentation and Environment Variable Management\nA new issue requests documentation for the `eliza_auth_header` environment variable and a way to disable the UI if not already present ([#5716](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5716)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

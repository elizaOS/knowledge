  "content": "# ElizaOS Daily Update (Jun 5, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, significant enhancements were made to the ElizaOS framework, particularly in the CLI and plugin functionalities. Key improvements include better plugin installation processes, bug fixes addressing critical issues, and optimizations in the agent's response mechanisms. The team also merged development changes into the main branch, ensuring a more stable release.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Plugin Enhancements\n- Improved plugin installation in the CLI with environment variable prompting ([#4945](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4945)).\n- Optimized plugin loading strategies and resolved core dependency conflicts ([#4949](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4949)).\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Resolved foreign key constraint violations in the `ensureConnections` function ([#4936](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4936)).\n- Fixed agent cross-chat interference in DM channels, ensuring correct message handling ([#4935](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4935)).\n- Addressed issues with action callbacks not reaching users ([#4954](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4954)).\n\n### CI and Versioning Improvements\n- Fixed CI versioning issues to ensure proper package publication ([#4960](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4960)).\n- Enhanced versioning logic in the client build process ([#4952](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4952)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Resolved Errors\n- Fixed the issue where agentId and roomId were required for starting agents, which caused startup errors ([#4933](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4933)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Plugin and API Challenges\n- Encountered a problem where creating a room via the REST API returns an empty rooms array after initial success ([#4955](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4955)).\n- A custom plugin's callback is being replaced by an `ATTACHMENTS` provider, leading to incorrect responses ([#4947](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4947)).\n- Noted an issue with successive replies being sent to target users, causing confusion in message delivery ([#4940](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4940))."

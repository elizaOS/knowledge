  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 22, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's focus was on refining the `plugin-training` module with several critical fixes, including security enhancements and path corrections. Additionally, new issues were opened concerning documentation and video production, alongside the resolution of a Google API agent response issue.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Plugin Training Module Enhancements\nSeveral updates were made to the `plugin-training` module to improve its robustness and security. This includes validating model parameters for `bunExec` to prevent potential command injection vulnerabilities ([#5663](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5663)), correcting the dataset path for HuggingFace uploads ([#5662](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5662)), and removing double escaping from the `bunExec` prompt ([#5661](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5661)).\n\n### Reasoning Service Stability\nA fix was implemented in the `simple-reasoning-service.ts` to prevent the use of undefined models, enhancing the stability of the reasoning process ([#5660](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5660)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Agent Functionality and API Key Configuration\nThe issue regarding an agent not responding when using the Google API was closed today ([#5664](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5664)). The problem was identified as a missing or incorrectly configured `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` environment variable, rather than a non-existent plugin. Solutions provided included ensuring the API key is correctly set and considering alternative plugin configurations for reliability.\n\n### Project Creation Without Keys\nThe issue concerning the inability to create a project without using keys was closed today ([#5605](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5605)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Documentation and Video Production Planning\nSeveral new issues were opened today focusing on content creation and documentation. These include a request for a full documentation nitpick review ([#5665](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5665)) and planning for a series of introductory videos: \"Getting Started Right - CLI vs Monorepo\" ([#5666](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5666)), \"Your First Agent - Zero to Running\" ([#5667](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5667)), and \"Multiple Agents & Characters\" ([#5668](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5668)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

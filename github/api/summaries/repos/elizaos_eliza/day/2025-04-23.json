  "content": "# ElizaOS Daily Update (Apr 23, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, the ElizaOS development team focused on addressing critical bugs within the framework. A significant fix was implemented to resolve an agent not found error after GUI creation. Additionally, several new issues were identified that require attention, particularly related to plugin installations and API key requirements.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Resolved an issue where starting an agent created via the GUI with the same name resulted in an error: \"Agent does not exist in database\" after the `ensureAgentExists` call. This fix is documented in [PR #4337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4337).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n- No issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### API Key Requirement\n- A new issue was reported regarding an error when sending messages without the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, which states: \"x-api-key header is required\" ([#4346](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4346)).\n\n### Plugin Installation Failures\n- Users reported failures when attempting to install the `@elizaos/plugin-solana` plugin ([#4342](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4342)).\n- Another issue was raised regarding the local model not working on the plugin development environment ([#4339](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4339))."

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 12, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, development focused on improving package discoverability with a new npm alias. A new pull request was opened to add browser build support with PGlite WASM, and a discussion continued on release automation.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Package Aliasing for Improved Discoverability\nA new `elizaos` alias package has been created to delegate to `@elizaos/cli`, simplifying the npm name for better discoverability while maintaining identical CLI functionality. ([#5972](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5972))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request, [#5970](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5970), was opened to add browser build support with PGlite WASM.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Repository Closure\nThe issue tracking the `plugin-rofl` repository was closed today. ([#5949](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5949))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Update Notification Logic\nA new issue, [#5971](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5971), was opened to address an issue where update available notifications are shown for alpha versions even when the user is not on an alpha distribution.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Release Automation Discussions\nDiscussions continued on [#5937](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5937) regarding Release Automation. The latest comments from \"linear\" at 2025-09-12T00:38:12Z provided feedback on proposed improvements:\n- Automated changelog CI step: Agreed upon.\n- Improved release notes clarity and consistency: Questioned if this is a product-driven decision.\n- Versioned documentation: Clarification sought on whether this implies maintaining multiple documentation versions or simply correct labeling."

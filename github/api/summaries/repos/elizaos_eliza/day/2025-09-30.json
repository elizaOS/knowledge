Critical bug fixes addressed TypeScript configuration and CLI plugin loading. Dynamic migration refactoring also progressed.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Agent Run Visualization and UI\nThe Agent Runs sidebar received a major upgrade, featuring an improved Timeline UI, better space utilization, and enhanced data extraction capabilities. This significantly improves the user experience for monitoring and understanding agent activities. ([#6023](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6023))\n\n### Core Configuration and CLI Stability Fixes\nCritical bug fixes were implemented to resolve an invalid project reference in the root `tsconfig.json`, preventing TypeScript errors. Additionally, a fix ensures that `elizaos start` and `elizaos dev` commands correctly pass `ProjectAgent.plugins` to the server when run in a plugin directory, addressing a key issue with plugin loading. ([#6022](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6022), [#6021](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6021))\n\n### Dynamic Migration Refactoring\nSignificant refactoring was performed on dynamic migrations within the `plugin-sql` package. This work involved updates across numerous files related to migration testing, runtime migrators, and Drizzle adapters, aiming to improve the robustness and maintainability of the migration system. ([#5990](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5990))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### CLI Plugin Loading Issue Resolved\nThe issue where `elizaos dev` and `elizaos start` commands failed to load plugins correctly when executed in a plugin directory has been successfully closed. This fix ensures that plugins are properly recognized and utilized by the server. ([#6017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6017))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Strategic Planning and Analysis\nNew issues have been opened to focus on strategic aspects of ElizaOS development, including finalizing cloud wireframes and conducting a SWOT analysis for agents.\n*   Cloud Wireframes Sealed & Agreed On ([#6019](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6019))\n*   SWOT Agent Analysis ([#6018](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6018))\n\n### Experimental Agent Development\nAn issue has been created to explore the development of a \"Prank Caller / AI Crank Yankers\" agent, suggesting a focus on novel and potentially humorous AI applications.\n*   Ship Prank Caller / AI Crank Yankers ([#6020](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6020))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

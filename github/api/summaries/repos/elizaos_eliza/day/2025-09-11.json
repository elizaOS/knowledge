  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 11, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW\nToday's development focused on critical bug fixes, specifically addressing test flakiness and cache-aware environment variable reads. Several new issues were opened, outlining future development directions including a browser database adapter, a refactor of core entities, and an SDK-first hooks mode.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core Stability and Test Reliability\nA significant bug fix was implemented to improve the stability of core tests. This involved making `SECRET_SALT` reads cache-aware to accurately reflect environment changes during testing and resolving flakiness in `plugin-bootstrap` tests ([#5968](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5968)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Documentation Improvements\nA broken link in the documentation related to LLMs was fixed ([#5954](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5954)). Additionally, miscellaneous documentation nitpicks were addressed ([#5967](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5967)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Database and Core Architecture Enhancements\nNew issues were opened to explore significant architectural improvements, including:\n*   Implementing a WASM PGLite adapter for browser runtime and ensuring single-connection handling ([#5964](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5964)).\n*   Consolidating duplicated database entities (rooms, worlds, channels, servers) into two core abstractions ([#5965](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5965)).\n\n### SDK and Plugin Development\nFuture development will also focus on:\n*   Supporting direct Eliza instantiation in the browser via hooks (SDK-first mode) ([#5966](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5966)).\n*   Sending a list of partners to the Business Development team (plugins) ([#5969](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5969)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jun 22, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant API documentation updates, ensuring alignment with the latest Eliza AI Framework, and a critical bug fix for database connection errors. These efforts enhance system stability and developer experience.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### API Specification Alignment & Documentation Refresh\nThe `eliza.postman.json` file was updated to reflect the current Eliza AI Framework API, including renaming, restructuring, and removing deprecated endpoints. Concurrently, the REST API documentation was extensively updated to align with the latest API specification v1, standardizing formatting, updating descriptions, and enhancing response schemas across numerous endpoints.\n- [#5239](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5239)\n- [#5236](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5236)\n\n### Robust Database Error Handling\nA bug fix was implemented to provide more precise error reporting when issues arise with the database connection, improving debugging capabilities for developers.\n- [#5235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5235)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#5242](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5242) Next\n- [#5241](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5241) feat: migrate client to use type-safe API client\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### API Endpoint Not Found Error Investigation\nIssue [#5230](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5230) reports \"API endpoint not found\" errors across most endpoints, with only the agents endpoint working. Initial analysis by ChristopherTrimboli on June 22nd suggested that the API documentation had been fully updated to the latest 1.0.10 APIs, implying the issue might be related to outdated documentation rather than missing endpoints. However, on July 3rd, iQiexie commented that the documentation still doesn't represent the actual API, citing missing parameters in error responses for the `submit-message` endpoint and a non-existent `send-message` endpoint. Most recently, on July 13th, Claude provided a comprehensive analysis, concluding that the API implementation is fully functional and the reported 404 errors are likely due to deployment or configuration issues, not missing endpoints. Claude verified that all documented endpoints are properly implemented and suggested potential root causes such as server initialization issues, environment configuration, port/network problems, or database issues. Diagnostic steps and recommendations were provided to help resolve the environmental factors."

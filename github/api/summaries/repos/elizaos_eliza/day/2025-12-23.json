This allows plugins to define typed event payloads, improving type safety and developer experience.\n- Generic type parameter added to `registerEvent` for custom events.\n- Enables plugins to define typed event payloads extending `EventPayload`.\n- Includes a new unit test to validate the functionality.\n- Relevant PR: [#6277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6277)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- **Asynchronous Message Handling & Cloud Optimization**: A new pull request [#6279](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6279) was opened to improve message service handlers, enabling them to perform asynchronous operations and optimize for cloud platforms.\n- **Generic Type Support for Event Handlers**: Pull request [#6276](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6276) was opened to address a bug by adding generic type support for custom event handlers in the core.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Dashboard and Performance Optimizations\nSeveral issues related to dashboard loading times and database performance were successfully closed, indicating a focus on improving user experience and backend efficiency.\n- Reduced dashboard loading time, addressing concerns about 10-15 second load times [#6248](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6248).\n- Tested Railway database for performance improvements, switching from Neon [#6250](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6250).\n\n### UI/UX and Agent Builder Refinements\nSignificant progress was made in refining the user interface, particularly within the agent builder, to enhance usability and consistency.\n- Redesigned the dashboard as the primary landing experience [#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222).\n- Prioritized apps on the dashboard to highlight their deployment value [#6225](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6225).\n- Added a chat interface to the landing page for goal-oriented user routing [#6223](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6223).\n- Elevated \"Apps\" to a first-class product section [#6224](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6224).\n- Added post-agent-creation next steps to guide users on deployment [#6226](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6226).\n- Moved the avatar button to position #4 in the agent builder [#6273](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6273).\n- Ensured the \"Create Agent Button\" is consistent across \"My Agents\" and \"Dashboard\" [#6274](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6274).\n- Refined the agent builder experience [#6268](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6268).\n- Added a tool tip for the system prompt [#6270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6270).\n- Implemented an inline \"send message\" button [#6271](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6271).\n- Added Topics/Adjectives to the agent form [#6272](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6272).\n\n### Bug Fixes and Content Management\nSeveral bugs were resolved, including issues with stale room states and error messages, alongside updates to brand assets and documentation.\n- Fixed stale room state after character edits, resolving 403 forbidden errors [#6260](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6260).\n- Addressed an error regarding \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_LARGE\" [#6140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6140).\n- Updated the Brandkit on GitHub to sync with the most recent version [#6091](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6091).\n- Updated documentation [#6264](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6264).\n\n### Feature Implementation and Naming Conventions\nNew features like inline image/video generation were implemented, and UI terminology was standardized for clarity.\n- Implemented inline image/video generation within chat bubbles [#6189](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6189).\n- Replaced \"MCP\" with \"Services\" in the UI for broader terminology [#6241](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6241).\n- Implemented true SSE streaming for real-time updates, replacing polling [#5930](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5930).\n- Added a warning for unsaved changes when users attempt to leave agent edit mode [#6275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6275).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### User Experience Enhancements\nNew issues have been opened to further improve the user experience, focusing on chat functionality and feedback mechanisms.\n- **Chat Renaming**: An issue was created to summarize chat names, aiming to improve chat organization and user clarity [#6278](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6278).\n- **Feedback Button**: A new issue proposes adding a feedback button to allow users to submit feedback easily [#6280](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6280).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

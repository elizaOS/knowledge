  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 13, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw active discussion on an existing issue regarding direct API calls, with a developer indicating readiness for review. A new documentation issue was opened concerning broken plugin links.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### Documentation Link Errors\nA new issue was reported concerning broken links within the documentation, specifically that every plugin link in the docs leads to a 404 error [#6061](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6061). The issue highlights that links like `https://docs.elizaos.ai/plugin-registry/overview#core-plugins` incorrectly redirect to `https://docs.elizaos.ai/plugins/bootstrap`. A comment noted that a PR in the docs repository aims to fix this by updating all plugin links from `/plugins/*` to `/plugin-registry/*`.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Direct API Calls Discussion\nDiscussion continued on the \"Direct API Calls\" issue [#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5923). The latest comment from tylermcwilliams indicates that the proposed solution is \"Ready for review.\" Previously, 0xbbjoker confirmed the approach, clarifying that `generate` would specifically refer to text generation, suggesting `generateText` for clarity, and `generateImage` for image generation. tylermcwilliams had proposed a `generateText(input: string, options?: GenerateTextOptions)` method, with options for `includeCharacter` and `modelType`, returning a `Promise<{ text: string }>`."

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 13, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on critical bug fixes related to TypeScript declaration generation and package exports, particularly for the `plugin-sql` module, ensuring smoother integration and build processes.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Plugin-SQL Type and Build Fixes\n*   Corrected the `types` path in `plugin-sql`'s `package.json` exports from `./types/index.d.ts` to `./dist/index.d.ts`, resolving TypeScript import errors ([#6134](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6134)).\n*   Removed a non-existent 'types' directory from the `files` array in `plugin-sql`'s `package.json` ([#6134](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6134)).\n*   Addressed TypeScript declaration generation errors for `plugin-sql` by adjusting build configurations ([#6146](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6146)).\n\n### Test Utilities Enhancement\n*   Implemented the missing `hasElizaOS()` method in the `test-utils` mock runtime, providing a required type predicate for the `IAgentRuntime` interface and returning `false` by default for test scenarios ([#6146](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6146)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n*   [#6147](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6147) proposes adding an `ownerId` field to the Agent with camelCase mapping for the `plugin-sql` module.\n*   [#6144](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6144) introduces an authentication token for the Socket.IO server.\n*   [#6143](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6143) aims to add `plugin-mysql` support, `initPromise`, and other minor fixes.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed on this day.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### Plugin Submission and Integration\n*   A new plugin submission for Coin Railz x402 Micropayment Services has been opened ([#6148](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6148)). The submitter, tdnupe3, has offered to provide additional support, including an example agent, documentation, and a quick-start agent for micropayment flows.\n\n### Migration and Token Swap Issues\n*   An issue regarding difficulties with AI16Z token migration to ELIZAOS tokens via the official website/migration portal was reported ([#6149](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6149)). This issue was subsequently closed with a recommendation to open a ticket in the Discord server.\n\n### Dependency Management\n*   A feature request was opened to address the deprecation of Langchain v0.3, suggesting migration to `langchain-classic` or bumping the version to v1 ([#6145](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6145)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Agent Functionality and Stability\n*   Issue [#37](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/37), \"Anyone able to get this to work right?\", received a new comment from rferrari stating that the system is \"working, at lease for now... i could setup using the instructions from readme file.\" This indicates some progress in setting up the agent using the provided documentation, though the initial problem of inconsistent posting behavior remains a potential concern."

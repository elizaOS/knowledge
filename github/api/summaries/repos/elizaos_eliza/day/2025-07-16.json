  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 16, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on addressing critical issues related to agent creation, plugin schema migrations, and inter-agent communication, alongside the closure of a character migrator issue.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Character Migration Tool Finalized\nThe issue concerning the v1 to v2 character migrator has been closed today, indicating the tool is now complete and available for use. This tool facilitates the transition of character data between ElizaOS versions. [#5452](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5452)\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Agent Creation and Directory Issues\nSeveral new issues highlight problems with agent creation, particularly on Windows, and directory management. Users are encountering \"ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir\" errors when setting up PGLite directories, and there are reports of the `.eliza` directory being hoisted. [#5603](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5603), [#5606](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5606)\n\n### API Key Configuration Challenges\nNew issues indicate difficulties with API key setup during project creation. Users are requesting the ability to make API key setup optional when using `npx elizaos create` and are unable to create projects without providing keys. [#5604](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5604), [#5605](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5605)\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Enhanced Agent-to-Agent Communication\nDiscussion on forwarding messages between agents without polling has seen significant progress. A comprehensive solution for direct, synchronous agent-to-agent communication has been proposed and implemented, featuring a new OpenAI-compatible `/api/openai/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. This solution aims to eliminate polling, provide immediate request-response cycles, and support streaming, allowing agents to target specific agents via an `X-Agent-ID` header. The proposed solution includes new files for the OpenAI router, documentation, and examples, and integrates with existing agent runtimes. [#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584)\n\n### Custom Plugin Schema Migration Analysis\nAn in-depth analysis of custom plugin schema migration issues has been provided. The root causes identified include the `DatabaseMigrationService` not being registered as a runtime service for SQL plugins, leading to skipped agent-level migrations. Solutions proposed involve ensuring proper plugin schema structure with correct exports, declaring plugin dependencies, and potentially modifying server-level migration registration. Workarounds like manual database schema creation or server-level plugin registration are also suggested. Debugging steps and common pitfalls for plugin loading and schema discovery are outlined. [#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588)\n\n### Twitter Client Initialization Errors\nMultiple users continue to report \"Twitter Client Initialization Error\" when creating or starting agents with the Twitter plugin. Despite successful authentication messages, subsequent errors related to memory insertion queries are observed. Users are seeking solutions to enable autonomous Twitter operations for their agents, noting that older ElizaOS methods for Twitter authentication worked previously.

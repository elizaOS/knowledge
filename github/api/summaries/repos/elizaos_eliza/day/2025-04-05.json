  "content": "# ElizaOS Daily Update (Apr 5, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, significant progress was made in enhancing the ElizaOS framework, particularly in the plugin-bootstrap and Twitter interaction areas. Key improvements included the addition of comprehensive test coverage for the bootstrap plugin and several bug fixes that enhance the overall stability of the CLI and Twitter functionalities. The team also addressed an issue related to running ElizaOS on Windows, which has now been resolved.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Feature Enhancements\n- Added comprehensive test coverage for the Eliza Bootstrap Plugin, improving the test infrastructure without altering production code ([#4173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4173)).\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Resolved an issue with the `elizaos test` command that occurred after creating a project or plugin ([#4196](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4196)).\n- Fixed a bun installation issue for the plugin-bootstrap by removing a non-existent `postscript` entry ([#4194](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4194)).\n- Eliminated a duplicate fetch call in the Twitter interaction functionality, streamlining the retrieval process ([#4192](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4192)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Resolved Windows Startup Issue\n- Closed the issue regarding the `elizaos start` command getting stuck on Windows with Node/NVM v23.3, which has been successfully addressed ([#4191](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4191)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Windows Startup Challenge\n- A new issue has been reported concerning the `elizaos start` command on Windows, where the process hangs and throws errors. This issue needs further investigation to ensure compatibility with Node.js v23.3 ([#4191](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4191))."

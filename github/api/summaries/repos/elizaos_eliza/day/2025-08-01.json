Significant effort was also put into repository cleanup by removing obsolete documentation and workflow files.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### CLI Enhancements and Build Optimizations\n*   **Automatic CLI Dependency Installation**: The `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency using Bun for `start` or `dev` commands in non-monorepo environments, streamlining the development setup. ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702))\n*   **Build Process Optimization**: Removed the docs filter from the main build process for more efficient builds and performed dependency cleanup. ([#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701))\n\n### Repository Cleanup and Maintenance\n*   **Obsolete Documentation Removal**: Unnecessary and outdated details, including LangChain integration references and extensive Tauri CI/CD documentation, were removed from the `README.md`. ([#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700))\n*   **GitHub Workflow Cleanup**: Three obsolete GitHub workflow files (`deploy-cli.yml`, `docs-publish.yml`, `llmstxt-generator.yml`) were removed, simplifying the repository's CI/CD setup. ([#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n\n*   A new pull request, [#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704), was opened to introduce a \"sessions API\".\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Core Package Enhancements\n*   **Action Management**: A feature request was opened to add an `unregisterAction` method to the core package, allowing for runtime unregistration of actions. ([#5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697))\n*   **Storage Service Type Definition**: An issue was created to add an `IStorageService` type to the core package, which is needed for new ElizaOS and AWS S3 plugins. ([#5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698))\n\n### Deployment and Infrastructure\n*   **Eliza Cloud Railway Deployment**: A new issue was opened regarding the deployment of Eliza Cloud on Railway. ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\nNo active issues had more than 3 comments today."

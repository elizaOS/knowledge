  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Dec 8, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on a significant dependency update across the monorepo, resolving compatibility issues and preparing for enhanced streaming support in text generation.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Dependency Management & Ecosystem Stability\nA major effort was undertaken to update all dependencies to their latest versions, specifically addressing conflicting `drizzle-orm` versions across the monorepo. This ensures compatibility and stability within the ElizaOS ecosystem. ([#6210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6210))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request, [#6212](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6212), was opened to enhance streaming support in text generation.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Functionality and Configuration\nAn issue regarding the necessity of `.eliza` files for `plugin-sql` to function correctly, and the need for its auto-creation, was closed. This problem was previously fixed in an alpha version. ([#6204](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6204))\n\n### Deepseek API Integration\nAn inquiry about using the Deepseek API was closed. While direct integration might be possible via OpenAI compatible endpoints, it was confirmed that Deepseek can be used with `plugin-openrouter` by configuring custom models. ([#6156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6156))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

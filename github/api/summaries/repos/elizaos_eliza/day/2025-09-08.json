  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 8, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on critical bug fixes across the core and server components, enhancing logging capabilities, and strengthening security with dependency overrides. Significant progress was also made in documentation, particularly for agent development.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Logging and Error Handling\nImprovements were made to the logging API to capture all logs, including namespaced agent logs, providing a more comprehensive view of system activity. The log level for `SECRET_SALT` validation was adjusted from error to warning to reduce confusion, and browser-specific Sentry integration was separated to resolve module resolution issues.\n- [#5900](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5900)\n- [#5895](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5895)\n- [#5893](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5893)\n\n### Core System Stability and Security\nKey fixes addressed server-side TypeScript logger parameter errors and ensured safer dependency management by adding NPM safe overrides for the `error-ex` package, mitigating potential supply chain risks.\n- [#5904](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5904)\n- [#5894](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5894)\n\n### Agent and Plugin Route Refinements\nUpdates were implemented to namespace plugin routes, making the server more permissive in development mode for easier integration with front-end frameworks. Agent panel loading was also fixed, exposing public agent plugin panels under agent-scoped paths.\n- [#5693](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5693)\n- [#5901](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5901)\n\n### Documentation and Repository Cleanup\nA new comprehensive contributor guide for agents (`AGENTS.md`) was added, and duplicate/deprecated documentation files (`AGENT.md`) and configuration files (`alpha-cli-tests.yml`, `fly.toml`, `knip.config.ts`) were removed to streamline the repository.\n- [#5898](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5898)\n- [#5899](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5899)\n- [#5897](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5897)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#5903](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5903): This WIP feature aims to add real-time channel creation with Socket.IO integration.\n- [#5902](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5902): A fix to sanitize DKG assets.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Documentation and UI Clarity\nSeveral issues related to documentation and user interface clarity were resolved. This includes addressing the lack of documentation for the web UI dashboard, ensuring users are aware of its existence and how to interact with agents.\n- [#5677](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5677)\n- [#5857](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5857)\n\n### Development Workflow and CI/CD Improvements\nIssues concerning the CLI CI tests and the dockerization of `project-starter` were closed, indicating progress in streamlining development and testing environments.\n- [#5714](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5714)\n- [#5842](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5842)\n\n### Chat UI Enhancements\nA request to show action calls and their results in the chat UI was completed, improving the transparency and user experience of agent interactions.\n- [#5831](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5831)\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Native Venice AI Provider Integration\nIssue [#5820](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5820) discusses the need for native integration of privacy-focused AI providers like Venice. The latest comment from `wtfsayo` clarifies that this can be achieved by modifying the base URL environment variable for the OpenAI plugin or by using the dedicated `plugin-venice`. This suggests that while a native integration might not be immediately planned, existing solutions offer a workaround for users seeking privacy-focused AI."

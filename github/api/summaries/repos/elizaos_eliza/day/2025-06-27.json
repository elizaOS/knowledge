  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jun 27, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant improvements to the ElizaOS framework, including enhanced character configurations, CLI optimizations, and critical bug fixes for client UI availability and static serving. A major feature addition involved new deployment configurations and plugin support for the `rofl` agent.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Agent and Plugin Enhancements\n*   Improved character configurations with enhanced plugin ordering and updated documentation, ensuring better agent behavior and easier setup ([#5302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5302)).\n*   Added new deployment configuration files for the `rofl` agent, fixed build issues, and integrated the `openai` plugin to enable all Polygon plugins ([#5277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5277)).\n\n### CLI and Client Infrastructure Improvements\n*   Removed orphaned legacy server directories from the CLI, streamlining the codebase as functionality has migrated to `@elizaos/server` ([#5305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5305)).\n*   Ensured the CLI build properly depends on the client build to prevent \"Client UI not available\" errors, resolving critical deployment issues ([#5307](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5307)).\n*   Improved the agent-log-viewer component by increasing the polling interval from 2 to 5 seconds for better performance and user experience, defaulting to live mode ([#5306](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5306)).\n\n### Bug Fixes and Rollbacks\n*   Dynamically resolved client paths for static serving to fix `NotFoundError` issues, ensuring proper access to client assets ([#5298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5298)).\n*   Rolled back a previous PR ([#5270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5270)) that had introduced new plugins as dependencies to the CLI and project starter packages ([#5297](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5297)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n*   [#5303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5303) `revert: Dynamic client path resolution`: This PR aims to revert changes related to dynamic client path resolution.\n*   [#5301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5301) `Feat/gork character`: This PR introduces a new character named \"Gork\".\n*   [#5300](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5300) `feat: Add Gork character persona`: This PR adds the persona definition for the new \"Gork\" character.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n### API Client Migration\n*   The `packages/client` has been successfully migrated to leverage the new `@elizaos/api-client` package, providing a type-safe, service-oriented API client for ElizaOS ([#5259](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5259)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Webhook Integration for Message Initiation\n*   Issue [#6](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6) discusses providing an option for webhooks to initiate new messages, as the current polling interval can be expensive or lead to poor UX. The latest comment from `wtfsayo` suggests that plugins can mount routes to the ElizaOS server, making webhook implementation feasible without excessive complexity. This indicates a potential path forward for implementing webhook functionality."

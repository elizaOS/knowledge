Additionally, documentation links were fixed, and a new model provider was proposed.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core API Enhancements\nA new `generateText()` Promise-based API was implemented to streamline text generation, addressing previous discussions around direct API calls. This feature clarifies the text generation process within the core runtime.

Its current status and progress are pending review.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Direct API Call Implementation\nThe discussion around implementing a direct API for text generation, specifically `generateText()`, has been concluded and resolved with the successful implementation of the new API. [#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5923)\n\n### Documentation Link Fixes\nAn issue where all plugin links in the documentation led to 404 errors has been identified and resolved. A pull request in the documentation repository addresses this by updating the incorrect links. [#6061](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6061)\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### New Model Provider Integration\nA new issue has been opened to discuss the integration of n1n.ai as a model provider, which offers access to over 400 large language models and multimodal generation capabilities.

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Dec 2, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day focused on significant cleanup and user interface improvements, alongside addressing a critical container deployment bug and server stability enhancements.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### UI/UX Enhancements and Simplification\nSeveral issues were closed related to improving the user interface and experience. This included cleaning up redundant user information in the sidebar, moving billing and credits to a more accessible location, and removing \"Quick Presets\" from the Generation Studio to simplify the UI. Additionally, a distinct visual theme for \"Build Mode\" was implemented, and the \"$\" symbol was added to credit balances for clarity. ([#6174](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6174), [#6175](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6175), [#6176](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6176), [#6177](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6177), [#6179](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6179))\n\n### Bug Fixes and System Stability\nA critical bug causing container deployment failures on specific architectures was resolved. Furthermore, a \"Dashboard\" button pointer event issue was fixed, and efforts were made to populate the \"Community Agents\" section or remove it if not feasible. ([#6187](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6187), [#6188](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6188), [#6182](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6182))\n\n### Server Reliability Improvements\nWork was completed to address concurrent connection timeouts and enhance server reliability. This involved configuring Socket.IO properly with ping/pong intervals and timeouts, as well as adding explicit HTTP server timeouts and socket disconnection handling. ([#6198](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6198))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES"

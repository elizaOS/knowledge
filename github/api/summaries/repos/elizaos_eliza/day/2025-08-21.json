  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 21, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant infrastructure changes, including converting documentation to a Git submodule, alongside crucial bug fixes for session metadata propagation and plugin-sql tests.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Documentation Infrastructure Overhaul\nThe project's documentation structure has been significantly refactored by converting the `packages/docs` directory into a Git submodule pointing to an external documentation repository. This change streamlines documentation management and reduces the main repository's size. ([#5803](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5803))\n\n### Enhanced Session Metadata Propagation\nA critical bug fix was implemented to ensure session metadata, such as `ethAd`, is correctly propagated throughout the ElizaOS message processing pipeline. This enables plugins and actions to access custom session metadata, improving data consistency and functionality. ([#5805](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5805))\n\n### Plugin Stability Improvements\nEfforts were made to stabilize the `plugin-sql` module, specifically addressing issues with test failures related to `createdAt` fields requiring `Date` objects for `pglite`. This fix ensures the reliability of SQL-related functionalities. ([#5802](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5802))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jun 17, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused heavily on bug fixes, addressing critical issues across message handling, project loading on Windows, and JSON serialization. A significant documentation enhancement was also added to guide AI assistants.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **Enhanced Chat Stability and Message Filtering:**\n    *   Fixed message filtering to ensure messages are correctly scoped to the current chat/channel, preventing cross-chat message display issues ([#5149](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5149)).\n    *   Resolved an issue where the GUI would get stuck when an agent ignored a user or sent an empty response, improving chat UI responsiveness ([#5151](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5151)).\n\n*   **Improved System Robustness and Compatibility:**\n    *   Addressed a critical bug preventing project loading on Windows machines ([#5156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5156)).\n    *   Implemented a fix to prevent infinite recursion in the JSON sanitizer by detecting and handling circular references ([#5152](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5152)).\n\n*   **Refined Agent Prompting and Codebase:**\n    *   Removed unnecessary evaluator choices from the `messageHandler` prompt, streamlining agent decision-making ([#5148](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5148)).\n    *   Refactored the codebase by removing OpenTelemetry instrumentation from socket message processing, simplifying the logic and cleaning up the code ([#5153](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5153)).\n\n*   **AI Assistant Documentation:**\n    *   Added a comprehensive `CLAUDE.md` file to provide detailed guidance for AI assistants on project architecture, development workflow, and critical rules ([#5158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5158)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n\n*   [#5163](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5163) fix: Windows compatibility for plugin imports and asset serving\n*   [#5157](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5157) fix: tests\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n*   **Knowledge Management Functionality:**\n    *   The issue where Knowledge management (RAG) was not working as expected in version 1.0.6 has been resolved and confirmed to be working in 1.0.9. Discussions included feedback on improving documentation for `LOAD_DOCS_ON_STARTUP` and the `plugin-knowledge` setup ([#5004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5004)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n*   **Windows Compatibility Issues:**\n    *   Reported issues with project loading on Windows machines due to `import()` not using the `file://` prefix ([#5155](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5155)).\n    *   An issue where `elizaos start` crashes after accessing `localhost:3000` on Windows was reported, preventing UI access ([#5161](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5161)).\n\n*   **Feature Request for AI Provider:**\n    *   A feature request was opened to add Ollama as an AI provider option in the `create` command, expanding the available choices beyond Local AI, OpenAI, and Anthropic ([#5159](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5159)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n*   **Plugin Action Callback Not Reaching User Response:**\n    *   **Issue:** The callback from plugin actions, specifically the `plugin-evm` transfer function, is not consistently making it to the end-user response in the chat.\n    *   **Discussion:** Users are testing with updated CLI versions (1.0.9) to verify fixes. Initial reports indicate some improvement for `plugin-evm`, but `plugin-mcp` responses still show issues. Developers are requesting users to perform clean installations (`rm -rf node_modules && rm -rf dist && rm -rf bun.lock`) and ensure `package.json` is clean to avoid cached dependencies. A temporary workaround involving modifying `plugin-bootstrap` was shared, which fixed the behavior for some but might affect evaluator logic. The issue is related to the order of action responses when a callback is passed. ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5017))"

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 11, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused heavily on enhancing code quality, automating workflows, and improving user experience. Significant progress was made in refining the CI/CD pipeline, particularly around code analysis and issue creation, alongside critical bug fixes and UX improvements.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Code Quality & Automation\nSignificant strides were made in establishing robust code quality analysis and automation. This includes adding comprehensive tools for daily code quality checks and documentation consistency ([#5532]), enhancing the workflow with Claude automation for verbose logging and issue creation ([#5543]), and implementing critical fixes for the code quality workflow, such as handling GitHub issue body character limits ([#5544], [#5541], [#5540], [#5539], [#5538], [#5535], [#5534]). Permissions for the Claude workflow were also granted to enable issue creation and bun/GitHub CLI commands ([#5553], [#5550]).\n\n### CLI & Core Utility Improvements\nThe CLI's robustness was improved by replacing `execa` with `bun.Spawn` for better logging and silent install failure detection ([#5531]). Core prompt logic was refined to enforce correct fenced code block formatting ([#5525]), reduce unnecessary LLM provider selection ([#5526]), and clarify prompt exclusivity for `IGNORE` actions ([#5528]). Ambiguity handling bugs in LLM responses were also addressed ([#5529]).\n\n### Client-Side UX & Character Management\nUser experience in the client was improved with an auto-resizing chat input textarea ([#5546]). A crucial feature was added for automatic V1 to V2 character conversion during JSON import, including plugin matching ([#5536], [#5537]). The agent settings page now keeps the user on the page after saving changes, improving workflow ([#5548]).\n\n### Configuration & Package Management\nA new \"configs\" package was introduced to unify ESLint, TSConfig, and Prettier configurations across the monorepo, reducing boilerplate and ensuring consistency ([#5508], [#5524]). The `plugin-forms` package was removed from the main repository, indicating a move towards externalizing plugins ([#5527]).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#5547](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5547) Refactored swap\n- [#5522](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5522) New AgentKit integration\n- [#5521](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5521) New NEAR plugin\n- [#5520](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5520) Feat: Autocoder + e2b sandboxes\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Code Quality Analysis Reports\nMultiple automated code quality analysis reports were generated and subsequently closed today, indicating active monitoring and rapid processing of code health. These reports highlighted various issues including dead code, security concerns, type safety, and missing test coverage ([#5542], [#5545], [#5549], [#5551], [#5552], [#5554]).\n\n### UX and Agent Management Improvements\nSeveral issues related to user experience and agent management were closed. This includes improvements for the \"three dots\" menu in the GUI ([#5498]) and resolution of UX issues concerning agent secrets ([#5502]).\n\n### Development Workflow & Plugin Migration\nIssues related to the development workflow, such as testing CLI commands against documentation ([#5325]), and the ongoing plugin migration using a hybrid AI and manual approach ([#5376]), were successfully closed.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Code Quality & Technical Debt\nSeveral new issues were opened today focusing on critical code quality and technical debt. These include a critical SQL Injection Vulnerability, the presence of non-Bun test frameworks violating project standards, missing test coverage for core functionality, excessive use of 'any' types in TypeScript, and significant dead code identified by Knip analysis ([#5542], [#5545], [#5549], [#5551], [#5552], [#5554]).\n\n### Windows Compatibility & Plugin Loading\nA new issue was reported regarding `plugin-local-ai` failing to load on Windows, leading to a loop when starting ElizaOS ([#5530]).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Plugin-local-ai failing to load on Windows ([#5499])\nThe `plugin-local-ai` is reported to be failing to load on Windows, with similar issues observed on Mac. A workaround suggested is to use hosted models. ChristopherTrimboli stated that a fix has been released in `v1.2.1` and is available for download. david-dina suggested uninstalling and re-running the script. The issue is still open, but a potential fix is available."

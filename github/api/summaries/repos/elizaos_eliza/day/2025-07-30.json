  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 30, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW\nToday, the team focused on standardizing documentation to exclusively use `bun:test`, improving consistency across the project. Several new pull requests were opened for refactoring and test fixes, while new issues highlighted challenges with the `dev` command, markdown rendering, and plugin deployment.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Documentation Standardization\nAll project documentation and rules files have been updated to exclusively use `bun:test` as the testing framework, ensuring consistency and clarity across the project. This involved changes to various `README.md` files, `CLAUDE.md` files, and documentation within the `packages/docs` directory. ([#5681](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5681))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nTwo new pull requests were opened today:\n- [#5692](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5692) proposes refactoring `plugin.ts` to adopt functional patterns.\n- [#5689](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5689) aims to fix subprocess mocks and CI paths within tests.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Documentation Review Completion\nThe comprehensive review of project documentation has been completed and closed. ([#5665](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5665))\n\n### Plugin-Related Issues Resolved\nSeveral issues related to specific plugins, including `aave`, `clanker`, `defi-llama`, and `moon-well`, have been closed. ([#5646](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5646), [#5645](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5645), [#5647](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5647), [#5648](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5648))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Development Environment and CLI Issues\nA new issue highlights that the `elizaos dev` command does not function correctly within a `plugin` folder without explicitly adding `@elizaos/cli` as a dependency. ([#5687](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5687))\n\n### Frontend Rendering Problems\nAn issue was opened regarding markdown rendering on the frontend chat view, noting that the spacing between lines is currently too wide. ([#5688](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5688))\n\n### Plugin Deployment and Branching Challenges\nTwo new issues address challenges with plugin management:\n- Setting `1.x` as the default branch for migrated/1.x supported plugins. ([#5690](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5690))\n- Some migrated 1.x plugins are missing auto-deployment CI files and are not being deployed. ([#5691](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5691))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

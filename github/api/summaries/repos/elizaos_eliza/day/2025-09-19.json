  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 19, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on refining the CLI's stability by fixing a critical bug related to dev server restarts and a significant refactor to centralize business logic within the server package, enhancing modularity and maintainability.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### CLI Stability and Development Workflow Improvements\nA bug causing an infinite loop during dev mode server restarts was resolved by ensuring the previous server port is released before a new one starts. This improves the development experience by preventing port conflicts and ensuring smooth restarts. ([#5988](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5988))\n\n### Core Business Logic Centralization\nA major refactoring effort was completed to centralize business logic within the `server` package. This involved moving various functionalities from the `cli` and `core` packages into the `server`, significantly improving modularity, maintainability, and the overall architecture of the ElizaOS framework. This change impacts a wide range of files across `cli`, `server`, and `core` packages.

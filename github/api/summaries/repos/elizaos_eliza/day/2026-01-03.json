  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 3, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on optimizing core message service provider handling for improved performance, alongside addressing new UI/UX issues and a SQL plugin fix.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core Service Optimization\nThe `default-message-service` underwent refactoring to optimize provider handling in MultiStep mode, aiming for faster internal execution of providers without altering their functionality or results. This change primarily impacts the `core` package and is considered low risk. ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request was opened to fix an issue in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` for `SET LOCAL` to prevent parameterization problems. ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316))\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### User Interface and Experience\n- A new issue highlights that the \"Connect wallet\" action should ideally lead directly to wallet options for a more streamlined user experience. ([#6317](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6317))\n- Another issue reports that scrolling functionality should extend to the entire page for improved navigation. ([#6318](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6318))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

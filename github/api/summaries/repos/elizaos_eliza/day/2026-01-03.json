  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 3, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on optimizing core message service provider handling for improved performance, alongside addressing new UI/UX issues and a SQL plugin fix.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core Service Optimization\nA significant refactoring effort was completed to optimize provider handling within the `MultiStep` functionality of the default message service. This change aims to improve execution speed without altering the functionality or results of providers. ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request, [#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316), was opened to address a fix in the `plugin-sql` by using `sql.raw()` for `SET LOCAL` to prevent parameterization issues.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### User Interface and Experience\nTwo new issues were reported concerning the user interface. Issue [#6317](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6317) suggests that the \"Connect wallet\" action should directly present wallet options. Additionally, issue [#6318](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6318) highlights a problem where scrolling functionality is not working across the entire page.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

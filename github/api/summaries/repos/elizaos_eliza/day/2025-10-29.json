  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 29, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing ElizaOS's multi-tenancy capabilities with PostgreSQL RLS, improving server health checks, and fixing a critical bug in DM channel creation, alongside minor updates to action options.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Multi-Tenancy and Server Stability\nSignificant progress was made in bolstering ElizaOS's multi-tenancy architecture by implementing PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) for tenant isolation, allowing multiple independent ElizaOS servers to securely share a single database ([#6101](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6101)). Additionally, public health check endpoints were added to the server, resolving issues with load balancer health checks in production deployments ([#6103](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6103)).\n\n### Client-Side Bug Fixes and Feature Improvements\nA critical bug preventing the creation of DM channels in the GUI client was resolved by correctly using the actual server ID ([#6105](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6105)). Furthermore, custom options can now be added to `Action` via an index signature, providing more flexibility ([#6104](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6104)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Navigation and Social Media Integration\nAn issue related to adding Discord and Farcaster buttons to the navigation was closed today ([#6089](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6089)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

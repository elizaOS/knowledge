  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 4, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw significant progress in laying the groundwork for new features, with a focus on billing, authentication, and performance. Several new issues were opened, indicating a strong push towards enhancing core functionalities and user experience.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo completed work was reported for this day.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n*   **New Middleware Development**: Two new pull requests were opened. One introduces an \"x402 middleware\" ([#6114](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6114)), while the other proposes a \"Framework for adjusting prompts to best fix model contexts\" ([#6113](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6113)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n*   **Frontend Agent Development**: The issue concerning the \"Otaku agent frontend\" ([#6054](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6054)) was closed.\n*   **UI/UX Enhancements**: The \"Left Menu Items\" issue ([#6086](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6086)), likely related to user interface improvements, has been closed.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n*   **Billing and Dashboard Improvements**: Several issues were opened focusing on billing and dashboard functionalities. These include \"Settings and Billing / Stripe Integration - Eliza Cloud\" ([#6118](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6118)), \"Billing Page & Stripe Integration\" ([#6123](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6123)), and \"Container Billing Logic\" ([#6124](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6124)). Additionally, \"Dashboard Redesign\" ([#6119](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6119)) and \"Agents Browser Flow\" ([#6120](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6120)) aim to enhance the user interface and agent management.\n*   **Authentication and Analytics**: New issues were created for \"Authentication & Login System\" ([#6126](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6126)) and \"Analytics\" ([#6125](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6125)), indicating a push towards more robust user management and data insights.\n*   **Performance and Infrastructure**: Issues related to \"Eliza Chat\" responsiveness ([#6127](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6127)) and \"Voice Infrastructure\" ([#6130](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6130)) were opened, highlighting a focus on improving core performance and expanding capabilities.\n*   **Documentation and Support**: A new issue, \"Docs\" ([#6128](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6128)), was created to address the need for a new public documentation UI. \"Support Tasks\" ([#6131](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6131)) and \"Plugin-Cloud Testing\" ([#6129](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6129)) also indicate ongoing efforts in support and testing.\n*   **Free Tier Features**: \"Free Mode Chats\" ([#6115](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6115)) and \"Free Inference\" ([#6116](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6116)) were opened to introduce and refine free-tier functionalities for non-logged-in users.\n*   **Changelog and Architecture Oversight**: The \"Changelog hasn't been updated since January.\" ([#6121](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6121)) issue points to a need for better release documentation. \"Architecture & Oversight\" ([#6117](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6117)) was created to oversee major refactors and PRs. A question regarding the location of documentation, \"Where did packages/docs/ go?\" ([#6122](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6122)), was also raised.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n*   **Billing Page & Stripe Integration** ([#6123](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6123)): CodeRabbit provided a detailed plan for implementing a complete Stripe-backed billing subsystem. This includes creating four new database tables (customers, payment_methods, invoices, transactions), adding six backend routers for various billing operations, developing a TypeScript API client with CRUD types, and creating seven frontend components for the billing page, overview, top-ups, payment methods, invoices, and transaction history. The plan also covers adding Stripe environment keys, migrations, and documentation.\n*   **Container Billing Logic** ([#6124](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6124)): CodeRabbit outlined a plan for a full automated monthly container billing system. This involves adding a new database schema for billing, a BillingService with cron job functionality, billing types and cost calculation, REST API endpoints for billing management, and comprehensive documentation. The plan also details wiring the new schema and routes into the server architecture.\n*   **Analytics** ([#6125](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6125)): CodeRabbit proposed implementing a new analytics API. This includes creating a new file for agent analytics with three endpoints (GET /api/agents/:agentId/analytics, /models, /services) that support time-range, limit, and type filters for aggregating model, service, container, chat, and media metrics. Documentation for the new API and modifications to the existing agent index file to mount the analytics router are also part of the plan.\n*   **Authentication & Login System** ([#6126](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6126)): CodeRabbit provided a plan to implement a production-ready OAuth and JWT authentication system. This involves adding TypeScript types, OAuth configuration, JWT utilities, an authentication service, and a database migration for authentication tables. The plan also includes comprehensive documentation, wiring routes and middleware, and developing a frontend login UI.\n*   **Eliza Chat** ([#6127](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6127)): CodeRabbit's plan for Eliza chat performance overhaul includes debugging and optimizing responsiveness by adding a ModelPerformanceMonitor with per-model timeouts and exponential-retry wrappers. It also covers integrating fast providers like Groq and Kimi, enabling real-time logging and metrics, and updating documentation related to model configuration and troubleshooting.\n*   **Docs** ([#6128](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6128)): CodeRabbit outlined a plan to add a new public documentation route at /docs. This involves creating and wiring a new React component to the main application, implementing a three-tab documentation page (Architecture Overview, API Explorer, Character Setup) using shadcn/ui and Tailwind, with features like responsive layout, interactive API explorer, code examples, and copy-to-clipboard functionality.\n*   **Plugin-Cloud Testing** ([#6129](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6129)): CodeRabbit's plan involves adding four new test files to provide comprehensive coverage and verification of ElizaOS cloud CLI commands (deploy, containers, login). These tests will validate documentation accuracy, TypeScript option/type consistency, and error-handling scenarios, and will be runnable via the existing Bun test runner.\n*   **Voice Infrastructure** ([#6130](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6130)): CodeRabbit proposed delivering a complete voice infrastructure. This includes adding client-side browser TTS implementation and a React hook, server-side premium and embeddings endpoints, and comprehensive documentation. Modifications to existing files will integrate premium routing and types, requiring specific environment variables for authentication and API keys.\n*   **Support Tasks** ([#6131](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6131)): CodeRabbit's plan for supporting anonymous ID and free inference architecture involves adding documentation, implementing new database tables (anonymous_users, inference_quotas, inference_usage), introducing a QuotaService with CRUD and scheduled resets, and integrating user-identification and quota-enforcement middleware. It also includes updating APIs and the frontend for fingerprinting and client changes, and enforcing tiered limits, model access, monitoring, and analytics."

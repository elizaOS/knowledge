  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 9, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw significant progress in client-side features with URL synchronization for DM channels and a fix for chat navigation. Documentation was improved with a modernized README, and several core issues were closed. A large number of new issues were opened, focusing on core API redesign, developer experience, and documentation.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Client-Side Enhancements and Fixes\n- Implemented URL synchronization for direct message channel switching and direct navigation, allowing users to bookmark and share specific conversations ([#5941](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5941)).\n- Resolved an issue where creating a new chat via the \"New Chat\" button caused URL inconsistency by removing a redundant `navigate()` call ([#5945](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5945)).\n\n### Documentation and Core Prompt Improvements\n- Modernized the README with a better structure and a quick start guide to improve the initial experience for new users ([#5896](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5896)).\n- Corrected an action name and improved the prompt for multi-step processes within the core system ([#5942](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5942)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Management and CI Stability\n- Resolved an issue related to custom plugin schema migration, with a detailed analysis and solutions provided by Claude, including proper plugin schema structure, dependencies, and server-level migration registration ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588)).\n- Closed an issue regarding a plugin not being visible in PRs after publishing, with guidance provided on correct publishing steps and registry submission ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)).\n- Addressed and closed issues related to setting 1.x as the default branch for migrated plugins ([#5690](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5690)) and fixing core CI tests ([#5715](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5715)).\n\n### Action History\n- Closed an issue concerning one-run action chain history ([#5496](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5496)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Core API and Runtime Refinement\n- Proposed establishing `ElizaOS` as the single programmatic entry point, defining its lifecycle methods, and implementing bulk operations for agents ([#5905](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5905), [#5906](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5906)).\n- Focused on cleaning up runtime internals, making state programmatically accessible, auditing type definitions, and removing legacy code paths ([#5910](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5910), [#5911](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5911)).\n- Addressed project management with `ElizaOS.loadProject(data)` for editable projects and replacing CLI loaders with explicit programmatic loading ([#5912](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5912)).\n- Introduced issues for runtime access and introspection, including a read-only runtime accessor, hot-reload capabilities, and introspection tools ([#5913](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5913)).\n- Highlighted the need for observability and resilience through metrics hooks and standardized error surfaces ([#5914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5914)).\n- Focused on testing and verification, including integration tests for initialization, reloads, and propagation of edits ([#5915](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5915)).\n\n### Message Bus and Agent Interaction Redesign\n- Proposed simplifying the message bus with a clean, optional, class-based API, defining new `MessageBus` class methods, and implementing chat-server-like semantics ([#5916](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5916), [#5917](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5917)).\n- Addressed features and resilience for the message bus, including message filtering, replay/recovery, backpressure, and rate limiting ([#5918](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5918)).\n- Suggested modernizing the message bus by replacing Node EventEmitter with Bun’s EventTarget ([#5919](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5919)).\n- Focused on integration and migration, including refactoring existing bus code, ensuring plugin compatibility, and writing a migration guide ([#5920](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5920)).\n- Emphasized testing and validation for multi-agent messaging flows, SSE streaming, and recovery scenarios ([#5921](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5921)).\n- Aimed to simplify agent interaction by exposing direct APIs for agents (e.g., `agent.generate(input)`) without requiring listeners ([#5922](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5922), [#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5923)).\n\n### Developer Experience and Frontend Integration\n- Focused on advanced output and flows, including structured return types, streaming responses, and multi-turn sessions ([#5924](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5924)).\n- Addressed error handling and debugging with timeout/retry patterns, debug mode logging, and performance benchmarks ([#5925](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5925)).\n- Proposed improvements to developer experience through serverless script examples, migration docs, and direct integration of agent output into workflows ([#5926](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5926)).\n- Focused on frontend integration with hooks and SSE, including `useEliza` and `useElizaChat` hooks, agent lifecycle management, and a mock client for testing ([#5927](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5927), [#5928](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5928), [#5929](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5929)).\n- Addressed streaming and state for frontend, replacing polling with SSE, ensuring offline fallback, and adding typed events ([#5930](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5930)).\n- Proposed developer experience enhancements like devtools overlay, bundle size optimization, and Next.js/Vite integration ([#5931](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5931)).\n\n### CLI, Server, and Documentation Overhaul\n- Addressed technical debt and cleanup for CLI/server, eliminating redundant logic and aligning with the `ElizaOS` class ([#5932](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5932), [#5933](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5933)).\n- Focused on consistency and stability for CLI/server, ensuring respect for `ElizaOS` defaults, consolidating helpers, and enforcing consistent logging ([#5934](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5934)).\n- Proposed testing and reliability for CLI/server, including smoke tests, integration tests, and improved error messages ([#5935](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5935)).\n- Focused on documentation and release process improvements, including automated changelog, clearer release notes, and versioned documentation ([#5936](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5936), [#5937](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5937)).\n- Proposed core documentation expansion, including renaming API references, adding detailed docs for runtime functions, and publishing JSON schemas ([#5938](https://"

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jun 15, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant architectural improvements, including splitting the server package from the CLI, extensive bug fixes across various components, and comprehensive documentation updates. Testing infrastructure was also greatly enhanced with new server and client tests.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core Architecture Refinement & Server Separation\nThe server functionality has been successfully extracted into a new, independent `@elizaos/server` package, maintaining backward compatibility with existing CLI integrations. This modularization enables independent usage of server components and streamlines future development. ([#5122](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5122))\n\n### Critical Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements\nSeveral critical bugs were addressed, including resolving CLI test failures caused by circular dependencies and missing runtime methods ([#5135](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5135)). Typographical errors in plugin documentation and action responses were corrected ([#5130](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5130), [#5127](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5127)). Improvements were also made to agent thinking state synchronization and evaluator callbacks ([#5128](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5128), [#5129](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5129)). The CLI codebase underwent strict typing and dependency updates for enhanced robustness ([#5126](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5126)).\n\n### Enhanced Testing and Documentation\nComprehensive tests were added for core, server, project-starter, and plugin-starter, including new Cypress tests for frontend components to facilitate development ([#5125](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5125)). Documentation received a major overhaul, with extensive accuracy and consistency updates across API router documentation, CLI overviews, and quickstart guides ([#5134](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5134)). A duplicated link in the sidebars was also removed ([#5119](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5119)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nFour new pull requests were opened today:\n- [#5133](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5133) `docs: add descriptive comments to API router mounting points`: A documentation enhancement to improve clarity.\n- [#5132](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5132) `🛠️ Fix: Resolve All Compiler Errors in Quickswap Plugin Test Suite`: A fix addressing compiler errors in a plugin's test suite.\n- [#5131](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5131) `fix: add Windows compatibility for CLI port cleanup in agent tests`: A fix to improve cross-platform compatibility for CLI tests.\n- [#5123](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5123) `DRAFT feat: quickswap plugin`: A draft feature for a new Quickswap plugin.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### API Endpoint Resolution\nThe issue regarding the `/api/agents/{agentId}/rooms` API endpoint not being found was closed ([#5121](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5121)). The discussion clarified that the correct endpoint for agent rooms is now `/api/memory/{agentId}/rooms`, and that the messaging API has transitioned to a channel-based architecture, using `/api/messaging/central-channels/{channelId}/messages` for incoming messages and `/api/messaging/submit` for outgoing messages.\n\n### GUI Plugin Duplication\nThe issue where the plugin list in the GUI settings displayed duplicates was resolved and closed ([#5086](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5086)).\n\n### Farcaster Configuration\nAn issue related to `FARCASTER_DRY_RUN` and other Farcaster settings in the `.env` file was closed, indicating a fix has been implemented ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/1)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### API Documentation Update\nA new issue was opened to update the `eliza.postman.json` file to ensure it is synchronized with the latest server API implementations ([#5124](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5124)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Bedrock LLM Integration\nThe discussion around integrating Bedrock as an LLM continues ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5117)). A user inquired about integrating Bedrock, noting the lack of CLI options. Initial responses suggested using existing OpenAI-compatible plugins or a blog post on OpenAI plugin environments. However, it was clarified that AWS Bedrock is not directly OpenAI compatible. The latest update indicates that a dedicated plugin for Bedrock is being developed and will be released soon, with a user confirming they were using a Bedrock gateway for OpenAI compatibility."

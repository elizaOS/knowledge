  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 11, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on critical bug fixes, primarily addressing database integrity issues in the server and refining the e2e test infrastructure. A new feature request for CometAPI support was also opened.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Server Stability and Database Integrity\nEfforts were made to enhance server stability by resolving a foreign key violation error in PostgreSQL environments. This fix ensures that agent records exist in the database before creating foreign key references, preventing startup issues. ([#6059](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6059))\n\n### E2E Test Infrastructure Refinement\nThe end-to-end test runner was updated to remove outdated `AgentManager` references. This involved replacing all `AgentManager` usages with `AgentServer`'s built-in `startAgents` method, streamlining the testing process. ([#6056](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6056))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#6060](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6060), was opened to simplify the CLI by leveraging the server and core components.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### Feature Request: Unified LLM API Support\nA new feature request, [#6055](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6055), was opened to add CometAPI support to ElizaOS. This aims to provide a unified API for accessing various LLM providers, building upon existing support for OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, Llama, and Grok.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nThere are no active issues with more than 3 comments."

Documentation was also improved by fixing a broken link. The development team focused on enhancing modularity and functionality, aligning with our core philosophy of adaptability and decentralization.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Plugin Enhancements\n- Completed the implementation and test cleanup of the Polygon zkEVM plugin, as detailed in [PR #4801](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4801).\n  \n### AI/ML API Integration\n- Added support for a new AI/ML API model provider, enhancing the framework's capabilities without affecting existing functionality, as outlined in [PR #4828](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4828).\n\n### Documentation Improvements\n- Replaced a broken link in the documentation, ensuring users have access to the correct resources, as noted in [PR #4829](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4829).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n- No issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Loading Issue\n- A new issue was reported regarding the `@elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm` failing to load due to a missing dependency on `@elizaos/plugin-tee`. This issue raises concerns about creating an Eliza AI agent capable of performing EVM operations, as described in [#4819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4819)."

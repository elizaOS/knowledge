  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 30, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant code refactoring to standardize logging across core components and CLI, alongside a critical rollback for `plugin-sql` build configurations. Several technical debt and logging-related issues were closed, while new discussions emerged regarding mobile and voice support.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Logging Standardization and Technical Debt Resolution\nA major refactor was completed to standardize logging across the Core, CLI, and Server components, improving consistency and observability. This effort addressed and closed a significant technical debt issue related to CLI/Server cleanup and logging unification.\n- Standardized logging across Core, CLI, and Server components ([#6169](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6169))\n\n### Plugin-SQL Build Configuration Rollback\nA rollback was performed on the `plugin-sql` package to revert previous build configuration changes, specifically restoring types path and adding a `types` directory.\n- Reverted build configuration changes for `plugin-sql` ([#6194](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6194))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Logging and Technical Debt Resolution\nThe team successfully closed issues related to standardizing logging across various components and addressing general technical debt and cleanup within the CLI and server.\n- Standardized logging across Core, CLI, and Server components ([#6073](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6073))\n- Eliminated redundant logic and aligned CLI/server with ElizaOS principles ([#5932](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5932))\n\n### OpenAI-Compatible API Support\nAn issue requesting support for OpenAI-compatible APIs was closed, with existing solutions highlighted for users to configure alternative LLM providers.\n- Addressed the request for OpenAI-compatible API support, noting existing configuration options ([#6168](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6168))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Future Platform Expansion\nTwo new issues were opened, indicating interest in expanding ElizaOS capabilities to new platforms and interaction methods.\n- Discussion initiated for adding Voice Support ([#6196](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6196))\n- Proposal for developing a Mobile App for ElizaOS ([#6195](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6195))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Farcaster + Base App Support\nDiscussions around adding Farcaster and Base app support are ongoing. The latest comments clarify that this feature is intended for the Otaku agent platform, not the Eliza framework itself, with an offer to define an initial scope for contribution.\n- The issue for Farcaster + Base app support is specifically for the Otaku agent platform, not Eliza framework ([#6161](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6161))"

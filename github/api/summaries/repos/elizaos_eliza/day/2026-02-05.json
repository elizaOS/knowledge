  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Feb 5, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw significant progress in closing out several infrastructure and integration-related issues, particularly around messaging, OAuth, and database migrations. Multiple new issues were opened, focusing on user experience, AI model optimization, and new feature development.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo new features, bug fixes, refactoring, documentation, or tests were added, and no other work was completed.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request, [#6461](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6461), was opened to update dependencies, the training pipeline, and tests for the 2048 game example.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Messaging and Onboarding Enhancements\nSeveral issues related to messaging infrastructure and user onboarding for the Eliza App were closed. This includes integrating a Twilio plugin for SMS fallback ([#6400](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6400)), implementing a \"poke-style\" onboarding flow ([#6413](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6413)), creating a dedicated Eliza App landing page ([#6412](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6412)), and setting up Telegram webhook registration ([#6425](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6425)). The messaging connection UI and routing service were also addressed ([#6431](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6431)).\n\n### Infrastructure and OAuth Improvements\nKey infrastructure issues were resolved, such as verifying serverless multi-tenant support ([#6415](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6415)), fixing a 3-second MCP plugin initialization delay ([#6432](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6432)), and provisioning a second Blue.io number for the dev environment ([#6446](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6446)). OAuth provider rollout for various services was completed ([#6437](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6437)), and a demo video for Google OAuth verification was recorded ([#6452](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6452)). Research into SMTP alternatives for Gmail OAuth was also concluded ([#6460](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6460)).\n\n### Database and Authentication Fixes\nA critical bug where user settings did not override agent settings, causing API key issues, was fixed ([#6451](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6451)). Additionally, the Drizzle migration cleanup was completed, addressing issues with manual migration scripts ([#6444](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6444)), and the authentication implementation was reverted and the auth page restored ([#6455](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6455)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### User Management and Integrations\nNew issues were opened to enhance user management and integration capabilities. This includes enforcing single OAuth connections per platform per user and linking Eliza App users to existing Cloud users ([#6462](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6462)). There's also a new task to deploy and test MCP servers for various OAuth integrations like Linear, GitHub, Slack, Notion, and HubSpot ([#6463](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6463)).\n\n### User Experience and AI Features\nSeveral new issues focus on improving the user experience and introducing new AI-driven features. This involves mapping out user journeys for the Eliza App, covering both utility-first and conversational flows ([#6464](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6464)). Additionally, a feedback system for NPC posts is proposed to improve character consistency ([#6465](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6465)), and a system for injecting top news stories with community voting into Babylon is planned ([#6466](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6466)).\n\n### AI Model Optimization\nA new issue addresses the optimization of AI model usage for the coding process ([#6467](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6467)). The goal is to establish best practices for using different AI models to reduce costs and improve efficiency.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

Key achievements include the restructuring of type definitions and improvements to logging functionality. Additionally, several bugs were addressed, contributing to a more stable and user-friendly experience.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Code Structure Improvements\n- Split the large `types.ts` file into more manageable, logical sections to enhance maintainability ([#4999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4999)).\n  \n### Logging Enhancements\n- Excluded text embedding content from debug logs to improve readability ([#5003](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5003)).\n- Resolved an issue where the logs viewer incorrectly displayed an empty state when data was present ([#5006](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5006)).\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Corrected typos in the `gitcoin-passport.md` documentation ([#5008](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5008)).\n- Attempted to fix matrix run issues on Windows ([#5007](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5007)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n- No issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Logging Configuration Issues\n- Reported that `LOG_LEVEL` set in `.env` files is ignored, functioning only when set via command line ([#5005](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5005)).\n\n### Knowledge Management Bug\n- Identified that the knowledge management (RAG) feature is not functioning as expected in version 1.0.6, with relevant code commented out ([#5004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5004))."

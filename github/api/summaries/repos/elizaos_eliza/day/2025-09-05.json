  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 5, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nToday, ElizaOS significantly enhanced its scenario testing capabilities with dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations. Critical bug fixes addressed logging issues and improved developer experience, while ongoing discussions continue for plugin visibility and build stability.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Scenario Testing with Dynamic Prompting\nA major feature was added to enable dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations within ElizaOS scenarios. This significantly improves the sophistication of testing and evaluation for AI agents, allowing for more realistic and complex interaction simulations. ([#5824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5824))\n\n### Developer Experience and Logging Improvements\nSeveral updates were implemented to streamline the development workflow. This includes fixes for logging inconsistencies, preventing excessive error messages, and adding support for `SERVER_HOST` in the `dev` command. File watching optimizations were also introduced for monorepo setups. ([#5881](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5881), [#5885](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5885), [#5884](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5884), [#5883](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5883))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Discord Integration and Image Generation Fixes\nThe issue where generated images were not appearing in Discord has been resolved. The problem was primarily related to Discord bot permissions and configuration, with a fix implemented in a previous PR. ([#5809](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5809))\n\n### CLI Project Creation Path Error Resolution\nA bug preventing new project creation due to a \"path not found\" error in the CLI has been fixed. The issue is no longer reproducible with the latest CLI version. ([#5856](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5856))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Logger Functionality Breakdown\nA new issue has been reported indicating that the logger is broken, potentially affecting the visibility and debugging of application processes. ([#5886](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5886))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Visibility in Registry\nDiscussions continue regarding a plugin that was successfully published to NPM but is not visible in the ElizaOS registry. The latest comments suggest the issue might stem from incorrect scoping of the npm package name and the need for a PR to the registry. A commit has been requested to correct the package name format from \"plugin-delta\" to \"@1BDO/plugin-delta\" in the registry. ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813))\n\n### Twitter Mention Response Issue\nThe issue where the agent does not respond to Twitter mentions remains active. The latest comment from `standujar` asks if the issue persists, indicating ongoing investigation or a potential fix in recent updates. ([#4921](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4921))\n\n### Core Build Failure\nThe build failure in `@elizaos/core` affecting the `bun run clean` command is still open. The latest comment from `standujar` suggests the issue might be resolved as it's no longer reproducible, implying a fix may have been implemented implicitly. ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738))"

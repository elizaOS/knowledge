  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 27, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant security and data architecture enhancements with the implementation of Entity-level Row Level Security, alongside a crucial bug fix for dynamic prompt normalization.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Security and Data Architecture\nA major feature was introduced to bolster ElizaOS's security and data architecture. This includes Entity-Level Row Level Security (RLS) using PostgreSQL policies for entity-based data isolation, and semantic C. This work involved extensive changes across the `client`, `api-client`, `cli`, and `examples` directories. ([#6167](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6167))\n\n### Dynamic Prompt Normalization Fix\nA bug related to dynamic prompt normalization was addressed. This fix ensures that structured responses from `dynamicPromptExecFromState` are correctly normalized for both XML and JSON outputs. It also relaxes required field validation to allow legitimate falsy values and includes new regression tests. ([#6192](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6192))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- No new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n- No issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n- No new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n- No active issues with more than 3 comments."

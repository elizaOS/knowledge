  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on refining core agent functionalities, streamlining the CLI by removing Claude dependencies, and addressing several documentation and release process issues.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core Agent Runtime Enhancements\nThe agent runtime received updates to improve action result accessibility and thought processing. A new public method was added to `IAgentRuntime` to allow plugins to access action results, enhancing plugin capabilities. Additionally, the computation of 'thought' for action events was optimized to ensure its availability for all action runs.\n- feat: add get action results ([#6081](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6081))\n- fix: action thought ([#6084](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6084))\n\n### CLI Streamlining and Dependency Reduction\nThe CLI underwent significant changes with the removal of Anthropic Claude Code dependencies and AI-powered plugin generation/upgrade functionalities. This change aims to reduce the CLI's footprint and simplify its architecture.\n- feat: remove claude code / upgrade / plugin gen from CLI ([#6087](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6087))\n\n### API Client Type Refinement\nThe `Agent.description` field in API client types was replaced with `bio` (string | string[]), aligning with a more consistent naming convention across the platform.\n- chore(types): replace Agent.description with bio ([#6085](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6085))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Documentation and Release Process Improvements\nSeveral issues related to documentation, release processes, and developer guides were closed today. This includes refining core documentation, improving release automation with changelog steps, and adding developer guides for migration and quickstarts.\n- Core Documentation Expansion ([#5938](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5938))\n- Documentation & Release Process ([#5936](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5936))\n- Release Automation ([#5937](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5937))\n- Developer Guides ([#5939](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5939))\n- Learning Aids & Discovery ([#5940](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5940))\n\n### Website and Content Updates\nIssues concerning the website's build page and a SWOT analysis for agents were resolved, indicating progress in content organization and strategic planning.\n- bake build.eliza page into docs ([#5974](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5974))\n- SWOT Agent Analysis ([#6018](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6018))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### UI/UX and Navigation Enhancements\nNew issues were opened to address user interface and navigation improvements, including updates to menu items and the addition of social media buttons.\n- Left Menu Items ([#6086](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6086))\n- Add Discord button to top header Nav and Farcaster to Bottom Footer Nav ([#6089](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6089))\n\n### Documentation and Brandkit Updates\nFurther documentation efforts are planned, specifically for creating a dedicated API/SDK section and updating the brand kit on GitHub.\n- Create Actual API/SDK Section of Docs ([#6090](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6090))\n- Update Brandkit on GH ([#6091](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6091))\n\n### Developer Tooling and Infrastructure\nAn exploratory issue was created to consider a DevTools MCP Server for various developer support functions.\n- DevTools MCP Server ([#6092](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6092))\n\n### CLI Installation Issues\nA critical issue regarding a `Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'` error after CLI installation was reported.\n- `Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'` after installing elizaOS CLI ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6088))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### The documentation for plugins isn't correct. ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6070))\nThe discussion on this issue highlights significant frustration from users regarding the plugin documentation and scaffolding process. Initial reports indicated that following the documentation led to errors, with one user expressing extreme dissatisfaction and switching to another framework. A core contributor, yungalgo, engaged with the user, offering to understand the specific challenges faced. Claude AI was used to identify and fix the root causes, which included incorrect CLI command syntax in documentation (`-t` instead of `--type`) and issues with template lookup paths during scaffolding. The fixes involved adding fallback paths for templates and correcting CLI syntax across multiple README files. The issue was closed after Claude's intervention, with the fixes aimed at resolving the reported plugin scaffolding errors."

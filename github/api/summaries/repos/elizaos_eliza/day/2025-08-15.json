  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 15, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's focus was on dependency updates to improve compatibility and maintainability, alongside addressing critical issues related to plugin publishing and testing.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **Dependency and Build System Improvements**\n    *   Upgraded `vite-plugin-node-polyfills` and other dependencies to enhance compatibility and maintainability, specifically addressing issues with `bun run clean`, `bats-assert`, and polyfills. ([#5776](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5776))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n*   A new pull request, [#5777](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5777), was opened to introduce streaming capabilities for `useModel /core`.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n*   **Plugin Publishing Reliability**\n    *   Resolved a critical issue where the `elizaos publish --npm` command reported false success for plugin publishing due to a 404 error from npm. The resolution involved updating the package name to be unscoped and ensuring the `package.json` matched the current plugin template structure. ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5754))\n*   **Plugin Testing Guidance**\n    *   Provided guidance and resolved an issue where a user encountered consistent errors during plugin testing. The solution involved proper WebSocket mock setup before imports to ensure the service uses the mock instead of real connections. ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5770))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

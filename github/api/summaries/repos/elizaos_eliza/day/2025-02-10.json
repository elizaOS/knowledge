  "content": "# ElizaOS Daily Update (Feb 10, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, significant progress was made in enhancing the ElizaOS framework with the addition of new agent commands. The team also addressed minor issues and continued to refine the codebase. Overall, the development efforts are focused on improving modularity and functionality, aligning with our mission to create an extensible AI agent framework.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### New Features\n- Introduced new agent commands to enhance functionality, as detailed in [PR #3424](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3424). This feature includes scaffolding for future enhancements but requires further testing.\n\n### Code Improvements\n- Added character methods to the codebase, noted in [PR #3400](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3400). While this addition expands capabilities, it has been flagged for potential bloat in the adapter and is not fully tested.\n\n### Minor Fixes\n- Corrected a typo in the codebase, as documented in [PR #3423](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3423).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Enhancements\n- Closed issue [#2793](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/2793) regarding the addition of a new plugin from Apro, which provides functionalities for querying coin prices and agent registration.\n- Resolved issue [#2230](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/2230) related to the creation of a swap plugin for EVM, enabling cross-chain and same-chain swaps.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Feature Requests\n- Opened issue [#3420](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3420) to decouple service types from third-party service development, highlighting the need for improved independence in plugin system development.\n- Raised issue [#3411](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3411) proposing the integration of BAML for structured outputs from LLMs, emphasizing the potential for enhanced developer experience.\n\n### Technical Challenges\n- Reported issue [#3418](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3418) regarding a module not found error when attempting to run ElizaOS on a Jetson Orin NX, indicating challenges for new users in the Linux environment."

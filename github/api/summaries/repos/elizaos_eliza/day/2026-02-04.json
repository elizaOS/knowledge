  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Feb 4, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing core functionality with per-user entity settings, fixing critical event emission bugs, and improving documentation. Significant progress was made in addressing long-standing issues and preparing for future integrations.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core System Enhancements and Request Context\nA new feature was added to the core system to introduce `RequestContext` for propagating per-user entity settings. This allows runtime methods to access originating entity contexts without explicit parameter passing, improving modularity and adaptability ([#6457](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6457)).\n\n### Bug Fixes for Event Emission and Plugin Functionality\nCritical bugs were addressed, including the `MESSAGE_SENT` event not being emitted after sending agent responses to the central server ([#6378](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6378)). Additionally, issues with the ElevenLabs API integration in the avatar example and the ElevenLabs plugin were resolved, consolidating project structure and improving functionality ([#6387](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6387)).\n\n### Comprehensive Documentation Updates\nSignificant documentation enhancements were made, adding core documentation pages covering architecture, core concepts, plugin development, interop, deployment, and API reference ([#6356](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6356)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Event Handling and LLM Evaluation Improvements\nThe issue where the `EventType.MESSAGE_SENT` event was not being emitted when agent responses were sent to the central server API has been resolved ([#5216](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5216)). Additionally, the `llm_judge` evaluator has been enhanced to provide multi-level evaluation beyond a binary `PASS`/`FAIL` outcome, allowing for more nuanced assessment of LLM responses ([#5637](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5637)).\n\n### Secure User Service Authentication\nA system for users to securely authenticate their personal services (e.g., Gmail, GitHub) through chat-initiated OAuth flows has been implemented ([#6410](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6410)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Pre-Launch Testing and Quality Assurance\nA bug bashing session has been proposed to coordinate end-to-end testing once integrations are ready, focusing on pre-launch quality assurance ([#6459](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6459)).\n\n### Research into Alternative Email Sending Methods\nResearch is needed to identify alternative email sending methods that do not require Google OAuth verification, specifically focusing on SMTP configuration for users ([#6460](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6460)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

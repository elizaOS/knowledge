  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 9, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant feature additions, including a new forms plugin and client-side UX improvements. Critical bug fixes addressed installation issues, action chaining, and form plugin stability.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core Plugin Development & Enhancements\nA new forms plugin was introduced, providing a foundational service for other plugins to build interactive forms. This includes comprehensive test coverage for database persistence, Zod validation, transaction safety, and error handling. Critical issues within the forms plugin were also addressed, fixing value extraction and improving robustness.\n- [#5487](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5487)\n- [#5489](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5489)\n- [#5488](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5488)\n\n### Client-Side User Experience & Architecture\nThe client's ArrayInput component was enhanced with an embedded \"Add\" button for improved usability, reducing reliance on the Enter key for adding tags. Additionally, the handling of client distribution files was refactored, moving responsibility from the CLI to the server package for better organization.\n- [#5493](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5493)\n- [#5483](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5483)\n\n### Critical Bug Fixes & Stability Improvements\nSeveral critical bugs were resolved, including a fix for Google Generative AI plugin installation during project creation. Issues in the action chaining implementation were addressed for increased robustness, and a problem preventing PGLITE database hoisting to parent `.eliza` directories was fixed. The progressive reveal animation in `AnimatedMarkdown` was also smoothed out.\n- [#5503](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5503)\n- [#5490](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5490)\n- [#5485](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5485)\n- [#5495](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5495)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#5492](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5492): Implements a CLI documentation coverage validation system.\n- [#5491](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5491): Refactors a swap mechanism.\n- [#5486](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5486): Ensures that hoisting does not occur outside the monorepo.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Installation & Functionality\nThe issue with the Google Generative AI plugin failing to install during project creation on Windows was closed, resolved by a corresponding fix.\n- [#5500](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5500)\n\n### Feature Review & Enhancement\nThe review of image generation functionality was completed and closed.\n- [#5375](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5375)\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Installation & Plugin Failures\n- [#5482](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5482): Reports dependency installation failure with exit code 1.\n- [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5499): Notes that `plugin-local-ai` is failing to load on Windows.\n- [#5500](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5500): Describes `plugin-google` failing during project creation on Windows.\n\n### UI/UX & Agent Functionality\n- [#5494](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5494): Introduces \"Jimmy Agent.\"\n- [#5496](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5496): Requests a \"One run action chain history\" feature.\n- [#5498](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5498): Suggests a \"Three dots improvement in GUI\" for import/export.\n- [#5502](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5502): Addresses an \"Agent Secrets UX issue resolution.\"\n\n### Build & Development Workflow\n- [#5497](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5497): Proposes that `elizaos start` should always build the project.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Dependency Installation Failed with Exit Code 1\n- [#5482](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5482): The user reported a dependency installation failure. Claude provided a comprehensive troubleshooting guide, emphasizing the requirement for `bun` (not `npm` or `pnpm`), Node.js 23.3.0, and proper `bun` installation. It also covered Git submodule issues, platform-specific considerations (WSL 2 for Windows), and a clean installation process. The user was asked to provide their OS, Node/Bun versions, and exact error messages for further assistance."

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 5, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing agent responsiveness with improved mention detection and adding pagination capabilities to memory retrieval. A minor documentation typo was also fixed.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Agent Responsiveness and Contextual Awareness\nSignificant updates were made to the core message flow logic, introducing a `mentionContext` interface and refining the `shouldRespond` logic. These changes aim to improve how the AI agent detects and responds to mentions, making it more platform-agnostic and intelligent in its decision-making. This is a medium-risk change affecting LLM decision-making. ([#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030))\n\n### Database Memory Pagination\nThe `getMemories` function now supports an optional `offset` parameter, enabling pagination for database-backed memory retrieval. This enhancement includes applying `limit`/`offset` in SQL queries and validating non-negative values, along with new integration tests to cover paging and edge cases. ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032))\n\n### Documentation Refinement\nA minor typo (\"Occassionally\" to \"Occasionally\") was corrected in the CLI scenario documentation. ([#6000](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6000))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request, [#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033), was opened to modernize the Renovate configuration and add a preset specifically for plugins.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Module Import Errors in Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031))\nDiscussion continues regarding import errors when creating new projects with Eliza CLI 1.61. The user `matteo-brandolino` initially suspected the issue was related to type definition files in `@Elizaos/core`, referencing non-existent source files in the published package. They noted that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolved the problem. `0xbbjoker` suggested running `bun x tsc --noEmit` to diagnose the issue, believing it might be an IDE-specific TypeScript compiler problem. `matteo-brandolino` later provided the output of `bun x tsc --noEmit`, which confirmed 28 errors across 4 files, indicating that various core types and members like `logger`, `IAgentRuntime`, `Project`, and `Character` are not being exported or found. This suggests a deeper issue with the `@elizaos/core` package's exports in version 1.61."

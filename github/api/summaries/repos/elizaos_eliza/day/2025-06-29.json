  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jun 29, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on critical bug fixes and documentation improvements. A significant bug preventing the saving of large character files was resolved, and documentation for plugin-bootstrap requirements was enhanced.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Server Stability and File Size Handling\nA critical bug preventing the saving of large character files was fixed by increasing the Express JSON payload limit from 100KB to 2MB. This update also includes a comprehensive regression test to prevent future occurrences of this issue. ([#5308](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5308))\n\n### Documentation Clarity\nDocumentation was enhanced to clearly communicate that `plugin-bootstrap` is mandatory for communication and basic agent functionality, unless heavy customizations are being performed. This update improves clarity for new users and developers. ([#5309](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5309))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Character File Size Limit\nThe issue where users could not save large character files due to a \"request entity too large\" error has been resolved. The server's JSON payload limit was increased to accommodate larger character files. ([#5268](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5268))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments were updated today."

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Feb 6, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing the dynamic execution engine with new tests for context management, alongside addressing several critical bug fixes related to null checks in plugin bootstrapping and settings utilities. Significant progress was also made in integrating and deploying the Discord plugin.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Dynamic Execution Engine Testing\n- Added tests for the V2.0.0 dynamic execution engine to validate context management and prevent context overflow, redoing previous work for the new version ([#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384)). This work introduces a validation-aware, schema-driven prompt execution path across runtimes and message flows.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- **Plugin Bootstrap Null Checks:** Three new pull requests were opened to address null pointer exceptions. These include adding a null check for `runtime.providers` in `plugin-bootstrap` ([#6473](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6473)), adding null checks to `Object.entries` calls in settings utilities ([#6471](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6471)), and adding null/undefined checks to prevent `Object.entries` errors specifically in `plugin-bootstrap` ([#6470](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6470)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Discord Plugin Integration & Deployment\n- The Discord Plugin has been successfully integrated into the Cloud environment ([#6398](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6398)), enabling Discord as a messaging surface.\n- The Discord plugin has also been deployed as an AWS service ([#6424](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6424)), allowing it to handle incoming messages and route them to agents within the infrastructure.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Security & Audit Enhancements\n- A new issue has been opened for a security audit and fixes for the MCP implementation, based on a recent review ([#6472](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6472)).\n- A request was made to add an EVM smart contract audit module to the ElizaOS EVM module ([#6468](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6468)).\n\n### Whitelisting System Development\n- A comprehensive whitelisting system is proposed to control access to the game/gating system, including \"First 100\", Leaderboard, and Ad-Hoc Admin Controls ([#6469](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6469)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jun 18, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on expanding AI provider options, streamlining CLI commands, enhancing character validation, and improving database management. Several key bug fixes were also implemented, alongside ongoing documentation updates.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced AI Provider Integration & CLI Streamlining\nThe `create` command now supports Ollama as an AI provider option, expanding choices for users. CLI commands were consolidated, merging the standalone `stop` command into `agent stop --all` for a more consistent user experience.\n- [#5160](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5160)\n- [#5175](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5175)\n\n### Robust Character Validation and Data Management\nSignificant improvements were made to character validation with the implementation of Zod-based validation and safe JSON parsing, enhancing data integrity. Database relationship management was improved with cascade delete functionality for agents, ensuring proper cleanup.\n- [#5167](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5167)\n- [#5171](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5171)\n\n### Core System Refinements and Bug Fixes\nKey bug fixes addressed global environment variable loading issues and resolved plugin template dependencies, improving the reliability of plugin creation and publishing. Media content display was tweaked for better color contrast and text handling.\n- [#5174](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5174)\n- [#5173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5173)\n- [#5165](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5165)\n\n### Documentation and Codebase Consolidation\nDocumentation links were updated to reflect the new official ElizaOS URL, and core documentation files were refreshed for clarity. Code refactoring efforts began to consolidate character loading logic, reducing duplication between CLI and server components.\n- [#5162](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5162)\n- [#5164](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5164)\n- [#5154](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5154)\n- [#5169](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5169)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#5184](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5184) feat: (cli) add monorepo guard with clear error messaging and navigation guidance\n- [#5180](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5180) Fix tests\n- [#5178](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5178) feat(plugin-alethea): Add comprehensive test suite with 93% coverage\n- [#5177](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5177) Fix/summarized tweet interval issue\n- [#5176](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5176) Phase 2: Environment Variable Centralization\n- [#5170](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5170) feat: implement Phase 2 unified configuration management (#5168)\n- [#5191](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5191) chore: bun:test migration + fix cli test\n- [#5190](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5190) Implement changes needed for full AGI\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Character Validation and Project Loading Improvements\nIssues related to character loading and validation, specifically the lack of robust validation and safe JSON parsing, were addressed and closed. Additionally, the problem of technical debt and complexity in the project loading and detection system was tackled.\n- [#5166](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5166)\n- [#5168](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5168)\n\n### AI Provider and LLM Integration\nThe feature request to add Ollama as an AI provider option in the `create` command was implemented and closed. An issue regarding the integration of Bedrock as an LLM was also closed, with a plugin released to address it.\n- [#5159](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5159)\n- [#5117](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5117)\n\n### API and Agent Behavior Fixes\nProblems with successive replies on target users were resolved. An issue where creating a room via the REST API initially worked but then returned an empty rooms array was also closed, with confirmation that it was fixed in version 1.0.9.\n- [#4940](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4940)\n- [#4955](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4955)\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Logging and Database Scalability\nA new issue was opened to allow downstream projects to customize the root logger configuration, addressing the current limitation where projects cannot modify transports or other logger behaviors. Another issue proposes implementing advisory locking for the DatabaseMigrationService to prevent race conditions during horizontal scaling.\n- [#5183](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5183)\n- [#5181](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5181)\n\n### Testing Framework Standardization\nA new issue highlights the problem of using a mixed testing setup with both `vitest` and `bun:test` across the monorepo, proposing a migration to `bun:test` for standardization.\n- [#5185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5185)\n\n### Plugin and Client Interaction\nAn issue was reported where the Twitter plugin is not running correctly when both the plugin and client are used together in a character, leading to consent violation warnings.\n- [#5172](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5172)\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Callback from Plugin Action to User Response ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5017))\nThe discussion revolves around a bug where callbacks from plugin actions are not reaching the end-user response in chat, specifically observed with `plugin-evm` and `plugin-mcp`. The latest comments indicate that after a fresh start with an updated CLI (version 1.0.9), responses are now being received for `plugin-evm` testing. There are still some potential issues with `plugin-mcp` responses, which might be unrelated. The issue is being considered for closure, with a suggestion to open a new issue for `plugin-mcp` if problems persist. Previously, a hotfix for `plugin-bootstrap` was shared as a workaround, suggesting a placeholder function was being passed instead of the proper callback."

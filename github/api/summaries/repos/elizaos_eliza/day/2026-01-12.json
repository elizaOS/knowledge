  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 12, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant performance optimizations for runtime initialization, achieving up to 40% faster warm starts. A new feature was also added to allow configuring embedding dimensions, reducing API calls.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Runtime Performance Enhancements\nOptimized `runtime.initialize()` by implementing atomic upserts and parallelizing independent operations, resulting in a 30% reduction in cold start times and a 40% reduction in warm start times. This involved changes across `plugin-sql`, `server`, and `core` packages. [#6342](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6342)\n\n### Embedding Dimension Configuration\nAdded support for configuring the embedding dimension via the `EMBEDDING_DIMENSION` setting, which allows skipping an expensive ~500ms embedding API call during agent initialization. This simplifies the `ensureEmbeddingDimension` method. [#6357](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6357)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Application Management\nThe issue concerning \"Unslop Apps\" was closed today.

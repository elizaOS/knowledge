  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 15, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day's development focused on critical bug fixes, including resolving an infinite rebuild loop in `dev-watch` mode and preventing shell environment variable leakage into agent secrets.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Preventing Infinite Rebuild Loops\nAn infinite rebuild loop in `dev-watch` mode was fixed. This issue was caused by `generate-version.ts` writing to `src/version.ts` on every build, which the watcher then detected, triggering endless rebuilds. The fix addresses this by modifying `packages/cli/src/scripts/generate-version.ts` and `scripts/dev-watch.js`. ([#6361](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6361))\n\n### Enhancing Security by Preventing Environment Variable Leakage\nA significant security improvement was implemented to prevent shell environment variables from leaking into ElizaOS plugin loading decisions and agent secrets. The `dotenv.config()` function was not overriding existing `process.env` values by default, leading to this vulnerability. This fix involved changes across several files in `packages/cli` and `packages/core`. ([#6360](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6360))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- No new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n- No issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n- No new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n- No active issues with more than 3 comments."

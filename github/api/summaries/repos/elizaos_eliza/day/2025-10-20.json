  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 20, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on critical bug fixes, including resolving missing dotfiles in new projects and addressing build failures. Several long-standing issues related to logger compatibility and build processes were also closed.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### CLI and Project Scaffolding Improvements\n*   **Resolved Missing Dotfiles:** Fixed an issue where `eliza create` was not including essential dotfiles like `.gitignore` and `.env.example` in new projects, improving project setup consistency. ([#6080](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6080))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n*   [#6081](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6081) feat: add get action results - This new feature aims to add functionality for retrieving action results.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Build Process and Compatibility Resolutions\n*   **Bun Build Compatibility:** The issue regarding `pino-pretty` errors in export builds from Bun, which led to the migration from pino to adze logger, has been successfully resolved. ([#5673](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5673))\n*   **Core Build Failure Fixed:** A critical build failure in `@elizaos/core` that prevented `bun run clean` from executing successfully has been addressed. ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738))\n\n### CLI Enhancements and User Experience\n*   **Optional API Key Setup:** The request to make API key setup optional in `npx elizaos create` has been closed, as it is already optional with the `-y` flag. ([#5604](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5604))\n*   **Dotfile Inclusion in `eliza create`:** The problem of missing `.gitignore` in projects scaffolded by `eliza create` has been fixed. ([#6074](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6074))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

([#6363](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6363))\n- A fix for the CLI to ensure that `@elizaos` dependencies in new projects always use the 'latest' version has been submitted. ([#6362](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6362))\n- A fix to prevent infinite rebuild loops in `dev-watch` mode has been opened. ([#6361](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6361))\n- A CLI fix to prevent shell environment variable leakage into agent secrets is under review. ([#6360](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6360))\n- An update addressing Python example testing and fixes for `v2.0.0` has been initiated. ([#6358](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358))\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Dashboard UI/UX Improvements\nTwo issues related to the agent dashboard's user interface were closed, focusing on the display of public/private icons and their hover states for better clarity and user experience. ([#6352](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6352))\n\n### User Onboarding Enhancements\nAn issue concerning the \"Sign up for free\" message in the agent's response for non-signed-up users was closed, indicating that it has been made into a clickable hyperlink to improve the onboarding process. ([#6353](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6353))\n\n### Feature Promotion\nThe \"Apps promotion feature\" issue has been closed, suggesting that the functionality for promoting applications has been addressed.

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 17, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's focus was on critical bug fixes, particularly addressing plugin loading issues and refining the migration to Bun's native EventTarget API for improved compatibility and performance. Significant progress was made in enhancing type safety and testing backward compatibility.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core API Modernization and Compatibility\n*   Migrated from Node.js EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget API, enhancing performance and compatibility with the Bun runtime ([#5609](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5609)).\n*   Addressed critical review issues from the EventTarget migration, including type safety and method chaining support for `on()` methods ([#5614](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5614), [#5612](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5612)).\n*   Replaced generic `any` types with `unknown` and explicit function signatures for improved type safety across affected modules ([#5611](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5611)).\n*   Added comprehensive unit tests to ensure backward compatibility with EventEmitter-based patterns for both `InternalMessageBus` and `SimpleMigrationAgent` ([#5613](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5613)).\n\n### Plugin and CLI Stability Fixes\n*   Resolved a critical bug preventing plugin actions from loading in the NPM deployed version of the ElizaOS CLI, ensuring proper functionality for published packages ([#5624](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5624)).\n*   Removed the `node-fetch` dependency from the bootstrap plugin to ensure full compatibility with Bun's native fetch implementation, fixing issues with message sending in Bun environments ([#5607](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5607)).\n\n### Documentation Cleanup\n*   Removed obsolete documentation files related to previously implemented fixes, streamlining the project's documentation ([#5621](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5621)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n*   [#5623](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5623) refactor(plugin-bootstrap): migrate JSON prompts to XML format\n*   [#5622](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5622) feat: add tiny, dim CLI warning when running from monorepo\n*   [#5615](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5615) eliza\n*   [#5610](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5610) chore: 1.2.11\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### CLI and Agent Setup Issues\n*   An issue was reported where the `.elizadb` directory is created in the wrong location (current working directory) instead of inside the newly created project folder when running `elizaos create` ([#5616](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5616)).\n*   An agent created on Windows WSL is not responding to messages in the front-end GUI after creation and setup ([#5617](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5617)).\n*   Windows CI tests are failing due to incorrect path handling in CLI agent start command tests, specifically with the `--path` flag ([#5619](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5619)).\n\n### Plugin Development and Testing\n*   A new issue was opened for \"Plugin-zapper\" ([#5620](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5620)).\n\n### Test/Spam Issues\n*   Several test/spam issues were created and subsequently closed: \"its working!\" ([#5625](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5625), [#5627](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5627)) and \"hello world\" ([#5626](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5626)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Twitter Integration Database Error\n*   **[#39](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/39) Twitter error with sql database**: This issue describes a `Failed query: insert into \"memories\"` error when starting the Twitter service. The latest comment from `yohaiai` at 2025-07-17T13:17:10Z simply states \"+1\", indicating another user is experiencing the same problem, suggesting the issue persists and affects multiple users. The error message points to a database insertion failure related to memories."

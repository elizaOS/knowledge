  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 10, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw significant progress in closing out several long-standing issues related to runtime improvements, project management, and observability. Discussions also advanced on the direct API calls for agent interactions.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\nNo new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Core Runtime and Project Management Enhancements\nSeveral issues aimed at improving the core runtime and project management capabilities were closed. This includes simplifying runtime internals and making state programmatically accessible [#5910](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5910), implementing programmatic project loading via `ElizaOS.loadProject(data)` [#5912](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5912), and enhancing runtime access and introspection with features like hot-reloading and introspection tools [#5913](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5913).\n\n### Observability and Testing Improvements\nEfforts to bolster the framework's observability and testing infrastructure were completed. This involved adding metrics hooks and standardizing error surfaces for runtime crashes [#5914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5914), and implementing integration tests for initialization, reloads, and configuration propagation [#5915](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5915).\n\n### Cloud and Configuration Updates\nKey issues related to cloud development and configuration were resolved. This includes the finalization and agreement on cloud wireframes [#6019](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6019) and addressing the default port configuration to avoid conflicts [#6051](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6051).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Cloud and Mobile Development\nNew issues were opened to explore expanding ElizaOS to mobile platforms, specifically for cloud mobile applications on iOS/Android [#6053](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6053).\n\n### Agent Frontend Development\nA new issue was created to develop the frontend for the Otaku agent [#6054](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6054).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Direct API Calls for Agent Interaction\nDiscussion on issue [#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5923) regarding direct API calls for agents is ongoing. The conversation clarified that the `generate()` function is primarily intended for text generation, with a suggestion to rename it to `generateText` for clarity. There's a proposal for a `generateText(input: string, options?: GenerateTextOptions)` API that would return a Promise, with options to include character personality and specify model type."

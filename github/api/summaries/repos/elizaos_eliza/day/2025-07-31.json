  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 31, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant documentation restructuring, fixing the TEE Starter Project, and adding character-based model configuration settings.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Model Configuration and Runtime\nA new feature was added to allow model parameters to be configured at the character level, providing more flexibility than hardcoded plugin settings. This enhancement improves the adaptability of AI agents. ([#5686](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5686))\n\n### TEE Starter Project Revitalization\nThe TEE Starter Project received a crucial update, fixing its broken development experience. This ensures that developers can now use the starter project effectively. ([#5683](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5683))\n\n### Comprehensive Documentation Overhaul\nA major restructuring and cleanup of the ElizaOS documentation were completed. This involved removing the old Docusaurus-based structure and implementing a new, more organized layout, significantly improving documentation quality and accessibility. ([#5694](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5694))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#5693](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5693), was opened to fix namespace plugin routes.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### CLI Tooling and Dependency Issues\nTwo new issues were reported concerning the command-line interface (CLI) and dependencies. Issue [#5695](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5695) highlights that `start` and `dev` commands should automatically add `@elizaos/cli` as a dev dependency if it's not already present. Additionally, issue [#5696](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5696) reports a `zod` module not found error when running the `dev` command, indicating a potential dependency resolution problem.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues had more than 3 comments today."

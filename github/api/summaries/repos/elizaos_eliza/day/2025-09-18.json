  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 18, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW\nThe day saw significant activity in addressing existing issues and proposing new features. Several long-standing issues related to plugin development and update notifications were closed. New pull requests were opened for refactoring and bug fixes, and a new feature request for Eigen TEE deployment was created.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo completed work was reported for Sep 18, 2025.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nThree new pull requests were opened today:\n- [#5990](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5990) proposes a refactor of dynamic migrations.\n- [#5989](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5989) is a pending pull request with no further details.\n- [#5987](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5987) aims to standardize the PGLite data directory environment variable within the `plugin-sql`.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n**Plugin Development and Integration**\nSeveral issues related to specific plugins and their integration were closed, including updates for the Neynar SDK for Farcaster ([#5943](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5943)), providing webhook options for Farcaster ([#5944](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5944)), and issues concerning `plugin-quickswap` ([#5947](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5947)), `plugin-rofl` ([#5949](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5949)), and `plugin-polymarket` ([#5950](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5950)).\n\n**Update Notification Logic**\nAn issue regarding update notifications for alpha versions was closed ([#5971](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5971)). This issue aimed to prevent \"update available\" messages for alpha versions if the user is not on an alpha distribution.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n**Enhanced TEE Deployment Options**\nA new issue was created to extend Eliza's TEE deployment support by integrating Eigen TEE alongside the existing Phala TEE option ([#5986](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5986)). This will provide users with more choices for secure agent deployment.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n**Twitter Error with SQL Database**\nIssue [#39](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/39) continues to be active, with recent comments focusing on reproducing and resolving a Twitter error related to SQL database foreign key constraints. User `rogi-sh` confirmed the error with `plugin-twitter` version 1.2.21 and ElizaOS CLI version 1.5.10, specifically \"insert or update on table \"memories\" violates foreign key constraint \"memories_entityId_fkey\"\". User `0xbbjoker` requested version details to reproduce the issue.\n\n**ElizaOS Class and Core API Refinements**\nDiscussions on issues [#5907](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5907) (Defaults & Validation), [#5905](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5905) (ElizaOS Class & Core API), and [#5906](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5906) (ElizaOS Lifecycle & Bulk Ops) indicate ongoing work on the core architecture. User `standujar` linked these issues to pull request [#5864](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5864), suggesting that an implementation related to these topics is underway."

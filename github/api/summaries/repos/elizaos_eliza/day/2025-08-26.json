  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 26, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on a significant build system overhaul, transitioning to Bun, alongside critical bug fixes and enhancements to template management for character configurations.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Build System Modernization with Bun\nA major initiative was completed to standardize the build process across ElizaOS packages by migrating from `tsup` to a Bun-based build system. This introduces reusable build utilities and custom scripts, streamlining development and improving consistency. ([#5807](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5807))\n\n### Plugin Action Reliability Improvements\nThe `GENERATE_IMAGE` handler within the `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` was updated to correctly return an `ActionResult`, ensuring adherence to the core `Action` contract and improving the reliability of image generation actions. ([#5823](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5823))\n\n### Enhanced Template Management and Character Configuration\nCore multi-step templates (`multiStepDecisionTemplate` and `multiStepSummaryTemplate`) were moved to the core layer for better modularity. This change also enables character-level overrides for these templates and introduces an environment-based strategy toggle, offering greater flexibility in character behavior. ([#5822](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5822))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#5826](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5826) merge develop: A standard PR to merge the `develop` branch, likely for syncing recent changes.\n- [#5824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5824) feat: scenarios dynamic prompting + spec: Introduces dynamic prompting capabilities for scenarios, along with updated specifications.\n- [#5821](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5821) feat: create @elizaos/utils package for shared build utilities: Proposes a new `@elizaos/utils` package to centralize shared build utilities, further enhancing modularity.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Request for Native AI Provider Integration\nA new feature request has been opened for the integration of a native Venice AI Provider. This aims to address the current lack of support for privacy-focused, uncensored AI providers within ElizaOS, catering to users who prioritize data privacy and open models. ([#5820](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5820))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

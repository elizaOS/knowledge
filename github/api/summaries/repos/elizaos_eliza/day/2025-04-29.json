  "content": "# ElizaOS Daily Update (Apr 29, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development efforts focused on enhancing the logging capabilities, improving knowledge scoping, and refining the core build process within the ElizaOS framework. Significant bug fixes were also implemented, addressing agent deletion issues and local AI errors. Overall, the team made strides in modularity and usability, aligning with our core philosophy of adaptability and decentralization.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Feature Enhancements\n- Introduced model/plugin name logging to improve transparency during model usage ([#4394](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4394)).\n- Implemented searchable knowledge scoped by entityId, worldId, or roomId, enhancing data accessibility ([#4390](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4390)).\n- Added automatic detection and building of core monorepo packages during development ([#4388](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4388)).\n- Included a `.env.example` file in the project starter to assist users with setup ([#4387](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4387)).\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Resolved an import issue affecting the derive key provider, improving compatibility without user-facing changes ([#4385](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4385)).\n- Fixed an error preventing agent deletion when agents owned worlds, addressing foreign key constraint issues ([#4395](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4395)).\n- Addressed error handling for scenarios with insufficient disk space for users ([#4389](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4389)).\n- Corrected an undefined error thrown by the local AI ([#4396](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4396)).\n\n### Code Refactoring and Cleanup\n- Enhanced UI with cleaner design and minor improvements, including naming updates from `room` to `group` ([#4393](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4393)).\n- Removed the EVM plugin package and related configurations from the monorepo, streamlining the codebase ([#4386](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4386), [#4399](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4399)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n- No issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n- No new issues were reported today."

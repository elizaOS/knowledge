  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 20, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant performance enhancements and API improvements, including asynchronous embedding generation, enhanced session management with advanced timeout configurations, and a new service load promise interface.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Performance and Runtime Enhancements\nKey improvements were made to optimize performance, particularly in message processing. Asynchronous embedding generation was introduced to prevent runtime blocking, significantly reducing latency. A new `getServiceLoadPromise` interface was added to the runtime for better service management.\n- Asynchronous embedding generation via queue service to improve message processing latency ([#5793](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5793)).\n- Added `getServiceLoadPromise` interface to runtime and fixed component queries in `plugin-sql` ([#5801](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5801)).\n\n### Enhanced Session Management\nThe sessions API received a major upgrade, introducing comprehensive timeout management, auto-renewal capabilities, and robust error handling for improved session control.\n- Significant enhancements to the sessions API with advanced timeout configuration and lifecycle control ([#5799](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5799)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request, [#5800](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5800), was opened to add a bench plugin locally.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System\nThe epic for the Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System was closed, indicating completion of this significant development.\n- The \"Epic: Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System\" was closed ([#5781](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5781)).\n  - The issue was closed by monilpat, who noted that all child tickets had been closed.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

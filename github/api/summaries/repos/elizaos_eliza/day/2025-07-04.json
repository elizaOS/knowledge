  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 4, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused heavily on UI/UX enhancements, bug fixes across various components, and foundational improvements for testing and CLI consistency. Key achievements include significant client-side refinements and critical bug resolutions.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced User Interface and Experience\nMultiple features were added to improve the client-side user experience. This includes a new header dropdown for agent actions, improved cursor pointer interactions across interactive elements, and a redesigned DM chat header. Avatar handling and styling consistency were also refined, along with updating the 'Actions' tab to 'Model Calls' for clarity.\n([#5403](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5403), [#5397](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5397), [#5392](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5392), [#5391](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5391), [#5390](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5390))\n\n### Critical Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements\nSeveral significant bugs were addressed, including a group chat crash, issues with new chat creation, and avatar preservation during secret updates. Agent card behavior for new chat initiation was refactored, and backward compatibility for agent bios was ensured. CI stability was also improved by standardizing memory allocation and test execution across platforms.\n([#5406](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5406), [#5405](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5405), [#5402](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5402), [#5400](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5400), [#5399](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5399), [#5398](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5398), [#5387](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5387))\n\n### Foundational Development and CLI Consistency\nA base setup for Bun tests was introduced for the `app` package, laying groundwork for future testing. The CLI was migrated to `@clack/prompts` for all input methods, ensuring consistency and a better user experience.\n([#5368](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5368), [#5359](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5359))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- **CLI Command Refinements**: A new pull request, [#5409](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5409), was opened to address nitpicks in the CLI `create` command.\n- **CI Workflow for Claude Code**: A new GitHub Workflow, [#5394](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5394), was proposed to add Claude Code integration.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### CLI Input Method Standardization\nThe issue [#5295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5295), which aimed to migrate remaining CLI input methods to `@clack/prompts` for consistency, was closed today. This standardization effort was successfully completed.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Loading Failures on Windows\nA new issue, [#5407](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5407), was reported concerning the failure to load `@elizaos/plugin-openai` and `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` on Windows. The user experienced failures even after successful plugin installation attempts.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Review of Actions Tab in GUI\nIssue [#5377](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5377) is active, discussing the review of the actions tab in the GUI. The latest comments indicate a decision to rename the tab to `Model Calls` for better clarity."

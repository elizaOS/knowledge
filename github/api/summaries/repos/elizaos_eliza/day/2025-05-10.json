Key features were added to optimize performance and maintainability, while several plugins were removed to streamline the codebase. The team also updated the Bun runtime to ensure compatibility with the latest versions.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Performance Enhancements\n- Improved agent loading speed when multiple agents are present, addressing performance issues in the agents API. See [#4519](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/4519).\n- Enhanced documentation with the addition of docstrings to the `api-cleanup` module, requested by @wtfsayo. Refer to [#4521](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/4521).\n\n### Codebase Maintenance\n- Removed the `plugin-local-ai` and `plugin-openai` from the monorepo to streamline the project. Details can be found in [#4439](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/4439) and [#4511](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/4511).\n- Updated the Bun runtime version to ^1.2.13 across relevant configuration files to facilitate minor and patch updates. See [#4522](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/4522).\n\n### TypeScript Improvements\n- Implemented strict typing and generated TypeScript definitions for the `plugin-bootstrap`, addressing stability issues in the codebase. More information is available in [#4504](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/4504).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n- No issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n- No new issues were reported today."

  "content": "# ElizaOS Daily Update (Apr 14, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, ElizaOS made significant strides in enhancing user experience and addressing bugs. A new typing indicator was added to Telegram bots, improving interaction quality. Additionally, a critical bug fix was implemented to ensure plugin initialization checks, and deprecated types were removed to streamline the codebase.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Feature Enhancements\n- Added a typing indicator to Telegram bots to simulate human-like interactions, enhancing user experience ([#4280](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4280)).\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Implemented a check to ensure the `init` function exists before calling it, preventing errors related to plugin loading ([#4278](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4278)).\n\n### Code Maintenance\n- Removed deprecated `hapi__shot` types to clean up the codebase and improve maintainability ([#4275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4275)).\n- Improved logging for transcription models to enhance debugging and monitoring capabilities ([#4283](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4283)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n- No issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Documentation Clarification\n- A need for clearer documentation regarding the contributing guide was identified. It should specify the installation process for contributors versus users who want to work on their agents ([#4285](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4285)).\n\n### Logging Configuration Bug\n- A bug was reported where changes to the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable do not reflect in the program's logging behavior, affecting user experience and debugging ([#4282](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4282))."

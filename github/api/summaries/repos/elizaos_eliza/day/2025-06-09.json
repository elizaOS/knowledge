Significant improvements were made in the CLI and CI workflows, alongside the introduction of a new submodule for cursor rules. The team also addressed several logging and database issues, contributing to a more robust development environment.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Feature Enhancements\n- Added automatic lockfile cleanup for GitHub fallback installations to prevent circular dependency issues ([#5009](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5009)).\n- Introduced a new `buildGitHubSpecifier` function to streamline GitHub specifications ([#5024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5024)).\n- Replaced the `.cursor` folder with a submodule for better sharing and updates across the team ([#5021](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5021)).\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Resolved logging issues and conditional GitHub authentication for the `publish` command ([#4986](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4986)).\n- Fixed duplicate CI runs and ensured workflows are canceled on push events ([#5022](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5022)).\n- Improved database handling in end-to-end tests to ensure unique and clean directories ([#5013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5013)).\n\n### Code Refactoring and CI Improvements\n- Centralized directory detection logic to support monorepo structures ([#5011](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5011)).\n- Refactored CI workflows to optimize job execution and introduced caching mechanisms to reduce build times ([#5015](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5015), [#5014](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5014)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Resolved Bugs\n- Fixed the issue where the Twitter Client failed to start with the new release 1.0.2 ([#4894](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4894)).\n- Addressed the problem of refreshing an agent chat causing errors ([#4927](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4927)).\n- Resolved the issue with the MessageBusService where agents were not recognized as participants in channels ([#4972](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4972)).\n- Corrected the problem with the `LOG_LEVEL` from `.env` not working in version 1.0.6 ([#5005](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5005)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Access and Callback Challenges\n- Encountered an access error with the OpenAI API key for GPT-4o, questioning the availability of a mini version ([#5023](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5023)).\n- Identified a bug where callbacks from plugin actions are not reaching the end user response in chat, particularly with the `plugin-evm` transfer function ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5017))."

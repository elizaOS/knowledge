  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 22, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day focused on critical bug fixes, particularly enhancing Python example testing and addressing compatibility issues. Significant progress was made in resolving API index and overall summary generation problems, ensuring more robust and consistent data access.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **Python Example and Plugin Enhancements:**\n    *   Added Python quickstart documentation.\n    *   Fixed the chat example to include `inmemorydb` plugin for database support and added `dotenv` loading.\n    *   Corrected the `inmemorydb` plugin to use proper Plugin. ([#6358](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358))\n*   **V2.0.0 Compatibility and Runtime Fixes:**\n    *   Opened pull requests to fix the avatar example and ElevenLabs plugin for V2.0.0. ([#6387](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6387))\n    *   Opened pull requests to address A2A example, protobuf compatibility, and runtime errors for V2.0.0. ([#6386](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6386))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n*   [#6387](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6387) V2.0.0: fixed avatar example and elevenlabs plugin - This PR aims to resolve issues with the avatar example and the ElevenLabs plugin in the V2.0.0 release.\n*   [#6386](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6386) V2.0.0: fixed a2a example and related protobuf compatibility and runtime errors - This PR addresses compatibility and runtime errors in the A2A example, specifically related to protobuf, for the V2.0.0 release.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n*   **Agent Message Processing and State Management:**\n    *   Closed issues related to provider batching for `composeState` and message processing parallelization, including suggestions for fire-and-forget embedding queues. ([#6336](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6336), [#6337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6337))\n*   **Migration Eligibility Discrepancy:**\n    *   Closed an issue concerning a migration eligibility mismatch and snapshot bug reported by a user with a Tangem hardware wallet. ([#6369](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6369))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n*   **API Index and Contributor Profiles Export:**\n    *   Issue [#225](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/225) reported that API index and contributor profiles were not being exported due to a missing `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines` workflow, resulting in 404 errors on production.\n    *   **Latest Comment (madjin):** The issue has been fixed by adding dynamic `SITE_URL` detection to `run-pipelines.yml`, using the same pattern as `deploy.yml`. This ensures that the correct site URL is determined based on the repository type (org sites or project sites), allowing `/api/index.json` and all contributor profiles to be generated correctly on the next pipeline run.\n*   **Overall Summaries Generation for Inactive Days:**\n    *   Issue [#226](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/226) highlighted that overall summary API endpoints returned 404 for dates with no repository activity.\n    *   **Latest Comment (madjin):** The issue has been fixed by modifying `generateOverallSummaryForInterval()` to always generate summaries, even when no repository activity exists. Instead of returning `null`, a simple fallback message \"No activity recorded for [date].\" is now generated. This ensures consistent API behavior, clear distinction between \"pipeline hasn't run\" vs \"no activity\", and honors the API contract for daily summaries."

  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 22, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day focused on critical bug fixes, particularly enhancing Python example testing and addressing compatibility issues. Significant progress was made in resolving API index and overall summary generation problems, ensuring more robust and consistent data access.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **Python Example and Plugin Enhancements:**\n    *   Added Python quickstart documentation.\n    *   Fixed the chat example to include `inmemorydb` plugin for database support and added `dotenv` loading.\n    *   Corrected the `inmemorydb` plugin to use proper `Plugin` functionality. ([#6358](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358))\n\n*   **Addressing API Index and Summary Generation Issues:**\n    *   Resolved an issue where API index and contributor profiles were not exported due to missing `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines` workflow. ([#225](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/225))\n    *   Fixed the problem of overall summaries not being generated for days with no repository activity, ensuring consistent API responses. ([#226](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/226))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n*   [#6387](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6387): This pull request aims to fix the avatar example and the ElevenLabs plugin for the v2.0.0 release.\n*   [#6386](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6386): This pull request addresses fixes for the a2a example, including protobuf compatibility and runtime errors, also for the v2.0.0 release.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n*   **Agent Message Processing Optimization:**\n    *   Closed issues related to provider batching for `composeState` and the parallelization of message processing, including `saveMessage`, `getUserState`, and `processAttachments`. ([#6336](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6336), [#6337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6337))\n\n*   **Migration Eligibility Discrepancy:**\n    *   Closed an issue concerning a migration eligibility mismatch and snapshot bug reported by a user with a Tangem hardware wallet. ([#6369](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6369))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n*   **fix: API index and contributor profiles not exported due to missing SITE_URL in run-pipelines workflow** ([#225](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/225))\n    *   **Problem:** API endpoints for `/api/index.json` and `/api/contributors/{username}/profile.json` were returning 404 on production.\n    *   **Resolution:** The issue was fixed by dynamically detecting `SITE_URL` in `run-pipelines.yml` using the same pattern as `deploy.yml`. This ensures that the correct site URL is used for generating API index and contributor profiles, which will be generated on the next pipeline run.\n\n*   **fix: Overall summaries not generated for days with no repository activity** ([#226](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/226))\n    *   **Problem:** Overall summary API endpoints were returning 404 for dates with no repository activity.\n    *   **Resolution:** The `generateOverallSummaryForInterval()` function was modified to always generate summaries, even when no repository activity exists. Instead of returning `null`, a simple \"No activity recorded\" message is now generated, ensuring consistent API behavior and a clear distinction between \"pipeline hasn't run\" and \"no activity.\" This change will take effect on the next pipeline run."

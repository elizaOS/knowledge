  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 22, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day's development focused on critical bug fixes, primarily addressing Python example testing and documentation, alongside resolving API endpoint issues for index, contributor profiles, and overall summaries.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Python Example and Plugin Enhancements\nSignificant work was done to improve the Python examples and plugins. This included adding quickstart documentation, fixing the chat example to properly use the inmemorydb plugin, and enabling `.env` file support via dotenv loading. The inmemorydb plugin was also updated to use the correct `Plugin` interface. ([#6358](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### API Endpoint Availability Fixes\nTwo critical issues related to API endpoint availability were resolved. The first addressed 404 errors for the `/api/index.json` and `/api/contributors/{username}/profile.json` endpoints by dynamically detecting the `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines.yml` workflow. ([#225](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/225)) The second fix ensured that overall summary API endpoints no longer return 404 for days with no repository activity, instead providing a \"No activity recorded\" message. ([#226](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/226))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

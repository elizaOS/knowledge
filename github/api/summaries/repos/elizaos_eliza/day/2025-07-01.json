  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 1, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, ElizaOS significantly enhanced its CLI with improved environment variable management and a new AI-powered plugin upgrade tool. Key UI improvements were also made, alongside critical bug fixes for project creation and version display.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced CLI Functionality and User Experience\nThe CLI received major improvements, including a refactored environment variable system for better maintainability and user-friendliness, now utilizing `clack` for prompts ([#5326](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5326)). The `create` command was fixed to correctly display project types and clean up on interruption ([#5321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5321), [#5337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5337)). Additionally, automatic installation of AI model plugins during project creation was implemented ([#5335](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5335)).\n\n### AI-Powered Plugin Migration Tool\nA new AI-powered migration tool was introduced to streamline the upgrade process for ElizaOS plugins from version 0.x to 1.x, featuring a stepwise migration guide ([#5311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5311)).\n\n### UI/UX Improvements and Server Control\nThe Web UI now includes an environment variable to toggle its availability, enhancing control in production environments ([#5304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5304)). The character form action buttons were restructured for improved layout and user experience ([#5342](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5342)). Furthermore, the GUI now dynamically displays the server version, fetched from a new server endpoint ([#5339](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5339)).\n\n### Environment Variable Management Refinements\nThe process for `.env` file creation was simplified to use templates only, preventing clutter from runtime environment pollution ([#5340](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5340)). Agent secrets are now automatically updated with local variables if they are empty ([#5329](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5329)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#5338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5338): This pull request introduces `@elizaos/plugin-grok` to support xAI Grok models, expanding ElizaOS's AI model compatibility.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n### CLI Create Command Text Fix\nIssue [#5336](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5336) was closed, addressing the problem where the CLI create command displayed incorrect project types in prompts. The fix ensures dynamic text based on the `--type` flag and accurate confirmation messages.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### Plugin Upgrade and CLI Text Display\n- [#5341](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5341): This issue tracks the upgrade of BD tier 1-4 plugins, indicating ongoing work to update core plugins.\n- [#5336](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5336): This issue, now closed, highlighted the need to fix the CLI create command to display the correct type (Plugin/Agent/TEE Project) in prompts instead of always showing \"Project\".\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Consistent Bun Test Execution\nIssue [#5218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5218) focuses on ensuring `bun run test` works consistently across all packages. The latest comment from `wtfsayo` at 2025-07-02T11:54:24Z indicates that this task has been completed. Previously, `ai16z-demirix` confirmed working on it with progress on phase 1.\n\n### Documentation Overhaul\nIssue [#5234](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5234) proposes a documentation overhaul to create separate tracks for simple users and developers. `SYMBaiEX` at 2025-07-06T08:23:00Z suggested closing or updating the issue. `Ifechukwudaniel` at 2025-07-01T21:57:36Z requested assignment. Earlier, `Megamindmaster` at 2025-06-24T19:32:33Z provided detailed feedback on the current documentation's shortcomings for beginners, citing issues with environment variables and example JSON files.\n\n### Deploying Eliza Agents\nIssue [#5244](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5244) discusses the best ways to deploy custom Eliza agents. The most recent activity shows `claude` at 2025-07-13T17:47:00Z successfully creating Railway and Render deployment configuration files, including `railway.json`, `render.yaml`, and a `DEPLOYMENT.md` guide. `wtfsayo` at 2025-07-13T17:46:44Z prompted `claude` to create these files. Earlier, `bealers` at 2025-07-01T19:46:03Z and 2025-07-01T19:36:18Z shared their work on making Eliza easier to install in production environments, including a `docker compose up` solution and a project called `elizify`. `wtfsayo` at 2025-06-23T07:35:50Z suggested Railway and Render, while `kamalbuilds` at 2025-06-23T03:40:52Z initiated the discussion, noting difficulties with existing options like Fleek and Relay.\n\n### CLI Input Method Migration\nIssue [#5295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5295) aims to migrate remaining CLI input methods to use `@clack/prompts` for consistency. `SYMBaiEX` at 2025-07-03T06:22:57Z requested a review for PR #5359, indicating progress. `wtfsayo` at 2025-07-02T06:22:23Z encouraged `Ifechukwudaniel` to work on it and submit a PR. `Ifechukwudaniel` at 2025-07-01T21:55:48Z had requested assignment."

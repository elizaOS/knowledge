  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jan 16, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, the `elizaos/eliza` repository saw significant code refactoring in the `plugin-sql` package, enhancing maintainability and testability. Additionally, two user experience issues were closed, while new issues emerged concerning smart contract deployment, AI model integration, and a migration eligibility bug.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### SQL Plugin Refactoring for Modularity\nThe `BaseDrizzleAdapter` in the `plugin-sql` package underwent a major refactor, extracting domain stores to improve maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns without altering the public API. This involved creating new domain store files for agents, cache, components, entities, logs, memory, messaging, participants, relationships, rooms, tasks, and worlds. ([#6366](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6366))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### User Experience Improvements\nTwo issues related to user experience were closed today. One addressed the removal of the '+' symbol from personality traits and topics of interest fields, aiming for a cleaner user interface. ([#6350](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6350)) The other resolved the issue of users being redirected to the dashboard after logging in or signing up, instead of returning to their previous agent chat session. ([#6354](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6354))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Future Feature Requests\nNew issues were opened to propose future capabilities for the ElizaOS platform. These include the ability to deploy smart contracts on-chain ([#6367](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6367)) and the integration of Opus 4.5 into the applications ([#6368](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6368)).\n\n### Migration and Wallet Discrepancy\nA new issue was reported concerning a migration eligibility mismatch and a snapshot bug related to a Tangem hardware wallet, specifically regarding $ai16z holdings. ([#6369](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6369))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments were identified today."

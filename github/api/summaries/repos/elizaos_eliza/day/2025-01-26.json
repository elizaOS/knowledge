  "content": "# ElizaOS Daily Update (Jan 26, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, significant progress was made in enhancing the ElizaOS framework, particularly with the introduction of a new news plugin and a critical bug fix in the goal objectives update logic. The development team focused on improving plugin functionality and addressing various issues reported by users, contributing to a more robust and user-friendly experience.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### New Features\n- Introduced a new **news-plugin** to enhance the capabilities of the ElizaOS framework. This feature is linked to the AI Agent Dev School Video #2. See [PR #1248](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/1248).\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Resolved a bug in the goal objectives update lookup logic, which was affecting the bootstrap plugin's evaluator. This fix is documented in [PR #2791](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/2791).\n\n### Active Development Areas\n- The **plugin-news** area saw 6 changes, while **plugin-bootstrap** and **agent/src** had 1 change each, indicating focused development efforts in these modules.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Enhancements\n- Closed the issue regarding the addition of support for the DeepSeek API, which will allow more developers to explore the framework. See [#2658](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/2658).\n- Resolved the request for supporting default grok in the generate object for the Twitter plugin, enhancing its functionality. See [#1983](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/1983).\n\n### Action and Integration Improvements\n- Addressed the issue related to deciding which actions to use from a plugin, streamlining the selection process. See [#1266](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/1266).\n- Closed the request for native integration support for FullsendFI, which would facilitate SOL transfers using Twitter UIDs. See [#1072](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/1072).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Testing and Coverage\n- Identified the need for improved test configuration and coverage for the **plugin-0x** package, highlighting gaps in current testing practices. See [#2806](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/2806).\n- Noted similar requirements for the **plugin-0g**, indicating a broader need for enhanced testing structures. See [#2804](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/2804).\n\n### User Experience Challenges\n- Reported issues regarding multiple agents working together, indicating a need for clearer guidance on functionality. See [#2801](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/2801).\n- Addressed a bug related to message ID collisions in the Telegram client, which could lead to message delivery issues. See [#2796](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/2796).\n- Highlighted connectivity issues with the headless web interface and Discord integration, which are impacting user experience. See [#2795](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/2795) and [#2792](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/2792)."

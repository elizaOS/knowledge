  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Dec 30, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on critical bug fixes, specifically addressing an issue where streaming LLM calls were not being logged to the database. Several new pull requests were opened, including a significant feature for unified hooks with multi-transport support, alongside new issues concerning the messaging API and application organization.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **Core Logging Fixes**\n    *   Resolved a bug where streaming model calls (TEXT_SMALL, TEXT_LARGE) were not being logged to the database due to incorrect placement of logging code after a `return` statement in the streaming path, ensuring all LLM calls are now properly recorded. ([#6296](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6296))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n*   A new feature for unified hooks with multi-transport support (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket) has been proposed. ([#6300](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300))\n*   A pull request to correct a typo from \"saftey\" to \"safety\" has been opened. ([#6297](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6297))\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n*   **Agent Card and Conversation Display Improvements**\n    *   Resolved an issue where agent cards were not resizing to match dashboard agent cards. ([#6291](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6291))\n    *   Fixed the behavior where clicking on an agent with existing conversations would lead to a brand new chat instead of opening the existing conversation. ([#6295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6295))\n\n*   **Documentation and Formatting Corrections**\n    *   Addressed issues with spacing in numbered items. ([#6283](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6283))\n    *   Completed fixes for monorepo documentation. ([#6284](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6284))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n*   **Messaging API Architectural Concerns**\n    *   Identified architectural issues within the messaging API, including double/triple processing of messages and the presence of dead code related to `handleWebS`. ([#6298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6298))\n\n*   **Application Organization**\n    *   A new issue has been opened to address the need for \"Unslop Apps,\" suggesting a focus on improving application structure and cleanliness. ([#6299](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6299))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

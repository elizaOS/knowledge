  "content": "# ElizaOS Daily Update (Feb 9, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused primarily on bug fixes related to the build process. Two significant pull requests were merged to enhance the build functionality, ensuring smoother operations for future development. Additionally, one issue was closed, addressing a security concern regarding public key verification.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Build Process Improvements\n- Fixed the core build process with the addition of `build:core` in [PR #3398](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3398).\n- Resolved issues with the root build command `bun run build` in [PR #3396](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3396).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Security Enhancements\n- Closed issue [#2050](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/2050), which addressed the prevention of forged public keys from using valid attestations to deceive users. This fix ensures that users can verify the authenticity of public keys generated within the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Bot Reply Behavior\n- A new issue was reported in [#3394](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3394) regarding the bot generating multiple replies due to the `DEFAULT_MAX_TWEET_LENGTH`. This issue highlights a potential flaw in the bot's response mechanism when interacting with followers."

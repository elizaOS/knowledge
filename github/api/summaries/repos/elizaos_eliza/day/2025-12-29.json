  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Dec 29, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on critical bug fixes, including standardizing server route naming and replacing deprecated process execution libraries. Documentation received significant updates, with a comprehensive README added for dummy services and various inconsistencies resolved across the project.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Server Route Standardization and API Client Alignment\nThe server's message-server routes were standardized to resolve inconsistencies with the `api-client` package, ensuring proper communication and preventing non-existent route calls. This fix improves the reliability of server-client interactions. [#6285](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6285)\n\n### CLI Toolchain Modernization\nOutdated process execution libraries like `execa` and `child_process` were replaced with Bun-native alternatives (`Bun.spawn` and `bun-exec`) across the CLI, aligning with project guidelines and improving performance and compatibility. [#6289](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6289)\n\n### Documentation Refinements and Additions\nDocumentation was enhanced by updating installation instructions to use `bun add`, fixing broken links, and adding crucial flags (`--port`, `--skip-type-check`) to the `BUILD_SYSTEM.md`. A comprehensive README was also added for the `@elizaos/plugin-dummy-services` package, detailing its purpose, installation, and available services. [#6288](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6288), [#6290](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6290)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- **Backend Hot Reloading**: A new pull request, [#6293](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6293), was opened to enable hot reloading for backend development, aiming to streamline the development workflow.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Dashboard and Chat Experience Improvements\nSeveral issues related to the user interface and chat experience were closed, including the removal of an unnecessary token button from the dashboard [#6287](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6287), and the implementation of chat renaming functionality [#6278](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6278).\n\n### User Feedback Mechanism\nA dedicated feedback button was added to allow users to submit feedback, enhancing user engagement and product improvement cycles. [#6280](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6280)\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### UI/UX Enhancements for Agent Management\nNew issues were opened to address user interface inconsistencies, specifically regarding agent card resizing to match dashboard cards [#6291](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6291), and ensuring that clicking an agent with existing conversations opens the last active chat instead of a new one [#6295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6295).\n\n### Advanced TypeScript Patterns and AI Reasoning\nDiscussions have begun on implementing advanced TypeScript patterns, including decorators, dependency injection, and type system enhancements, to elevate the codebase quality [#6292](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6292). Additionally, a new issue proposes adding Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning streaming support at the core level, enabling real-time reasoning feedback for both server and cloud environments [#6294](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6294).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Snapshot Eligibility and Wallet Connection Challenges\nIssue [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211) continues to be active, focusing on a user's difficulties with AI16Z to ElizaOS migration due to snapshot eligibility and Tangem wallet connection issues. The latest comment from `om1d-sa` suggests two potential solutions: importing the cold wallet seed phrase into a hot wallet like Phantom for self-migration, or utilizing the official Discord server's ticket system for manual migration, emphasizing verification of official support staff. The user `jessica991190-dot` also inquired if the issue has been resolved."

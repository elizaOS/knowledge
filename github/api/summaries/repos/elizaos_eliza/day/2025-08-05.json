  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 5, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day focused on diagnosing and addressing a critical agent startup issue related to plugin loading, particularly the `bootstrap` plugin. Two new issues were opened, and two older agent-related issues were closed.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\nNo new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n### Agent Development Cleanup\nTwo issues related to specific agent development, [#5494](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5494) \"Jimmy Agent\" and [#5643](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5643) \"base agent -- clank tank\", were closed.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### Agent Startup and Plugin Loading Issues\nA critical issue, [#5719](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5719), was opened regarding `startAgent` hanging when the `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` is omitted or included. An investigation by Claude identified the `bootstrap` plugin as critical infrastructure and proposed immediate fixes and medium-term improvements, including automatic inclusion or clear error messages for the missing plugin, and timeouts for plugin loading.\n\n### API Client Enhancements\nIssue [#5721](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5721) was opened to make the sessions API available to the `api-client` package, referencing a related pull request.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Agent Startup Hanging Issue\nIssue [#5719](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5719) is actively being investigated. The core problem is that `startAgent` hangs, either early without the `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` or later with it. Claude's detailed analysis points to the `bootstrap` plugin's critical role in message handling and runtime initialization. Proposed solutions include automatically adding the `bootstrap` plugin, implementing timeouts for plugin loading, and improving debug logging. The discussion highlights the complexity of workspace dependency resolution and local development detection in the plugin loading process. Odilitime noted that nothing in bootstrap should inherently prevent other plugins from starting up."

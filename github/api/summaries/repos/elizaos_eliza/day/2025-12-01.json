  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Dec 1, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant code refactoring in the server for optimization and reorganization, alongside crucial bug fixes to improve markdown rendering in the client UI.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Server Optimization and Reorganization\nA major refactoring effort was completed in the server, focusing on optimization and reorganization of the codebase. This involved changes across numerous files, including API endpoints, services, and utilities, with a low to medium risk due to potential Socket.IO configuration impacts and import path changes, all of which were tested and verified. ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199))\n\n### Client Markdown Spacing Improvements\nTwo bug fixes were implemented to address markdown content spacing issues in the client. These changes aim to improve the visual consistency of AI-generated responses by fixing excessive vertical spacing and refining heading, separator, and blockquote spacing. ([#6159](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6159), [#6197](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6197))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Documentation Location Clarification\nThe issue regarding the location of the `packages/docs/` directory was closed after clarification that the documentation has been moved to a separate repository. ([#6122](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6122))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Server Connection Reliability and Timeouts\nA new issue was opened to address concurrent connection timeouts and implement reliability patterns for the server. This includes configuring Socket.IO properly with ping/pong intervals and timeouts, adding explicit HTTP server timeouts, and implementing socket disconnection handling. ([#6198](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6198))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

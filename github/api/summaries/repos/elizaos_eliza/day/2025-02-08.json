  "content": "# ElizaOS Daily Update (Feb 8, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, the ElizaOS development team focused on addressing several bugs and refining the codebase. Key improvements were made to the CLI commands and character loading functionality, enhancing user experience. Additionally, a significant refactor was implemented to adopt a handler pattern, promoting better modularity in the code.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Fixed CLI build and initialization command to improve usability ([#3378](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3378)).\n- Resolved issues with `yargs` slicing in character loading, allowing for correct argument parsing when running agents with custom characters ([#3374](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3374)).\n\n### Code Refactoring\n- Refactored generation to implement a handler pattern, enabling better service integration and modularity in the codebase ([#3376](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3376)).\n\n### Character Path Loading\n- Enhanced character path loading functionality to allow users to specify paths relative to the repository root, improving flexibility in character management ([#3375](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3375)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Dependency Issues\n- Resolved missing dependencies for the `@elizaos/agent` package, ensuring proper builds and functionality ([#3365](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3365)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Plugin and Character Issues\n- Users reported being unable to use the `plugin-evm` after installation, indicating potential configuration issues ([#3380](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3380)).\n- Confusion regarding the quick start instructions due to the eliza-starter being a separate repository, necessitating clearer documentation ([#3387](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3387)).\n- Issues with agents getting stuck on startup in Docker environments, highlighting a critical bug in version v0.25.6-alpha.1 ([#3385](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3385)).\n- Problems with Twitter actions not processing correctly, affecting user engagement capabilities ([#3384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3384)).\n- A request to enhance the Twitter AI agent's behavior to improve human-like engagement and reduce predictability ([#3383](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3383)).\n- An error related to missing modules in the Discord.js integration, indicating potential installation or configuration issues ([#3373](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3373))."

Key developments include the implementation of a world selection feature in the message API and the integration of a gas oracle. Additionally, documentation updates and workflow fixes were addressed, contributing to overall project stability and usability.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Feature Enhancements\n- Added a missing plugin failure test to ensure robustness in plugin installation ([#4643](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4643)).\n- Introduced an optional `worldId` query parameter for the message API, allowing for better memory tracking ([#4637](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4637)).\n- Enhanced the API to return the ID of newly created agents, streamlining subsequent API calls ([#4634](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4634)).\n\n### Plugin Development\n- Implemented the Polygon Gas Oracle Integration, which is crucial for gas estimation in transactions ([#4574](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4574)).\n- Added the Polygon Plugin, which includes core EVM RPC wrappers and basic read operations ([#4635](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4635)).\n- Merged the addpolygon resolution to finalize plugin integration ([#4636](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4636)).\n\n### Documentation and Workflow Improvements\n- Updated project documentation comprehensively, including blog posts and partner documentation ([#4586](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4586)).\n- Fixed the documentation deployment workflow to ensure proper npm caching and streamline deployment processes ([#4640](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4640)).\n- Enhanced the ElizaOS CLI command for better character file handling and consistent behavior ([#4618](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4618)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Documentation Updates\n- Closed the issue regarding the community section of the documentation, which involved gathering ideas for improvements ([#4260](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4260)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Dependency Management\n- A new issue was raised concerning the need to publish to npm due to peer dependency conflicts with the zod library, which is affecting builds in other repositories ([#4562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4562))."

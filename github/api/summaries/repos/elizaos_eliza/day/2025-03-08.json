Notable achievements include the addition of core types for TypeScript support, optional removal of the Venice system prompt, and extensive updates to documentation across multiple languages. The team also addressed several dependency updates and resolved critical issues related to Docker and PostgreSQL migrations.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Feature Enhancements\n- Added core types to enable building `index.d.ts` in `/dist`, resolving type availability errors on imports ([#3875](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3875)).\n- Introduced optional removal of the Venice model provider's default system prompt, allowing for greater customization ([#3583](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3583)).\n- Added documentation for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), enhancing security understanding ([#2876](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/2876)).\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Updated multiple dependencies including `pnpm`, `zod`, and `langchain` to their latest versions, improving overall stability ([#3848](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3848), [#3847](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3847), [#3844](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3844)).\n- Resolved issues with PostgreSQL migrations and Docker errors, ensuring smoother deployment processes ([#3803](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3803), [#3790](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3790)).\n\n### Documentation Improvements\n- Revamped README files in multiple languages, including Romanian and Turkish, to enhance clarity and accessibility ([#2151](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/2151), [#3422](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3422)).\n- Conducted extensive JSDoc updates across 417 files, improving code documentation and developer guidance ([#3806](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3806)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n- Resolved the issue of missing module `@anush008/tokenizers-linux-arm64-gnu` on ARM64 architecture, allowing successful project startup on Ubuntu ([#2242](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/2242)).\n- Closed the issue regarding the `text_generation` service not being found, improving the reliability of character interactions ([#3802](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3802)).\n- Addressed the problem with Twitter agent posting and responding, enhancing functionality for user interactions ([#3693](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3693)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### Dependency and Compatibility Challenges\n- Users reported issues with the `@elizaos/agent` package not being installable, indicating potential problems with package management ([#2624](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/2624)).\n- Ongoing difficulties with Docker builds on M-based Macs, highlighting compatibility issues that need addressing ([#2432](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/2432)).\n\n### Functionality and Performance Concerns\n- Multiple reports of agents not responding correctly to tweets, suggesting a need for improved handling of Twitter interactions ([#2424](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/2424)).\n- Users experiencing performance issues under parallel requests, indicating potential bottlenecks in the DirectClient implementation ([#2311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/2311))."

A critical bug regarding import errors in the CLI was also resolved, improving developer experience.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core Framework Enhancement: Plugin and Configuration Modules\nThe core framework received a major upgrade with the introduction of new plugin and configuration modules. This includes automatic plugin installation, loading, validation, and dependency resolution, alongside new configuration options for character, environment, and secrets. These changes are crucial for building more autonomous and adaptable AI agents.\n- Added plugin management with auto-install, loading, validation, and dependency resolution.\n- Introduced configuration modules for character, environment, and secrets.\n- Refactored ElizaOS/Server to integrate these new core functionalities.\n- Most active development areas: `core` (25 changes), `server` (8 changes).\n([#6037](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6037))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request, [#6052](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6052), was opened to introduce a `feat: elizaos deploy` feature.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Resolution of CLI Import Errors\nA critical issue where imports were not found in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61 has been closed. The problem was identified as specific to version 1.6.1 of `@elizaos/core`, likely due to missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files during its publication. Users are advised to upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later.\n- The issue was specific to `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1, caused by incomplete build artifacts or failed TypeScript declaration generation.\n- Users reported that a clean reinstall or upgrading to newer versions resolved the problem.\n- Recommendations include upgrading to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later and adding publish-time validation to prevent similar issues.\n([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

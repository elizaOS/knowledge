  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 19, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing core services with a new MessageService interface and optional embedding service, alongside critical bug fixes for session API responses and significant code formatting improvements.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core Service Enhancements\nThe core framework saw significant updates with the addition of a `MessageService` interface and its default implementation, improving message handling capabilities. Support for the `PATCH` method was also added to the `Route` type, expanding API flexibility. Furthermore, the embedding service was made optional, functioning as a no-op when no `TEXT_EMBEDDING` model is registered, optimizing resource usage.\n- [#6048](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6048)\n- [#6076](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6076)\n- [#6075](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6075)\n\n### API Response and Code Quality Improvements\nA crucial bug fix was implemented to include the `channelId` in session API responses, ensuring more complete data for WebSocket connections. Additionally, a comprehensive code formatting pass was conducted across the codebase to enforce consistent style using Prettier/ESLint, improving readability and maintainability without altering logic.\n- [#6079](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6079)\n- [#6077](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6077)\n\n### Development Branch Merged\nThe `develop` branch was merged into `main`, integrating the latest changes including a pluggable message service, `generateText` API, unified server startup/config, and a new Docker/ECS deploy command for the CLI.\n- [#6078](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6078)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

  "content": "# ElizaOS Daily Update (May 23, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, significant advancements were made in the ElizaOS project, particularly in enhancing the database API and introducing new features for document handling. The team focused on improving plugin functionality and addressing various bugs, resulting in a more robust and user-friendly framework.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Database API Enhancements\n- Improved database API with new methods: `getEntitiesByIds` and `getRoomsByIds`, while maintaining backward compatibility with existing helpers ([#4556](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4556)).\n\n### Document Handling Features\n- Added support for extracting and uploading text from PDF files, enhancing knowledge management capabilities ([#4611](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4611)).\n- Introduced a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plugin for advanced document ingestion and retrieval ([#4614](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4614)).\n- Moved knowledge processing functionality into a dedicated knowledge plugin, streamlining the runtime ([#4701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4701)).\n\n### Plugin and CI Improvements\n- Enhanced plugin publishing with NPM authentication and validation ([#4731](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4731)).\n- Fixed integration CI issues by adding necessary dependencies ([#4723](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4723)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Bug Fixes and Improvements\n- Resolved issues related to the RAG process that caused errors with large documents ([#3745](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3745)).\n- Addressed problems with group chat functionality and ensured local AI settings are respected ([#4303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4303), [#4315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4315)).\n- Fixed various build errors and runtime issues, including those related to environment file handling and unused imports ([#4408](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4408), [#4728](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4728)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Installation Challenges\n- Encountered an error related to missing exports in plugin installations, affecting some plugins while others function correctly ([#4744](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4744)).\n\n### Future Development Goals\n- Discussion initiated on V3 goals, focusing on transitioning to a fully streaming paradigm for AI models and enhancing multi-modality capabilities ([#4720](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4720))."

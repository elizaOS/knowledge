This includes designing and implementing the configuration schema ([#5778](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5778)), developing the `elizaos scenario matrix` CLI command ([#5779](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5779)), creating a parameter override system ([#5780](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5780)), and implementing run orchestration and isolation ([#5782](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5782)). An epic was also created to encompass the entire \"Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System\" ([#5781](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5781)).\n\n### Advanced Evaluation & Data Collection\nSeveral issues were created to enhance evaluation and data collection. These include implementing structured JSON output from evaluators ([#5783](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5783)), defining scenario capabilities ([#5784](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5784)), logging agent trajectories ([#5785](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5785)), and centralizing and serializing run data ([#5786](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5786)).\n\n### Performance Reporting Dashboard\nNew issues were opened to establish a performance reporting dashboard. This involves implementing the `elizaos report generate` command ([#5787](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5787)), designing and building an HTML report template ([#5788](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5788)), and implementing dynamic report rendering ([#5789](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5789)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

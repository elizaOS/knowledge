  "content": "# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 24, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's focus was on bug fixes, addressing issues with plugin creation and CLI publishing. A significant new issue was opened regarding logger compatibility with Bun builds, with an immediate automated attempt to resolve it. Several long-standing issues were also closed.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### CLI and Plugin Starter Fixes\nCritical bugs affecting the `elizaos create` and `elizaos publish` commands were resolved. This includes ensuring `.gitignore` files are properly included in published npm packages for plugin starters, preventing accidental sensitive file commits, and fixing a `zod` module error that prevented newly created plugins from being published. A minor spelling error in the plugin starter was also corrected.\n- [#5675](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5675)\n- [#5674](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5674)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### CLI and Plugin Creation Stability\nSeveral issues related to the stability and functionality of the CLI and plugin creation process were resolved. This includes fixing an agent not responding in the GUI after creation and setup, and resolving a `zod` module error that prevented newly created plugins from being published.\n- [#5617](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5617)\n- [#5657](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5657)\n\n### Documentation Updates\nAn issue concerning the update of action-chaining documentation on the docs repo/site was closed, indicating that the necessary documentation enhancements have been completed.\n- [#5656](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5656)\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Logger Compatibility for Bun Builds\nA new critical issue has been identified regarding the incompatibility of the current `pino` logger with Bun binary compilation and build processes. The proposed solution is to replace `pino` with `adze` to ensure compatibility. An automated attempt by Claude has already been made to address this, with a detailed plan for migration and verification.\n- [#5673](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5673)\n\n### DevRel Agent Content Freshness\nA new issue was opened to ensure the DevRel Agent always provides the most up-to-date content from the documentation, reflecting recent changes to ensure accuracy in responses.\n- [#5676](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5676)\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

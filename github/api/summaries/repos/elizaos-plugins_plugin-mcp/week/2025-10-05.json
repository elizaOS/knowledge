  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's activity centered on maintenance and critical bug investigation rather than new feature development. The primary focus was a community-driven effort to diagnose a significant import error affecting users of Eliza CLI v1.6.1. This collaborative troubleshooting on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/6031) successfully identified the likely root cause as faulty TypeScript declaration files in the `@elizaos/core` package. Additionally, a new pull request ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/17)) was introduced to automate dependency management, signaling a proactive step towards improving repository health.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nNo new features or bug fixes were merged this week. Development efforts were focused on infrastructure improvement and issue diagnosis.\n\n- **Dependency Management Automation**: A pull request ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/17)) was opened to add a Renovate configuration to the repository. This aims to automate the process of keeping dependencies up-to-date, reducing manual maintenance overhead and improving project security.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed this week, and no new issues were opened. The main activity was concentrated on an important ongoing issue.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - The discussion on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/6031) (\"Imports Not Found in `index.ts` with Eliza CLI 1.61\") dominated the week's triage activity. Community investigation revealed that the problem is specific to type-checking in version 1.6.1 of `@elizaos/core`, as projects still run correctly. The consensus points to missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in that specific package version. The recommended workaround for users is to upgrade to a version newer than 1.6.1, and it was suggested that the ElizaOS team consider deprecating the faulty version.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration was highly visible this week in the detailed investigation of issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/6031). Contributors @matteo-brandolino, @0xbbjoker, and @wtfsayo worked together to diagnose the problem. @matteo-brandolino provided extensive details, including environment information (OS, Node/Bun versions), reproduction steps, and screenshots, which were crucial in isolating the issue to a type-checking problem within a specific version of `@elizaos/core`. This interaction highlights a healthy and engaged community actively participating in troubleshooting complex technical problems."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Weekly Report (Aug 3 - 9, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's development was characterized by a focus on critical bug investigation rather than new feature delivery. Progress was largely blocked by two significant build failures originating in `@elizaos/core` and the Eliza CLI project templates. While no work was completed, a new pull request was opened to address logger compatibility, and community members actively collaborated on diagnosing the root causes of the blocking build issues.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nBased on the available data, no pull requests were merged or work completed this week. Development efforts were instead directed toward addressing foundational issues.\n\nA new pull request, [#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/15), was opened to fix a logger compatibility issue, representing the only new code contribution initiated during this period.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe project's focus was heavily on issue triage, with no issues being closed. The primary activity centered on two critical, active issues that are currently blocking further development and testing.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - **`@elizaos/core` Build Failure:** Issue [#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5738) remains a major blocker. The build is failing due to TypeScript errors, which prevents testing of complex scenarios like advanced mocking and dynamic plugin loading.\n    - **Eliza CLI Project Build Failure:** Issue [#5734](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5734) details a failure when building a new project with the CLI. Investigation revealed the cause to be a missing placeholder in `logger.info` calls within project templates.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nDespite the development blockers, there was active collaboration around troubleshooting. Contributors `monilpat`, `wtfsayo`, and `Kemystra` were engaged in the active issues. Notably, `Kemystra` identified the specific cause of the CLI build failure ([#5734](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5734)), while `monilpat` confirmed the `@elizaos/core` build failure ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5738)) after a team call, demonstrating focused community effort on resolving these critical problems."

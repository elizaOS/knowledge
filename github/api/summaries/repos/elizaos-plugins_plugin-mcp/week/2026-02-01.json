  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Weekly Report (Feb 1 - 7, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week, development on the `plugin-mcp` repository centered on hardening the framework for multi-tenant environments and enhancing security through granular connection management. The primary focus was the implementation of per-user Model Context Protocol (MCP) connections, which allows for dynamic API key injection based on individual user contexts. This shift addresses critical architectural needs for isolation and security, ensuring that agent interactions remain secure and distinct across diverse user sessions.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Multi-Tenancy & Security Hardening\nThe core of this week's technical progress involved transitioning the plugin from a global connection model to a more secure, user-centric architecture.\n\n*   **Per-User MCP Connections:** Implemented a system for dynamic API key injection, allowing the plugin to manage connections based on individual user contexts. This significantly improves security in multi-tenant deployments by isolating user data and credentials ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/23)).\n*   **Lifecycle & Header Management:** Modified the MCP connection lifecycle and request headers to support these dynamic connections. This included implementing URL-origin checks to prevent misconfigurations during the request context phase ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/23)).\n*   **State Mutation Fixes:** Initiated work to resolve shared-state mutation issues. By addressing how MCP states are modified, the project aims to eliminate race conditions and data leakage between different tenants ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/24)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No specific issues were marked as closed this week; however, the merging of PR [#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/23) resolved the primary technical debt regarding connection isolation.\n*   **New & Active Issues:** The most critical active work is currently tracked in PR [#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/24), which focuses on fixing shared-state mutations. This is a high-priority item for maintaining the integrity of the multi-tenant safety features introduced earlier in the week.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was highly focused on core architectural integrity. The development activity suggests a concentrated effort on medium-risk changes that require careful review of security protocols, particularly regarding how request contexts and headers are handled. The transition from implementing per-user connections ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/23)) to immediately addressing shared-state concerns ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/24)) demonstrates a proactive approach to stabilizing the plugin's new multi-tenant capabilities."

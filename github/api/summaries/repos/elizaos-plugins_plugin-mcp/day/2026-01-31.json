  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Daily Update (Jan 31, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant enhancements to MCP tool actions, transitioning to dynamic registration and reducing LLM calls. Additionally, improvements were made to HTTP transport mechanisms, including StreamableHTTP support and custom header functionality.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Dynamic MCP Tool Actions and Performance Optimization\nA major update transformed MCP tools from single `CALL_MCP_TOOL` actions to dynamically registered native ElizaOS actions. This change significantly reduces LLM calls per MCP tool invocation from three to one, improving efficiency. Optional Redis caching for MCP tool schemas was also introduced. ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/22))\n\n### Enhanced HTTP Transport and Custom Headers\nThe `plugin-mcp` now supports `StreamableHTTPClientTransport` for non-SSE HTTP connections, eliminating the Redis requirement for certain HTTP transport types. Custom header support has been added for HTTP transports, enabling features like authentication header injection. Code quality was also improved with a simplified error handling helper. ([#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/20), [#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/21))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo issues had more than 3 comments today."

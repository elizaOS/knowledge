This enhancement improves multi-tenancy and security for MCP interactions.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Multi-tenancy and Secure Connections\n- Implemented per-user MCP connections, allowing for dynamic API key injection based on individual user contexts. This change significantly improves the isolation and security of multi-tenant environments. ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/23))\n- Modified the MCP connection lifecycle and request headers to support these new per-user connections. This is a medium-risk change that requires careful consideration of request context and URL-origin checks to prevent misconfiguration. ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/23))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo issues with more than 3 comments are currently active."

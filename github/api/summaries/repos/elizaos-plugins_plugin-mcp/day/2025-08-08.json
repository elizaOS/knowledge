Several critical issues were active, including a build failure in `@elizaos/core` blocking testing, and an Eliza CLI build failure.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\nNo completed work to report.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- A new pull request, [#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/15), was opened to fix logger compatibility.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n- **Core Build Failure Blocking Testing:** Issue [#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5738) details a build failure in `@elizaos/core` due to TypeScript errors during the DTS build. The latest comment from monilpat confirms the issue was identified during a morning call, exists on the latest branch, and is blocking testing of complex scenarios such as advanced mocking, natural language agent interaction, and dynamic plugin loading.\n- **Eliza CLI Build Failure:** Issue [#5734](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5734) reports that the ElizaOS CLI fails to build projects. The latest comment from wtfsayo suggests that this issue might be fixed in the 1.4.x version. An earlier comment from Kemystra identified the problem as a missing placeholder in `logger.info` calls within `templates/project-starter/src/index.ts` and other template files, providing a fix."

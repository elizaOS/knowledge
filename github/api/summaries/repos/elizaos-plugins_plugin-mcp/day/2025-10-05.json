  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Daily Update (Oct 5, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw the introduction of a new Renovate configuration and ongoing discussion regarding an import error in `index.ts` with Eliza CLI 1.61.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo new technical developments were completed today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- **Dependency Management Automation**: A new pull request was opened to add Renovate configuration, aiming to automate dependency updates and maintenance for the repository ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/17)).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n- **Imports Not Found in `index.ts` with Eliza CLI 1.61** ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/6031)): The discussion continued regarding import errors in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61.\n    - **User Observation**: @matteo-brandolino suggested the issue might stem from missing type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically referencing non-existent `src` directories in `dist/index.d.ts` and `dist/types/index.d.ts`. They noted that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the problem.\n    - **Troubleshooting Steps**: @0xbbjoker previously suggested running `bun x tsc --noEmit` to diagnose the issue, suspecting a problem with the IDE's TypeScript compiler.\n    - **Further Details**: @matteo-brandolino confirmed the issue occurs in a newly created project using `elizaos create` and provided a screenshot illustrating the import errors. They also confirmed that the project functions correctly when run with `elizaos start`, indicating a type-checking specific problem."

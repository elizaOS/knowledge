  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Monthly Report (December 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nDevelopment in December focused on foundational improvements to the Master Control Program (MCP) provider. The key effort involved enhancing the provider's configuration capabilities and refining how agent tools interact with memory. This work improves the robustness of agent configuration and lays the groundwork for more sophisticated memory management, directly supporting the project's goal of creating more autonomous and adaptable agents.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n### MCP Provider and Memory Handling Enhancements\nA significant update was made to improve the integration between the MCP provider, tool usage, and agent memory.\n- An optional `mcpText` field was introduced, allowing for more flexible and formatted MCP configurations.\n- The `handleToolResponse` function was refactored to return a `Memory` object instead of a simpler type, enabling a more direct and effective integration with the agent's memory systems. The `callTool` function was also updated to support this change, completing the enhancement ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nBased on the provided reports for December, there was no activity related to issues. No new issues were opened, and no existing issues were closed.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe development reports for this period did not contain information regarding community discussions, contributor activity, or collaborative efforts on pull requests or issues."

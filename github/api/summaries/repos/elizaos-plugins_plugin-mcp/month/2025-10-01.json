  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Monthly Report (October 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nOctober was a month focused on infrastructure improvement and critical bug investigation rather than new feature development. Efforts were centered on diagnosing a significant import resolution issue affecting users of a specific Eliza CLI version, which consumed considerable community attention. Concurrently, work began on automating dependency management to improve long-term project maintenance and stability, with the introduction of a Renovate configuration.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWhile no major features were merged, a key step was taken to improve the project's maintenance workflow.\n\n- **Dependency Management Automation**: A pull request ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/17)) was opened to add a Renovate configuration. The goal of this initiative is to automate the process of updating dependencies, ensuring the project stays current with security patches and upstream improvements with less manual effort.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe month's issue triage was dominated by a single, high-impact bug. No new issues were opened, and none were closed.\n\n- **New & Active Issues**: The primary focus was on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/6031), concerning import errors in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI version 1.61. Community investigation revealed that this is likely a type-checking problem related to missing type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, as projects still function correctly at runtime. Diagnostic outputs confirmed numerous `TS2305` errors, and it was noted that the problem does not occur with earlier or later versions of the CLI. This issue remains active and is a key point of investigation.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this month was highly focused and diagnostic in nature, centered on resolving the active import issue.\n\n- There was significant discussion and collaborative troubleshooting on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/6031). Contributor @matteo-brandolino provided extensive details, including screenshots, diagnostic command outputs, and analysis pointing to a type definition problem. This was complemented by troubleshooting suggestions from @0xbbjoker, showcasing a healthy community effort to pinpoint the root cause of a complex bug."

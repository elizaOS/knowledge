  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nDevelopment in August was characterized by a focus on addressing critical infrastructure issues rather than shipping new features. Progress was significantly hampered by blocking build failures in both `@elizaos/core` and the Eliza CLI, which prevented testing of more complex functionalities. Despite these challenges, collaborative efforts were underway to diagnose the root causes, and a new pull request was opened to improve logger compatibility, signaling a move towards stabilization.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nNo new features or bug fixes were completed during this period. Development efforts were concentrated on identifying and resolving foundational blockers.\n\n- **Logger Compatibility**\n  - Work began to address system stability with the opening of a pull request to fix logger compatibility ([#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/15)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe project's issue landscape was dominated by active, high-priority blockers. No issues were closed or newly created during this timeframe.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  - No issues were reported as closed in August.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - The team's focus was on two critical, active issues that have stalled further development and testing:\n    - **`@elizaos/core` Build Failure ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5738)):** A TypeScript error during the DTS build is blocking testing for advanced mocking, natural language agent interaction, and dynamic plugin loading.\n    - **Eliza CLI Build Failure ([#5734](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5734)):** The CLI is unable to build projects. A potential cause has been identified related to a missing placeholder in `logger.info` calls within project templates.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration was centered on diagnosing the critical build failures. Discussions on issue [#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5738) during a team call confirmed the problem's existence on the latest branch. For the CLI issue ([#5734](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5734)), contributors actively investigated and provided potential fixes, demonstrating a focused, collaborative effort to resolve these foundational blockers."

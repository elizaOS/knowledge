  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Monthly Report (January 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nIn January 2026, development for `plugin-mcp` focused on optimizing the integration between the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and the ElizaOS framework. The primary theme of the month was increasing efficiency and flexibility in how agents interact with external tools and servers. Key achievements included a major architectural shift toward dynamic tool registration, which significantly reduced LLM overhead, and the expansion of HTTP transport capabilities to support more diverse networking environments.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Dynamic Tool Integration & Performance Optimization\nThe project underwent a significant architectural improvement in how MCP tools are handled within the ElizaOS ecosystem. By moving away from a static `CALL_MCP_TOOL` structure, the plugin now supports dynamic registration of MCP tools as native ElizaOS actions.\n*   **LLM Efficiency:** This transition reduced the number of LLM calls required for tool invocation from three down to one, drastically improving response latency and reducing token costs.\n*   **Caching:** Optional Redis caching for MCP tool schemas was introduced to further streamline performance ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/22)).\n\n### Enhanced Network Transport & Connectivity\nSignificant work was dedicated to making the plugin more adaptable to different server environments by expanding its transport layer.\n*   **StreamableHTTP Transport:** The introduction of `StreamableHTTPClientTransport` allows for non-SSE (Server-Sent Events) HTTP connections. This is a critical update for environments where Redis is not available or desired for transport management ([#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/20)).\n*   **Custom Headers:** Support for custom headers was added to HTTP transports, enabling essential features such as authentication header injection for secure MCP server communication ([#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/20), [#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/21)).\n*   **Code Quality:** Error handling was refined through the implementation of simplified helper functions to ensure more robust connection management ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/21)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe end of the month saw a focus on clearing the path for these new architectural changes. While no specific external issues were reported as closed in the final days of January, the successful merging of major PRs ([#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/20), [#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/21), [#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/22)) addressed core technical debt regarding LLM inefficiency and transport limitations. There are currently no high-activity \"blocker\" issues with significant discussion, indicating a stable transition to the new dynamic action system.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe development activity in January reflects a highly focused effort on core framework alignment. The rapid progression from the opening of transport enhancements to the implementation of dynamic tool registration suggests a tight feedback loop between contributors. The work on PR [#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/22) in particular demonstrates a commitment to the ElizaOS philosophy of modularity, ensuring that MCP tools feel like first-class, native citizens within the agent's cognitive architecture."

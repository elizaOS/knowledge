  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nNovember's development focused on foundational refinement and maintenance within the MCP plugin. The primary effort involved improving the clarity of core action names to better align with the plugin's scope, renaming `CALL_TOOL` and `READ_RESOURCE` to `CALL_MCP_TOOL` and `READ_MCP_RESOURCE` respectively. These changes were implemented with backward compatibility to ensure a seamless transition for existing integrations. Additionally, the project's core dependency was updated, keeping the plugin current with the broader ElizaOS ecosystem.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month centered on a single pull request aimed at enhancing code clarity and maintaining dependencies.\n\n- **Action Name Refinements for Clarity:** To improve namespacing and make the plugin's actions more explicit, key actions were renamed. The changes, introduced in PR [#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/18), included renaming `CALL_TOOL` to `CALL_MCP_TOOL` and `READ_RESOURCE` to `READ_MCP_RESOURCE`. Importantly, these updates were implemented with backward compatibility to prevent breaking changes for users.\n- **Dependency Management:** As part of the maintenance effort in PR [#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/18), the `@elizaos/core` dependency was updated to version `^1.5.4`.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in November.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened during the month, and there were no reports of significant activity on existing issues.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nDevelopment activity in November was focused, with all changes consolidated into a single pull request. The provided data does not indicate broader community discussions or contributions for this period."

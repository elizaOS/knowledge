  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-pdf Daily Update (Oct 5, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day's development focused on addressing a critical import error within the Eliza CLI, specifically concerning `@Elizaos/core` package imports. A new pull request was opened to add Renovate configuration for dependency management.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-pdf/pull/8), was opened to add Renovate configuration to the repository. This aims to automate dependency updates and maintenance.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Addressing `@elizaos/core` Import Errors in Eliza CLI 1.61\nDiscussion continued on [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-pdf/issues/6031) regarding import errors in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61. The user `matteo-brandolino` provided a detailed output of `bun x tsc --noEmit`, showing numerous `TS2305: Module '\"@elizaos/core\"' has no exported member` errors for various types and functions like `logger`, `IAgentRuntime`, `Project`, `Character`, `UUID`, `Plugin`, `Action`, `ActionResult`, `Content`, `GenerateTextParams`, `HandlerCallback`, `Memory`, `ModelType`, `Provider`, `ProviderResult`, `Service`, and `State`. Additionally, `TS2339` and `TS7006` errors related to `ZodError` and implicitly `any` typed parameters were reported in `plugin.ts`. `matteo-brandolino` suggested the issue might stem from missing source files in the published `@Elizaos/core` package for version 1.6.1, noting that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the problem. Previously, `0xbbjoker` had suggested running `bun x tsc --noEmit` to diagnose the issue, suspecting an IDE TSC compiler problem, as they could not reproduce the error on a fresh installation."

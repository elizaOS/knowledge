  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-pdf Daily Update (Oct 8, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day's activity focused on continued investigation and discussion around a critical import error in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61, with community members actively troubleshooting the problem.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\nNo new technical developments were reported today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Troubleshooting Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.61\nDiscussion continued on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-pdf/issues/6031), which reports \"Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61\". Today, `matteo-brandolino` provided an update, confirming that the issue persists on an Arch Linux system and shared the output of `bun x tsc --noEmit`, which shows numerous `TS2305` errors indicating missing exported members from `@elizaos/core`. These errors include `logger`, `IAgentRuntime`, `Project`, `ProjectAgent`, `Character`, `UUID`, and various types related to plugins. The user noted that the problem does not occur with versions prior to 1.6.1 or with later versions, suggesting a version-specific bug. `0xbbjoker` previously suggested that the issue might be related to the IDE's TypeScript compiler, as they could not reproduce the problem on a fresh installation with 1.6.1."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-pdf Monthly Report (October 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nOctober's development was characterized by focused debugging and infrastructure enhancement. The primary effort involved investigating a critical, version-specific import error related to `@elizaos/core` v1.6.1, with community members collaborating to diagnose the root cause. Concurrently, work began to improve long-term project maintenance by introducing automated dependency management via Renovate. This month prioritized stability and process improvement over new feature development.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving the project's maintenance infrastructure.\n\n- **Dependency Management Automation**\n  To streamline dependency updates and ensure the project stays current with its upstream packages, a pull request ([#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-pdf/pull/8)) was opened to add a Renovate configuration. This aims to automate the process of discovering and creating pull requests for new dependency versions.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management was dominated by a single high-priority bug investigation.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  No issues were reported as closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  The most significant activity was the ongoing investigation into issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-pdf/issues/6031), \"Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61\".\n  - **Problem:** Users reported numerous `TS2305: Module '\"@elizaos/core\"' has no exported member` errors when using Eliza CLI v1.61. This prevented the plugin from compiling correctly, affecting core types like `IAgentRuntime`, `Plugin`, `Action`, and `logger`.\n  - **Investigation:** Community members determined that the issue is specific to version `1.6.1` of the `@Elizaos/core` package. Downgrading to `1.5.15` or upgrading to a version newer than `1.6.1` resolves the problem, suggesting a potential packaging or publishing error in that specific release.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration was evident in the focused effort to troubleshoot the critical import bug. The discussion on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-pdf/issues/6031) showcased a healthy dynamic, with user `matteo-brandolino` providing detailed error logs and system information, and contributor `0xbbjoker` offering diagnostic steps. This collaborative debugging was crucial in narrowing down the problem to a specific dependency version."

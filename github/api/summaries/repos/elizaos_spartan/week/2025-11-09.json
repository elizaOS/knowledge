  "content": "# elizaos/spartan Weekly Report (Nov 9 - 15, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's development was characterized by a focused effort on enhancing the project's plugin architecture. The most significant achievement was a major refactoring of the `degenIntel` plugin, which involved a comprehensive reorganization of its API routes. This update also introduced a critical payment protection layer and new analytics endpoints, strengthening the plugin's commercial viability and data capabilities. Meanwhile, community discussion continued around an active issue concerning the Spartan News Service's reliability.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on a single, impactful pull request aimed at improving a core plugin.\n\n- **`degenIntel` Plugin API Refactor**\n  A substantial restructuring of the `degenIntel` plugin's API was completed to improve its organization and functionality. This effort, captured in PR [#23](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/pull/23), introduced a payment protection layer across various endpoints and added new analytics endpoints specifically for market data. This refactor enhances both the security and the feature set of the plugin.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nNo new issues were opened or closed this week, with attention remaining on a pre-existing problem.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n- **New & Active Issues:** While no new issues were reported, discussion continued on the **Spartan News Service functionality** ([#37](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/issues/37)). Users have been experiencing inconsistent posting behavior. A recent comment in the thread noted that the service appeared to be working for one user after following the `README` instructions, suggesting the issue may be related to configuration or documentation.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThis week's activity indicates a pattern of focused, deep work on a single major feature by the development team. Community engagement was most visible in the ongoing troubleshooting discussion for the Spartan News Service issue ([#37](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/issues/37)), where users are actively involved in diagnosing the problem."

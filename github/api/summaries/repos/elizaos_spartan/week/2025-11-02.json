A substantial update to the `main` branch synchronized core system components and a wide array of plugins. This work centered on refining the project's modular architecture and ensuring consistency across the codebase, particularly affecting build processes and plugin infrastructure. The week was otherwise quiet, with no new issues or pull requests, indicating a period of consolidation rather than new feature development.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n### Core System and Plugin Synchronization\nA major update was merged into the `main` branch, representing a broad synchronization and integration effort across the repository.

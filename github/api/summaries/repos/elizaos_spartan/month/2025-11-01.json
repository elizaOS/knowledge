This foundational effort focused on synchronizing core system components and refining the plugin infrastructure, reinforcing the project's commitment to a robust and modular architecture. The update touched a wide array of files, from build processes to key plugins like `account`, `analytics`, and `autofun`, indicating a broad effort to ensure consistency across the codebase. The remainder of the period was quiet, with no new issues or pull requests reported.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThe month's work was consolidated into a single, impactful update aimed at system-wide integration and refinement.\n\n- **Core System & Plugin Synchronization:** A substantial update was merged into the `main` branch, representing a broad synchronization effort.

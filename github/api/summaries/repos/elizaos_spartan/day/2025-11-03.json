This update touched core system files like `build.ts`, `package.json`, and `src/index.ts`, alongside numerous files within the `account`, `analytics`, and `autofun` plugins. This indicates a broad synchronization or integration effort across the project. ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/pull/12))\n\n### Plugin File Modifications\nThe `src/plugins` directory saw the most active development, with 43 changes recorded. This includes updates to action files, interfaces, providers, and services within the `account` plugin (e.g., `act_reg_confirmemail.ts`, `int_accounts.ts`, `account.ts`, `srv_accounts.ts`). Similarly, the `analytics` plugin experienced changes in its action files (e.g., `getAccountAnalytics.ts`), interfaces, providers (e.g., `birdeyeProvider.ts`), and services. The `autofun` plugin also had updates to its APIs, providers (e.g., `birdeyeTrending.ts`), schemas, and tasks.

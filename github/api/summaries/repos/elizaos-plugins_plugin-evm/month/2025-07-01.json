  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm Monthly Report (July 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nDevelopment in July focused on addressing stability and critical bugs within the `plugin-evm` repository. No new features were merged; instead, effort was directed toward resolving existing issues. A key activity was the submission of a pull request ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/21)) to fix a build error. Concurrently, significant community discussion took place around a persistent SQL database error ([#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/39)), leading to a proposed temporary workaround.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nBased on the provided reports for July, no new features, bug fixes, or other code changes were completed and merged this month. Development activity was centered on work-in-progress fixes.\n\nA new pull request, [#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/21), was opened on July 25 to address a building error. This work remains in progress.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month concentrated on identifying and discussing solutions for existing problems rather than closing issues or opening new ones.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed in July.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** While no new issues were created, there was significant activity on a pre-existing critical issue. Discussion continued on [#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/39), \"Twitter error with sql database,\" which was originally opened on July 16. The issue describes a failure in the Twitter service caused by an SQL query. A potential temporary workaround was suggested: deleting the `.elizadb` file before startup.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration was evident in the troubleshooting efforts around active issues. The discussion on issue [#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/39) involved multiple community members (Rxbbn, itnccuong, yohaiai) sharing their experiences and working towards a solution. The opening of PR [#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/21) also demonstrates active contributor engagement in maintaining the stability of the project."

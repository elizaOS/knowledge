  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm Monthly Report (September 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nSeptember was a month of targeted enhancements and stability improvements for the `plugin-evm`. The most significant development was the introduction of an optional `data` parameter in transfer templates, increasing the flexibility of on-chain interactions. Alongside this new feature, the team focused on maintenance, updating dependencies, and resolving key issues related to the CI/CD pipeline and user interface, ensuring a more robust and user-friendly experience.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month centered on adding new capabilities and performing routine maintenance to keep the project current.\n\n- **Enhanced EVM Transfer Functionality**\n  A key feature was added to improve the flexibility of EVM transfers by supporting an optional `data` parameter within the transfer template. This change, introduced in PR [#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/16), addresses cases where calldata was not being correctly included, enabling more complex transactions.\n\n- **Project Maintenance and Dependency Updates**\n  Routine maintenance was performed in PR [#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/22), which bumped the project version to 1.0.13. This update also included refreshing various dependencies to ensure the plugin remains stable, secure, and compatible with the latest standards.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month focused on closing out bugs and improving the developer and user experience, with discussions pointing toward future integrations.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  Several important issues were resolved, strengthening the project's foundation:\n    - **CI/CD & Tooling:** The CLI CI tests were successfully fixed ([#5714](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5714)), and the `project-starter` was dockerized ([#5842](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5842)), improving the development and testing workflow.\n    - **UI/UX:** An enhancement was completed to display action calls and their results directly in the chat UI ([#5831](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5831)), providing users with better visibility into agent activities.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  No new issues were opened this month. However, an important discussion continued in [#5820](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5820) regarding the potential integration of a native Venice AI provider. The conversation suggests that users can currently achieve similar functionality by modifying environment variables for `plugin-openai` or by using the separate `plugin-venice`, indicating that existing solutions may cover this need.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nBased on the available data, collaboration this month was evident in the active discussion around issue [#5820](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5820). This shows community engagement in exploring integration possibilities and finding practical workarounds, which is a healthy sign for the project's ecosystem. The focus on closing existing issues reflects a collaborative effort to maintain project quality and stability."

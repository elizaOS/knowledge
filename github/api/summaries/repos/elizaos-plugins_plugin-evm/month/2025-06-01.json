  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm Monthly Report (June 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nJune was a month focused on stabilization and resolving critical user-facing issues. While no new features were merged directly into the codebase during this period, significant progress was made by closing several long-standing bugs related to agent interaction and API reliability. The resolution of a key bug preventing plugin action callbacks from reaching users marks a major improvement in the platform's feedback loop. Community engagement drove discussions around future capabilities, including advanced DeFi functions and enhanced developer customizability.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nAccording to the development reports from this period, there were no new features, bug fixes, or code refactoring efforts merged directly into the repository. The primary development activity involved the verification and closure of issues addressed in the recent `v1.0.9` release.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management was the central activity in June, with a strong focus on closing out persistent bugs and clarifying future development paths.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** A number of important issues were resolved, enhancing the plugin's stability and user experience.\n    - **Agent & API Reliability:** Several bugs impacting core functionality were closed. This includes a fix ensuring plugin action callbacks are correctly delivered to the user chat ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5017)), a fix for successive agent replies ([#4940](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/4940)), and a resolution for an issue with room creation via the REST API ([#4955](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/4955)). These fixes were confirmed to be working in version 1.0.9.\n    - **LLM Integration:** The issue regarding Bedrock LLM integration ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5117)) was closed, with the solution being the release of a new, separate `plugin-bedrock`, reinforcing the project's modular architecture.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** New discussions point toward future enhancements for developers and users.\n    - **Token Swaps:** A new issue ([#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/20)) was opened to inquire about the plugin's capabilities for token swaps, specifically mentioning Chainlink CCIP. This indicates community interest in expanding the plugin's DeFi features.\n    - **Logger Customization:** An ongoing discussion in [#5183](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5183) centers on a feature request to allow downstream projects to customize the root logger configuration. A maintainer has taken ownership of the issue, signaling it is under consideration for future development.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this month was characterized by a strong feedback loop between users and maintainers. The resolution of the critical callback bug in [#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5017) was confirmed by community members after updating their installations, demonstrating effective communication and issue validation. Maintainers were actively engaged in triaging issues and taking on new work, as seen in the discussion around logger customization ([#5183](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5183))."

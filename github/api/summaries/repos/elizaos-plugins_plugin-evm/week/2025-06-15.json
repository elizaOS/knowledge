  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm Weekly Report (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts centered on stabilization and resolving key user-facing issues. While no new code was merged, significant progress was made in closing long-standing bugs related to agent interaction and API reliability. The most critical achievement was the resolution of an issue preventing plugin action callbacks from reaching the end-user chat, restoring essential feedback for transactions. This focus on bug squashing has improved the overall stability and user experience of the plugin.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nBased on the provided reports, development activity this week was focused on issue triage and resolution rather than new code contributions. No new features, bug fixes, or refactoring pull requests were merged. The primary \"developments\" were the successful closure of several important issues, confirmed through community testing and version updates.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe project saw a productive week of issue management, clearing out a backlog of bugs and clarifying paths for future features.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** A number of important issues were resolved and closed, enhancing plugin reliability:\n    - **Agent Interaction & Callbacks:** A critical bug where callback responses from plugin actions failed to appear in the user chat ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5017)) was fixed and confirmed by the community after updating to version 1.0.9. A related issue with successive agent replies ([#4940](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/4940)) was also closed.\n    - **API & Integrations:** An issue with room creation via the REST API ([#4955](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/4955)) was confirmed resolved. Additionally, the issue for Bedrock LLM integration ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5117)) was closed following the release of the new `plugin-bedrock`.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - **Token Swaps:** A new issue ([#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/20)) was opened to inquire about the plugin's capabilities for token swaps, specifically mentioning Chainlink CCIP. This signals community interest in expanding the plugin's cross-chain functionality.\n    - **Logger Customization:** Discussion continues in [#5183](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5183) on the feature request to allow downstream projects to customize the root logger configuration. A maintainer has taken ownership of the issue, which aims to provide greater flexibility for developers building on the framework.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was evident in the issue resolution process. The fix for the critical callback bug ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5017)) involved a healthy feedback loop, with user `@jonathanprozzi` confirming the resolution after updating their environment, and maintainer `@0xbbjoker` facilitating the closure. Similarly, maintainer `@standujar` actively engaged with the community by taking ownership of the logger customization feature request ([#5183]), demonstrating a responsive approach to developer needs."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm Weekly Report (Sep 7 - 13, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts focused on enhancing the core functionality and stability of the EVM plugin. A key feature was introduced to provide greater flexibility in EVM transfers by supporting optional calldata. The project also saw a routine maintenance release, updating dependencies to ensure stability. On the infrastructure front, significant progress was made by resolving CI test failures and completing the dockerization of the project starter, improving the overall developer experience and deployment pipeline.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on a targeted feature enhancement and essential maintenance.\n\n- **Enhanced EVM Transfer Flexibility**\n  A new feature was merged to support an optional `data` parameter within the transfer template. This change addresses a previous limitation by allowing calldata to be correctly included in transactions, significantly improving the flexibility and power of EVM transfers initiated through the plugin ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/16)).\n\n- **Maintenance and Dependency Updates**\n  A routine maintenance update was performed, bumping the project version to 1.0.13. This release included updates to various dependencies, ensuring the project remains secure, stable, and aligned with the latest standards ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/22)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this week focused on closing out important infrastructure and UI tasks, with a key discussion emerging around future provider integrations.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  Several key issues were resolved, strengthening the project's foundation:\n    - **CI/CD & Developer Experience:** An issue with failing CLI CI tests was fixed, restoring confidence in the test suite. The task to dockerize the `project-starter` was also completed, simplifying setup and deployment ([#5714](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5714), [#5842](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5842)).\n    - **UI Enhancements:** A UI improvement was implemented to display action calls and their results directly in the chat interface, providing better visibility into agent activity ([#5831](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5831)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  No new issues were opened this week. The primary active discussion revolves around the potential integration of a native Venice AI provider ([#5820](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5820)). Current thinking suggests that similar functionality can be achieved by modifying the base URL for the existing `plugin-openai` or by using the separate `plugin-venice`, indicating a preference for leveraging existing modular components over adding new native support.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nBased on the available data, collaboration this week was centered on the technical discussion in issue [#5820](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5820) regarding the integration of a new AI provider. This highlights the community's focus on maintaining a modular and extensible architecture by carefully considering the best approach for integrating new services."

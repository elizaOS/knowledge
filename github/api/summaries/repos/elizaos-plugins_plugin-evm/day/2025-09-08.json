  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm Daily Update (Sep 8, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, the `plugin-evm` repository saw a new feature enabling optional data parameters in transfer templates and a routine dependency update. Several issues were closed, including fixes for CI tests and UI improvements.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced EVM Transfer Functionality\nA new feature was added to support an optional `data` parameter within the transfer template, addressing an issue where calldata was not being correctly included. This improves the flexibility of EVM transfers. ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/16))\n\n### Maintenance and Dependency Updates\nThe project underwent a routine maintenance update, bumping the version to 1.0.13 and updating various dependencies to ensure the project remains current and stable. ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/pull/22))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNone\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### CI/CD and Dockerization Improvements\nThe issue related to fixing CLI CI tests was resolved, confirming that the tests are now working as expected. Additionally, the task to dockerize the `project-starter` was completed. ([#5714](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5714), [#5842](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5842))\n\n### UI/UX Enhancements\nThe issue concerning showing action calls and their results in the chat UI was closed, indicating that this feature has been implemented. ([#5831](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5831))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNone\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Native Venice AI Provider Integration\nDiscussion on [#5820](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5820) regarding the integration of a native Venice AI provider suggests that users can achieve similar functionality by modifying the base URL environment variable for the `plugin-openai`. A dedicated `plugin-venice` also exists, potentially offering a direct solution."

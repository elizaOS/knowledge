  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm Daily Update (Jun 18, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day's activity focused on resolving existing issues, particularly those related to agent responses, room creation via REST API, and plugin action callbacks. Significant progress was made in addressing these long-standing concerns, with several issues being closed.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Agent Response and Callback Fixes\nSeveral issues related to agent responses and plugin action callbacks were addressed and closed. This includes a fix for successive replies on target users ([#4940](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/4940)) and ensuring callbacks from plugin actions are properly delivered to the end-user response in chat ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5017)). The latter was confirmed to be working after updating to version 1.0.9.\n\n### REST API Room Creation\nThe issue where creating a room via the REST API initially worked but then returned an empty rooms array ([#4955](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/4955)) was closed. This was confirmed to be resolved in version 1.0.9, with the understanding that agents register in rooms only after a message is sent, and the switch from rooms to channels.\n\n### Bedrock Integration\nThe issue concerning the integration of Bedrock as an LLM ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5117)) was closed. A new plugin, `plugin-bedrock`, was released to address this.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

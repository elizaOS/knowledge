  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Daily Update (Jan 21, 2026)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing code quality and compatibility. Key achievements include implementing structured logging, resolving TypeScript errors for `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x, and refactoring the messaging API.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Logging and Code Quality\nStructured logging has been implemented across the repository, standardizing log formats to align with the eliza monorepo. This includes the addition of ESLint with a structured logging rule and a `lint:check` script for CI, improving code quality and maintainability. ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/21))\n\n### TypeScript Compatibility and Type Safety\nResolved TypeScript errors to ensure compatibility with `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x. This involved removing deprecated `serverId` from `ensureConnection` calls, casting `serverId` to `UUID` for type safety in Room/World objects, and fixing custom event payload typing. ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24))\n\n### Unified Messaging API\nThe messaging API has been refactored to implement a unified approach with elizaOS support, streamlining message handling within the plugin. ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

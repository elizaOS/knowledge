  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Daily Update (Jan 21, 2026)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing code quality and compatibility. Key achievements include implementing structured logging, resolving TypeScript errors for `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x, and refactoring the messaging API for unified ElizaOS support.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Logging and Code Quality\nStructured logging has been implemented across the repository, standardizing log formats to align with the Eliza monorepo. This includes the addition of ESLint with a structured logging rule and a `lint:check` script for CI, improving code quality and maintainability ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/21)).\n\n### Improved ElizaOS Compatibility and Type Safety\nTypeScript errors related to `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x compatibility have been resolved. This involved removing deprecated `serverId` from `ensureConnection` calls, casting `serverId` to `UUID` for type safety in Room/World objects, and fixing custom event payload typing and `MessagePayload` to use proper `Memory` ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24)).\n\n### Unified Messaging API\nThe messaging API has been refactored to implement a unified approach with ElizaOS support, streamlining communication within the plugin ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Daily Update (Oct 20, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday saw significant progress in the Telegram plugin with a migration to a new message handling system and critical bug fixes for button handling and logging.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Message Handling and Debuggability\nThe Telegram plugin's message handling has been refactored to use direct `runtime.handleMessage()` calls instead of event-based emissions. This change, primarily affecting `src/environment.ts` and `src/messageManager.ts`, aims to make the message flow more traceable and easier to debug, improving overall system reliability ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/17)).\n\n### Robust Button Handling and Improved Logging\nA critical bug fix was implemented to resolve crashes related to Telegram button handling. This involved safely converting Telegram buttons with validation and fallbacks. Additionally, structured logging was improved, test coverage expanded, and package/core versions updated, enhancing the plugin's stability and diagnostic capabilities. The most active development areas for this fix were `src` and `__tests__` directories ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/19)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/20): This pull request addresses an issue where GIF animations are not playing correctly in Telegram.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Core Build and Logging System Stability\nTwo significant issues impacting the core build process and logging system were resolved. The `pino-pretty` errors in export builds from Bun were fixed by migrating to `adze` as the logger, ensuring compatibility with Bun's binary compilation process ([#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/5673)). Additionally, a build failure in `@elizaos/core` causing `bun run clean` to fail due to TypeScript errors was also fixed ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/5738)).\n\n### API Key Setup Flexibility\nThe issue regarding making API key setup optional in `npx elizaos create` was closed. It was confirmed that this functionality is already available using the `-y` flag ([#5604](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/5604)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

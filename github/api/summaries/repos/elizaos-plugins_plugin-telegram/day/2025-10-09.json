  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Daily Update (Oct 9, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw the closure of a significant issue regarding import errors with Eliza CLI 1.61, with the resolution attributed to clean reinstalls rather than specific code changes. A new pull request was opened to migrate to `runtime.handleMessage()`.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Core Runtime Migration\nA new feature branch has been initiated to migrate the plugin's message handling to `runtime.handleMessage()`, aiming to align with updated core functionalities. [#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/17)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- **Feature: Migrate to runtime.handleMessage()**: A new pull request [#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/17) was opened to implement the migration to `runtime.handleMessage()`. This is a new feature and is currently in progress.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Resolution of Eliza CLI 1.61 Import Errors\nIssue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/6031), concerning \"Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61,\" was closed today. The resolution appears to be related to users performing clean reinstalls of dependencies, rather than a specific code fix. The issue was diagnosed as a build/publish pipeline problem specific to `@elizaos/core@1.6.1`, where TypeScript declaration files were missing or malformed.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61 [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/6031)\nThe issue, which reported `Module '\"@Elizaos/core\"' has no exported member 'logger'` and similar errors, was closed today. The latest comments indicate that the type errors seem to be resolved after clean reinstalls of `node_modules` and fresh project creation. The user `matteo-brandolino` confirmed that the issue is no longer occurring. `wtfsayo` noted that this type of error can be due to node/package type resolution issues and that no specific fix was made on their end. Earlier discussions involved `claude` diagnosing the root cause as a build/publish pipeline issue in `@elizaos/core@1.6.1`, where TypeScript declaration files were missing or malformed, and recommended upgrading to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later. `0xbbjoker` had previously attempted to reproduce the issue without success and suggested verifying Node and Bun versions and performing clean installations."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Daily Update (Oct 8, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day's activity focused on ongoing investigation and discussion of an import resolution issue with `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1, with community members providing diagnostic information.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\nNo new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Investigation into `@elizaos/core` Import Errors ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/6031))\nDiscussion continued regarding an issue where imports from `@elizaos/core` were not found when using Eliza CLI 1.6.1. On October 8th, user @matteo-brandolino provided their OS as Arch Linux, in response to a query about their environment. This issue, initially reported on October 2nd, has seen multiple attempts at diagnosis, including a detailed analysis by Claude on October 7th, which suggested the problem was specific to version 1.6.1 due to missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in the published package. The latest comments on October 9th indicate that a clean reinstall resolved the issue for @matteo-brandolino, with @wtfsayo suggesting it might be due to node/package type resolution issues rather than a specific fix."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Monthly Report (September 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nDevelopment in September focused on enhancing the interactive capabilities of the Telegram plugin. The primary effort was centered on introducing support for inline keyboard callback buttons, a feature designed to expand the ways users can interact with AI agents. This work, initiated by a feature request, progressed directly to a pull request, demonstrating a focused effort to build more dynamic and responsive agent experiences within the Telegram ecosystem.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThe month's development work was concentrated on a single, significant new feature.\n\n- **Support for Inline Callback Buttons**\n  To improve user interaction, work was initiated to add inline callback buttons. This new feature complements the existing URL and Login buttons, allowing for more complex, stateful conversations. Pull request [#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/15) was opened to introduce the necessary utilities, types, and documentation to support this functionality.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in September.\n- **New & Active Issues:** The main driver for this month's development was the creation of issue [#14](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/14), which formally requested support for inline keyboard callback buttons. This issue highlights the project's direction toward more interactive and capable agent interfaces.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe development process this month showed a direct and responsive workflow. The feature request filed in issue [#14](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/14) was immediately followed by the submission of pull request [#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/15), indicating a tight feedback and implementation loop."

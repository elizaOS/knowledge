  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Monthly Report (October 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nOctober was a month of significant stabilization and modernization for the Telegram plugin. Development efforts were centered on resolving a critical, environment-specific import bug related to `@elizaos/core`, which was successfully triaged and closed through community collaboration. Key architectural improvements were made, including a migration to the core `runtime.handleMessage()` function to enhance debuggability. The team also focused on improving project maintainability by introducing automated dependency management and closing several issues deemed redundant, reflecting a pragmatic approach to development.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month focused on refactoring core integrations, fixing critical bugs, and improving infrastructure.\n\n-   **Core Message Handling Refactor**\n    A major refactoring effort was completed to migrate the plugin's message flow from an event-based system to direct calls using `runtime.handleMessage()` ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/17)). This change makes the message handling process more traceable and easier to debug, aligning the plugin with the latest core framework patterns and improving overall system reliability.\n\n-   **Stability and Bug Fixes**\n    A critical bug causing crashes when handling Telegram buttons was resolved ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/19)). The fix introduced safer button conversion with validation and fallbacks. This work also included improvements to structured logging and an expansion of test coverage, enhancing the plugin's stability and diagnostic capabilities.\n\n-   **Infrastructure Automation**\n    To improve long-term maintainability, a pull request was opened to add a Renovate configuration ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/16)). This will automate the process of keeping project dependencies up-to-date, reducing manual effort and potential security risks.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n### Closed Issues\nSeveral important issues were resolved, clearing the path for future development:\n\n-   **`@elizaos/core` Import Errors:** A complex issue causing import errors with Eliza CLI v1.6.1 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/6031)) was thoroughly investigated and closed. The root cause was identified as a build/publish pipeline problem in a specific version of `@elizaos/core`, and the issue was resolved for affected users after they performed clean dependency reinstalls.\n-   **Core Build & Logging Stability:** Issues related to the core build process were addressed. A problem with `pino-pretty` in Bun export builds was fixed by migrating to `adze` for logging ([#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/5673)), and a separate build failure in `@elizaos/core` was also fixed ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/5738)).\n-   **Pipeline Enhancement Pruning:** Two enhancement requests for the CLI pipeline—one for API cost estimation ([#156](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/156)) and another for graceful shutdown ([#155](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/155))—were closed. It was determined that existing mechanisms already covered the required functionality, demonstrating adherence to the YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) principle.\n-   **API Key Setup Clarification:** An issue regarding optional API key setup during project creation was closed, as it was confirmed the functionality already exists via the `-y` flag ([#5604](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/5604)).\n\n### New & Active Issues\nNew issues opened this month focus on enhancing media handling capabilities:\n\n-   **Image & GIF Display:** A new issue was opened to address the inability to send images without displaying the raw URL to the user ([#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/18)). A related pull request was opened to fix an issue where GIF animations are not playing correctly ([#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/20)). These represent the next focus area for improving the user experience.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was particularly strong this month, highlighted by the collaborative effort to diagnose and resolve the import error in issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/6031). User `matteo-brandolino` provided detailed reports and environment specifics, which were crucial for the investigation. Contributors `0xbbjoker` and `wtfsayo` actively participated in the discussion, attempting to reproduce the bug and offering diagnostic suggestions. This interaction demonstrates a healthy and responsive feedback loop between users and maintainers, which was essential in resolving a problem that originated outside the plugin's own codebase."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts focused on enhancing the stability and debuggability of the Telegram plugin. A significant refactor of the message handling system was completed, moving from event-based emissions to direct function calls to improve traceability. A critical bug causing crashes related to Telegram button handling was resolved, and core stability was further improved by fixing build and logging system issues, notably by migrating to the `adze` logger for better compatibility with Bun's build process.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this period centered on refactoring and bug fixes to create a more robust plugin.\n\n- **Message Handling Refactor:** The plugin's message flow was made more traceable and easier to debug by refactoring it to use direct `runtime.handleMessage()` calls instead of event emissions. This change, implemented in PR [#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/17), primarily impacted `src/environment.ts` and `src/messageManager.ts`.\n\n- **Stability and Bug Fixes:** A critical bug that caused crashes when handling Telegram buttons was fixed in PR [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/19). The solution involved safely converting buttons with added validation and fallbacks. This effort also included improvements to structured logging, expanded test coverage, and dependency updates to enhance overall stability.\n\n- **New Work Initiated:** A new pull request, [#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/20), was opened to address an issue where GIF animations fail to play correctly within Telegram.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this week focused on resolving core build system problems and clarifying existing functionality.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n    - **Core Build & Logging:** Two key issues affecting the build process were resolved. An error with `pino-pretty` in Bun export builds was fixed by migrating the logging system to `adze` ([#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/5673)). A separate build failure in `@elizaos/core` was also fixed ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/5738)).\n    - **CLI Configuration:** An issue regarding optional API key setup during project creation was closed, as it was confirmed the `-y` flag already provides this functionality ([#5604](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/5604)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - No new issues were opened during this period.\n    - There were no active issues with significant discussion reported.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe provided development reports focused on technical progress, with no specific community or collaboration highlights mentioned."

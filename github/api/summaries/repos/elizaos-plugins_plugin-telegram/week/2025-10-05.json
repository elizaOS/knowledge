  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts centered on improving project infrastructure and diagnosing a critical dependency issue. A pull request was introduced to automate dependency management using Renovate, a key step towards enhancing long-term maintainability. Concurrently, significant progress was made in investigating a complex import error affecting users of `@elizaos/cli` v1.6.1. The collaborative troubleshooting on this issue successfully identified a likely cause within the core package's build process and established a clear workaround for affected users.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThe sole development activity this week focused on improving the project's maintenance workflow.\n\n- **Infrastructure Automation:** A pull request ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/16)) was opened to add a Renovate configuration file. This aims to automate the process of keeping project dependencies up-to-date, reducing manual effort and improving security and stability.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nNo new issues were opened and no existing issues were closed this week. The primary focus was on an ongoing investigation.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were resolved this week.\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - **Investigation into `@elizaos/core` Import Errors ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/6031)):** Discussion continued on an issue where imports from `@elizaos/core` (like `logger` and `IAgentRuntime`) were not being found by TypeScript when using `@elizaos/cli` v1.6.1. Contributor `matteo-brandolino` suggested the problem stemmed from malformed type definition files in that specific version of the core package. The issue was confirmed to be specific to IDE type-checking, as the project still runs correctly. The problem was ultimately diagnosed as a likely build/publish pipeline error for `@elizaos/core` v1.6.1, with the recommended solution being to upgrade to a newer version like `1.6.2`.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity collaboration was evident in the detailed troubleshooting of issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/6031). The back-and-forth between contributors `matteo-brandolino` and `0xbbjoker` highlights an engaged community working together to diagnose a nuanced problem that originated in an upstream dependency. The detailed analysis provided by `matteo-brandolino`, including identifying the issue's scope (IDE-only) and its potential root cause in the core package's declaration files, was crucial to reaching a resolution."

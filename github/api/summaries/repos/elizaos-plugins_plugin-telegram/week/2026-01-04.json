  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Weekly Report (Jan 4 - 10, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis was a quiet week for the Telegram plugin, with no new code contributions or pull requests. The primary activity centered on issue tracking, with the identification of a new bug. A user reported a significant crash involving a `TypeError` when the plugin attempts to process images uploaded natively as photos, which will require investigation in the coming weeks.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThere were no technical developments, features, or bug fixes merged this week. The codebase remains unchanged from the previous period.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe focus of the week was on identifying a new problem area rather than resolving existing ones.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.\n- **New & Active Issues:** A new bug was reported in issue [#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/23). The report details a `TypeError` that occurs in the `processImage` function, causing the plugin to crash when a user uploads an image \"as a photo\" instead of \"as a file\" through the Telegram client. There were no significant discussions on other active issues.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity and collaborative activity was minimal this week. No pull requests were opened for review, and there were no notable discussions on active issues, indicating a period of low development activity."

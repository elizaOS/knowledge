  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts centered on issue triage and architectural review, particularly concerning the data ingestion pipeline. No new code was merged; instead, the focus was on clarifying existing system capabilities. Two enhancement requests related to pipeline rate limiting and graceful shutdowns were closed after confirming the current implementation already addresses these needs. A new issue was opened to improve the user experience of sending images, identifying a path forward for hiding image URIs in messages.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThere were no new features, bug fixes, or code refactoring activities this week. Development was focused on reviewing existing functionality against open enhancement requests.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management was the primary activity, leading to a refinement of the project's backlog.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** Two issues related to the data ingestion pipeline were reviewed and closed, as the requested functionality was already present in the system.\n    - **Pipeline Rate Limit Management ([#156](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/156)):** This issue was closed as redundant. The existing GitHub client's built-in rate-limiting system, which includes a token bucket and automatic throttling, was deemed sufficient to prevent rate limit exhaustion.\n    - **Graceful Pipeline Shutdown ([#155](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/155)):** This enhancement was closed after determining that the pipeline's current process of continuously saving progress to its SQLite database already allows for graceful interruption and seamless resumption.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** A new issue was opened to address a usability problem with media sharing.\n    - **Telegram Image Sending ([#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/18)):** This issue highlights that sending an image currently forces its URI to be displayed in the message. A potential solution using `sendMessage` with `link_preview_options.url` was proposed to hide the URL while still rendering the image preview.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe activity this week was characterized by internal review and issue management rather than collaborative coding. The closing of issues [#155](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/155) and [#156](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/156) demonstrates a healthy process of auditing feature requests against the current state of the codebase."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-birdeye Weekly Report (Nov 2 - 8, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's development was centered on a significant architectural refactor to enhance the plugin's modularity and stability. The core logic was migrated to a config-driven `BirdeyeService`, which improves scalability and simplifies future enhancements. As part of this effort, new data providers for wallet portfolio, market overview, and multi-chain trending data were integrated, complete with caching. A critical bug fix was also implemented to ensure safe task scheduling and cleanup during initialization, preventing potential race conditions.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week focused on improving the plugin's foundational architecture and reliability.\n\n- **Plugin Service and Initialization Refactor**\n  A major refactoring effort introduced a dedicated `BirdeyeService` to manage the plugin's operations. The initialization process is now config-driven, allowing for more flexible and scalable configuration. This change also brought in new providers for key financial data, including wallet portfolio, market overview, and multi-chain trending information, with caching mechanisms to improve performance ([#6](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-birdeye/pull/6)).\n\n- **Task Management Bug Fix**\n  A stability issue was resolved by deferring Birdeye task cleanup and `BIRDEYE_SYNC_WALLET` registration until the runtime has fully initialized. This fix ensures that previous tasks are safely removed before new ones are scheduled, preventing conflicts and improving the reliability of the plugin's background processes ([#7](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-birdeye/pull/7)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported. There were no active issues with significant discussion during this period.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe provided development reports for this week did not contain information regarding community discussions, new contributors, or collaborative reviews on pull requests or issues."

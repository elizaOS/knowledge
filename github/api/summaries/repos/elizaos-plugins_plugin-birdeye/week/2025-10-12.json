  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-birdeye Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's development activity centered on a significant architectural refactor aimed at improving the plugin's core structure. A new pull request was introduced to make plugin initialization and service wiring config-driven. This change aligns with the ElizaOS philosophy of modularity and configurability, laying the groundwork for more flexible and scalable service integration in the future.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThe primary focus this week was on foundational architectural improvements rather than new features.\n\n- **Configuration-Driven Architecture:** A major refactoring effort was initiated in pull request [#6](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-birdeye/pull/6). This work aims to overhaul how the plugin initializes and wires up its providers, moving from a hardcoded approach to one driven by configuration files. The goal is to enhance modularity and make the plugin easier to configure and extend.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe issue tracker remained quiet this week, with no new issues opened or existing ones closed.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nBased on the available data, development this week was focused on the single architectural pull request. There is no information regarding specific community discussions or collaborative reviews from the provided reports."

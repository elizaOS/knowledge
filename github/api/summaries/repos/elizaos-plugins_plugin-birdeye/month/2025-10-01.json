A key pull request was introduced to refactor the plugin's core initialization and service wiring. This foundational work aims to create a more modular and configurable system by moving towards a config-driven service architecture, directly aligning with the ElizaOS principles of modularity and adaptability.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThe primary focus this month was on improving the plugin's internal structure for better long-term scalability and maintainability.\n\n- **Architectural Refactoring**\n  Work began on a foundational refactor of the plugin's architecture.

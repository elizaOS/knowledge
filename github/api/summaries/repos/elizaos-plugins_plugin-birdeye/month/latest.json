  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-birdeye Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nNovember's development focused on foundational architectural improvements for the Birdeye plugin. A significant refactoring effort introduced a config-driven service model, enhancing modularity and preparing the plugin for future scalability. This work included the integration of new data providers for wallet portfolio, market overview, and trending data. Alongside this refactor, a critical bug fix was implemented to stabilize the plugin's initialization process, ensuring task scheduling and cleanup operations are executed safely and without conflict.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving the plugin's core architecture and stability.\n\n- **Plugin Service and Initialization Refactor**\n  A major refactoring introduced a dedicated `BirdeyeService` to manage plugin logic, moving away from a monolithic structure. The initialization is now config-driven, allowing for greater flexibility. As part of this effort, new providers for wallet portfolio, market overview, and multi-chain trending data were integrated, complete with caching mechanisms to improve performance ([#6](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-birdeye/pull/6)).\n\n- **Task Management Bug Fix**\n  A bug affecting task management during startup was resolved. The fix defers the cleanup of old tasks and the registration of the `BIRDEYE_SYNC_WALLET` task until the runtime has fully initialized. This prevents race conditions and ensures a clean, predictable startup sequence ([#7](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-birdeye/pull/7)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, and there were no significant discussions on existing issues. The issue tracker remained quiet for the month.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe development activity recorded in November was focused on internal refactoring and bug fixes.

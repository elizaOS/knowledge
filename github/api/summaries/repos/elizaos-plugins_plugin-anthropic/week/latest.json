  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic Weekly Report (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's development focused on enhancing the plugin's text generation capabilities. The primary achievement was the integration of more granular controls for the Anthropic models, giving users greater influence over model output. This update introduced support for configurable Chain-of-Thought (CoT) budgets and the `topP` sampling parameter, directly aligning with the project's goal of creating adaptable and modular AI components.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on expanding the configuration options available for text generation.\n\n- **Enhanced Model Configuration**\n  A new feature was added to provide more sophisticated control over text generation. The plugin now supports configurable CoT budgets and the `topP` parameter, allowing for more precise tuning of model behavior. This enhancement was implemented through modifications to text handlers and the Anthropic client, as detailed in PR [#11](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/11).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nBased on the provided reports, there was no activity related to issues this week.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, and there were no significant discussions on existing issues.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe available reports for this week did not contain specific details regarding community discussions, reviews, or collaborative activities on pull requests or issues."

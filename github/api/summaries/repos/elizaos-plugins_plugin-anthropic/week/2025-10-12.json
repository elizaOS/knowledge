  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic Weekly Report (Oct 12 - 18, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts were concentrated on foundational code health and architectural improvements. The primary achievement was a significant refactoring of the plugin's core structure, enhancing modularity and future scalability in line with the ElizaOS philosophy. This structural work was complemented by a crucial bug fix that resolved TypeScript compilation errors, stabilizing the development environment and ensuring build reliability. Overall, the focus was on improving the codebase's maintainability and organization.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on improving the internal structure and developer experience of the plugin.\n\n- **Architectural Refactoring for Modularity**\n  A major effort was undertaken to improve the plugin's architecture by breaking apart the monolithic `index.ts` file. The codebase was reorganized into a more scalable, modular structure with dedicated directories for `models`, `providers`, and `utils`. This change makes the system easier to navigate and extend ([#9](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/9)).\n\n- **Build & Tooling Fixes**\n  A key bug causing TypeScript compilation failures related to Node.js environment variables was resolved. The fix involved adding `@types/node` as a development dependency and updating the `tsconfig.json` file, ensuring the build process is stable and predictable for all contributors ([#10](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/10)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe issue tracker remained quiet this week, with no new issues reported and no existing issues closed. There are currently no active issues with significant ongoing discussion.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe development reports for this period focused on code contributions, with no specific details on community discussions, new contributors, or collaborative reviews."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic Daily Update (Oct 12, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant code refactoring to improve modularity and maintainability, alongside a crucial bug fix for TypeScript compilation errors.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Plugin Architecture Refactoring\n- The monolithic `index.ts` file was split into a modular directory structure, enhancing organization and scalability.\n- Dedicated directories were created for `models` (with `text.ts` and `object.ts` handlers), `providers` (for the Anthropic client factory), and `utils` (for config and event handling). ([#9](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/9))\n\n### TypeScript Compilation Fixes\n- Added `@types/node` as a `devDependency` to resolve TypeScript compilation errors related to `process.env` usage.\n- Updated `tsconfig.json` to include `\"types\": [\"node\"]`, ensuring proper Node.js type definitions are available. ([#10](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/10))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

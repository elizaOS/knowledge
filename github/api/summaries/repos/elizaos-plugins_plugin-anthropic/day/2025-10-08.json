  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic Daily Update (Oct 8, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day's development focused on diagnosing and discussing a critical import resolution issue within the `@elizaos/core` package, specifically affecting version 1.6.1, with community members actively contributing to troubleshooting.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo new features, bug fixes, refactoring, documentation, or tests were added today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Investigation into `@elizaos/core` Import Resolution Issues [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/issues/6031)\nDiscussion continued regarding the \"Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61\" issue. @matteo-brandolino provided system details (Arch Linux, Node v24.9.0, Bun v1.2.22) and shared the output of `bun x tsc --noEmit`, which confirmed numerous `TS2305` errors indicating missing exports from `@elizaos/core`. @0xbbjoker suggested that the issue might be related to the IDE's TypeScript compiler, as they could not reproduce the problem in a fresh environment. @matteo-brandolino countered that the issue only appears with version 1.6.1 and not with earlier or later versions, suggesting a version-specific bug. @claude was tasked with diagnosing the issue and provided a detailed analysis, concluding that version 1.6.1 of `@elizaos/core` was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files, making it a build/publish pipeline issue specific to that version rather than a user environment problem. Recommendations included users upgrading to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later, and the ElizaOS team considering yanking v1.6.1 from npm."

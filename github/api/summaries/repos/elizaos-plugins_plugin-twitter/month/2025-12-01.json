  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Monthly Report (December 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nDevelopment in December focused on enhancing the stability and user experience of the Twitter plugin. A key bug fix was merged to ensure consistent behavior for post enablement settings. Concurrently, significant effort was put into identifying and documenting areas for future improvement, with several new issues opened related to agent conversation management, UI polish, and monorepo documentation. This work sets the stage for upcoming development cycles focused on improving agent interaction and overall usability.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThe primary development work recorded this month centered on bug fixes and maintaining core functionality.\n\n- **Posting Enablement Fix:** A bug was resolved to ensure that changes to posting enablement settings are applied immediately and consistently. This fix, implemented in `src/post.ts` and `src/services/twitter.service.ts`, improves the reliability of the agent's posting controls ([#42](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/42)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue triage this month highlighted key areas for improving the agent's chat interface and documentation.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were reported as closed in the provided data for December.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several important issues were opened, pointing to future work:\n    - **Agent Chat and Conversation Management:** Two issues were identified to improve the agent chat experience. One proposes opening the most recent conversation by default ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6281)), while another reports a bug where conversations are incorrectly duplicated when switching between agents ([#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6282)).\n    - **UI and Documentation:** Minor but important improvements were flagged, including a UI spacing issue with numbered lists ([#6283](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6283)) and a need to fix monorepo documentation ([#6284](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6284)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe provided reports for December did not contain specific details on community collaboration, such as PRs with high discussion volume or the activity of new contributors. The focus appeared to be on individual contributions for maintenance and issue reporting."

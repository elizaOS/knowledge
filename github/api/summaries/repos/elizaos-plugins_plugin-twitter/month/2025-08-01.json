  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nDevelopment in August focused on enhancing the stability and reliability of the plugin. Key efforts centered on resolving critical issues in the build and test pipeline, successfully fixing a persistent plugin publishing failure and addressing recurring test instabilities. Additionally, important user feedback was raised regarding the practical limitations and costs associated with the required Twitter API tiers, opening a discussion on improving accessibility for users.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWhile no new features were merged this month, significant work was done to improve the core developer experience and plugin reliability. The primary developments were captured in issue resolutions rather than new pull requests.\n\n*   **Build & Test Stability:** Foundational improvements were made to the plugin's core processes. A critical fix was implemented to correct a publishing failure caused by incorrect package scoping and outdated templates ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5754)). Stability was further enhanced by resolving persistent test failures through the proper implementation of WebSocket mocks, ensuring reliable and accurate test runs ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5770)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month concentrated on resolving blockers and capturing important user feedback for future development.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** Two significant issues were closed, directly improving the plugin's health.\n    *   **Plugin Publishing:** An issue preventing successful NPM publishing via the `elizaos publish` command was resolved by updating the package name and template files ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5754)).\n    *   **Test Failures:** A recurring problem with WebSocket-related tests was fixed by ensuring mocks were correctly initialized before service imports ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5770)).\n\n*   **New & Active Issues:** A key new issue was opened, highlighting a potential adoption blocker for users.\n    *   **API Tier Requirements:** A user raised concerns about the severe rate limits of Twitter's Free API Tier and the high cost of the Basic Tier, questioning if the plugin could be modified to be more conservative with API calls, such as making the initial home timeline fetch optional ([#40](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/40)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity interaction this month was highlighted by user-driven feedback. The opening of issue [#40](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/40) provided valuable insight into the real-world usability challenges related to Twitter's API costs and limitations, initiating an important conversation about the plugin's accessibility and configuration options."

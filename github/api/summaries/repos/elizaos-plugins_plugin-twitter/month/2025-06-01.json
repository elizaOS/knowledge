  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Monthly Report (June 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nDevelopment in June focused on issue triage and user support rather than new feature implementation. No new code was merged into the repository during this period. Key activities revolved around diagnosing and resolving user-reported problems, including an authentication issue caused by outdated dependencies and a newly reported bug preventing the plugin from replying to mentions. Significant effort was also dedicated to investigating complex, ongoing issues, suggesting a focus on stability and addressing foundational challenges within the broader ElizaOS ecosystem.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThere were no new features, bug fixes, or code refactoring efforts completed in the `plugin-twitter` repository during this reporting period. All development activity was concentrated on the investigation, discussion, and resolution of issues.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe project saw active engagement in issue management, with several key problems being addressed and new ones being identified.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n    - An authentication problem where the plugin incorrectly used password-based methods was resolved. The root cause was identified as an outdated version being used from the user's `node_modules` ([#28](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/28)).\n    - A proposal for a documentation overhaul ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5234)) and an issue regarding challenges in custom plugin development ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5260)) were also closed.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - A critical new bug was reported where the Twitter plugin fails to post replies to mentions or tags, despite being configured correctly ([#29](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/29)).\n    - Discussion continued on an issue where a custom plugin's callback is interfered with by the `ATTACHMENTS` provider. A detailed root cause analysis was provided, and a potential fix is being planned for a future release ([#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/4947)).\n    - Investigation into server API endpoints returning 404 errors ([#5230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5230)) concluded that the API is fully functional, with the errors likely stemming from user-side deployment or configuration issues rather than a code defect.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this month was centered on responsive troubleshooting and detailed issue analysis. The in-depth investigation by contributor `@claude` on issue [#5230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5230) provided a comprehensive diagnostic summary, demonstrating a commitment to supporting users with configuration-related problems. Similarly, the detailed analysis of the callback interference in issue [#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/4947) highlights a collaborative effort to diagnose and plan fixes for complex architectural challenges. The activity reflects a healthy interaction between users reporting issues and maintainers providing support."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Monthly Report (October 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nOctober was a month focused on enhancing both platform stability and core plugin functionality. Significant effort was dedicated to diagnosing and resolving two critical issues related to the ElizaOS CLI, ultimately improving the developer experience through dependency resolution and a new CLI release. In parallel, development on the Twitter plugin progressed with the standardization of message processing to align with platform patterns and the initiation of work to support media uploads. This dual focus on platform health and feature advancement characterized the month's progress.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving plugin architecture and introducing new capabilities.\n\n-   **Standardized Message Processing:** The plugin was updated to use `runtime.handleMessage()` for all message processing. This change, completed in PR [#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/44), aligns the Twitter plugin with the standard architectural pattern used across the ElizaOS ecosystem, promoting consistency and maintainability.\n-   **Automated Dependency Management:** To streamline future maintenance, a pull request was opened to add a Renovate configuration to the repository, automating the process of keeping dependencies up-to-date ([#43](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/43)).\n-   **New Media Upload Feature:** Work began on a significant new feature to enable media uploads via the Twitter-API-v2. A pull request ([#45](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/45)) was opened to implement this functionality.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe month saw active triage and resolution of critical CLI-related issues affecting the plugin's development environment.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    -   A complex import issue with Eliza CLI v1.6.1 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6031)) was thoroughly investigated and closed. After extensive discussion and diagnostics, it was determined that the type errors were not a persistent code bug but were likely caused by package resolution or caching problems. The issue was resolved for users after performing a clean reinstall of dependencies.\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   A module resolution error, \"Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'\" ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6088)), was reported by users after installing the ElizaOS CLI. The problem was quickly identified as a bundling issue in the published npm package. A new version of the CLI (1.6.3) was released, and users confirmed the fix after updating.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration was strong this month, particularly around troubleshooting platform-level issues.\n\n-   Issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6031) showcased a high degree of community collaboration. User `matteo-brandolino` provided detailed error logs and environment information, while maintainer `0xbbjoker` assisted with diagnostics.\n-   A notable aspect of the investigation into issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6031) was the involvement of the AI agent `@claude`, which was tasked with diagnosing the problem and provided a root cause analysis pointing to malformed type declaration files in a specific version of `@elizaos/core`.\n-   The swift resolution of the CLI bundling issue [#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6088) with a patch release demonstrated responsive maintenance and a commitment to addressing developer friction."

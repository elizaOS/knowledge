  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Daily Update (Oct 8, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day's activity focused on diagnosing and discussing a critical import issue within the Eliza CLI, specifically concerning `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo new features, bug fixes, refactoring, documentation, or tests were added today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Investigation into Eliza CLI Import Errors [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6031)\nDiscussion continued regarding the \"Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61\" issue. @matteo-brandolino provided further details, including a full `bun x tsc --noEmit` output showing 28 errors across 4 files, all related to missing exports from `@elizaos/core`. He suggested the problem might stem from malformed type definition files in `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1, noting that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the issue. @0xbbjoker confirmed that he could not reproduce the issue on his end with 1.6.1 after a fresh install and requested @matteo-brandolino's Node, Bun, and OS versions for further diagnosis. @matteo-brandolino later confirmed his environment details (Node v24.9.0, Bun 1.2.22, Arch Linux x86_64). The AI agent, @claude, was tasked to diagnose the issue and provided a detailed root cause analysis, concluding that version 1.6.1 of `@elizaos/core` was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files, making it a version-specific and environment-independent problem. Claude recommended users upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later and suggested the ElizaOS team consider deprecating v1.6.1."

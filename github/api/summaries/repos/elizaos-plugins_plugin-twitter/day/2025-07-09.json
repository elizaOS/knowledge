  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Daily Update (Jul 9, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw no direct code contributions to the `plugin-twitter` repository. The primary activity revolved around new issue creation, particularly concerning Twitter API rate limits and installation failures within the broader ElizaOS ecosystem.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\nNo direct technical developments or code changes were made to the `plugin-twitter` repository today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### Twitter API Rate Limit Concerns\nA new issue [#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/38) was opened reporting a \"Failed to fetch Home timeline\" error, specifically a 429 \"Too Many Requests\" API limit error, even when the search functionality was disabled. This suggests an underlying issue with how the plugin handles Twitter API calls, potentially leading to excessive requests.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Dependency Installation Failures\nIssue [#5482](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5482) \"Dependency installation failed with exit code 1\" remains active. The latest comments from `claude` provide a comprehensive troubleshooting guide for dependency installation within ElizaOS, emphasizing the strict requirement for `bun` as the package manager, Node.js version 23.3.0, and proper handling of git submodules. It also highlights platform-specific considerations, especially for Windows users requiring WSL 2. The discussion indicates a focus on ensuring the correct development environment setup to resolve installation issues.\n\n### Plugin Installation Failure on Windows\nIssue [#5500](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5500) \"plugin-google fails during project creation on Windows\" was opened and subsequently closed on the same day, referencing [#5503](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5503). This indicates a quick resolution or a duplicate issue regarding plugin installation failures specifically on Windows when creating a new project with ElizaOS and selecting the Google Generative AI provider."

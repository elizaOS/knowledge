  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Daily Update (Jul 7, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw the creation of a new issue regarding Twitter client creation failure. Active discussions continued on existing issues, particularly concerning plugin loading failures on Windows and Twitter client initialization errors, with community members reporting similar problems and offering insights.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\nNo new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### Twitter Client Creation Failure\nA new issue was reported concerning the failure to create a Twitter client after migrating an agent to V2 and updating the plugin to 1.0.14. Users are encountering an error despite successful authentication with the Twitter API v2. This issue appears to be a recurrence or a related problem to previously reported client initialization errors. [#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/36)\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Plugin Loading Failures on Windows\nDiscussions continued on the issue of `@elizaos/plugin-openai` and `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` failing to load on Windows. A user reproduced the issue and is actively researching a fix, providing screenshots to illustrate the problem. Another user confirmed the issue persists even with the 1.0.19 release and offered to provide more debugging information. [#5407](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5407)\n\n### Twitter Client Initialization Error\nThe ongoing issue of Twitter client initialization errors received further comments. A user reported that while the latest 1.0.14 `plugin-twitter` was intended to fix a previous error, it introduced a new one related to memory insertion during client creation. Other users continued to report the same client initialization error, indicating the problem is widespread and not fully resolved by recent updates. Concerns were raised about the ability to run agents autonomously on Twitter due to these persistent issues. [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31)"

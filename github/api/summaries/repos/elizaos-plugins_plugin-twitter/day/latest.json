The user initially reported errors when running `elizaos create` despite following documentation. After being asked for their ElizaOS version, the user confirmed they were using the latest (1.7.2) but still encountered issues, including when trying to get the CLI version. It was identified that the CLI wrapper was broken. A temporary workaround was provided: `bun -i g @elizaos/cli`. The issue was resolved for the user, and related fixes were implemented in the ElizaOS core ([#6389](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6389)) and documentation ([#83](https://github.com/elizaOS/docs/pull/83))."

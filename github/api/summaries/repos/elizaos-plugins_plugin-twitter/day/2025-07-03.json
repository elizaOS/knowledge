  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Daily Update (Jul 3, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's focus was on addressing existing issues, with significant progress made on client hot reloads and API endpoint verification. A new issue regarding deprecated Twitter plugin methods was also reported.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Deprecated Twitter Plugin Method\nA new issue was opened reporting an error where ElizaOS is calling an old, deprecated method of the Twitter plugin, `fetchSearchTweets`, instead of the recommended `searchTweets` generator. This is causing errors when fetching search tweets. ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/32))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Client Hot Reloads in Development\nThe issue regarding the lack of client hot reloads in the development environment ([#4889](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/4889)) was marked as done by @ChristopherTrimboli, indicating that this functionality has been implemented.\n\n### Server API Endpoint Verification\nDiscussions continued on the server API endpoint issue ([#5230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5230)). @claude provided a comprehensive analysis, concluding that the API implementation is fully functional and the reported 404 errors are likely due to deployment/configuration issues rather than missing endpoints. The analysis verified that all documented endpoints are properly implemented and that OpenAPI specifications and Postman collections are complete. @claude also provided a detailed list of likely root causes for 404 errors, including server initialization issues, environment configuration, port/network issues, and database problems, along with diagnostic steps and recommendations. This analysis was in response to @wtfsayo's request for verification against current OpenAPI specs and Postman files. Earlier, @iQiexie pointed out discrepancies in documentation regarding message sending parameters and a non-existent endpoint, which @ChristopherTrimboli addressed by stating that the ElizaOS API documentation was fully updated with the latest 1.0.10 APIs.\n\n### CLI Input Method Consistency\nRegarding the migration of CLI input methods to use `@clack/prompts` for consistency ([#5295](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5295)), @SYMBaiEX requested @wtfsayo to review PR #5359, indicating ongoing work on this task. Previously, @wtfsayo had given permission to @Ifechukwudaniel to work on the issue and send a PR.\n\n### Twitter Client Initialization Error\nUsers continue to report issues with Twitter client initialization ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31)). @Ovodo expressed concern about the inability to make agents run autonomously on Twitter due to this error, noting that an older method of authentication worked previously. @nccuong-vikki suggested that the issue might be related to limitations of free subscriptions preventing fetching the Home Timeline. @myst4 also reported experiencing the same problem."

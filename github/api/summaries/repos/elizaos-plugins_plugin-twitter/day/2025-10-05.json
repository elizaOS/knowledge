  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Daily Update (Oct 5, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw no direct code changes or feature additions. The primary activity involved the creation of a new pull request to add Renovate configuration, and ongoing discussion on an active issue regarding import errors with Eliza CLI 1.61.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\nNo new technical developments were completed today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request was opened to add Renovate configuration to the repository, aiming to automate dependency updates [#43](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/43).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.61 [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6031)\nDiscussion continued regarding import errors in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61. The user `matteo-brandolino` suggested the issue might stem from missing type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically referencing non-existent `src` directories in `dist/index.d.ts` and `dist/types/index.d.ts`. They noted that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the problem. `0xbbjoker` requested `matteo-brandolino` to run `bun x tsc --noEmit` to further diagnose, suspecting an IDE TSC compiler issue. `matteo-brandolino` provided the output of `bun x tsc --noEmit`, which showed 28 errors across 4 files, primarily indicating that numerous members like `logger`, `IAgentRuntime`, `Project`, `Character`, `UUID`, `Plugin`, `Action`, `ActionResult`, `Content`, `GenerateTextParams`, `HandlerCallback`, `Memory`, `ModelType`, `Provider`, `ProviderResult`, `Service`, and `State` are not exported from `@elizaos/core`. The user also questioned if the issue was with their IDE's TSC compiler, given that previous and later versions of Eliza CLI do not exhibit the same problem."

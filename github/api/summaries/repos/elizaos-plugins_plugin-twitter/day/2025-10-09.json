  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Daily Update (Oct 9, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw the resolution of a critical import issue affecting Eliza CLI 1.61, confirming that a clean reinstall or upgrade to newer versions of `@elizaos/core` resolves the problem. A new feature PR was also opened to enhance message processing.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/44), was opened to implement `runtime.handleMessage()` for message processing, indicating a potential feature enhancement for how the plugin interacts with the ElizaOS runtime.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n### Resolution of Eliza CLI 1.61 Import Errors\nIssue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6031), concerning \"Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61,\" was closed. The resolution confirmed that the type errors were resolved after a clean reinstall of dependencies or by creating a fresh project, suggesting the issue was related to package resolution rather than a specific code bug.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6031))\nThe discussion on this issue concluded with confirmation that the type errors experienced with Eliza CLI 1.61 are no longer occurring after a clean reinstall of dependencies or creating a fresh project. The user `matteo-brandolino` reported that both approaches now work correctly. `wtfsayo` acknowledged this, suggesting that such errors can often be attributed to node/package type resolution issues and that no specific fix was implemented on their end. This indicates that the problem was likely environmental or related to cached dependencies rather than a persistent bug in the ElizaOS core."

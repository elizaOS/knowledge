  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Daily Update (Jul 12, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, the primary focus was on resolving a critical issue preventing the creation of the Twitter Client, which has now been successfully addressed.\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\nNo new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n### Twitter Client Initialization Fixed\nThe issue where users were unable to create a Twitter Client, specifically with version 1.0.14, has been resolved. This problem was reported by multiple users attempting to migrate their agents to V2. The fix is available with the 1.2.0 update. ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/36))\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Timeline Fetching and API Rate Limits\nDiscussions continue around the issue of failing to fetch the Home timeline, leading to 429 API limit errors, even when the search is disabled. Users are reporting that this issue persists with version 1.2.16, which was intended to introduce a new system for timeline fetching. There's an ongoing conversation about whether a \"PRO\" or \"Basic\" Twitter subscription tier is required to avoid these rate limits, with one user confirming that the $200/month \"Basic\" tier works. The rate limit for this tier is being questioned. ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/38))"

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Daily Update (Oct 23, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe Twitter plugin saw a key feature addition today, standardizing message processing across the ElizaOS platform. An important CLI issue was also resolved, improving the developer experience.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Standardized Message Processing\nThe Twitter plugin now consistently uses `runtime.handleMessage()` for message processing, aligning with the established pattern across all ElizaOS platform plugins. This ensures uniformity and maintainability. ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/44))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#45](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/45), has been opened to enable the upload of media data using the Twitter-API-v2.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### CLI Module Resolution Error\nIssue [#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6088), \"Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code' after installing elizaOS CLI,\" was actively discussed and resolved today. Users reported encountering this error after installing the ElizaOS CLI. The issue was identified as a bundling problem in the published npm package.

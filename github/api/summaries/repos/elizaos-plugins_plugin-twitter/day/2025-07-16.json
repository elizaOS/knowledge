  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Daily Update (Jul 16, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw no new code contributions or pull requests. A new issue was opened regarding a Twitter error with the SQL database. Active discussions continued on agent communication without polling and custom plugin schema migration issues, with detailed solutions proposed by Claude.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Twitter Integration Errors\nA new issue [#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/39) was reported concerning a Twitter error related to the SQL database, specifically an `insert into \"memories\"` query failure.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Agent-to-Agent Communication Enhancements\nDiscussion on [#5584](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5584) focused on forwarding messages between agents without polling. @claude provided a comprehensive solution by implementing a new OpenAI-compatible `/api/openai/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. This solution aims to enable direct, synchronous agent-to-agent communication, bypassing the message bus and supporting streaming. Key features include OpenAI compatibility, direct agent access via `X-Agent-ID` header, and no polling requirement.\n\n### Custom Plugin Schema Migration Challenges\nThe issue [#5588](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5588) regarding custom plugin schema migration issues received a detailed analysis from @claude. The root causes were identified as the `DatabaseMigrationService` not being registered as a runtime service and improper plugin schema integration. Solutions proposed include ensuring proper plugin schema structure, declaring plugin dependencies, and server-level plugin registration. Workarounds like manual database schema creation or modifying server initialization were also suggested.\n\n### Twitter Client Initialization Errors\nIssue [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31) continues to be active, with users reporting \"Twitter Client Initialization Error\" despite successful authentication. The error message indicates a failure to insert into the \"memories\" table. Users @yasir23 and @joaoCarvalho1000 reported experiencing the same issue. Previous comments suggested that plugin version 1.0.14 might fix some issues but introduced new ones related to database queries."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Daily Update (Dec 24, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on a minor bug fix related to consistent handling of posting enablement. Several new issues were opened, covering agent chat behavior, UI spacing, and monorepo documentation.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Posting Enablement Consistency\nA bug fix was implemented to ensure consistent handling of posting enablement, specifically addressing the immediate application of settings. This involved changes in `src/post.ts` and `src/services/twitter.service.ts`. ([#42](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/42))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Agent Chat and Conversation Management\nTwo new issues were opened concerning agent chat functionality. One addresses the need for opening the most recent conversation when accessing an agent from \"My Agents/Dashboard\" ([#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6281)). The other highlights a problem where conversations with one agent are duplicated on another when switching between them ([#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6282)).\n\n### User Interface and Documentation Improvements\nTwo additional issues were created. One reports issues with spacing in numbered items within the UI ([#6283](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6283)). The other aims to fix monorepo documentation ([#6284](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6284)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues had more than 3 comments today."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Daily Update (Jul 2, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw the resolution of several issues related to CLI testing consistency and initial plugin setup, alongside the emergence of a new critical bug concerning Twitter client initialization.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### CLI Test Command Improvements\nAn issue regarding inconsistent `bun run test` behavior across packages was resolved, ensuring a more reliable developer experience for running tests within individual packages. This fix addresses [#5218](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5218).\n\n### Initial Plugin Setup and Configuration\nSeveral issues related to the initial setup and configuration of the plugin were addressed. This includes clarifying environment variable requirements like `LOAD_DOCS_ON_STARTUP` and `CTX_KNOWLEDGE_ENABLED`, and identifying a potential issue with dynamic providers. This work is captured in [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Twitter Client Initialization Error\nA new critical issue has been reported where users are experiencing a \"client initialization error\" despite successful authentication with the Twitter API. This prevents agents from running autonomously on Twitter. This problem is detailed in [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### CLI Test Command Monorepo Requirement\nDiscussion continues on [#5142](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5142) regarding the `@elizaos/cli` test command incorrectly requiring a monorepo root for standalone projects. While a user indicated it was fixed, a request was made for an investigation to confirm its current validity.\n\n### Event Message Sent Not Working\nThe issue of `EventType.MESSAGE_SENT` not being emitted by `sendAgentResponseToBus` when sending payloads to the central server API endpoint is still active in [#5216](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5216). A user asked if the bootstrap plugin was added.\n\n### CLI Input Method Consistency\nThe migration of remaining CLI input methods to use `@clack/prompts` for consistency, tracked in [#5295](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5295), is ongoing. A user requested to be assigned to the issue and was encouraged to work on it and submit a PR."

Alongside this refactoring, there was a strong focus on improving the developer experience through enhancements to testing infrastructure and CLI consistency. However, progress was challenged by the emergence of a critical client initialization error that is currently preventing agents from operating autonomously on Twitter. Community engagement was high, with contributors actively tackling documentation, testing, and usability issues.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThis week's development focused on modernizing the plugin's core and its supporting tools.\n\n- **Twitter API v2 Migration & Code Cleanup:** A substantial refactoring effort was completed to finalize the migration from unofficial GraphQL endpoints to the official Twitter API v2. This cleanup streamlined the plugin by removing over 3,500 lines of legacy code, primarily from the `src/client`, `src/services`, and `src/utils` directories, enhancing overall maintainability ([#33](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/33)).\n\n- **Testing Infrastructure Modernization:** Foundational work began to improve the plugin's testing framework. A new issue was opened to address test coverage ([#34](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/34)), proposing a switch from Vitest to Bun to align with ElizaOS standards. A pull request was subsequently opened to implement this migration ([#35](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/35)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe week saw the resolution of developer experience issues, but also the introduction of a critical new bug and other technical debt.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** An issue causing inconsistent behavior with the `bun run test` command across different packages was resolved, creating a more reliable testing experience for developers ([#5218](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5218)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - **Critical Blocker:** A new, high-priority issue emerged where users face a \"client initialization error\" despite successful authentication ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31]). This bug prevents agents from running autonomously on Twitter and is a key focus.\n    - **Technical Debt:** New issues were identified highlighting technical debt, including an unused `TWITTER_MAX_INTERACTIONS_PER_RUN` environment variable ([#30](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/30)) and a call to a deprecated `fetchSearchTweets` method within ElizaOS ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/32)).\n    - **Ongoing Efforts:** Work continues on migrating CLI input methods to `@clack/prompts` for consistency, with a pull request now under review ([#5295](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5295)). Discussions also progressed on a major documentation overhaul to create separate tracks for users and developers ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5234)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe community was highly active this week, with several contributors stepping up to claim tasks and drive discussions forward.\n\n- **Proactive Contributions:** Contributors @ai16z-demirix and @Ifechukwudaniel actively requested assignment to key issues related to testing consistency ([#5218](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5218)), documentation overhaul ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5234)), and CLI improvements ([#5295](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5295)).\n- **In-depth Analysis:** In a discussion about server API endpoints ([#5230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5230)), @claude provided a comprehensive analysis that helped distinguish between code defects and configuration issues, providing clear diagnostic steps for the community.\n- **Community Projects:** @bealers offered to contribute their \"elizify\" project to make production deployments easier, demonstrating a commitment to improving the broader ElizaOS ecosystem ([#5244](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5244))."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week saw no new code contributions, with development efforts focused entirely on issue triage and architectural planning. A recurring database error related to the `memories` table emerged as a key challenge, highlighted by a new issue ([#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/39)) and ongoing reports in an existing one ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31)). Significant progress was made in discussions on core architectural problems, with comprehensive solutions proposed for agent-to-agent communication ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5584)) and custom plugin schema migration ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5588)).\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThere were no new features, bug fixes, or other code changes this week. All development activity was concentrated on analyzing and discussing existing issues. No pull requests were opened or merged.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were resolved or closed this week.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** The primary focus was on diagnosing and discussing existing problems.\n    - **Database Integration Errors:** A significant trend this week is a recurring SQL error. A new issue, [#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/39), was opened concerning a failure on an `insert into \"memories\"` query. This problem is also the subject of the active issue [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31), where multiple users confirmed experiencing the \"Twitter Client Initialization Error\" linked to the same database operation.\n    - **Architectural Discussions:**\n        - In [#5584](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5584), a detailed proposal was put forward by @claude to enable direct, synchronous agent-to-agent communication by implementing a new OpenAI-compatible endpoint, aiming to eliminate the need for polling.\n        - For issue [#5588](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5588), @claude provided an in-depth analysis of custom plugin schema migration failures, identifying root causes and proposing solutions related to service registration and plugin dependencies.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nWhile there were no code contributions, community interaction was centered on issue discussions. Contributor @claude played a key role by providing comprehensive analyses and potential solutions for complex architectural issues [#5584](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5584) and [#5588](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5588). Additionally, users @yasir23 and @joaoCarvalho1000 actively participated in issue [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31) by reporting their experiences with the Twitter client initialization error, helping to confirm the scope of the problem."

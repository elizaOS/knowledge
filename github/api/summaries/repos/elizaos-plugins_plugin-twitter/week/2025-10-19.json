  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's development focused on improving platform consistency and developer experience. The Twitter plugin was updated to use the standard `runtime.handleMessage()` function, aligning it with other ElizaOS plugins for better maintainability. A significant CLI installation issue that was blocking developers was identified and resolved with a new package release. Additionally, work has begun on a new feature to enable media uploads, expanding the plugin's capabilities.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n### Platform Standardization\nTo ensure uniformity and maintainability across the ElizaOS ecosystem, the plugin was updated to consistently use `runtime.handleMessage()` for all message processing. This refactoring effort ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/44)) aligns the Twitter plugin with the established pattern used by other platform plugins.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n### Closed Issues\nA critical developer experience issue was resolved this week.\n- **CLI Module Resolution Error ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6088)):** Users reported a \"Cannot find module\" error after installing the `@elizaos/cli` package. The root cause was identified as a bundling problem in the published npm package. A new version of the CLI (1.6.3) was released, and users confirmed the fix resolved the installation error.\n\n### New & Active Issues\nWhile no new issues were formally opened, a pull request was submitted that represents significant future work:\n- **Media Uploads ([#45](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/45)):** A new pull request is now under review to enable the upload of media data using the `Twitter-API-v2`.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe resolution of the CLI installation bug ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6088)) highlighted a healthy feedback loop between the project's users and maintainers. Users reported the problem, a fix was promptly released, and the community confirmed the resolution. Furthermore, the standardization of message handling ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/44)) demonstrates a commitment to the overall architectural integrity of the ElizaOS platform, reflecting strong cross-project awareness."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Weekly Report (Dec 21 - 27, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's activity centered on maintenance and identifying areas for improvement. A key bug fix was merged to enhance the reliability of the plugin's posting functionality. While no major features were introduced, a significant effort was made to document new issues, particularly concerning agent chat behavior, UI consistency, and monorepo documentation. This sets the stage for upcoming development cycles focused on improving user experience and core agent interactions.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nDevelopment work this week was focused on a targeted bug fix to improve stability.\n\n- **Posting Functionality Bug Fix:** A fix was implemented to ensure the consistent and immediate application of posting enablement settings. This resolves a bug where changes to posting permissions were not applied correctly without a delay. The work, tracked in PR [#42](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/42), involved modifications to `src/post.ts` and `src/services/twitter.service.ts`.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe focus this week was on issue identification, with several new tickets opened and no issues closed.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Four new issues were opened, highlighting key areas for future work:\n    - **Agent Chat Behavior:** Two related issues were created to improve the agent conversation experience. [#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6281) proposes opening the most recent conversation by default, while [#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6282) reports a bug where conversations are duplicated when switching between agents.\n    - **UI and Documentation:** Improvements to the user interface and project documentation were also flagged. [#6283](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6283) addresses minor UI spacing inconsistencies, and [#6284](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6284) calls for fixes to the monorepo documentation.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nBased on the available data, this was a quiet week for direct collaboration. Activity was characterized by individual contributions, with one developer merging a bug fix and several new issues being logged to outline future tasks. There were no new pull requests opened or significant discussions on active issues, indicating a period of stabilization and planning."

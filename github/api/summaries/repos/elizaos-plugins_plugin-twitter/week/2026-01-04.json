  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Weekly Report (Jan 4 - 10, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week, the `plugin-twitter` repository focused on a major security and architectural upgrade to its authentication flow. The primary achievement was the implementation of OAuth2 PKCE support, which modernizes how AI agents interact with the Twitter/X platform. This update aligns with the project's core philosophy of autonomy and security by enabling a more robust \"login + approve\" flow without compromising existing configurations.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Authentication & Security Enhancements\nThe week's technical focus was centered on transitioning to more secure authentication standards while maintaining the modularity required for diverse agent deployments.\n\n*   **OAuth2 PKCE Implementation:** The team introduced support for 3-legged authentication using OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE). This is a significant security milestone as it allows for secure authentication without the need to ship or store a client secret. \n*   **Backward Compatibility:** A key priority of this refactor was ensuring that the new OAuth2 flow remains fully compatible with the existing OAuth 1.0a environment variable setups, preventing breaking changes for current users.\n*   **System-Wide Integration:** This update required extensive modifications across authentication providers and related client components to ensure a seamless transition to the new protocol ([#46](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/46)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No specific issues were closed during this period, as the primary focus was on the major feature rollout in PR [#46](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/46).\n*   **New & Active Issues:** There were no new issues reported or significant discussions on active issues during this timeframe, indicating a stable period of development focused on the core authentication upgrade.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe development activity this week was concentrated on the major authentication refactor. The implementation of PR [#46](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/46) involved significant changes to the core client logic, reflecting a high-impact contribution to the project's infrastructure. The focus on maintaining backward compatibility demonstrates a commitment to the existing user base while pushing the framework toward more modern, decentralized-friendly security standards."

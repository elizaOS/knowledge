  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Weekly Report (Jul 6 - 12, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week was focused on addressing critical stability and functionality issues within the Twitter plugin. The most significant achievement was resolving a widespread bug that prevented Twitter client creation, unblocking users migrating to Agent V2. However, the project continues to face challenges with new and persistent issues, including severe Twitter API rate limiting errors and inconsistent posting behavior. Community engagement was high, with users actively reporting detailed bugs and contributing to diagnostics, particularly around cross-platform installation failures in the broader ElizaOS ecosystem.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nNo new features, bug fixes, or code changes were merged into the repository this week. The primary development was the release of version 1.2.0, which contained the fix for the critical Twitter client initialization failure.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe week's activity was heavily concentrated on identifying and resolving user-reported issues.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  - **Twitter Client Creation Fixed:** The most critical issue of the week, the failure to create a Twitter client after migrating to Agent V2 ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/36)), was resolved and closed. The fix was delivered in the 1.2.0 update.\n  - A Windows-specific installation failure for the Google plugin ([#5500](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5500)) was also quickly closed, indicating a swift resolution or consolidation with another issue.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - **API Rate Limits:** A major new blocker emerged with users hitting \"429 Too Many Requests\" errors when fetching the home timeline, even with search disabled ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/38)). Discussions suggest this persists in recent versions and may require a paid Twitter API subscription, raising questions about the plugin's usability on free tiers.\n  - **Plugin Reliability:** A new issue was opened concerning inconsistent plugin functionality, where agents post an initial burst of tweets and then stop, despite various configuration attempts ([#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/37)).\n  - **Ecosystem & Installation:** Discussions continued on broader installation problems, particularly on Windows ([#5407](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5407)). A detailed troubleshooting guide was provided in a related issue ([#5482](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5482)), emphasizing strict environment requirements like `bun`, a specific Node.js version, and WSL 2 for Windows users.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity collaboration was central to this week's progress, with users providing crucial, detailed bug reports that drove the development focus. The discussions around client initialization errors ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/31), [#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/36)) and API rate limits ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/38)) demonstrated active user engagement in diagnosing problems. Furthermore, the comprehensive troubleshooting guide posted by `claude` in response to dependency installation failures ([#5482](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5482)) highlights a responsive effort to help users navigate complex environment setups."

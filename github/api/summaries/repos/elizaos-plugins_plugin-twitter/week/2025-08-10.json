  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Weekly Report (Aug 10 - 16, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts centered on enhancing the stability and reliability of the plugin's development lifecycle. Two critical issues that were hindering progress were resolved: one preventing successful plugin publishing to npm and another causing persistent test failures. These fixes unblock developers and improve the integrity of our testing pipeline. Concurrently, a significant new issue was raised concerning the practical usability of the plugin due to Twitter's API rate limits and associated costs, highlighting a potential challenge for users.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week focused exclusively on resolving foundational issues to ensure a stable development and deployment environment.\n\n- **Plugin Publishing and Testing Stability:** A significant effort was made to address core infrastructure problems. A critical bug was fixed where the publish command would report success while failing to publish to npm, which was traced back to incorrect package naming and outdated templates ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5754)). Additionally, recurring test failures were resolved by correcting the setup order for WebSocket mocks, ensuring they are initialized before service imports to prevent attempts at real network connections during tests ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5770)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe issue tracker saw important activity focused on resolving blockers and identifying future challenges.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** Two major blockers were closed, significantly improving the developer experience.\n    - **Plugin Publishing Failures ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5754)):** Resolved the critical issue where plugins failed to publish. The fix involved updating the package name to be unscoped and aligning the `package.json` with the current plugin template.\n    - **Test Stability ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5770)):** Addressed persistent test failures by ensuring WebSocket mocks are correctly configured before being used by the service, leading to more reliable test runs.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** A key new concern was brought to light regarding the plugin's interaction with the Twitter API.\n    - **Twitter API Rate Limiting ([#40](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/40)):** This new issue highlights that avoiding rate-limiting errors requires a paid Basic Tier subscription. It questions the necessity of fetching the home timeline at startup, as this action consumes a significant portion of the API quota, posing a potential cost and usability barrier for users.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe resolution of active issues demonstrated effective collaboration. The discussions in both [#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5754) and [#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5770) involved detailed guidance from maintainers and confirmation from the issue reporters once the fixes were successfully implemented. Notably, one user praised Eliza's \"ASK AI\" documentation as being \"superior to GPT-5\" during the debugging process for the WebSocket issue."

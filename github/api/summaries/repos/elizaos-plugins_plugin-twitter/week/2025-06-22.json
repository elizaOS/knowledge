  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter Weekly Report (Jun 22 - 28, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts were centered on issue triage and diagnostics rather than new code contributions. The community was active in reporting and analyzing key functional problems, including a failure in the plugin's reply-to-mention capability and an authentication issue caused by outdated dependencies. Significant diagnostic work was completed on long-standing issues, with a detailed analysis suggesting a server endpoint problem is likely environmental, not a code defect. Discussions also progressed on a core architectural issue where a provider interferes with custom plugin callbacks, with a potential fix targeted for a future release.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThere were no new features, bug fixes, or other code changes merged into the repository this week. All development activity was focused on the investigation and discussion of existing and newly reported issues. No new pull requests were opened.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe week saw a focus on resolving user-reported problems and investigating complex interactions between the plugin and the core framework.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n    - **Authentication & Configuration:** An issue where the plugin attempted to use password authentication instead of API keys was resolved. The root cause was identified as an outdated version being used from `node_modules` ([#28](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/28)).\n    - **Framework & Documentation:** Issues related to a documentation overhaul proposal ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5234)) and challenges with custom plugin development ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5260)) were also closed.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - **New Plugin Bug:** A critical new issue was reported where the Twitter plugin fails to reply to mentions or tags, despite being configured correctly and showing no errors ([#29](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/29)).\n    - **Server Endpoint Investigation:** Discussion continued on 404 errors from \"server\" API endpoints. A comprehensive analysis concluded that the API implementation is complete and the errors are likely due to deployment or configuration issues, not missing code ([#5230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5230)).\n    - **Core Framework Conflict:** An active discussion on a custom plugin's callback being overridden by the `ATTACHMENTS` provider progressed with a detailed root cause analysis. A fix is being considered for v1.2.4 to better isolate provider state from action callbacks ([#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/4947)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration was evident in the detailed diagnostic efforts this week. In issue [#5230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5230), the interaction between `@wtfsayo` and `@claude` led to a thorough investigation that helps differentiate between a code defect and an environmental problem. The new issues reported by users ([#28](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/28), [#29](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/29)) highlight an active feedback loop between the user community and the development team."

  "content": "# elizaos/docs Monthly Report (January 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nJanuary was a transformative month for the ElizaOS documentation, marked by a massive expansion that increased content coverage from 60% to 95%. The primary focus was on maturing the framework's educational resources, specifically targeting developer pain points in real-time communication and agent memory configuration. By bridging these gaps, the project has significantly lowered the barrier to entry for building extensible, modular AI agents within the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Documentation Expansion & Coverage\nThe documentation underwent a comprehensive overhaul to ensure a more complete and user-friendly experience for developers.\n*   **Core Coverage Increase:** A major initiative successfully brought documentation coverage to near-completion (95%), involving updates to the character interface, plugin architecture, and the plugin registry ([#81](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/81)).\n*   **Real-Time Communication:** New technical guides were introduced for streaming responses, specifically covering Server-Sent Events (SSE) and WebSockets via `guides/streaming-responses.mdx` ([#81](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/81)).\n*   **Reference Material:** Significant technical depth was added to the `rest-reference/messaging` and `cli-reference` sections, providing developers with more granular control over agent interactions and command-line operations ([#81](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/81)).\n\n### Agent Configuration & Engagement\nEfforts were made to improve the clarity of agent behavior and interface documentation.\n*   **Interface Refinement:** Updates to `agents/character-interface.mdx` and various architectural documents were implemented to make the documentation more engaging and easier to navigate ([#81](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/81)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n### New & Active Issues\nThe project is actively identifying areas where users struggle with agent autonomy and recall.\n*   **Agent Memory Configuration:** A critical new issue was opened to address difficulties users face when configuring agent memory. This upcoming work will focus on creating dedicated guides for the \"knowledge\" and \"lore\" sections within the agent JSON files, directly responding to feedback gathered from the community Discord ([#82](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/82)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this month was characterized by a strong feedback loop between the user community and the documentation maintainers. The identification of the need for better memory configuration documentation ([#82](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/82)) originated from active discussions on Discord, demonstrating a responsive development cycle. The massive push in PR [#81](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/81) indicates a highly productive period of internal review and content synthesis to meet the project's goal of providing a professional-grade resource for the open-source AI community."

  "content": "# elizaos/docs Monthly Report (October 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nOctober was a pivotal month for improving the developer experience and documentation clarity for ElizaOS. Efforts focused on restructuring core content, responding to critical user-reported bugs, and expanding guides for advanced use cases. Key achievements include the consolidation of builder resources into a new \"Launch Resources\" page and a project-wide renaming of the \"API Reference\" to \"REST Reference\" for better accuracy. The team also demonstrated rapid response to community feedback by fixing significant issues in the CLI and plugin scaffolding process, reinforcing the project's commitment to a healthy feedback loop.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month centered on structural enhancements, new content, and user experience improvements.\n\n- **Documentation Restructuring and Clarity**\n  A major effort was undertaken to make the documentation more intuitive and accessible. The \"API Reference\" was systematically renamed to \"REST Reference\" across all relevant sections to more accurately describe the content ([#75](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/75)). A new \"Launch Resources\" page was created to consolidate essential builder information directly into the docs, streamlining access for developers ([#76](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/76)). A \"new\" tag was later added to highlight this section ([#79](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/79)).\n\n- **New Deployment and Payment Guides**\n  To support more advanced implementations, work began on new comprehensive guides. A pull request was opened to add documentation for integrating x402 payments and deploying with Nginx, addressing key needs for production environments ([#77](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/77)).\n\n- **User Experience and Maintenance**\n  Several updates focused on improving the user journey. A prominent call-to-action to join the project's Discord was added to the site to foster community engagement ([#78](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/78)). Additionally, broken links within the plugin registry documentation were resolved, preventing 404 errors and ensuring smooth navigation for users exploring plugins ([#74](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/74)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThis month saw active engagement on critical issues, driven directly by user feedback.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  No issues were formally closed in the provided reports.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  Two significant issues were highlighted and addressed in October:\n  - **CLI Installation Module Error ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6088)):** Users reported a `Cannot find module` error after installing the CLI via npm. The root cause was identified as a bundling issue, and a fix was promptly released in version 1.6.3, with users confirming the resolution.\n  - **Plugin Documentation Inaccuracies ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6070)):** A user reported that inaccuracies in the plugin documentation, including incorrect CLI command syntax, were preventing successful plugin scaffolding. The issues were analyzed and fixes were implemented to correct the commands and add fallback paths for templates.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration was a strong theme this month, with a clear feedback loop between users and maintainers. The resolution of issues [#6088](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6088) and [#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6070) demonstrates the project's responsiveness to community-reported problems, turning user frustration into actionable improvements. The engagement on issue [#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6070), where a user's detailed report led to a deep analysis and fix, exemplifies a healthy and productive open-source dynamic. The deliberate addition of a more prominent Discord CTA ([#78](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/78)) further underscores the project's focus on growing and supporting its contributor and user community."

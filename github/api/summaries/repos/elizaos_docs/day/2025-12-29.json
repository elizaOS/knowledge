A community member, om1d-sa, provided advice on two potential solutions:\n*   Importing a cold wallet's seed phrase into a hot wallet like Phantom for self-migration.\n*   Joining the official Discord server and using the ticket system for manual migration, emphasizing verification of official support team members."

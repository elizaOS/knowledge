  "content": "# elizaos/docs Daily Update (Jan 25, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on a crucial documentation enhancement, updating the CLI installation command to ensure users can correctly set up ElizaOS. This directly addressed a user-reported issue regarding project generation.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Documentation Updates\nThe CLI installation command in the documentation was updated to use the correct scoped package name, resolving issues with project generation for new users. This improvement is detailed in [#83](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/83).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### CLI Installation and Project Generation\nA critical issue, [#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6388), reporting an inability to generate projects due to an incorrect CLI installation command, was closed today. The issue was resolved by updating the documentation.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Project Generation Failure and CLI Installation Guidance\nIssue [#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6388), \"Can not generate project,\" was actively discussed and resolved today. The user initially reported errors when running `elizaos create` after following the documentation. After some troubleshooting, including checking the ElizaOS version, a temporary workaround was provided by `standujar` to use `bun -i g @elizaos/cli` due to a broken wrapper. Subsequently, `standujar` also linked to a pull request ([#83](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/83)) that addressed the documentation update, and the user confirmed the fix was working."

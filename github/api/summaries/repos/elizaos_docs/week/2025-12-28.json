  "content": "# elizaos/docs Weekly Report (Dec 28 - 3, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis was a quiet week for code contributions, with the primary focus shifting to documentation and community support. No new features or bug fixes were merged. The main activities included the submission of a new pull request aimed at updating documentation and continued community-led troubleshooting on a key migration issue. This period highlights a focus on refining existing resources and supporting users through active challenges.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nBased on the available reports, no pull requests were completed or merged this week. However, work has begun on documentation improvements, as evidenced by a newly opened pull request.\n\nA new pull request, [#81](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/81), was opened to update project documentation, though it has not yet been merged.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this week centered on addressing existing user problems rather than closing tickets or introducing new ones.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week according to the provided data.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened. Discussion continued on the active issue [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6211), which concerns user difficulties with the AI16Z to ElizaOS migration. The specific challenges reported are a Snapshot Eligibility Issue and the lack of support for the Tangem Wallet.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was evident in the active discussion surrounding issue [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6211). Community member `om1d-sa` provided significant support by suggesting two potential workarounds for the user's migration problem:\n1.  Importing the cold wallet's seed phrase into a supported hot wallet like Phantom to perform a self-migration.\n2.  Contacting the official support team via the Discord server's ticket system for a manual migration.\n\nThis interaction demonstrates valuable peer-to-peer support within the ElizaOS community, helping users navigate complex issues."

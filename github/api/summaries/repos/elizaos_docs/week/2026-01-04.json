  "content": "# elizaos/docs Weekly Report (Jan 4 - 10, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week was marked by a monumental push in documentation, dramatically increasing content coverage from approximately 60% to 95%. This effort, consolidated in a single major pull request, introduced crucial new guides on topics like streaming responses and significantly expanded the REST API and CLI reference sections. The week also highlighted a healthy feedback loop with the community, as user discussions directly led to the creation of a new issue to improve documentation for agent memory configuration.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThe primary focus this week was a comprehensive expansion and refinement of the project's documentation.\n\n- **Massive Documentation Expansion:** A significant effort was completed to enhance documentation clarity, user engagement, and overall coverage. This initiative added substantial new content and improved existing guides. The work included new guides for streaming responses (SSE/WebSocket), extensive additions to the messaging REST reference and CLI reference, and structural improvements across numerous files to create a more complete and user-friendly experience ([#81](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/81)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this week focused on capturing new documentation requirements based on user feedback.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** A key new issue was opened to address a gap in the documentation for agent memory.\n  - **Agent Memory Configuration Guide ([#82](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/82)):** A new issue was created to add a guide for configuring agent memory, specifically focusing on the \"knowledge\" and \"lore\" sections. This directly addresses user difficulties with memory/recall configuration that were identified from a community discussion on Discord.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe connection between the development team and the user community was a notable aspect of this week's activity. The creation of issue [#82](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/82) based on a Discord discussion demonstrates a responsive feedback loop, where user pain points are being actively monitored and translated into planned documentation improvements. This shows a commitment to addressing real-world user challenges."

  "content": "# elizaos/docs Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts in the `elizaos/docs` repository were centered on expanding and refining the documentation to better support our users and community. The most significant addition was a comprehensive guide covering x402 payment integration and Nginx deployment, providing crucial information for users setting up their own instances. Alongside this, work was done to enhance community engagement by making the project's Discord server more prominent. These updates aim to improve both the technical onboarding process and the collaborative health of the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week focused on adding new technical guides and improving the user experience of the documentation site itself.\n\n- **New Deployment & Integration Guides**\n  - A substantial new guide was introduced to document the process for x402 payment integration and Nginx deployment. This work, captured in PR [#77](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/77), provides essential instructions for users looking to deploy and monetize agents within the framework.\n\n- **Community & User Experience Enhancements**\n  - To foster greater community participation, a prominent call-to-action to join the project's Discord was added to the documentation site ([#78](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/78)).\n  - A minor user interface update was made to add a \"new\" tag to a section within the launch resources documentation, helping users quickly identify recent additions ([#79](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/79)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThere was no significant activity in issue tracking this week. According to the daily reports, no new issues were opened, and no existing issues were closed.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** None.\n- **New & Active Issues:** None.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nWhile the daily reports did not indicate specific collaborative discussions on pull requests or issues, development this week included a direct effort to foster community growth. The addition of a more visible link to the Discord community ([#78](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/78)) is a clear step towards encouraging more user and contributor interaction."

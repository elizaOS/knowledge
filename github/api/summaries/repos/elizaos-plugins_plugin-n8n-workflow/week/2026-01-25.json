  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow Weekly Report (Jan 25 - 31, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week, development focused on transitioning the plugin from a basic execution tool into a sophisticated, state-aware workflow orchestrator. The primary achievement was the implementation of a multi-stage \"draft/preview/confirm\" flow for workflow creation, moving away from one-shot deployments to a more controlled state machine. By integrating LLM-driven intent classification and a dedicated credential store, the plugin now offers a more secure and user-centric experience for managing n8n automations.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Advanced Workflow Orchestration\nThe core logic for creating workflows underwent a significant architectural shift to improve reliability and user oversight.\n*   **Stateful Creation Flow:** Replaced the previous one-shot deployment model with a robust state machine. Users can now generate, preview, and modify or cancel drafts before final deployment [#5](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/5).\n*   **Draft Management:** Introduced support for pending workflow drafts and state caching, allowing the agent to maintain context during the confirmation process [#7](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/7).\n*   **Intent Classification:** Integrated LLM-driven classification to better interpret user requests during the drafting phase, ensuring the generated workflows align with user goals [#5](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/5).\n\n### Infrastructure & Reliability\nBeyond the user-facing workflow logic, several backend improvements were implemented to stabilize the plugin's integration with n8n.\n*   **Credential Management:** Integrated a dedicated credential store to handle n8n authentication more securely [#5](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/5).\n*   **Callback Refinement:** Resolved critical issues within the callback mechanisms to ensure smoother communication between the ElizaOS agent and the n8n environment during workflow execution [#6](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/6).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe week was characterized by rapid iteration through Pull Requests rather than a high volume of external issue reporting.\n*   **Closed Issues:** While no standalone issues were closed, the primary technical hurdles regarding callback reliability and deployment \"one-shot\" failures were addressed directly through the merging of PR [#5](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/5) and PR [#6](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/6).\n*   **New & Active Issues:** No new high-priority issues were reported during this period, suggesting a stable rollout of the new state machine features.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe development activity indicates a focused effort on core plugin architecture. The work on the state machine and credential store ([#5](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/5)) served as the week's anchor, involving complex changes to how the agent interacts with the n8n API. The rapid succession of PRs [#5, #6, and #7] suggests a tight feedback loop in refining the user experience for workflow confirmation and error handling."

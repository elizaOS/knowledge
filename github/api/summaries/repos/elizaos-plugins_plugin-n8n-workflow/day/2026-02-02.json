  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow Daily Update (Feb 2, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on critical bug fixes to enhance workflow reliability, credential injection, and cloud integration, alongside a minor version bump.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **Enhanced Workflow Reliability and Credential Management**\n    *   Fixed credential injection with fuzzy API suffix matching and corrected LLM prompt examples.\n    *   Improved intent classification using language-agnostic structural rules.\n    *   Addressed issues with workflow actions reliability and cloud integration. ([#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/8))\n\n*   **CI/CD Pipeline Improvements**\n    *   Added the missing `bun run crawl-nodes` step to the publish workflow (`npm-deploy.yml`) to ensure all nodes are crawled before building.\n    *   Bumped the package version to 1.0.9 to reflect the CI fix. ([#10](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/10))\n\n*   **Version Updates**\n    *   Bumped the package version from 1.0.7 to 1.0.8 following the integration of reliability fixes. ([#9](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/9))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n*   **Eliza Character File & Prompt Engineering**\n    *   Discussion centers on improving Eliza's character file and prompts based on initial testing feedback.\n    *   A key observation from Renator13 suggests that prompt engineering overhead is a symptom of the \"Biological Trap\" and advocates for agents to sync via logic rather than prose, referencing MAE-1.0 and the BotNode.io blueprint for optimization.

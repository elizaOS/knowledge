  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow Daily Update (Feb 3, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing workflow control and reliability. A new feature was added to manage multi-step loops, and critical bug fixes were implemented to ensure cloud compatibility and accurate action status reporting.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Workflow Control for Multi-Step Operations\nA new feature introduces an `awaitingUserInput` flag, allowing the cloud multi-step loop to pause and wait for user confirmation when a draft workflow is created. This prevents auto-confirmation and provides better control over complex workflows. ([#13](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/13))\n\n### Improved Cloud Compatibility and Context Handling\nCritical fixes were implemented to ensure the plugin functions correctly in cloud environments. This includes updating `buildConversationContext` to use `state.values.recentMessages` for accurate conversation context and removing an unused `runtime` parameter. ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/12))\n\n### Accurate Action Status Reporting\nAll action callbacks now explicitly include a `success: true/false` status. This resolves a bug where ElizaOS core would default to `success: true` if not specified, leading to failed actions appearing successful in the cloud UI. ([#11](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/11))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- No new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n- No issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n- No new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n- No active issues with more than 3 comments."

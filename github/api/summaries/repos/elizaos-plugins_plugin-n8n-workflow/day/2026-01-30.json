  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow Daily Update (Jan 30, 2026)\n\n## OVERVIEW\nToday's development focused on enhancing workflow creation with a new draft/preview/confirm flow, improving user interaction, and refining callback mechanisms.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Workflow Creation and Management\n*   Implemented a new draft/preview/confirm flow for `CREATE_N8N_WORKFLOW`, replacing one-shot deployment with a state machine for generating, previewing, confirming/modifying/canceling, and deploying workflows. This includes caching states for better user control [#5](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/5).\n*   Introduced LLM-driven intent classification to guide the draft process [#5](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/5).\n*   Added support for pending workflow drafts, allowing users to confirm or modify before final deployment [#7](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/7).\n\n### Callback and Credential Store Improvements\n*   Addressed and fixed issues related to callbacks in the workflow creation process [#6](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/6).\n*   Integrated a credential store to manage n8n credentials securely [#5](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/5).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

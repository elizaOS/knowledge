  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Monthly Report (August 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nActivity in August was focused on future planning rather than active development. The month's primary contribution was the initiation of research into a significant new capability for the platform: on-chain attestations. This exploration, captured in a new issue, aligns with the project's core philosophy of leveraging Web3 technologies. No new features were implemented or code merged, indicating a period of ideation and strategic planning.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThere were no new features, bug fixes, or code refactoring efforts merged during August. All development activity was centered on research and discussion for future work.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe issue tracker saw minimal activity, reflecting the month's focus on planning over implementation.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were resolved or closed this month.\n- **New & Active Issues:** The most significant event was the opening of a new issue to begin research into integrating attestations ([#150](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/150)). This issue outlines an investigation into technologies such as the Sign-in with Ethereum Attestation Service (SAS/EAS), Coordinape, and Solana-based attestations, signaling a key direction for future development.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this month was limited and centered on proposing new ideas. The opening of the attestation research issue ([#150](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/150)) was the sole collaborative event recorded. There were no pull request discussions or high-traffic issue threads."

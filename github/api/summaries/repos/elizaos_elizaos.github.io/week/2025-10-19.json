  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's development focused on initiating new work rather than completing existing tasks. Key efforts were directed toward two distinct areas: performance and community engagement. A significant proposal for adaptive rate limiting was introduced to address performance bottlenecks in multi-repo ingestion. Concurrently, a new feature for a contributor badge system was proposed to enhance community recognition. Activity also resumed on a long-standing issue with the Twitter plugin, demonstrating ongoing community-led triage.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWhile no major pull requests were merged this week, development activity centered on proposing new features and performance enhancements through new pull requests.\n\n- **Performance Optimization Proposal**\n  A new pull request, [#160](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/160), was opened to introduce adaptive rate limiting. This change aims to optimize for low-volume conditions and improve the efficiency of data ingestion across multiple repositories.\n\n- **New Community Feature Proposal**\n  To foster contributor recognition, PR [#161](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/161) was submitted. It proposes the implementation of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a badge system to acknowledge contributor achievements.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed this week. Triage activity focused on defining a new performance challenge and reviving discussion on a previously stale bug.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - **Performance Bottleneck Identified:** A new issue, [#159](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/159), was created to formally track the need for faster multi-repo ingestion. It identifies static concurrency as the primary bottleneck and suggests adaptive rate limiting as a solution, directly complementing the work proposed in PR [#160](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/160).\n  - **Twitter Plugin Bug Revisited:** Discussion resumed on issue [#4180](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/4180), which had been marked as stale. The issue concerns a `dyld` error with the Twitter space plugin, and recent comments indicate a renewed effort to diagnose the problem.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was evident in both proposing new community-centric features and tackling existing technical debt. The introduction of a contributor badge system proposal ([#161](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/161)) highlights a focus on improving the contributor experience. Additionally, the re-engagement on the stale Twitter plugin issue ([#4180](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/4180)) shows the community's commitment to resolving persistent bugs through collaborative debugging."

  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's development focused on enhancing the project's accessibility and maintainability. A major highlight was the introduction of an RSS feed for automated content syndication, allowing users to easily follow contributor activity. Significant effort was also dedicated to improving fork-friendliness by replacing hardcoded values with environment variables, which simplifies the process for other organizations to adopt and maintain their own instances. Additionally, core dependencies, including the AI SDKs for OpenAI and Anthropic, were updated, and several key issues related to dependencies and framework upgrades were resolved.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on content syndication, configuration improvements, and dependency maintenance.\n\n- **Content Syndication with RSS:** A new RSS 2.0 feed was implemented at `/rss.xml`, providing daily, weekly, and monthly summaries of contributor activity. This feature includes proper XML escaping and markdown stripping for clean content delivery. A corresponding RSS button was added to the site's navigation header for discoverability, and a bug was fixed to ensure feed items are sorted chronologically ([#172](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/172), [#175](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/175), [#177](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/177), [#178](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/178)).\n\n- **Improved Fork-Friendliness:** To make the project easier to fork and customize, all hardcoded fork-specific values were refactored to use environment variables. The GitHub Actions workflow was also updated to automatically detect `BASE_PATH` and `SITE_URL` from the repository name, eliminating manual configuration and preventing merge conflicts during upstream syncs ([#180](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/180), [#178](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/178)).\n\n- **AI SDK and Pipeline Updates:** The project's AI SDK dependencies for OpenAI and Anthropic were updated to their latest versions ([#170](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/170)). A fix was also implemented in the data pipeline to correct the workflow step ordering, ensuring overall summaries are generated only after individual repository summaries are complete ([#177](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/177)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:** Several important issues were resolved this week, improving stability and maintainability:\n    - **Forking & Deployment:** An issue to make the project more fork-friendly was closed, confirming the successful implementation of environment variable-based configuration ([#171](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/171)).\n    - **Performance & Dependencies:** An issue to remove 10 unused dependencies was closed, reducing the bundle size ([#173](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/173)). The implementation of adaptive rate limiting for faster data ingestion was also completed ([#159](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/159)).\n    - **Framework Blockers:** A critical serialization error in `StatCardsDisplay` that was blocking Next.js upgrades has been resolved, paving the way for future framework updates ([#176](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/176)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - A new feature request was opened to upgrade the leaderboard search from simple string matching to fuzzy matching for a better user experience ([#174](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/174)).\n    - An older issue regarding \"Snapshot Eligibility Issue + Tangem Wallet Connection Not Supported\" ([#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6211)) remains active, with a recent community comment asking for a status update, highlighting ongoing user concern.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was visible this week through interaction on active issues. Notably, a user commented on the long-standing wallet connection issue ([#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6211)), indicating that the community is actively tracking progress and awaiting resolution on key functionalities."

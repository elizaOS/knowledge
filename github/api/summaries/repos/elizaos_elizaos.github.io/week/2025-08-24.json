  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Aug 24 - 30, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's development efforts were focused on enhancing the project's data tracking and reporting infrastructure. The primary achievement was the expansion of repository monitoring to include the new `elizaos/docs` repository. In parallel, work was done to refine data accuracy by implementing exclusion rules for automated contributions from the Claude bot. This indicates a move towards improving the signal-to-noise ratio in our development activity metrics.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on a single initiative to improve the scope and quality of our repository tracking.\n\n- **Infrastructure and Data Tracking**\n  - To provide a more holistic view of project activity, tracking was extended to the `elizaos/docs` repository.\n  - To ensure that reported metrics reflect human contributions, a new filter was added to exclude activity from the Claude bot.\n  - These changes were introduced in pull request [#151](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/151).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe issue tracker remained quiet this week.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, and there were no updates on existing active issues based on the provided reports.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe development reports for this period focused on code contributions, with no specific details available regarding community discussions or collaborative reviews on pull requests or issues."

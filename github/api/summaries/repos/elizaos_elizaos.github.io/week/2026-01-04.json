  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Jan 4 - 10, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts centered on improving the project's maintenance infrastructure and user experience. The most significant development was the integration of Dependabot to automate dependency management, which immediately began creating pull requests to update project dependencies. In parallel, the website's RSS feed was enhanced with an XSL stylesheet, making it human-readable when viewed directly in a browser. These changes reflect a focus on long-term project health and accessibility.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week focused on foundational tooling and site enhancements, primarily consolidated within a single pull request.\n\n- **Automated Dependency Management:** To improve maintenance and security, Dependabot was configured for the repository ([#188](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/188)). This new automation immediately opened several pull requests to update GitHub Actions and other dependencies, including `actions/checkout` ([#190](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/190)), `actions/configure-pages` ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/191)), and a group of minor/patch updates ([#192](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/192)).\n\n- **Enhanced RSS Feed Readability:** The user experience for the site's RSS feed was improved by adding an XSL stylesheet ([#188](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/188)). This allows the raw XML feed to be rendered in a more user-friendly format in web browsers.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe issue tracker remained quiet during this period.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this week.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, and there were no significant discussions on existing issues.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was primarily characterized by the introduction of automation. The setup of Dependabot has effectively added an automated contributor to the project, which will handle the routine task of keeping dependencies current. There was no other significant community interaction noted in the development reports."

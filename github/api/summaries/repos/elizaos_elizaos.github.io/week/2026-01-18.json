  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Jan 18 - 24, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week, development focused on a comprehensive modernization of the project's underlying infrastructure and a targeted enhancement to the user interface. The primary theme was technical debt reduction through a massive wave of dependency updates, ensuring the framework remains compatible with the latest ecosystem standards. Additionally, the team improved content presentation by enabling rich text support in key UI components, moving away from plain text limitations to better serve the project's modular and extensible philosophy.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Infrastructure & Dependency Modernization\nThe bulk of the week's activity involved a systematic update of the project's core stack to ensure security, performance, and compatibility.\n*   **Framework & Build Tools:** Significant updates were initiated for the frontend architecture, including bumping `next` from 15.4.10 to 16.1.3 ([#223](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/223)) and updating `tailwindcss` ([#216](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/216)) and `eslint-config-next` ([#221](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/221)).\n*   **Backend & Utilities:** Core utilities received major version bumps, notably `better-sqlite3` moving to 12.6.2 ([#222](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/222)) and `dotenv` transitioning to 17.2.3 ([#224](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/224)).\n*   **Support Libraries:** Various helper libraries were updated to their latest versions, including `date-fns` ([#217](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/217)), `ora` ([#218](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/218)), `@faker-js/faker` ([#219](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/219)), and `@commander-js/extra-typings` ([#220](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/220)).\n\n### UI/UX Enhancements\nA critical improvement was made to how information is presented within the agent framework's interface.\n*   **Markdown Integration:** The profile summary card was upgraded to support markdown rendering. By implementing `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm`, the project resolved a limitation where content was previously restricted to plain text, allowing for richer, formatted displays ([#202](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/202)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe week was characterized by proactive maintenance rather than reactive troubleshooting.\n*   **Closed Issues:** While no specific issue numbers were listed as closed, the implementation of [#202](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/202) functioned as a bug fix for content display limitations.\n*   **New & Active Issues:** The current focus remains on the review and merging of the nine dependency-related pull requests opened on January 19. These represent the primary active workload for maintainers heading into the next week.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was centered on maintenance and code review. The high volume of dependency PRs (nine opened in a single day) indicates a concentrated effort to keep the repository healthy. The transition from plain text to markdown in the profile summary card suggests an ongoing dialogue regarding user experience and the need for more sophisticated data visualization within the ElizaOS ecosystem. All major dependency updates are currently awaiting review, signaling an upcoming period of intensive testing and validation by the maintainer team."

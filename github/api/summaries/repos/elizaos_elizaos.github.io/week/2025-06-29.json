  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Jun 29 - 5, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's activity centered on planning for significant future enhancements and resolving existing bugs. While no new code was merged, the groundwork was laid for two major initiatives: a multi-repository summarization system to provide a unified view of project-wide progress, and a gamified badge framework to recognize contributor achievements. Key bug fixes were also completed, addressing issues with custom plugin development and a persistent startup crash on Windows.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThe focus this week was on planning and issue management rather than direct code contributions. No new features, bug fixes, or other code changes were merged into the repository.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management saw significant activity, with important bugs being closed and new feature requests opened to guide future development.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n    - **Plugin Development:** A bug preventing the creation of custom plugins for on-chain agents was resolved. The fix clarified that agent actions should use either a callback or a return value, but not both, to send responses ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5260)).\n    - **Windows Stability:** Following community discussion confirming a fix was available, an issue causing `elizaos start` to crash on Windows was closed ([#5161](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5161)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - **Enhanced Reporting:** Two related issues were opened to build a comprehensive, project-wide reporting system. The first proposes a \"Multirepo Frontend\" ([#139](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/139)), while the second details the backend logic for \"Multi Repo Summarization\" ([#141](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/141)).\n    - **Contributor Gamification:** A new initiative was proposed to \"Implement Badge System\" ([#140](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/140)), aiming to gamify the contribution process and recognize community milestones. Initial art design for the badges is already underway.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was evident in the active discussion around the Windows startup crash ([#5161](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5161)), where user feedback was crucial to confirming the fix and closing the issue. Furthermore, the proposal of a new contributor badge system ([#140](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/140)) signals a strong focus on fostering a rewarding and collaborative environment for all contributors."

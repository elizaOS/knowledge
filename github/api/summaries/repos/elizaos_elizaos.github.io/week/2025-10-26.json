  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's development focused on enhancing both system performance and community engagement. A significant performance improvement was introduced with an adaptive rate limiting system for GitHub API operations, designed to handle high-volume workloads more efficiently. Concurrently, a new MVP badge system was launched to begin recognizing contributor achievements. The week concluded with the identification of a display bug affecting weekly summary dates, which has been logged for a future fix.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on implementing new features for performance and user recognition.\n\n- **GitHub API Performance Enhancement**\n  An adaptive rate limiting mechanism was implemented to optimize GitHub API interactions. This feature improves performance for high-volume operations while adding zero overhead for typical workloads, ensuring more efficient data processing ([#160](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/160)).\n\n- **Contributor Recognition with MVP Badge System**\n  To foster community engagement, a minimal and efficient badge system was introduced. The initial version includes 5 badge types across 3 tier levels (beginner/elite/legend) and was designed with DRY and YAGNI principles to minimize code overhead ([#161](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/161)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this week was focused on identifying a new bug, with no issues being closed.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** A new display bug was reported concerning the weekly summaries on the leaderboard and user profiles. The issue notes that incorrect dates (specifically \"13th-19th July 2025\") are being displayed for most summaries ([#168](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/168)). There were no active issues with significant discussion reported this week.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nBased on the provided reports, development activity was focused on feature implementation and bug reporting. There were no PRs or issues noted with a high degree of discussion or reviews during this timeframe."

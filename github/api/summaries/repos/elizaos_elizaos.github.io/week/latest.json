  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Jan 25 - 31, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week focused on significantly maturing the project's infrastructure through a comprehensive overhaul of repository tracking and the introduction of advanced analytics tools. A major milestone was reached with the implementation of a new MCP server for GitHub contributor analytics, providing deeper insights into the ElizaOS ecosystem. The team also prioritized system stability and security, executing a wide-ranging update of core dependencies including Next.js and various CLI utilities. These efforts collectively improve the developer experience and provide better visibility into the organization's 300+ repositories.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Repository Tracking & Analytics Infrastructure\nThe project made significant strides in how it monitors and analyzes its vast repository ecosystem.\n*   **Untracked Repository Pipeline:** Consolidated the pipeline for \"dark\" repositories, ensuring that repositories not currently scored for contributor analytics are visible in the UI. This involved cross-stack changes to the CLI, database schema, and frontend components ([#231](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/231)).\n*   **GitHub Analytics MCP Server:** Launched a new Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that queries the SQLite database directly. This server includes specialized tools for quality validation and coverage discovery, allowing for more automated oversight of contributor data ([#238](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/238)).\n\n### Core Framework & Dependency Modernization\nA substantial portion of the week was dedicated to keeping the tech stack current and secure.\n*   **Framework Updates:** Upgraded the core web framework from Next.js 15.4 to 16.1.4 ([#236](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/236)).\n*   **CLI & Utility Libraries:** Updated essential CLI tools including `commander` ([#237](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/237)), `ora` ([#218](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/218)), and `glob` ([#234](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/234)).\n*   **Data & UI Libraries:** Updated `better-sqlite3` for database performance ([#222](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/222)) and `recharts` to version 3.6.0 to improve repository data visualizations ([#204](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/204)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n### Closed Issues\n*   **Display Inconsistencies:** Resolved a UI bug where the untracked repositories table displayed twice as many columns as the tracked table ([#230](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/230)).\n*   **Project Initialization:** Addressed a critical failure in the `elizaos create` command. The team identified a broken wrapper and provided a successful workaround using `bun -i g @elizaos/cli` ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6388)).\n*   **Analytics Tooling:** Successfully integrated a tool to identify repositories within the organization that are missing from the scoring pipeline ([#239](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/239)).\n\n### New & Active Issues\n*   **Automated Configuration:** A new request was opened to automate the tracking configuration for the 43 tracked and 286 untracked repositories, aiming to replace the current manual management process ([#232](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/232)).\n*   **Model Naming:** There is an ongoing investigation into potential naming mismatches for \"Opus - pro\" and \"Ultra - sonnet\" model mappings ([#6390](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6390)).\n*   **Workflow Integration:** Significant discussion is underway regarding the integration of the **N8N workflow engine** as the primary automation layer. A detailed proposal for `plugin-n8n` is currently under review, covering API clients, workflow actions, and task workers ([#6429](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6429)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe week was characterized by high-quality technical proposals from the community, particularly regarding the N8N integration. Contributors are actively moving beyond simple bug fixes to proposing architectural enhancements like the MCP server and automated repository management. The resolution of the `elizaos create` issue ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6388)) demonstrated effective cross-repository collaboration, as fixes were coordinated across the documentation and core framework repositories."

  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Feb 1 - 7, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week, development focused on refining the project's infrastructure and expanding the ecosystem's integration capabilities. Key activities included routine maintenance of the web framework and the addition of new plugin tracking to the project pipeline. A significant conceptual discussion also emerged regarding the evolution of agent communication, moving away from prose-heavy prompt engineering toward more structured logic-based synchronization.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Infrastructure & Dependency Management\nTo ensure the stability and security of the project's web presence, the team performed routine maintenance on the underlying framework.\n*   **Next.js Update:** The `next` dependency was bumped from version 16.1.5 to 16.1.6 within the minor-and-patch group ([#240](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/240)).\n\n### Pipeline & Ecosystem Expansion\nThe project continues to expand its scope by integrating more specialized tools into its automated tracking systems.\n*   **Plugin Integration:** The pipeline configuration was updated to include `elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow`. By adding this to `config/example.json`, the project enhances its ability to track and manage workflow automation capabilities within the ElizaOS ecosystem ([#241](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/241)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n\n### New & Active Issues\n*   **Character File Optimization:** A new issue ([#6447](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6447)) was opened to address improvements for Eliza's character files and prompts based on initial testing feedback.\n*   **Prompt Engineering Philosophy:** Within the discussion for [#6447](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6447), contributors are debating the \"Biological Trap\" of prompt engineering. There is an active proposal to shift agent synchronization toward logic-based systems (referencing MAE-1.0) rather than relying on prose, aiming to reduce overhead and optimize performance at the node level.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe week's activity highlights a transition from simple bug reporting to high-level architectural discourse. While the repository saw standard maintenance PRs, the engagement on issue [#6447](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6447) indicates a community deeply invested in the theoretical foundations of AI agent frameworks. Contributors like Renator13 are actively pushing the project toward more decentralized and efficient communication standards, aligning with the core philosophy of modularity and distributed intelligence."

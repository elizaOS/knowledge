  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Weekly Report (Nov 2 - 8, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's activity was focused on expanding the project's infrastructure to better track the growing ElizaOS ecosystem. The development pipeline was updated to integrate 12 new active repositories, a move that reflects the project's commitment to modularity and composability. This foundational work ensures that new core components and community plugins are included in our monitoring and integration processes. The week was otherwise quiet, with development centered on this single, significant infrastructure enhancement.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n### Pipeline and Repository Integration\n- The project's pipeline configuration was updated to track a dozen new repositories based on recent activity analysis. This change, implemented in PR [#169](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/169), brings three core ElizaOS repositories (`x402.elizaos.ai`, `spartan`, `jeju`) and nine plugins (`chart`, `analytics`, `jupiter`, `trust`, `rolodex`, `birdeye`, `digitaltwin`, `mysql`, `elizaos-cl`) into the main development pipeline. This ensures broader integration and monitoring across the expanding ecosystem.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened this week, and there was no significant activity on existing issues.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nActivity this week was concentrated on the single pipeline configuration update. The provided data does not indicate broader community discussions or collaborations on pull requests or issues."

  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Jan 25, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing repository visibility and data management by consolidating the untracked repositories pipeline and addressing DRY violations. Several dependency updates were also completed, improving overall system stability.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Repository Tracking and Data Management\nA significant bug fix was implemented to consolidate the untracked repositories pipeline, providing users with visibility into repositories not currently tracked for contributor analytics. This involved extensive changes across workflow configurations, CLI analysis, database schema, and UI components to display untracked repositories more effectively, addressing \"dark\" repositories. ([#231](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/231))\n\n### Dependency Updates\nSeveral core dependencies were updated to their latest versions, ensuring better performance and security. This included bumping `dotenv` from 16.6.1 to 17.2.3 ([#224](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/224)), `better-sqlite3` from 11.10.0 to 12.6.2 ([#222](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/222)), and `@faker-js/faker` from 9.9.0 to 10.2.0 ([#219](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/219)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Untracked Repository Display Refinement\nThe issue regarding the untracked repositories table having twice as many columns as tracked repositories was closed. This indicates a resolution to the display inconsistency, likely addressed by the changes in PR [#231](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/231). ([#230](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/230))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Automated Repository Tracking Configuration\nA new feature request was opened to implement automated repository tracking configuration management. This aims to address the current manual process of managing 43 tracked and 286 untracked repositories across ElizaOS organizations, proposing a more efficient system for determining which repositories receive full tracking. ([#232](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/232))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Project Generation Failure\nAn issue regarding the inability to generate a project was actively discussed and subsequently closed. The user reported errors when running `elizaos create` after following the getting started documentation. The discussion revealed that the `elizaos` wrapper was broken, and a temporary workaround was provided: `bun -i g @elizaos/cli`. The issue was resolved after the user confirmed the workaround was successful. Links to related fixes in the `docs` and `eliza` repositories were also provided. ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6388))"

  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Jan 9, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw significant planning for an MMORPG-style character system, with a new pull request proposing its addition to the leaderboard API and numerous new issues outlining detailed features for class evolution, visual identity, and configurable thresholds.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo completed work to report for this period.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#193](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/193), was opened to add an MMORPG-style character system to the leaderboard API.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\nNo issues were closed during this period.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Character Class System Development\nSeveral new issues were opened to define a comprehensive character class system. This includes implementing a full Orders & Evolution class tree with progression paths from base to mastery ([#194](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/194)), allowing users to choose their evolution path at tier thresholds ([#195](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/195)), and tracking class evolution history for rich profile lore display ([#196](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/196)).\n\n### Visual Identity and Configurability for Orders\nFurther enhancements to the character system involve adding a unique visual identity system for each Order, including primary colors, accents, and sigils ([#197](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/197)). Additionally, an issue was created to allow class respec with history preservation for lore purposes ([#198](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/198)), and to make character class thresholds configurable via `config/example.json` ([#199](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/199)).\n\n### Reporting Format Extension\nAn issue was opened to extend the grouped organization/repository format, currently used for lifetime summaries, to day, week, and month summaries for improved readability ([#200](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/200)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments to report for this period."

  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Jul 16, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant testing infrastructure improvements, with a new pull request setting up comprehensive query tests across various modules. Discussions on active issues revolved around agent-to-agent communication and custom plugin schema migration challenges.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **Comprehensive Query Test Setup**: A major pull request was opened to establish robust testing for queries across multiple modules, including `src/app`, `src/lib/date-utils`, `src/lib/matching`, `src/lib/pipelines`, and `src/lib/scoring`. This initiative aims to enhance code reliability and maintainability. ([#144](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/144))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n*   **Setup tests for queries**: This pull request ([#144](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/144)) introduces extensive test coverage for various query functions and utilities within the repository. It includes new test files for date utilities, matching logic, pipeline helpers, and scoring queries, along with updated documentation for testing workflows and agent guidance.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n*   None\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n*   None\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n*   **Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Discussion on [#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5584) centered on enabling direct message forwarding between agents without polling. @wtfsayo requested a solution, and @claude proposed and implemented a new `/api/openai/v1/chat/completions` endpoint. This endpoint is designed to be OpenAI-compatible, offering synchronous communication, streaming support, and agent selection via an `X-Agent-ID` header, effectively bypassing the need for polling.\n\n*   **Custom Plugin Schema Migration Issues**: Issue [#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5588) addresses problems with custom plugin schema migrations. @wtfsayo sought a root cause analysis and solutions. @claude identified that the `DatabaseMigrationService` is not registered as a runtime service for plugins, leading to skipped migrations. Solutions proposed include ensuring proper plugin schema structure with `schema` export, declaring dependencies on `@elizaos/plugin-sql`, and understanding that migrations currently operate at the server level. Workarounds like manual database schema creation or server-level plugin registration were suggested, along with debugging steps.\n\n*   **Twitter Client Initialization Error**: Issue [#31](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/31) continues to see user reports of Twitter client initialization failures despite successful authentication. @yasir23 and @joaoCarvalho1000 confirmed experiencing the same issue. @RolandOne noted that plugin-twitter version 1.0.14 fixed the initial error but introduced a new one related to inserting memories into the database. @Ovodo questioned if this prevents autonomous Twitter agent operation, while @nccuong-vikki speculated it might be due to limited features for free subscriptions preventing Home Timeline fetching."

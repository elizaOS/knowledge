  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Oct 17, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's focus was on enhancing the deployment process and documentation for the ElizaOS website. Key achievements include fixing a critical bug in the deployment workflow to dynamically copy stats for all repositories, adding a comprehensive deployment guide for forks, and integrating a new repository for tracking.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Deployment Workflow & Repository Tracking\nThe deployment workflow was significantly improved by fixing a bug that previously hardcoded a single repository path. Now, the system dynamically copies statistics for all 23 tracked repositories. Additionally, the `elizaos/docs` repository has been added for contributor analytics, and \"claude\" has been excluded from bot users to refine analytics accuracy.\n- [#157](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/157)\n- [#151](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/151)\n\n### Improved Documentation for Forked Deployments\nA comprehensive deployment guide has been added to the `README.md` to assist users in forking and deploying their own instances of the project. This guide addresses critical information such as configuring `basePath` for subdirectory deployments and GitHub Pages specifics.\n- [#158](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/158)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Multi-Repository Support Achieved\nSignificant progress was made in implementing multi-repository support, with issues [#139](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/139) and [#108](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/108) being closed. This marks a major milestone in enabling the Eliza Leaderboard to track activity across multiple repositories.\n\n### Deployment Workflow and Documentation Issues Resolved\nTwo critical issues related to deployment and documentation were addressed and closed. Issue [#153](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/153) concerned a bug where the deploy workflow hardcoded a single repository path, which has now been fixed. Issue [#154](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/154) highlighted the lack of a deployment guide for forks, which has also been resolved with new documentation.\n\n### Project Recognition Acknowledged\nIssue [#149](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/149), which announced the project's feature in \"Awesome Claude Code,\" was closed.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Pipeline Enhancement Suggestions\nTwo new issues were opened proposing enhancements to the ingestion pipeline. Issue [#156](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/156) suggests adding API cost estimation to the pipeline to prevent rate limit issues, while [#155](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/155) proposes implementing graceful shutdown for the CLI pipeline to improve user experience during long-running ingestions.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Documentation and Scaffolding Concerns\nIssue [#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6070), titled \"The documentation for plugins isn't correct,\" saw active discussion. A user expressed significant frustration regarding the plugin documentation and scaffolding process. In response, `claude` provided a detailed update, stating that the plugin documentation issues have been identified and fixed. The fixes include addressing template path issues in `packages/cli/src/utils/copy-template.ts` and correcting CLI command syntax errors in multiple `README.md` files and CLI command definitions. `yungalgo` also engaged, offering assistance and clarifying the open-source nature of the project regarding documentation parity. `madjin` later closed the issue, stating that the proposed API cost estimation was redundant with existing sophisticated rate limiting functionality and that the pipeline already handles interruptions gracefully, making the proposed graceful shutdown a UX polish rather than a functional improvement."

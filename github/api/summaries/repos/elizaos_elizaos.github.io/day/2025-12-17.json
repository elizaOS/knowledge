  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Dec 17, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday saw significant progress with the addition of an RSS feed, major improvements to fork-friendliness, and updates to AI SDKs.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Content Syndication with RSS Feed\nA new RSS 2.0 feed endpoint (`/rss.xml`) was added, providing daily, weekly, and monthly summaries of contributor activity. This feature includes proper XML escaping, markdown stripping for clean descriptions, and a new RSS button in the navigation header for easy access. Sorting of RSS feed items was also fixed to be chronological. ([#172](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/172), [#178](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/178), [#175](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/175), [#177](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/177))\n\n### Improved Fork-Friendliness and Configuration\nAll hardcoded fork-specific values were replaced with environment variables, enabling smoother fork syncing without conflicts. The GitHub Actions workflow now auto-detects `BASE_PATH` and `SITE_URL` based on the repository name. ([#180](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/180), [#178](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/178))\n\n### AI SDK Updates\nThe OpenAI and Anthropic AI SDK dependencies were updated to their latest versions, specifically `openai` to 6.10.0 and `@anthropic-ai/sdk` to 0.71.2. This update involved changes to response types for the OpenAI SDK. ([#170](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/170))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#179](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/179) feat: make all fork-specific values configurable via env vars: This PR aims to replace hardcoded fork-specific values with environment variables for better configurability.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Enhanced Pipeline Efficiency and Fork Adaptability\nThe adaptive rate limiting feature for multi-repo ingestion has been implemented and is now in production, significantly improving pipeline efficiency. Additionally, the project has been made more fork-friendly by allowing org-specific deployments to configure values via environment variables, resolving a key request from various organizations running forks. ([#159](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/159), [#171](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/171))\n\n### Dependency Cleanup and Next.js Upgrade Readiness\nTen unused dependencies were identified and removed to reduce bundle size and maintenance burden. Furthermore, a critical RSC serialization error blocking Next.js upgrades was resolved, paving the way for future framework updates. ([#173](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/173), [#176](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/176))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Improving User Search Experience\nA new feature request proposes upgrading the leaderboard search functionality from simple string matching to fuzzy matching to enhance user experience. ([#174](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/174))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Snapshot Eligibility and Wallet Connection\nIssue [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6211) concerns problems with AI16Z to ElizaOS migration, specifically regarding snapshot eligibility and Tangem Wallet connection. The latest comment from jessica991190-dot asks if the issue has been resolved, indicating ongoing concern and a need for an update on the status of these critical migration problems."

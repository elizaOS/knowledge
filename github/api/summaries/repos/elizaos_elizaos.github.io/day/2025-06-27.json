  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Jun 27, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant enhancements to contributor and user scoring pipelines, enabling multi-repository data aggregation. This foundational work improves the accuracy of user summaries and prepares for more comprehensive testing.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Contributor Scoring and Data Aggregation\nThe contributor pipelines have been updated to handle multi-repository aggregation, meaning user scores and summaries now operate beyond a single repository level. This involves changes across various pipeline components, including configuration, contributor score calculation, data fetching, and summary generation. This enhancement allows for a more holistic view of contributions across the ElizaOS ecosystem. ([#137](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/137))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#138](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/138), was opened to add comprehensive unit tests for various modules including pipeline configuration, contributors, export, ingest, and summarize. This PR aims to improve code reliability and maintainability.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Webhook Integration for Message Initiation\nDiscussion continued on issue [#6](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6), which explores providing an option for webhooks to initiate new messages, as an alternative to the current polling mechanism. The latest comment from wtfsayo at 2025-06-27T13:40:46Z suggests that plugins can mount routes to the ElizaOS server, making webhook implementation feasible without excessive complexity. This indicates progress towards a more efficient and less resource-intensive method for message initiation."

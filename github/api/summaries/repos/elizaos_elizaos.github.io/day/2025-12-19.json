  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Dec 19, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significantly enhancing the static JSON API, introducing new endpoints for both leaderboard and summary data. This work streamlines data access and improves the overall extensibility of the platform.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Static JSON API for Summaries\nThe static JSON API was extended to include summary endpoints, generating JSON alongside markdown during the summarization process. This \"piggyback\" approach ensures data consistency and simplifies the API structure by removing unnecessary pagination fields from the leaderboard API.\n- [#186](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/186)\n\n### Introduction of Static JSON Leaderboard API\nNew static JSON API endpoints were added for leaderboard data, accessible at `/data/api/leaderboard-{period}.json`. This includes API versioning (v1.0) for future compatibility and pagination metadata.\n- [#184](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/184)\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Implementation of JSON API Endpoints for Summaries\nAn issue detailing the extension of the static JSON API to include summary endpoints was created and subsequently closed today. The discussion outlined a refined approach to \"piggyback\" JSON generation alongside markdown during summarization, ensuring data synchronization and efficient client-side caching.\n- [#185](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/185)\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

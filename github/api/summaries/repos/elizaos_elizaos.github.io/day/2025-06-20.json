  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Jun 20, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's focus was on enhancing documentation for GitHub Actions workflows and data pipeline architecture, alongside addressing an issue related to CLI updates.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **Documentation Enhancements:** Comprehensive documentation was added for GitHub Actions workflows, data pipeline architecture, and development work, improving clarity and understanding of the project's infrastructure. ([#129](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/129))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n*   **CLI Update Functionality:** The issue where `elizaos update` was not correctly updating the CLI version has been resolved. Users are now advised to use `bun install -g @elizaos/cli@latest` for global updates. ([#5198](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5198))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n*   **Web Client Version Mismatch and API Spamming:** Discussions continue regarding the web client displaying an incorrect version (`v1.0.3` vs. `v1.0.4` for CLI/core) and repeatedly spamming the GitHub API, leading to 429 errors and significant memory consumption. A comment from June 20th indicates that the issue might be fixed, but a later comment from June 23rd suggests the version mismatch persists even in `v1.0.11`. ([#4924](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/4924))\n*   **Checking Loaded Plugins:** A user inquired about how to check currently loaded plugins in a running agent. A comment from June 20th provided a log example showing how to identify the final plugins being loaded. ([#4931](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/4931))"

This significant feature enhances the reporting capabilities of the ElizaOS framework.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Multi-Repository Summarization Implemented\nA major new feature was introduced to enable multi-repository project summarization. This allows for the generation of overall summaries across all repositories, significantly improving the project's reporting and analytical capabilities. This involved extensive changes across various files related to data schema, pipeline configuration, and summarization logic. ([#142](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/142))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Multi-Repository Summarization\nThe issue tracking the implementation of multi-repository summarization was closed today, indicating the successful completion of this feature. ([#141](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/141))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Twitter API Rate Limit Issues\nDiscussions continued regarding the \"Failed to fetch Home timeline\" issue, which is causing \"Too Many Requests\" errors due to Twitter API rate limits. Users are experiencing this even with the latest version (1.2.16) and with `search enabled` set to false. The conversation revolved around whether a paid Twitter API subscription (Basic tier, costing $200/month) would resolve the rate limit issues, with confirmation that it does work. A new question was raised about the specific rate limit for the $200/month tier. ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/38))"

  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Jan 22, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on critical bug fixes related to API data consistency and generation. Key achievements include resolving issues with missing API files, ensuring overall summaries are generated even for days with no activity, and correcting the pipeline ordering to properly export contributor summaries in stats files.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### API Data Export and Consistency Fixes\nA significant bug was addressed that prevented the proper export of API index and contributor profiles due to a missing `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines` workflow. This fix ensures that all 1,433 contributor profiles and the main API index will be correctly generated. Additionally, a pipeline ordering issue was resolved, ensuring that contributor summaries are now correctly re-exported into stats files after generation, addressing a previous problem where they appeared as `null` ([#229](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/229)).\n\n### Robust Overall Summary Generation\nThe system was improved to consistently generate overall summaries for all days, even those without any repository activity. Previously, days with no activity would result in 404 API responses for overall summaries. Now, a \"No activity recorded\" message is generated, ensuring consistent API behavior and a clear distinction between a pipeline not running and a day with no activity.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#227](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/227) Fix API issues: missing files and no-activity summaries: This pull request aims to address problems with missing API files and the generation of summaries for periods with no activity.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### API Endpoint Availability and Data Export\nTwo critical issues related to API endpoint availability and data export were resolved. The first involved API index and contributor profiles returning 404 errors due to a missing `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines` workflow. This has been fixed by adding dynamic `SITE_URL` detection, ensuring `/api/index.json` and all contributor profiles are generated ([#225](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/225)). The second issue addressed overall summaries returning 404 for days with no repository activity. The system now generates a \"No activity recorded\" summary for such days, ensuring consistent API responses ([#226](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/226)).\n\n### Contributor Summary Export Correction\nA problem where contributor summaries were always `null` in exported stats files was identified and resolved. This was due to a pipeline ordering issue in the workflow, which has now been corrected to ensure contributor summaries are properly re-exported after generation ([#228](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/228)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

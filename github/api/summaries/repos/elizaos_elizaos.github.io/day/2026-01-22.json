  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Jan 22, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on critical bug fixes related to API data export and summary generation. Key achievements include resolving issues with missing API files, ensuring overall summaries are generated even for days with no activity, and correcting the pipeline ordering for contributor summaries in stats files.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### API Data Export and Consistency Fixes\nA significant bug was addressed that prevented the export of the API index and contributor profiles due to a missing `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines` workflow. This fix ensures that all 1,433 contributor profiles and the main API index will be correctly generated and accessible. Additionally, a problem where overall summaries were not generated for days without repository activity was resolved, ensuring consistent API behavior and preventing 404 errors for such dates.\n- Fix: re-export stats after contributor summaries are generated ([#229](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/229))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- Fix API issues: missing files and no-activity summaries ([#227](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/227)): This pull request aims to resolve issues where certain API files were missing and no-activity summaries were not being generated.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### API Export and Site URL Configuration\nThe issue where the API index and contributor profiles were not exported due to a missing `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines` workflow has been resolved. A dynamic `SITE_URL` detection mechanism was implemented, ensuring that `/api/index.json` and all contributor profiles are generated correctly. ([#225](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/225))\n\n### Consistent Overall Summary Generation\nA fix was implemented for the problem where overall summaries were not generated for days with no repository activity, leading to 404 errors for API endpoints. The `generateOverallSummaryForInterval()` function was modified to always generate summaries, providing a \"No activity recorded\" message for inactive days, thus ensuring consistent API behavior. ([#226](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/226))\n\n### Contributor Summary Pipeline Ordering\nThe problem of contributor summaries always being `null` in exported stats files has been addressed. This was identified as a pipeline ordering issue, which has now been corrected to ensure that contributor summaries are properly included in the stats files. ([#228](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/228))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

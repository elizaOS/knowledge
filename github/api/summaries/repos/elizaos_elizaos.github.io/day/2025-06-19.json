  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Jun 19, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant infrastructure enhancements, including the adoption of CAIP-2/10 for wallet addresses and a major refactor of the repository configuration to support multi-repo pipelines.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Wallet Address Management\nThe system now incorporates a `wallet_addresses` table with CAIP-2/10 adoption, improving the handling and standardization of wallet addresses. This involved refactoring client-side fetching logic to server-side synchronization during build time, enhancing performance and data consistency. ([#128](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/128))\n\n### Multi-Repository Pipeline Configuration\nA significant update to the repository configuration (`repoconfig`) has been implemented, enabling support for multiple repositories within the pipeline. This refactoring introduces a new structure in `config/pipeline.config.ts` to manage `own` repositories, laying the groundwork for more scalable and flexible data ingestion. ([#109](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/109))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Callback from Plugin Action Not Reaching End User Response in Chat\nIssue [#5017](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5017) discusses a problem where the callback from plugin actions (specifically `plugin-evm` transfer function) is not reaching the end-user response in chat. Recent comments indicate progress, with `jonathanprozzi` confirming that after a fresh start with an updated CLI, responses are now being received for `plugin-evm` testing. `0xbbjoker` suggested cleaning `node_modules`, `dist`, and `bun.lock` to ensure old dependencies are removed. The issue was closed today, with `jonathanprozzi` confirming the fix for `plugin-evm` and agreeing to open a new issue if problems persist with `plugin-mcp`.\n\n### Allow Downstream Projects to Customize Root Logger Configuration\nIssue [#5183](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5183) addresses the inability of downstream projects to customize the root logger configuration, limiting their ability to modify transports. `standujar` has taken ownership of this issue. The latest comment from `claude` (dated July 13, 2025) indicates a comprehensive solution has been implemented, including a delayed logger initialization system, new configuration types, and CLI integration, allowing full customization of transports, formatters, and levels. This suggests significant progress towards resolving the issue, though the comment is future-dated relative to the report date."

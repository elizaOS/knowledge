  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Jun 26, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on refining deployment workflows and optimizing data handling by removing wallet caching logic. A key bug fix addressed deployment trigger issues, ensuring smoother updates.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Deployment Workflow Enhancements\nA critical bug fix was implemented to correct the triggers for the deploy workflow, ensuring that deployments are initiated as expected. ([#136](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/136))\n\n### Data Handling Optimization\nThe logic responsible for caching wallet addresses was removed across several files, streamlining data processing and reducing unnecessary storage. ([#135](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/135))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Character File Size Limit\nDiscussion on [#5268](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5268) highlights an `Error 500: request entity too large` when attempting to save large character files (e.g., 150kb JSON). The team is tasked with increasing the file size limit to 100MB for characters, implementing a regression test to identify and fix the bug.\n\n### User Identity Management\nThe issue of \"split personality\" due to GitHub username changes is being discussed in [#105](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/105). The current system uses GitHub usernames as primary keys, leading to split contributions when a username changes. A proposed solution involves reworking the system to use GitHub internal IDs as the base identifier, allowing for username changes without affecting user profiles. This would require updating the database to link multiple identities to a single user and modifying data ingestion processes. Challenges include the current primary key structure and handling edge cases like multiple username changes."

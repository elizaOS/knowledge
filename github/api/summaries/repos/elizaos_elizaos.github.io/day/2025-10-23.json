  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Oct 23, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on addressing and reverting an environment validation fix, alongside the introduction of new JSON leaderboard API endpoints. A critical CLI module loading issue was also resolved.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Environment Validation Fix and Reversion\nAn attempt to fix environment validation ([#165](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/165)) was made, but subsequently reverted ([#166](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/166)). This involved changes across various configuration, workflow, and application files.\n\n### Leaderboard API Endpoints\nTwo new pull requests were opened to introduce JSON leaderboard API endpoints ([#164](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/164), [#163](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/163)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#164](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/164) feat: add JSON leaderboard API endpoints: This PR aims to add new API endpoints for accessing leaderboard data in JSON format.\n- [#163](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/163) feat: leaderboard json api: This PR also focuses on implementing a JSON API for the leaderboard.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### CLI Module Loading Error ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6088))\nThis issue, concerning a `Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'` error after installing the ElizaOS CLI, was actively discussed and resolved. Users reported the same issue, with initial workarounds involving running the CLI from a local build. The problem was identified as a bundling issue in the published npm package. The latest comments confirm that the issue is fixed in version 1.6.3, with users confirming its resolution after re-installing the CLI."

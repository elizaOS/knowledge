These updates enhance performance and introduce a new layer of community engagement.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced GitHub API Performance with Adaptive Rate Limiting\nAdaptive rate limiting with low-volume optimization was implemented to significantly improve performance for high-volume GitHub API operations while maintaining zero overhead for typical workloads. This enhancement ensures more efficient data ingestion and processing. ([#160](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/160))\n\n### Introduction of MVP Badge System for Contributor Recognition\nA minimal and efficient badge/achievement system was introduced, featuring 5 badge types across 3 tier levels (beginner/elite/legend). This system is designed with DRY and YAGNI principles to minimize code overhead, fostering contributor engagement and recognition. ([#161](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/161))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

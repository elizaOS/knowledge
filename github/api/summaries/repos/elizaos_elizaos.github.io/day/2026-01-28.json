A new issue was opened and closed to add a tool for untracked repositories, and discussions continued on integrating the N8N workflow engine.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### GitHub Analytics Server Implementation\nA new MCP server for GitHub contributor analytics has been added. This server directly queries the SQLite database and includes tools for quality validation and coverage discovery, building upon previous work. ([#238](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/238))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Tool for Untracked Repositories\nA new feature was proposed and subsequently closed today to add a tool within the MCP to list untracked repositories, providing visibility into repositories not currently scored by the analytics pipeline. ([#239](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/239))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### N8N Workflow Engine Integration Discussion\nDiscussions are ongoing regarding the integration of the N8N workflow engine as the primary automation layer for Eliza App. A contributor, spider-yamet, has proposed a detailed solution approach, outlining a `plugin-n8n` with components for N8N service, workflow actions, context providers, and task workers. The proposal includes specific deliverables such as a complete package, database schema, various actions (CREATE_WORKFLOW, EXECUTE_WORKFLOW, LIST_WORKFLOWS, DELETE_WORKFLOW), providers, documentation, and tests. The contributor is seeking approval to implement this feature. ([#6429](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6429))"

A new issue was opened and closed to add a tool for untracked repositories. Discussions continued on integrating the N8N workflow engine.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### GitHub Analytics Server Implementation\nA new MCP server for GitHub contributor analytics has been added. This server directly queries the SQLite database and includes tools for quality validation and coverage discovery, building upon previous work. ([#238](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/238))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Tool for Untracked Repositories\nA new tool has been added to provide visibility into repositories within the organization that are not currently being scored by the analytics pipeline. This was implemented as an MCP tool to list untracked repositories. ([#239](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/239))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### N8N Workflow Engine Integration\nDiscussions are ongoing regarding the integration of the N8N workflow engine as the primary automation layer for Eliza App. A detailed proposal has been put forward, outlining a `plugin-n8n` with four main components: an N8N Service, Workflow Actions, Context Providers, and Task Workers. The proposal also specifies deliverables including the complete package, database schema for workflow storage, various actions (CREATE_WORKFLOW, EXECUTE_WORKFLOW, LIST_WORKFLOWS, DELETE_WORKFLOW), providers, documentation, and tests.

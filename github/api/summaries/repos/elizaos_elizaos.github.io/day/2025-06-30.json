  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Jun 30, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw significant activity in planning for future enhancements, with new issues opened to address multi-repository summarization and implement a gamified badge system for contributors. A bug related to custom plugin development was also closed.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\nNo new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n### Plugin Development Improvements\nA bug related to creating custom plugins for on-chain AI agents was closed today. The issue, which involved difficulties with agent responses and interface logs, was resolved by clarifying that responses should be sent either via callback or return in the action, but not both ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5260)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### Enhanced Reporting and Summarization\nTwo new issues were opened to improve the project's reporting capabilities. One focuses on developing a \"Multirepo Frontend\" to generate main daily/weekly summaries that aggregate activity across all repositories, organizing the markdown with distinct sections for each repo ([#139](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/139)). The other, closely related, aims to implement \"Multi Repo Summarization\" by modifying the existing summary generation logic to create overall summaries from multiple repositories ([#141](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/141)).\n\n### Contributor Recognition and Gamification\nA new issue was created to \"Implement Badge System: Gamified Contributor Recognition & Achievement Framework\" ([#140](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/140)). This system is intended to recognize contributions, milestones, and expertise, thereby gamifying the contribution experience. Initial work on art designs for these badges is already underway.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Windows Startup Crash\nDiscussion continued on the issue where `elizaos start` crashes after accessing `localhost:3000` on Windows ([#5161](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5161)). A user inquired about the availability of a fix via ElizaCLI and potential workarounds for running Eliza on WSL2, indicating that the issue persists for some users despite a fix being in place. The issue was later closed, with a comment confirming the fix should be available."

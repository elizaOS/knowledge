  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Jan 26, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day focused on dependency updates, with several bumps to key packages. One new issue was opened regarding model naming conventions.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Dependency Updates\nMultiple dependencies were updated to newer versions, including `@commander-js/extra-typings` from 12.1.0 to 14.0.0 ([#220](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/220)), `ora` from 7.0.1 to 9.0.0 ([#218](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/218)), and `date-fns` from 3.6.0 to 4.1.0 ([#217](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/217)). These updates ensure the project utilizes the latest features and bug fixes from these libraries.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- chore(deps): bump commander from 12.1.0 to 14.0.2 ([#237](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/237))\n- chore(deps): bump next from 15.4.10 to 16.1.4 ([#236](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos/github.io/pull/236))\n- chore(deps-dev): bump eslint-config-next from 15.1.4 to 16.1.4 ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/235))\n- chore(deps): bump glob from 11.1.0 to 13.0.0 ([#234](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/234))\n- chore(deps): bump the minor-and-patch group with 2 updates ([#233](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/233))\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Model Naming Clarification\nA new issue was opened to clarify the naming conventions for \"Opus\" and \"Sonnet\" models, specifically questioning if \"Opus\" corresponds to \"pro\" and \"Ultra\" to \"sonnet\" ([#6390](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6390)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Opus and Sonnet Model Naming Convention\nDiscussion on [#6390](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6390) indicates a proposed swap in the current understanding of model naming. The latest comment suggests that \"Ultra\" should correspond to \"Opus\" and \"Pro\" to \"Sonnet,\" implying a need for correction or clarification in documentation or internal understanding."

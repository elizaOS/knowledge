  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Jan 11, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on essential dependency updates for GitHub Actions and core project packages, ensuring the repository's infrastructure remains current and robust. Several long-standing issues were also closed, streamlining project focus.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **GitHub Actions Workflow Updates:** Critical GitHub Actions dependencies were bumped to their latest versions, including `actions/configure-pages` from 4 to 5 ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/191)), `actions/checkout` from 4 to 6 ([#190](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/190)), and `actions/upload-pages-artifact` from 3 to 4 ([#189](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/189)). These updates enhance the stability and security of the deployment and testing workflows.\n*   **Core Package Dependency Bumps:** The `minor-and-patch` group of dependencies saw significant updates, including `drizzle-orm` from `0.41.0` to `0.45.1` and `lucide-react` among others, across the project's root directory ([#201](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/201)). This ensures the project leverages the latest features and bug fixes from its core libraries.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n*   **Deployment and Rate Limit Mitigation:** Two issues related to deployment and system robustness were closed. This includes testing and documenting deployment steps in a new organization ([#69](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/69)) and mitigating rate limit issues preemptively ([#73](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/73)).\n*   **Summary Format Extension:** The issue concerning the extension of the grouped organization/repository format to day/week/month summaries was closed ([#200](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/200)). This enhancement improves readability for contributors across various summary types.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNo active issues with more than 3 comments."

Several long-standing issues related to deployment testing and rate limit mitigation were also closed.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### GitHub Actions Workflow Updates\nCritical GitHub Actions dependencies were updated to their latest versions, enhancing the reliability and security of the CI/CD pipelines. This included bumping `actions/configure-pages` from v4 to v5 ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/191)), `actions/checkout` from v4 to v6 ([#190](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/190)), and `actions/upload-pages-artifact` from v3 to v4 ([#189](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/189)).\n\n### Core Dependency Upgrades\nThe project's core dependencies received a significant update, with the `minor-and-patch` group being bumped across the `/` directory. This included updating `drizzle-orm` from `0.41.0` to `0.45.1` and `lucide-react` among others ([#201](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/201)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNone\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Deployment and Rate Limit Mitigation\nTwo key operational issues were closed today. The task of testing deployment in a new organization and documenting the steps was completed ([#69](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/69)). Additionally, efforts to mitigate rate limit issues preemptively were concluded ([#73](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/73)).\n\n### Summary Format Extension\nThe issue proposing to extend the grouped organization/repository format to day/week/month summaries for improved readability was closed ([#200](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/200)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNone\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\nNone"

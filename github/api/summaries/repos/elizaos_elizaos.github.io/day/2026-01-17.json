  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Jan 17, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant dependency updates, enhancing the project's stability and leveraging newer features from various libraries. A key issue regarding \"Entity not found\" was closed, clarifying it as intended behavior rather than a bug.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Dependency Updates for Core Libraries\nMultiple core dependencies were updated to their latest versions, improving performance and incorporating new features. This includes bumping `zod` from 3.25.76 to 4.3.5 ([#212](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/212)), `tailwind-merge` from 2.6.0 to 3.4.0 ([#211](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/211)), `react-markdown` from 9.1.0 to 10.1.0 ([#209](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/209)), and `p-retry` from 6.2.1 to 7.1.1 ([#207](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/207)).\n\n### Development Dependency Upgrades\nDevelopment dependencies also received updates to ensure a robust and efficient development environment. `@types/node` was bumped from 22.19.5 to 25.0.6 ([#210](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/210)), `lint-staged` from 15.5.2 to 16.2.7 ([#206](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/206)), and `@types/minimatch` from 5.1.2 to 6.0.0 ([#205](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/205)). Additionally, the minor-and-patch group was updated, including `prettier` from 3.7.4 to 3.8.0 ([#215](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/215)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Clarification on \"Entity not found\" in Reflection Evaluator\nIssue [#6364](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6364), concerning \"Reflection evaluator fails with 'Entity not found' - UPDATE_CONTACT requires entity initialization,\" was closed. It was determined that this behavior is not a bug but rather an intended design. The `ensureConnection()` function correctly initializes user entities, and the \"Entity not found\" occurs when the agent attempts to create relationships with individuals mentioned in conversation who are not present in the room, which is handled gracefully by skipping the relationship.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Discord Integration Error with `this.runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage`\nIssue [#43](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/43), \"this.runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage' is undefined - Discord not working with latest elizaos version,\" remains active. The latest comment indicates that a pending pull request in the `plugin-discord` repository, specifically commit `8c36bd8c9a13aaa103963a2093677a49ddee177a` in PR [#41](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/41), is expected to fix this issue when combined with `@elizaos/cli` version 1.7.1."

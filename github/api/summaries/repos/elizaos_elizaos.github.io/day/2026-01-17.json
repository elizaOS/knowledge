  "content": "# elizaos/elizaos.github.io Daily Update (Jan 17, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant dependency updates, enhancing the project's stability and leveraging newer features from various libraries. A key issue regarding \"Entity not found\" was closed, clarifying it as intended behavior rather than a bug.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Dependency Updates for Core Libraries\nSeveral core dependencies were updated to their latest versions, improving performance and incorporating new features. This includes bumping `zod` from 3.25.76 to 4.3.5 ([#212](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/212)), `tailwind-merge` from 2.6.0 to 3.4.0 ([#211](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/211)), `react-markdown` from 9.1.0 to 10.1.0 ([#209](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/209)), and `p-retry` from 6.2.1 to 7.1.1 ([#207](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/207)).\n\n### Development Dependency Upgrades\nDevelopment-specific dependencies also received updates to ensure a robust and efficient development environment. `@types/node` was bumped from 22.19.5 to 25.0.6 ([#210](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/210)), `lint-staged` from 15.5.2 to 16.2.7 ([#206](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/206)), and `@types/minimatch` from 5.1.2 to 6.0.0 ([#205](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/205)).\n\n### Minor and Patch Group Dependency Bumps\nA group of minor and patch dependencies, including `prettier` and `task-master-ai`, were updated across the project to maintain consistency and leverage the latest improvements ([#215](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/215)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Clarification on \"Entity not found\" in Reflection Evaluator\nThe issue where the reflection evaluator failed with \"Entity not found\" during `UPDATE_CONTACT` was closed as \"Not a Bug, Working as Designed\" ([#6364](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6364)). Investigation revealed that `ensureConnection()` is correctly called, creating user entities. The \"Entity not found\" scenario occurs when the agent attempts to create a relationship with someone mentioned in conversation who was never in the room, which is gracefully handled by the system.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Discord Integration Error: 'this.runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage' is undefined\nThe issue regarding `'this.runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage' is undefined` in Discord integration ([#43](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/43)) is considered fixed. The latest comment indicates that a pending pull request for `plugin-discord` (https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/41/commits/8c36bd8c9a13aaa103963a2093677a49ddee177a), when paired with `@elizaos/cli 1.7.1`, resolves this problem."

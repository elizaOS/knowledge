  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster Daily Update (Jun 15, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day's development focused on code refactoring for consistent terminology and addressing a critical bug related to environment variable settings. A new pull request was opened to standardize \"post\" to \"cast\" terminology.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **Codebase Terminology Refinement:**\n    *   Docstrings were added to `refactor/farcaster-post-to-cast-nomenclature` to improve code documentation, as requested by @wtfsayo ([#5](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/5)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n\n*   A new pull request, [#3](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/3), was opened to replace 'post' terminology with 'cast' throughout the codebase, aiming for consistent language.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n*   **Environment Variable Configuration Fix:**\n    *   An issue regarding an error when enabling 'post' and 'dryrun' settings from the `.env` file was closed, with confirmation from @lalalune that it is now fixed ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/1)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\nNo new issues were opened on Jun 15, 2025.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n*   **Bedrock Integration Discussion:**\n    *   The discussion around integrating Bedrock as an LLM continued ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5117)). @wtfsayo initially suggested checking OpenAI plugin environments and later committed to adding a plugin for Bedrock. @furkannabisumji clarified that AWS Bedrock is not OpenAI compatible and later confirmed using a Bedrock gateway for OpenAI compatibility. @0xbbjoker announced the release of a dedicated `plugin-bedrock` and requested feedback.\n*   **API Endpoint Not Found for Rooms:**\n    *   The issue concerning a 404 error when calling the `/api/agents/{agentId}/rooms` endpoint was actively discussed and resolved ([#5121](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5121)). @wtfsayo clarified that the correct endpoint is `http://localhost:3000/api/memory/{agentId}/rooms` and provided a detailed explanation of the new channel-based messaging API structure, including endpoints for sending messages to and from agents, and how to find channel IDs. @exitsimulation confirmed the helpfulness of the explanation, noting the switch from \"rooms\" to \"channels.\""

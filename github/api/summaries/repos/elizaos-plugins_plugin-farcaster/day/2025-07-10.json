On July 10th, `scottrepreneur` reported experiencing the same issue on Mac with `v1.2.0`, suggesting that using hosted models is the main workaround. Subsequent comments on July 11th from `david-dina` suggested uninstalling and re-running the script, and `ChristopherTrimboli` stated the issue has been fixed in `v1.2.1` and provided a download link. The latest comment on July 13th from `wtfsayo` indicated that the local-ai plugin is being deprecated in favor of Ollama, though it might work on a second startup.\n\n### Twitter Client Creation Failures\nAn ongoing issue concerning the failure to create a Twitter Client with version 1.0.14 of the plugin was discussed [#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/36). On July 10th, `yasir23` reported experiencing the same error. The issue was later marked as fixed with the 1.2.0 update on July 12th by `RolandOne`."

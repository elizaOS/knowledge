A user confirmed that the problem persists on Arch Linux. A detailed diagnosis by Claude suggested that the root cause is likely missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in `@elizaos/core@1.6.1`, recommending users upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later. The ElizaOS team was advised to consider deprecating v1.6.1 and implement publish-time validation."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster Daily Update (Jun 16, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day's focus was on refining Farcaster terminology within the plugin for improved accuracy and consistency.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Farcaster Terminology Refinement\nThe plugin underwent a significant refactoring to align its nomenclature with Farcaster's native terminology. Specifically, the generic term \"post\" was updated to \"cast\" across various files, ensuring better integration and understanding within the Farcaster ecosystem while maintaining backward compatibility. This change impacted numerous files including configuration, tests, and service managers. ([#4](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/4))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### CLI Test Command Monorepo Requirement\nA new issue was opened regarding the `@elizaos/cli` test command, which incorrectly requires a monorepo root for standalone projects. This prevents running E2E tests outside of the ElizaOS monorepo structure. ([#5142](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5142))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Callback from plugin action not making it to end user response in chat ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5017))\nDiscussions continued regarding the issue where callbacks from plugin actions are not reaching the end-user response in chat. @0xbbjoker suggested a clean installation of dependencies (`rm -rf node_modules && rm -rf dist && rm -rf bun.lock`) and ensuring `package.json` is clean to resolve potential caching issues. @jonathanprozzi confirmed he would try a fresh project setup after updating to version 1.0.9, as he was still not seeing responses. @alex-nax noted that while it's working on his side, there seems to be an unwanted reply before the desired action.\n\n### What happened to agent-twitter-client repository ? ([#5074](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5074))\nThe discussion on this issue clarified that the `agent-twitter-client` repository was taken down due to a cease and desist request from X (formerly Twitter), which now requires a $5k/month fee for API access.\n\n### bedrock ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5117))\nThe issue of integrating AWS Bedrock as an LLM was discussed. @furkannabisumji inquired about the lack of options in the CLI for Bedrock integration, noting that Bedrock is not OpenAI compatible. @wtfsayo stated that a plugin for Bedrock would be added soon.\n\n### /api/agents/{agentId}/rooms -> API endpoint not found ([#5121](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5121))\nThe discussion revolved around the `404` error when trying to access the `/api/agents/{agentId}/rooms` endpoint. @wtfsayo clarified that the correct endpoint is `/api/memory/{agentId}/rooms` and provided details on the new channel-based messaging architecture, including endpoints for sending messages to and from agents, and how to find channel IDs. @exitsimulation confirmed the confusion due to the switch from \"rooms\" to \"channels\" and the outdated documentation.\n\n### Service Types and Test Services ([#4914](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/4914))\nThe latest comment from @claude (on July 13, 2025) indicates that the implementation of service types and test services is complete. This includes a new `getServicesByType()` method, standardized interfaces for various service types (PDF, Video, Browser, Transcription, WebSearch, Email, Message, Post), and comprehensive dummy services for testing. The update also notes changes to the runtime to support multiple services per type and extensive test coverage. A pull request was generated for these changes."

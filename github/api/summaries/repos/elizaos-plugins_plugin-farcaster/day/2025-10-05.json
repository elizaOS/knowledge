User matteo-brandolino provided a detailed analysis, suggesting the issue might stem from missing type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package for version 1.6.1. They noted that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the problem. They also shared a screenshot illustrating the errors and confirmed that the project functions correctly when run with `elizaos start`, indicating a type-related problem rather than a runtime one."

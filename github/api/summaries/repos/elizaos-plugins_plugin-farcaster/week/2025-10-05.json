  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts centered on infrastructure improvement and collaborative troubleshooting. A new pull request was introduced to automate dependency management using Renovate, aiming to enhance long-term project maintenance. The primary focus, however, was a deep-dive investigation into a critical import error affecting users of Eliza CLI v1.61. Community members and the core team worked together to diagnose the issue, which appears to stem from a dependency problem within the `@elizaos/core` package.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nNo new features or fixes were merged this week. Development activity focused on preparing for future maintenance automation.\n\n- **Dependency Management Automation:** A new pull request ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/12)) was opened to add a Renovate configuration. This initiative aims to streamline the process of keeping project dependencies up-to-date, reducing manual maintenance overhead.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management was focused on investigating a single, high-impact active issue, with no new issues reported or closed.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were resolved this week.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** The main focus was on the ongoing investigation into **Import Errors with Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/6031))**.\n    - Discussion progressed significantly, with user `matteo-brandolino` providing a detailed analysis suggesting the root cause is missing TypeScript declaration files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, specifically version 1.6.1.\n    - The issue was confirmed to be reproducible on Arch Linux, adding valuable environmental context.\n    - The current diagnosis points to a problem in the build/publish pipeline of the core dependency rather than the Farcaster plugin itself. The recommended workaround for affected users is to upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or a later version.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThis week highlighted strong community collaboration in troubleshooting. User `matteo-brandolino` was instrumental in driving the investigation of issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/6031), providing detailed reports, analysis, and follow-up testing across different environments. This collaborative effort between community contributors and the core team was crucial in narrowing down the source of the complex dependency issue."

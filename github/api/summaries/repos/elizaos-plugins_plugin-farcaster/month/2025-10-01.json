  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster Monthly Report (October 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nOctober's efforts were centered on improving project stability and maintenance. While no new features were merged, significant progress was made in diagnosing a critical import error affecting users of Eliza CLI v1.61. This investigation, driven by detailed community analysis, identified a root cause within a core dependency. Concurrently, work began on automating dependency management with the introduction of a Renovate configuration, signaling a proactive move towards long-term repository health.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nNo new features or bug fixes were merged this month. Development activity focused on foundational maintenance and tooling.\n\n- **Dependency Management Automation:** A pull request ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/12)) was opened to add a Renovate configuration file. This initiative aims to streamline the process of keeping project dependencies up-to-date, reducing manual maintenance overhead and preventing future compatibility issues.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month was focused entirely on investigating a single, high-impact active issue. No new issues were opened, and none were closed.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** The primary focus was the ongoing investigation into issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/6031), concerning import errors when using Eliza CLI v1.61. Community members provided crucial analysis, suggesting the problem stemmed from missing TypeScript declaration files in the `@Elizaos/core@1.6.1` package. Further diagnosis confirmed this, with the recommended workaround being an upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or newer. This issue highlights a dependency-related blocker for users on the affected version.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration was most evident in the troubleshooting efforts for issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/6031).

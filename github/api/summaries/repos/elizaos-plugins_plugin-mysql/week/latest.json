While there were no new code contributions or feature developments, key progress was made in issue triage. Two issues were closed, providing important clarifications on plugin setup and the new, centralized location for project documentation. This activity helps streamline the onboarding process for new users and contributors.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThere were no new technical developments, pull requests, or code changes merged this week. The project's development activity was paused, with efforts directed towards issue management.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe week's efforts centered on resolving user-facing questions and clarifying project structure.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** Two issues were closed, enhancing clarity for the community:\n    - **Setup Guidance:** A helpful tip was provided in issue [#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/1), which noted that disabling other plugins can resolve table creation problems during setup.\n    - **Documentation Location:** Issue [#6122](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/6122) was closed, clarifying that documentation has been migrated from the local `packages/docs/` directory to the dedicated `elizaos/docs` repository.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened this week, and there were no significant discussions reported on existing active issues.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity interaction this week was focused on providing support and information rather than collaborative coding. The closure of the two informational issues demonstrates a commitment to maintaining clear guidance for users, even during periods of lower development velocity. No significant PR discussions or new contributor activity was noted in the reports."

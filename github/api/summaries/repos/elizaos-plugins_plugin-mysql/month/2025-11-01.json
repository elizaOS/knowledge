  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nDevelopment in November focused on restoring core functionality and addressing user-reported setup challenges. The key achievement was the re-enabling of the database migration feature, a critical step for plugin initialization. Concurrently, community discussion on active issues highlighted difficulties some users face during setup, specifically regarding intermittent behavior, suggesting a potential need for documentation improvements or a more streamlined onboarding process.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month centered on improving the plugin's foundational capabilities.\n\n- **Database Migration Re-enabled**\n  A significant update restored the ability for the plugin to create tables automatically. This functionality, often referred to as migrations, was re-enabled through changes in `src/mysql2/manager.ts` ([#2](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/pull/2)), ensuring a smoother setup experience for users.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management this month was focused on understanding and resolving existing user-facing problems.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  Based on the available data, no issues were closed in November.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  No new issues were opened. However, discussion continued on issue [#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/37), which concerns challenges in getting the plugin to function correctly. A user initially reported that the plugin would post a few times and then stop, but later noted that following the `readme` instructions carefully resolved the problem. This feedback suggests the setup process may be a source of difficulty for users.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity interaction was centered on troubleshooting and user support within the issue tracker. The discussion on issue [#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/37) serves as the primary example of collaboration, where user feedback helped clarify that setup instructions were effective, even if the initial experience proved challenging."

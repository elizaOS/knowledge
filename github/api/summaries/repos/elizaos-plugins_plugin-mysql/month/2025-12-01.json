  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql Monthly Report (December 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nDecember was a quiet month for the MySQL plugin, with development activity focused on maintenance and user support. No new code was committed. The primary activity involved resolving user-facing issues related to documentation and initial plugin setup, ensuring users have clear guidance. A key clarification was made regarding the new location for all ElizaOS documentation, which has been centralized in a separate repository.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThere were no new technical developments, features, or bug fixes reported for the plugin during December. All development activity was paused, with the focus shifting entirely to issue management.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe month's work centered on clarifying information for users and maintainers through issue resolution.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** Two issues were closed, providing important guidance. Issue [#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/1) was resolved with a helpful tip for users, suggesting that other plugins may need to be disabled for successful table creation during setup. Issue [#6122](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql/issues/6122) clarified that documentation has been migrated from the local `packages/docs/` directory to the centralized `elizaos/docs` repository.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, and there were no ongoing discussions on active issues reported during this period.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity interaction was minimal in December, consistent with the pause in active development. The activity was limited to closing two informational issues, with no pull requests opened or significant discussions taking place."

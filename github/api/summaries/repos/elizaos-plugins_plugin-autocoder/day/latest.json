User matteo-brandolino provided their OS as Arch Linux and shared detailed output from `bun x tsc --noEmit`, which showed numerous `TS2305` errors indicating missing exported members from `@elizaos/core`. This output further supported the claim that the issue is specific to version 1.6.1 of `@elizaos/core` and not present in earlier or later versions. The user also noted that the problem might be related to type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package, potentially referencing source files not included in the published package."

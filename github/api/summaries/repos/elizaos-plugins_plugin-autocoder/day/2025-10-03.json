  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder Daily Update (Oct 3, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day focused on dependency updates, with a significant upgrade to Zod v4 and other package bumps. An issue regarding import errors with Eliza CLI 1.61 was actively discussed and investigated.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Dependency and Version Updates\nThe application's version was bumped to 1.3.3, and key dependencies were upgraded to their latest compatible versions for improved stability. A pull request was opened to update to Zod v4 and other dependencies, though it is noted as \"Not tested.\" ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/pull/1))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- **Zod v4 and Dependency Update**: A pull request was opened to update the project to Zod v4 and other dependencies. The PR is currently in review and marked as \"Not tested.\" ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/pull/1))\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed on this date.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened on this date.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Migration to Zod v4\nThe issue [#5999](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/5999) discusses the migration of all dependencies and plugins to Zod v4. Stan has initiated approximately 20-25 PRs across various plugins, including `plugin-autocoder`, to update dependencies to the latest compatible Zod version.\n\n### Eliza CLI Import Errors\nIssue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/6031) reports that imports are not found in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61. @0xbbjoker tested the issue and confirmed it works on their side with version 1.6.1, requesting more steps to reproduce. @matteo-brandolino clarified that the issue occurs in a newly created project using `elizaos create` and seems related to types from the `@Elizaos/core` package, despite the project working as expected when run with `elizaos start`."

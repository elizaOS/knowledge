  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder Daily Update (Oct 5, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day's activity focused on addressing a critical import error in `index.ts` with Eliza CLI 1.61, with discussions around potential causes and solutions. A new pull request was opened to add Renovate configuration.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#2](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/pull/2), was opened to add Renovate configuration, aiming to automate dependency updates.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Troubleshooting Import Errors in Eliza CLI 1.61\nDiscussion continued on [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/6031) regarding \"Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61\". On October 5th, `matteo-brandolino` suggested the issue might stem from missing type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package for version 1.6.1, noting that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using newer versions resolves the problem. This comment followed `0xbbjoker`'s earlier suggestion to check the IDE's TSC compiler and provided steps to re-install dependencies, as they could not reproduce the issue on their end. `matteo-brandolino` had previously confirmed the issue occurs in a newly created project and provided a screenshot of the errors."

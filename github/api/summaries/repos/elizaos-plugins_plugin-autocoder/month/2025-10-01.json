  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder Monthly Report (October 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nOctober's efforts centered on dependency modernization and collaborative bug investigation. A significant push was made to upgrade core dependencies, including a migration to Zod v4, and to automate future updates by introducing Renovate. A critical import error related to Eliza CLI v1.61 became a primary focus, with community members actively collaborating to diagnose the root cause. This period highlighted the project's commitment to maintaining a healthy, up-to-date codebase while showcasing the strength of its community in troubleshooting complex issues.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month focused on improving project maintenance and stability through dependency management.\n\n- **Dependency Modernization:** A key initiative was updating the project's dependencies. A pull request ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/pull/1)) was opened to upgrade to Zod v4 and other packages, part of a wider effort across the ElizaOS ecosystem to migrate to the new version ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/5999)). The application version was also bumped to 1.3.3.\n- **Automation for Dependency Updates:** To streamline future maintenance, a pull request ([#2](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/pull/2)) was opened to add a Renovate configuration, which will help automate the process of keeping dependencies current.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nNo issues were closed in this period, but significant progress was made in diagnosing an active, high-priority bug.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed in the observed timeframe.\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - No new issues were opened directly in the repository.\n    - The most significant activity was the collaborative investigation into issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/6031), concerning import errors when using Eliza CLI v1.61. Community members traced the problem to a likely issue with missing type definition files in the `@Elizaos/core` package for that specific version. Contributor `matteo-brandolino` provided detailed diagnostic output, including `tsc` errors, which strongly supported this hypothesis and helped narrow down the problem for the core team.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was a standout feature of the month, particularly in problem-solving. The discussion on issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/6031) demonstrated effective collaboration between users and maintainers. The detailed bug reports and diagnostics provided by `matteo-brandolino`, and the responsive troubleshooting from `0xbbjoker`, exemplified a healthy and engaged open-source community working together to resolve a blocking issue. Additionally, the Zod v4 migration, coordinated by Stan across numerous plugins, shows a strong, collaborative effort to maintain consistency across the entire ElizaOS project ecosystem."

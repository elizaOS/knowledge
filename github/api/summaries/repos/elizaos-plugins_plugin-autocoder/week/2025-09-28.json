  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder Weekly Report (Sep 28 - 4, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts centered on foundational maintenance and dependency modernization. The primary focus was a significant, project-wide migration to Zod v4 to enhance stability, which involved updates across numerous plugins and core dependencies. In parallel, the team began investigating a newly reported import issue affecting project creation with the latest Eliza CLI, highlighting a continued commitment to developer experience and toolchain reliability.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week was concentrated on improving the project's underlying stability and compatibility.\n\n- **Dependency and Version Updates:** The project was bumped to version 1.3.3. A key technical effort involved upgrading dependencies to their latest compatible versions, most notably migrating the entire project to Zod v4. This update, captured in PR [#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/pull/1), aims to ensure long-term stability and leverage the latest features of the validation library.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management focused on a major migration effort and a new, high-priority bug investigation.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** Based on the available data, no issues were closed this week.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - **Zod v4 Migration ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/5999)):** A significant ongoing effort is the migration to Zod v4. This is a large-scale task spanning approximately 20-25 pull requests across the ElizaOS ecosystem, including `plugin-autocoder`, to ensure all plugins and core packages are aligned.\n    - **Eliza CLI Import Errors ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/6031)):** An important issue was reported concerning projects created with `elizaos create` using Eliza CLI v1.61. Users are experiencing import errors for types from `@Elizaos/core`, even though the project runs correctly with `elizaos start`. The problem appears to be environment-specific and is under active investigation.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration was evident in the coordinated effort to tackle large-scale maintenance tasks and respond to community-reported issues.\n\n- The migration to Zod v4 ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/5999)) demonstrates significant cross-repository collaboration, with contributor Stan leading the charge across multiple plugins.\n- The active discussion and investigation into the Eliza CLI import issue ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/6031)) showcases a responsive feedback loop between users and maintainers, with the team working to diagnose a problem that impacts the new user setup experience."

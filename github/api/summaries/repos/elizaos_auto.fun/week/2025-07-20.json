  "content": "# elizaos/auto.fun Weekly Report (Jul 20 - 26, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts centered on improving the project's build infrastructure and addressing foundational technical debt. The most significant development was a major refactoring of the logging system, migrating from Pino to Adze to resolve critical compatibility issues with Bun's binary compilation process. This work was carefully executed to maintain API compatibility and avoid breaking changes. Additionally, a new issue was raised concerning the project's smart contract, highlighting that it is based on an outdated version and will require future updates.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n- **Build System Compatibility & Logging Refactor**\n  To resolve `pino-pretty` errors encountered during `bun export` builds, a migration from the Pino logger to Adze was initiated and completed at the code level ([#5673](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/5673)). The `ElizaLogger` class was rewritten using Adze while preserving the existing pino-compatible API, ensuring zero breaking changes for the 182 files that depend on it. Key features such as custom log levels, Sentry integration, and agent context binding were successfully maintained. The migration is now pending final verification via `bun install`, `bun test`, and `bun build`.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  Based on the available reports, no issues were closed this week.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  A significant new issue was opened regarding the project's smart contract ([#521](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/521)). It notes that the current Autofun contract is based on an old version of the Pumpfun smart contract and is missing key features, such as a global vault, present in the newer version.\n\n  The most active issue this week was the Pino to Adze logger migration ([#5673](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/5673)). Discussion confirmed that the code migration is complete, with focus now shifting to the final verification and testing phase.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was focused within the active issue for the logger migration ([#5673](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/5673)). A detailed update from contributor \"claude\" outlined the status of the migration, its non-breaking nature, and the next steps required for completion, keeping the team aligned on the progress of this critical infrastructure task."

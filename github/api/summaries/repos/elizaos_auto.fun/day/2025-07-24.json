  "content": "# elizaos/auto.fun Daily Update (Jul 24, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe primary focus today was on addressing compatibility issues with the Bun build process, specifically by initiating a migration from Pino to Adze for logging. A new issue regarding the Autofun smart contract's outdated base was also opened.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Logger Compatibility for Bun Builds\nAn effort was initiated to replace the Pino logger with Adze to resolve `pino-pretty` errors encountered during Bun export builds. This migration aims to ensure compatibility with Bun's binary compilation process, maintaining the existing logging API and features. The task is code-complete and awaiting `bun install`, `bun test`, and `bun build` verification. ([#5673](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/5673))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Smart Contract Outdated Version\nA new issue was opened highlighting that the Autofun smart contract is based on an old version of the Pumpfun smart contract, specifically noting the absence of a global vault in the newer version. ([#521](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/521))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Pino to Adze Logger Migration ([#5673](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/5673))\nThe discussion on this issue centers around the ongoing migration from the Pino logger to Adze to resolve `pino-pretty` compatibility issues with Bun's binary compilation. The latest comment from \"claude\" indicates that the code migration is complete. The `ElizaLogger` class has been rewritten using Adze while maintaining a pino-compatible API, ensuring zero breaking changes for the 182 files that use the logger. Key features like custom log levels, `InMemoryDestination`, environment variable configuration, Sentry integration, and agent context binding have been preserved. The next steps involve running `bun install`, `bun test`, and `bun build` to fully verify the migration."

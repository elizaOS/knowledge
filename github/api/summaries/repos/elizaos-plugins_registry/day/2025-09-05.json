Discussions continued on existing issues, including a build failure and a plugin visibility problem, with some progress made on troubleshooting.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n- **Registry Expansion:** Ten new plugins were proposed for addition to the registry, significantly broadening the available tools for ElizaOS agents. These include various \"gorpy\" themed plugins and \"jello\" themed plugins.

([#5856](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5856))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNone\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n- **Agent Won't Respond to Twitter Mentions:** A user inquired if the issue persists, following a previous suggestion to update the CLI and `plugin-twitter` version. ([#4921](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4921))\n- **Build Failure in @elizaos/core:** A user reported being unable to reproduce the build failure, suggesting it might be fixed. This issue is blocking testing of advanced mocking, natural language agent interaction, and dynamic plugin loading. ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5738))\n- **Plugin Not Visible in PR After Publish:** A user provided a link to a comparison, and `yungalgo` suggested adding a commit to the PR to scope the npm package correctly, changing \"plugin-delta\" to \"@1BDO/plugin-delta\" due to a bug in the code. ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5813))"

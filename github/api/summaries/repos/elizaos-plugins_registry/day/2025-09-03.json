  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Sep 3, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw new pull requests opened to add two new plugins to the registry, `plugin-delta` and `@standujar/plugin-composio`. Discussions continued on an existing issue regarding plugin visibility after publishing, with troubleshooting steps provided.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo completed work to report for this period.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nTwo new pull requests were opened today to expand the plugin registry:\n- [#218](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/218) Add plugin-delta to registry\n- [#217](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/217) Add @standujar/plugin-composio to registry\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Visibility and Publishing Process Clarification\nDiscussions continued on [#5813](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5813), where a user reported their `plugin-delta-0.1.0` was successfully published to npm but not visible in the registry's pull requests. The user provided detailed logs of their `elizaos publish --npm` command, showing successful npm publication but also a message indicating \"NPM publishing currently does not update the registry.\"\n\n`yungalgo` provided extensive troubleshooting, explaining that the `--npm` flag bypasses registry and GitHub steps, focusing solely on npm publication. They advised the user to:\n- Remove the registry clone from their organization.\n- Run `elizaos publish` locally without the `--npm` flag.\n- Consider altering the plugin's name if npm throws an error due to an existing package.\n- Emphasized that the `elizaos publish` command should automatically handle the PR submission to the registry.\n\n`1BDO` later confirmed a pull request was opened, linking to [#218](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/218).\n\n### Rate Limiting and API Usage for Plugins\nDiscussion on [#40](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/40) continued with `ChuXo` reporting the implementation of a rate limiter to prevent exceeding the monthly read limit for posts, specifically for the Free Tier. This aims to address concerns about high API usage at startup."

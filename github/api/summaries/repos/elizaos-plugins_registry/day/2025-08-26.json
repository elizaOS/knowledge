Key achievements include implementing alphabetical sorting for registry generation, integrating and enhancing the Claude Code review workflow, and adding a new plugin.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Registry Generation and Consistency\nThe registry generation process was improved by adding alphabetical sorting for entries and the final output, ensuring consistent ordering. This involved changes to `index.json` and `scripts/generate-registry.js`. ([#207](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/207))\n\n### Advanced Code Review Automation\nThe repository integrated and subsequently enhanced the Claude Code review workflow. This enhancement includes comprehensive validation for plugin registry contributions, such as verifying NPM packages using `npm view`. These updates are reflected in `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml` and `.github/workflows/claude.yml`. ([#208](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/208), [#206](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/206))\n\n### New Plugin Addition\nThe \"polymarket\" plugin was added to the registry, following the established registry update checklist.

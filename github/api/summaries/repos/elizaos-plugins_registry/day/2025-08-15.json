  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Aug 15, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's focus was on resolving critical publishing issues and providing guidance on plugin development. A new plugin idea for cryptocurrency analysis was also proposed.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\nNo new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n**Plugin Publishing Reliability**\nThe issue where the `elizaos publish --npm` command reported success but failed to publish was resolved. The solution involved updating the package name to remove the `@elizaos` scope and ensuring the `package.json` matched the current plugin template structure. ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5754))\n\n**Plugin Testing Guidance**\nGuidance was provided for a user experiencing consistent test failures related to WebSocket mocks. The resolution involved ensuring mock setup occurred before imports and using consistent mocking libraries. ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5770))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n**New Plugin Proposal**\nA new issue was opened to propose the \"Token Metrics Plugin,\" a comprehensive cryptocurrency analysis plugin leveraging 20 Token Metrics API endpoints and AI-powered insights. ([#202](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/202))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n**Plugin Testing Guidance ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5770))**\nThe latest comment from 1BDO confirms that moving the WebSocket mock setup before imports successfully resolved the persistent test failures, allowing the service to use the mock instead of attempting real connections. The user also expressed satisfaction with Eliza's \"ASK AI\" documentation.\n\n**Critical: Plugin Publishing Fails with False Success Reports ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5754))**\nThe issue was successfully resolved today. The latest comment from monilpat confirms that the plugins have been published, attributing the fix to the legacy plugin naming change suggested by yungalgo."

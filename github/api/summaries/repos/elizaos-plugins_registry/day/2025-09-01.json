  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Sep 1, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's focus was on a critical bug fix related to semantic versioning in the registry, ensuring correct plugin compatibility detection. Discussions also continued on existing issues, particularly around image generation in Discord and a proposed CLI refactor.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Registry Compatibility Fixes\nA significant bug fix was implemented to correct how the registry classifies plugin compatibility. This involved switching from point satisfaction to semantic version range intersection for v0 and v1 bands, resolving misclassification issues. ([#214](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/214))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### CLI Refactoring Initiative\nA new issue was opened to discuss and plan the refactoring of the Eliza CLI. The goal is to simplify the CLI by delegating more logic to project directories, moving away from the current overly complex structure. ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5860))\n\n### Project Creation Path Error\nA new issue was reported concerning a \"path not found\" error when attempting to create a new project, specifically related to a missing `package.json` module. ([#5856](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5856))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Image Generation Not Working in Discord ([#5809](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5809))\nThe discussion on this issue continued with a new comment from `tcm390` stating that the issue has been fixed in a related PR ([https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5861](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5861)). Previously, `1BDO` suggested running with debug logging to diagnose the problem, and `harperaa` confirmed that image generation works in the web UI but not in Discord, despite correct permissions, and provided logs. The initial comprehensive advice from `1BDO` focused on checking Discord bot permissions, verifying bot setup, environment configuration, plugin loading, and log entries.\n\n### Refactor Eliza CLI ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5860))\nThis newly opened issue saw significant discussion. `standujar` provided a detailed progress update on the CLI refactor, outlining architectural changes, delegation of runtime to projects, argument passthrough, and a restructured project starter. They also proposed a clear distinction of responsibilities for the server package, CLI, and starter projects. `wtfsayo` agreed with the general direction but expressed concerns about minimal changes to projects and suggested replicating how `mintlify cli` works. `odilitime` cautioned against syncing groups of functions across projects if logic is moved out of the CLI. The next steps involve auditing, migrating, and cleaning up tests.\n\n### Path Not Found ([#5856](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5856))\n`standujar` requested more information from the reporter, `MagdiejamesNYC`, including the CLI version and any other relevant details, to help diagnose the \"Cannot find module\" error during project creation."

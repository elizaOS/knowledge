  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Jun 27, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day saw the addition of two new plugins to the registry, expanding the available integrations for ElizaOS. Discussions also began on providing webhook options for improved message initiation.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Plugin Registry Expansion\nTwo new plugins were proposed for addition to the registry, enhancing the available functionalities for ElizaOS.\n- Added `@bealers/plugin-mattermost` to the registry. ([#183](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/183))\n- Added the `TokenMetrics` plugin to the registry. ([#182](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/182))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#183](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/183): This PR proposes adding the `@bealers/plugin-mattermost` plugin to the registry.\n- [#182](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/182): This PR proposes adding the `TokenMetrics` plugin to the registry.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Webhook Integration for Plugins\nDiscussion continued on issue [#6](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6), which explores providing an option for webhooks to initiate new messages, as an alternative to polling. The latest comment from wtfsayo confirms that plugins can mount routes to the ElizaOS server, making webhook implementation feasible without significant complexity. This suggests a path forward for improving user experience and reducing the cost associated with frequent polling."

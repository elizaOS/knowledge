  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Sep 2, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day's development focused on expanding the plugin registry with new additions and continued active discussion on the significant refactoring of the Eliza CLI, aiming for a more modular and streamlined architecture.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo completed work to report for features added, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, tests added, or other work.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nTwo new pull requests were opened today, both aiming to add the `@testorg-eliza/plugin-sourcegraph` to the registry:\n- [#216](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/216) Add @testorg-eliza/plugin-sourcegraph to registry\n- [#215](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/215) Add @testorg-eliza/plugin-sourcegraph to registry\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Eliza CLI Refactoring Discussion\nDiscussion continued on [#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5860) regarding the refactoring of the Eliza CLI. The latest comments indicate ongoing progress and refinement of the proposed architecture.\n\n- **Latest Updates:** `standujar` provided an update on September 2nd at 16:08:40Z, referencing `#5864`, and at 08:52:23Z, stating \"Restarting from clean!\".\n- **Architectural Proposals:** `standujar` proposed a clear distinction of responsibilities: a `@eliza/server` package for agent lifecycle, plugin loading, database, and character management, and a streamlined `@eliza/cli` for delegation and remote control. Starter projects would handle composition roots.\n- **Community Feedback:** `wtfsayo` agreed with the general direction, suggesting a model similar to Mintlify CLI where the `start` command wraps server initialization. `odilitime` expressed caution about moving logic \"into projects\" if it leads to duplicated function groups across projects, to which `standujar` requested examples for clarification.\n- **Progress Report:** On September 1st, `standujar` provided a detailed progress update, outlining completed phases (autonomous starter, CLI delegation, argument passthrough, stdio inheritance) and a restructured project starter. The end-to-end workflow for `elizaos create` and `elizaos start` is reported to be working smoothly.\n- **Next Steps:** The immediate focus is on auditing and migrating tests, ensuring proper delegation, template structure, mode switching, and cleaning up outdated tests."

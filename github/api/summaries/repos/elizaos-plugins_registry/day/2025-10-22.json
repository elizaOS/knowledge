  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, a new plugin for self-sovereign identity with the Nuggets platform was added. Discussions continued on a recently closed issue regarding plugin documentation and a new issue emerged concerning a module not found error in the CLI.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### New Plugin Integration\n- A new \"nuggets\" plugin was added, enabling self-sovereign identity interactions and data verification with the Nuggets platform. ([#236](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/236))\n- The `index.json` file was updated to reflect the new plugin entry.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- No new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n- No issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### CLI Module Resolution Error\n- A new issue was reported where the ElizaOS CLI fails with a \"Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'\" error after installation. ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6088))\n- This appears to be a bundling issue in the published npm package, as building from source resolves the problem.\n- A workaround involves using the CLI from a local clone of the repository.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Plugin Documentation and Scaffolding Issues ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6070))\nThe discussion on this recently closed issue continued today, with user `ryanmstokes` expressing significant frustration over the documentation and framework's usability, stating they spent a week trying to get it to work and ultimately moved to another framework. `yungalgo` engaged with `ryanmstokes`, apologizing for the frustration and requesting more specific details about the challenges faced (e.g., OS, model provider, database) to understand and address the issues. `ryanmstokes` committed to providing detailed feedback."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Jul 15, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, the registry saw an update with the publication of the `plugin-bonsai`. Discussions continued on an active issue regarding Twitter API rate limits and timeline fetching.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Plugin Registry Updates\n- The `plugin-bonsai` has been published to the registry, with all checklist items for registry inclusion verified, including correct NPM package naming, GitHub URL formatting, and file placement. ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/191))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Twitter API Rate Limit and Timeline Fetching Issues\nDiscussions continued on the issue of \"Failed to fetch Home timeline\" ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38)), which is causing 429 API limit errors even when `search enabled` is false. Users are experiencing \"Too Many Requests\" errors despite being on version 1.2.16, which was supposed to include a new system for timeline fetching. The core of the discussion revolves around the Twitter API subscription tiers, with clarification that the \"Basic\" tier (costing $200/month) is required to avoid these rate limits, unlike the free tier. A user inquired about the specific rate limit for the $200 tier."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Jul 7, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, the registry expanded with the addition of `plugin-desearch`. Debugging continued on critical issues, including Windows plugin loading failures and Twitter client initialization errors, with new insights and reproduction steps identified.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n### Plugin Registry Expansion\n*   Added `plugin-desearch` (version 0.1.2) to the registry, enabling seamless integration with Desearch for enhanced search capabilities. ([#187](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/187))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n### Twitter Client Initialization Failures\n*   A new issue was reported regarding `Failed to create Twitter Client (1.0.14)` ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/36)). Users are experiencing this error after migrating agents to V2 and updating the Twitter plugin to version 1.0.14.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Windows Plugin Loading Failures\nDiscussion on [#5407](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5407) (Fails to load @elizaos/plugin-openai and @elizaos/plugin-bootstrap on Windows) continued with new developments. @gcbsumid confirmed the issue persists even with the v1.0.19 release, providing screenshots of the failure. @SYMBaiEX reproduced the bug, also providing detailed screenshots, and is actively researching a fix.\n\n### Twitter Client Initialization Error\nOn [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31) (Twitter Client Initialization Error), @RolandOne noted that the latest 1.0.14 `plugin-twitter` should address the initial error, but reported a new error related to memory insertion during client creation. Other users, @yasir23 and @joaoCarvalho1000, also reported experiencing the same issue."

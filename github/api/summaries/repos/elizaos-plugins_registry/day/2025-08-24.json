  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Aug 24, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day's development focused on expanding plugin offerings with a new Vercel AI Gateway plugin. Discussions continued on an existing issue regarding agent knowledge retrieval, with new user reports confirming the problem.\n \n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo completed work or merged pull requests were reported for this date.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#204](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/204), was opened to add the Vercel AI Gateway Plugin to the registry.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\nNo issues were closed on this date.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\nNo new issues were reported on this date.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Agent Knowledge Retrieval Challenges\nDiscussions continued on [#14](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/14), where users are experiencing issues with agents not responding with knowledge from ingested documents. A new comment from `bbsdevcollab` on August 24, 2025, confirms the problem, stating that despite successful document ingestion with one fragment, the agent fails to respond with knowledge even when questions are phrased similarly to the document content. This echoes earlier reports from `0xRabbidfly` and `matteo-brandolino`, indicating a persistent problem with RAG context awareness.\n\n### Token Metrics Plugin Integration\nOn [#202](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/202), `wtfsayo` commented on August 24, 2025, requesting a pull request for the Token Metrics Plugin, suggesting checking recently merged PRs for guidance. This indicates progress towards integrating a comprehensive cryptocurrency analysis plugin with 20 Token Metrics API endpoints and AI-powered insights."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Aug 13, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nThe day focused on expanding the plugin registry with two new additions. Significant progress was made in diagnosing and providing a solution for a critical plugin publishing failure, clarifying issues related to scoped package names and outdated templates.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Plugin Registry Expansion\nTwo new plugins were proposed for addition to the registry, indicating an expansion of available functionalities.\n- Added `plugin-fal-ai` to the registry via [#201](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/201).\n- Added `plugin-asd123` to the registry via [#200](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/200).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- **New Plugin Submissions:** Two new pull requests were opened to add plugins to the registry:\n    - [#201](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/201) \"Add plugin-fal-ai to registry\"\n    - [#200](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/200) \"Add plugin-asd123 to registry\"\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Critical Plugin Publishing Failure Diagnosis\nDiscussion on [#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5754) provided a detailed diagnosis and solution for the \"Critical: Plugin Publishing Fails with False Success Reports\" issue. The core problems identified were:\n- **Scoped Package Name Issue:** The use of scoped package names (e.g., `@elizaos/plugin-polygon`) without the corresponding npm organization or publish access leads to 404 errors during `npm publish`.\n- **Outdated Plugin Template:** The plugin in question was likely created with an older template, lacking the correct structure and configuration for successful publishing.\n\nA suggested fix was provided, advising users to:\n1. Update their `package.json` to use an unscoped package name (e.g., `plugin-polygon`).\n2. Ensure their `package.json` matches the current plugin template structure, recommending creating a fresh plugin to compare.\n3. Re-attempt publishing after these changes. The current template has been confirmed to work smoothly for publishing."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Jul 14, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's focus was on expanding the plugin registry with the addition of the Mattermost plugin. Discussions continued on two active issues, one concerning custom plugin callbacks and another regarding Twitter client initialization errors, with community members actively seeking solutions and providing insights.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **Plugin Registry Expansion**\n    *   Added `plugin-mattermost` to the registry, making it available for use within the ElizaOS ecosystem. ([#188](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/188))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n*   **Custom Plugin Callback Interference**\n    Discussion on [#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947) continued, focusing on a bug where a custom plugin's action callback is being replaced by the `ATTACHMENTS` provider. A user `tcm390` suggested checking for existing `GENERATE_IMAGE` actions in the bootstrap and potentially removing them to prevent conflicts. Previously, `claude` had identified the root cause in `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/index.ts` (lines 606-620), where the `ATTACHMENTS` provider modifies the state before it's passed to action callbacks. `claude` also proposed a fix to separate provider state composition from action callback processing and confirmed the issue's validity in the current codebase (v1.0.19).\n\n*   **Twitter Client Initialization Error**\n    Issue [#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31) saw continued reports of the Twitter client initialization error. `joaoCarvalho1000` reported experiencing the same issue. Earlier, `RolandOne` mentioned that `plugin-twitter` version 1.0.14 should fix the initial error but introduced a new memory-related error. `Ovodo` expressed concern about the inability to run agents autonomously on Twitter and sought suggestions, noting that older ElizaOS methods worked. `nccuong-vikki` speculated that the issue might be related to limitations of free Twitter API subscriptions."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Jul 1, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday saw a new plugin added to the registry and ongoing discussions on critical issues related to testing consistency, documentation, agent deployment, and CLI input standardization.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\nNo completed work to report for this period.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nA new pull request, [#185](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/185), was opened to add the `@elizaos/plugin-datai` to the registry.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Enhancing CLI Consistency and Test Reliability\nDiscussions continued on [#5218](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5218) regarding inconsistent `bun run test` behavior across packages. @ai16z-demirix confirmed they have started working on this issue, making progress on phase 1, and will take care of the complete issue. Similarly, on [#5295](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5295), which aims to standardize CLI input methods using `@clack/prompts`, @Ifechukwudaniel requested assignment to the issue.\n\n### Improving Documentation for Diverse Users\nIssue [#5234](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5234) focuses on overhauling documentation to cater to both simple users and developers. @Ifechukwudaniel requested assignment to this issue. @Megamindmaster provided detailed feedback, highlighting challenges faced by non-coders, such as inconsistent environment variable settings across different documentation sources and non-functional example JSON files, emphasizing the need for beginner-friendly resources.\n\n### Streamlining Eliza Agent Deployment\nThe discussion on [#5244](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5244) revolved around the best ways to deploy custom Eliza agents. @bealers shared their work on \"elizify,\" a project aiming for easy, secure, and reproducible Eliza installations, including a one-click Coolify install and solid `docker compose up` functionality, offering it as a community project. They also referenced an older, more brittle attempt at remote deployment. @wtfsayo suggested Railway and Render as potential platforms."

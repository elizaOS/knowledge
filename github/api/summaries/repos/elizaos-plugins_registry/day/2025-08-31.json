  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Aug 31, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday, the registry saw updates to its plugin listings, including a new entry for the Vercel AI Gateway plugin, expanding access to over 100 AI models. Discussions continued on critical issues like streaming support and Discord image generation.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n*   **Registry Updates and New Plugin Integration**\n    *   The `index.json` file was updated to include the `plugin-hedera` entry, ensuring proper naming conventions for potential NPM packages ([#212](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/212)).\n    *   A new `plugin-vercel-ai-gateway` was added to the registry, providing universal access to over 100 AI models via Vercel AI Gateway ([#213](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/213)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n*   **V3 Goals and Streaming Functionality** ([#4720](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4720))\n    *   Discussion continued regarding the implementation of streaming functionality. A user inquired about the status of streaming features and offered assistance, highlighting its importance for reducing response latency.\n    *   Previous analysis by `claude` confirmed that \"Streaming First\" is partially compatible with the current architecture, requiring updates to response handling patterns but offering a gradual migration path.\n\n*   **Optional Stream Responses for API Performance** ([#5060](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5060))\n    *   A user confirmed that they have implemented streaming support by modifying core files, leveraging existing Eliza AI package capabilities for streaming. They noted this is not an official solution but provides a working example.\n    *   Another user inquired about updates on implementing streaming, indicating ongoing interest in this feature for improving response times.\n\n*   **Image Generation Issues in Discord** ([#5809](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5809))\n    *   A user confirmed that generated images are not appearing in Discord, despite working in the web UI. They provided screenshots confirming correct Discord permissions and noted the absence of relevant logs for Discord-initiated image generation, unlike the web UI.\n    *   Previous comments provided comprehensive troubleshooting steps, including verifying Discord bot permissions (EMBED\\_LINKS, ATTACH\\_FILES, SEND\\_MESSAGES), checking environment configurations, and ensuring proper plugin loading."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Jul 22, 2025)\n\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on expanding the plugin registry with a new blockchain-related plugin. Additionally, a significant user support issue regarding Google API integration was resolved, providing valuable troubleshooting insights.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Plugin Registry Expansion\nA new plugin, `plugin-coti`, was added to the registry. This plugin enables private token operations and encrypted transactions on the COTI blockchain for ElizaOS. ([#193](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/193))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNone\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n### Google API Integration Troubleshooting\nAn issue concerning an agent not providing a reply when using the Google API was closed. The discussion clarified that the `@elizaos/plugin-google-genai` plugin exists and the primary cause of the problem was an incorrectly set `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` environment variable. Solutions included verifying the API key, setting it correctly in the `.env` file, and restarting the agent. ([#5664](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5664))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNone\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Google API Agent Reply Issue\nIssue [#5664](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5664) saw active discussion today, leading to its resolution. Initially, there was a misunderstanding about the existence of the `@elizaos/plugin-google-genai` plugin, which was quickly corrected. The core problem was identified as the agent receiving messages but not generating responses, pointing to an issue with the `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`. Users were advised to ensure the API key was correctly set in their environment variables. It was also noted that `bootstrap` and `sql` plugins are mandatory. The user confirmed the solution worked."

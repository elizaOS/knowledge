  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Jan 22, 2026)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on enhancing API reliability by fixing issues with missing API exports and inconsistent summary generation for days without activity. A new plugin for Cerebras was also proposed.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### API Export and Contributor Profile Fixes\nA critical issue preventing the export of `/api/index.json` and 1,433 contributor profiles was resolved. The fix involved dynamically detecting the `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines.yml` workflow, ensuring these essential API endpoints are correctly generated. This addresses the 404 errors previously encountered for these endpoints.\n### Consistent Overall Summary Generation\nThe system was updated to consistently generate overall summaries, even for days with no repository activity. Previously, such days resulted in 404 errors for summary API endpoints. Now, a \"No activity recorded\" message is generated, ensuring consistent API behavior and a clear distinction between a pipeline not running and a day with no activity.\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#249](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/249) Add Cerebras Plugin: This pull request proposes adding a new plugin for Cerebras.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### API Export and Contributor Profile Resolution\nThe issue where API index and contributor profiles were not exported due to a missing `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines` workflow has been fixed. The solution involved adding dynamic `SITE_URL` detection to the workflow, ensuring proper generation of `/api/index.json` and all contributor profiles. This resolves the 404 errors previously observed for these endpoints. ([#225](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/225))\n\n### Overall Summary Generation Consistency\nThe problem of overall summaries not being generated for days with no repository activity, leading to 404 API responses, has been addressed. The `generateOverallSummaryForInterval()` function was modified to always generate summaries, even when no repository activity exists, providing a \"No activity recorded\" message instead of skipping generation. This ensures consistent API behavior and a better developer experience. ([#226](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/226))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES"

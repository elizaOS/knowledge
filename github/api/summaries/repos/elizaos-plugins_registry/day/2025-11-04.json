  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Daily Update (Nov 4, 2025)\n## OVERVIEW \nToday's development focused on significant infrastructure enhancements, including a new billing system with Stripe integration, comprehensive chat performance optimizations, and a robust OAuth-based authentication system. Documentation and cloud CLI testing also saw major updates.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Billing and Payments Infrastructure\nA complete Stripe-backed billing subsystem was implemented, introducing four new database tables for customers, payment methods, invoices, and transactions. This includes six new backend API routes for managing customer, payment, top-up, invoice, and transaction operations, along with a TypeScript API client and seven new frontend components for a full billing page UI. Additionally, a comprehensive container billing system was developed, featuring a monthly cron job for cost deduction, payment failure handling with a 7-day grace period, and email notifications. This system also includes new database schemas, a `BillingService`, and REST API endpoints for billing management. ([#6123](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6123), [#6124](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6124))\n\n### Chat Performance and Reliability\nSignificant improvements were made to Eliza chat responsiveness and reliability. This involved adding a `ModelPerformanceMonitor` for real-time tracking, implementing per-model timeouts and exponential retry wrappers, and integrating fast model providers like Groq and Kimi. New documentation was added to guide model configuration and troubleshooting, ensuring faster response times and reduced timeouts. ([#6127](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6127))\n\n### Authentication and User Management\nA full OAuth and JWT authentication system was implemented to replace the existing API key flow. This includes new TypeScript types, OAuth configuration, JWT utilities, an authentication service, and database migrations for users, OAuth accounts, and wallet addresses. A new login page with support for Google, Twitter, GitHub, Apple, and wallet-based authentication was also developed, along with updated authentication middleware. ([#6126](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6126))\n\n### Documentation and Cloud CLI Testing\nA new public `/docs` UI was built, featuring an OpenAI-style API explorer, character setup guides, and an overview of the cloud architecture. This includes interactive code examples and comprehensive API key usage instructions. Additionally, a comprehensive test suite was added for ElizaOS cloud CLI commands, covering `deploy`, `containers`, and `login` functionalities, ensuring documentation accuracy and type consistency. ([#6128](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6128), [#6129](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6129))\n\n### Voice Infrastructure Development\nThe voice infrastructure was enhanced with browser-based voice generation for client-side TTS and optional server voice endpoints for premium users. This includes new client-side utilities and React hooks for browser TTS, server-side premium synthesis routers, and integration with compute embeddings for voice-to-vector search capabilities. ([#6130](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6130))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- **[#240](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/240) Add plugin-otaku-x402 to registry**: This pull request proposes adding a new plugin, `plugin-otaku-x402`, to the registry. The status of this PR is new and awaiting review.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n- None\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n- None\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n- **[#6122](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6122) Where did packages/docs/ go?**: The user inquired about the location of `packages/docs/`.

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Monthly Report (June 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nJune was a month of significant growth and stabilization for the ElizaOS plugin ecosystem. The registry expanded with the addition of eight new plugins, demonstrating a vibrant and growing developer community. Concurrently, the team resolved several long-standing and critical bugs related to plugin action callbacks, API behavior, and knowledge management, enhancing the platform's reliability. Key architectural discussions were initiated around improving logger customization, user identity management, and message initiation via webhooks, setting the stage for future core improvements.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThe primary focus of development work was the expansion and maintenance of the plugin registry.\n\n*   **Plugin Registry Expansion:** The ecosystem grew substantially with the addition of eight new plugins, broadening the capabilities available to ElizaOS agents. New additions include:\n    *   `@yungalgo/plugin-jellie` ([#177](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/177))\n    *   `@yungalgo/plugin-jello` ([#176](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/176))\n    *   `kudo` ([#179](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/179))\n    *   `plugin-bonsai` ([#181](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/181))\n    *   `TokenMetrics` ([#182](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/182))\n    *   `@bealers/plugin-mattermost` ([#183](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/183))\n    *   Proposals were also opened for `@yungalgo/plugin-coconut` ([#175](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/175)) and `@esscrypt/plugin-polkadot` ([#180](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/180)).\n\n*   **Registry Maintenance:** Efforts were made to ensure the registry's accuracy and integrity. This included updating `index.json` to reflect the migration of plugin repositories from the `notorious-d-e-v` to the `payai` GitHub organization ([#172](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/172)) and updating the `plugin-cardano` repository location ([#178](https://github.comcom/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/178)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThis month saw the resolution of several critical bugs and the start of important discussions on new features and architectural changes.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:**\n    *   **Callback and API Fixes:** A significant bug where callbacks from plugin actions failed to reach the end-user chat response was resolved ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5017)), improving the reliability of plugins like `plugin-evm`. Other stability fixes included resolving issues with successive agent replies ([#4940](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4940)) and room creation via the REST API ([#4955](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4955)).\n    *   **Functionality Restoration:** A long-standing issue with the Knowledge Management (RAG) feature was confirmed fixed in version 1.0.9 ([#5004](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5004)). A request for Bedrock LLM integration was addressed by the release of a dedicated plugin ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5117]).\n    *   **CLI and Configuration:** An issue with the `elizaos update` command was clarified and closed ([#5198](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5198)), and a `TEXT_EMBEDDING` handler error was resolved through correct agent character file configuration ([#5279](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5279)).\n\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Logger Customization:** A feature request was opened to allow downstream projects to customize the root logger configuration ([#5183](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5183)). This sparked a detailed discussion and a comprehensive implementation plan, signaling a key upcoming improvement for developers building on ElizaOS.\n    *   **User Identity Management:** A critical discussion is underway regarding user identity management after GitHub username changes ([#105](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/105)). The proposed solution involves using internal GitHub IDs as the primary key instead of usernames, a significant architectural change to prevent user data fragmentation.\n    *   **Plugin Development & Functionality:** Ongoing discussions highlight challenges in custom plugin development ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5260)) and persistent bugs in the Twitter plugin related to response formatting and delivery ([#26](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/26), [#29](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/29)).\n    *   **Future Enhancements:** Conversations began on providing webhook options for message initiation as an alternative to polling ([#6](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6)) and increasing the character file size limit ([#5268](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5268)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was strong in June, characterized by active problem-solving and a growing base of plugin contributors. The resolution of the callback issue ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5017)) showcased a healthy feedback loop between maintainers and users, with multiple community members confirming the fix.\n\nThe detailed technical discussion on logger customization ([#5183](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5183)) and user identity management ([#105](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/105)) highlights deep collaboration among core contributors like `claude`, `wtfsayo`, `standujar`, and `0xCardiE`. Furthermore, the submission of new plugins from various authors (e.g., `@yungalgo`, `@bealers`, `@esscrypt`) is a clear indicator of a healthy, expanding third-party developer ecosystem."

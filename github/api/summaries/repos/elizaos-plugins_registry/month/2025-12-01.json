  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Monthly Report (December 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nDecember was a month of strategic expansion for the plugin registry, reinforcing ElizaOS's commitment to both Web2 and Web3 ecosystems. Development focused exclusively on integrating new capabilities, with three significant plugins added to enhance agent functionality. These additions broaden the framework's reach into DeFi, decentralized social media, and communication. A notable theme was the move towards greater autonomy, exemplified by the addition of a self-hosted Farcaster plugin that reduces reliance on external APIs.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nAll development work this month centered on expanding the plugin ecosystem with new integrations.\n\n*   **New Plugin Integrations:** The registry was enhanced with three new plugins, expanding the capabilities available to ElizaOS agents.\n    *   A Moralis DeFi plugin (`@pyboom/plugin-moralis-v2`) was added to provide agents with Moralis v2 functionalities ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)).\n    *   An OpenChat integration (`@tonyflam/plugin-openchat`) was integrated, enabling agents to use OpenChat for communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n    *   A self-hosted Farcaster plugin (`plugin-farcaster-local-hub`) was introduced, allowing agents to connect to a local Snapchain/Hubble hub. This important addition removes dependencies on third-party APIs like Neynar and ensures data freshness ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nBased on the provided daily reports, there was no activity related to GitHub issues in December.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed this month.\n*   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened, and there were no noteworthy discussions on existing issues.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nWhile the integration of three new plugins indicates contributions from the community, the daily reports for December did not contain specific details about collaborative dynamics, such as high-discussion pull requests or issue threads. The work merged this month represents the primary collaborative signal."

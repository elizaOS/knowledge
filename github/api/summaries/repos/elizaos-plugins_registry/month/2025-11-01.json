  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Monthly Report (November 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nNovember's development focused on expanding the plugin registry with new capabilities, particularly in the Web3 and AI-driven financial analysis space. The primary theme was growth through the addition of new community-contributed plugins. Key additions provided new tools for Solana and AI16z trading insights, directly supporting the ElizaOS mission of creating a modular and extensible AI agent framework.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this month centered exclusively on growing the number of available plugins within the registry.\n\n### New Trading & Insights Plugins\nThe registry was enhanced with new plugins aimed at providing financial trading insights, expanding the toolkit for AI agents operating in this domain.\n- **AI16z Trading Insights**: Two related plugins were added to provide trading insights, including `plugin-ai16x402` ([#239](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/239)) and the more specific `@laurabee19802025/plugin-ai16x402` ([#238](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/238)).\n\nIn addition to the completed work, a pull request ([#237](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/237)) was opened to add a new plugin for Solana trading insights, `@laurabee19802025-max/plugin-kolscan`, signaling continued growth in Web3 functionality.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThere was no activity related to issues during this period. No new issues were opened, and no existing issues were closed or saw significant discussion.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this month was characterized by community-driven expansion of the plugin registry. All reported development activity came in the form of pull requests from the community to add new plugins. The submissions from contributors like `@laurabee19802025` and `@laurabee19802025-max` highlight the project's reliance on its user base to extend the capabilities of the ElizaOS ecosystem."

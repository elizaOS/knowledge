  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Jun 29 - 5, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's activity centered on expanding the plugin ecosystem and improving the overall user and developer experience. While no code was merged, two new plugins, `@elizaos/plugin-datai` and `plugin-desearch`, were proposed for addition to the registry. Significant community discussions took place around foundational improvements, including standardizing CLI tooling, overhauling documentation for broader audiences, and exploring better deployment strategies for custom agents. The focus was clearly on planning and addressing core infrastructure needs to support future growth.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nNo pull requests were merged or key technical work was completed this week. However, progress was made in proposing new functionality for the registry.\n\n- **New Plugins Proposed**\n  - Two pull requests were opened to add new plugins to the registry:\n    - [#185](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/185): Proposes adding `@elizaos/plugin-datai`.\n    - [#186](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/186): Proposes adding `plugin-desearch`.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nNo issues were opened or closed this week. The focus remained on discussions within several critical active issues.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  - No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - **Developer Experience:** Discussions continued on improving tooling consistency. In [#5218](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5218), work has begun to resolve inconsistent `bun run test` behavior. Meanwhile, issue [#5295](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5295) saw a contributor volunteer to standardize CLI inputs using `@clack/prompts`.\n  - **Documentation & Usability:** A major documentation overhaul is being discussed in [#5234](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5234) to better serve both developers and non-technical users, with detailed feedback provided on the challenges faced by beginners. In the GUI, a discussion in [#5377](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5377) suggests renaming the \"actions\" tab to \"Model Calls\" for clarity.\n  - **Agent Deployment:** The community is actively exploring streamlined deployment methods for custom Eliza agents in [#5244](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5244). Suggestions included community projects like \"elizify\" for one-click installs and platforms like Railway and Render.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThis week highlighted strong community engagement through active issue discussions. Several contributors, including @ai16z-demirix, @Ifechukwudaniel, @Megamindmaster, @bealers, and @wtfsayo, participated in shaping future work. Notably, @Ifechukwudaniel requested assignment to two key improvement issues ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5234), [#5295](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5295)), demonstrating proactive involvement. The discussion around deployment in [#5244](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5244) was a prime example of community-driven problem-solving, with @bealers offering their own project as a potential solution for the ecosystem."

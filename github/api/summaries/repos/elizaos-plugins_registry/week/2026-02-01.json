  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Feb 1 - 7, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week, the ElizaOS plugin registry saw a significant expansion of its ecosystem, focusing heavily on financial utility and agent security. The primary theme was the introduction of specialized tools for Web3 operations, including smart money signals, decentralized exchange (DEX) trading, and job marketplaces. Parallel to these feature additions, the community engaged in critical architectural discussions regarding agent optimization and resource management, specifically addressing prompt engineering overhead and the necessity of tracking LLM operational costs.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThe week's technical activity was dominated by the submission of several new plugins designed to enhance the capabilities of AI agents within the Base and Orderly Network ecosystems.\n\n### Web3 Trading & Financial Intelligence\nNew tools were proposed to provide agents with better market data and execution capabilities:\n*   **Base L2 Smart Money Signals:** Introduction of `@erdgecrawl/plugin-base-signals` to provide agents with actionable intelligence on Base Layer 2 ([#253](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/253)).\n*   **Perpetual Trading:** The Arthur DEX plugin was proposed to enable perpetual trading on the Orderly Network ([#256](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/256)).\n*   **Agent Economy:** The `plugin-moltbazaar` was introduced, establishing an AI Agent Job Marketplace on the Base network ([#255](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/255)).\n\n### Security & Guardrails\nA major focus was placed on the reliability of agent-led transactions:\n*   **Transaction Validation:** Multiple submissions were made for `@proofgate/eliza-plugin`, which implements transaction validation guardrails to ensure agents operate within secure parameters ([#254](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/254), [#257](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/257)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nWhile no issues were closed during this period, active discussions are shaping the future technical debt and feature roadmap of the registry.\n\n### New & Active Issues\n*   **Cost Evaluation for LLM Usage:** Discussion intensified on [#5759](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5759), which proposes a \"Cost Evaluator\" to track the dollar cost of LLM usage per step based on token counts. This is seen as a critical requirement for sustainable agent operations.\n*   **Character File & Prompt Engineering:** In [#6447](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6447), contributors are debating the \"Biological Trap\" of prompt engineering. The discussion suggests moving away from prose-based agent synchronization in favor of logic-based syncing (referencing MAE-1.0) to reduce overhead and improve agent adaptability.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe community demonstrated a strong drive toward decentralization and modularity, with several independent developers contributing plugins that bridge ElizaOS with various blockchain protocols. Collaboration is currently centered on high-level architectural philosophy, particularly regarding how agents should communicate and how their resource consumption should be monitored. The active participation in the \"Cost Evaluator\" and \"Character File\" discussions indicates a community that is transitioning from basic functionality toward enterprise-grade reliability and efficiency."

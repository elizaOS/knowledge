  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Sep 7 - 13, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's development activity was focused on expanding the plugin ecosystem. The primary achievement was the integration of a new community-contributed plugin, which enhances the capabilities available to ElizaOS agents. The week was otherwise quiet, with no new issues or significant discussions, indicating a period of stable, incremental growth for the registry.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n### New Plugin Integration\n*   The registry was expanded with the addition of the `@standujar/plugin-composio` plugin. This integration involved updating the `index.json` file to include the new entry and ensuring it met all registry standards, such as correct NPM package naming and GitHub URL formatting ([#217](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/217)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThere was no significant activity regarding issues this week.\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and there were no noteworthy discussions on existing issues.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week centered on the successful integration of a new plugin from community member `@standujar`. This contribution highlights the project's open nature and its ability to attract external developers to expand the agent framework's modular capabilities. The process appeared straightforward, with no significant back-and-forth discussion noted in the reports."

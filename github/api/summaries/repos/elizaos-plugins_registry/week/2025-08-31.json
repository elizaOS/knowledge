  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Aug 31 - 6, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week was characterized by a dual focus on expanding the plugin ecosystem and initiating a significant architectural discussion around the Eliza CLI. The registry grew with the addition of the Vercel AI Gateway plugin, and a critical bug in semantic versioning was fixed, improving plugin compatibility detection. Meanwhile, a major new initiative to refactor the CLI kicked off, sparking intense community debate on decentralizing logic and simplifying the developer experience. Ongoing user-facing issues, particularly around streaming support and Discord image generation, continued to see active discussion and progress.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week focused on enhancing the registry's stability and expanding its offerings.\n\n*   **Registry Maintenance and Compatibility:**\n    *   A critical bug was fixed in how the registry classifies plugin compatibility. The logic was updated to use semantic version range intersection, resolving issues where plugins were being misclassified ([#214](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/214)).\n    *   The `plugin-hedera` entry was updated to align with NPM naming conventions ([#212](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/212)).\n\n*   **New Plugin Integrations:**\n    *   The `plugin-vercel-ai-gateway` was added to the registry, granting agents access to over 100 AI models through the Vercel AI Gateway ([#213](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/213)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nNo issues were formally closed this week, but significant progress was made on several active fronts, and important new discussions were started.\n\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   **Major Initiative: Eliza CLI Refactor ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5860)):** A new issue was opened to plan a major refactoring of the Eliza CLI. The proposal aims to simplify the CLI by delegating more runtime logic to project directories and a new `@eliza/server` package. This sparked immediate and detailed discussion regarding architectural changes, division of responsibilities, and potential risks, with community members weighing in on the best path forward.\n    *   **Image Generation in Discord ([#5809](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5809)):** This persistent issue saw a positive development, with a contributor noting that a fix has been implemented in a related PR in the main `elizaOS/eliza` repository. This follows detailed community troubleshooting efforts to diagnose the problem.\n    *   **Streaming Support ([#4720](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5060), [#5060](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5060)):** Community interest in official streaming support remains high. Users continued to discuss its importance for reducing latency, with one member sharing that they have a working local implementation, providing a potential example for an official solution.\n    *   **New Bugs & Support:** A new bug was reported regarding a \"path not found\" error during project creation ([#5856](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5856)). Additionally, a contributor was guided through the correct publishing process after their plugin failed to appear in the registry, clarifying the proper use of CLI flags ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5813)).\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was strong this week, highlighted by both new contributions and deep collaborative design discussions.\n\n*   **Ecosystem Growth:** The community was active in expanding the plugin registry, with several new pull requests opened to add new tools:\n    *   `@testorg-eliza/plugin-sourcegraph` ([#215](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/215), [#216](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/216))\n    *   `@standujar/plugin-composio` ([#217](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/217))\n    *   `plugin-delta` ([#218](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/218))\n\n*   **Collaborative Design:** The discussion around the CLI refactor ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5860)) was a prime example of open collaboration. Key contributors like `standujar`, `wtfsayo`, and `odilitime` engaged in a detailed debate, weighing different architectural approaches and drawing inspiration from other successful developer tools.\n\n*   **Peer Support:** The dialogue around the plugin publishing process ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5813)) and the Discord image generation bug ([#5809](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5809)) demonstrated a healthy support system, with maintainers and community members actively helping each other troubleshoot and navigate the project's contribution workflows."

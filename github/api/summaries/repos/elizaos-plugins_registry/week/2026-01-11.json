  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Jan 11 - 17, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week, the elizaos-plugins registry continued its steady expansion into decentralized financial tooling. The primary focus was on broadening the ecosystem's capabilities through new plugin submissions, specifically targeting micropayment infrastructure. While the week was relatively quiet in terms of core registry refactoring, the addition of specialized payment protocols reinforces the project's mission to bridge AI agents with Web3 economic layers.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Ecosystem Expansion & Web3 Integration\nThe registry's growth this week was driven by community contributions aimed at enhancing the financial autonomy of ElizaOS agents.\n*   **Micropayment Capabilities:** A significant new submission was introduced to integrate the `@blockrun/elizaos-plugin`. This plugin facilitates x402 micropayments, providing a standardized way for agents to handle small-scale value transfers and paywalled interactions. [#248](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/248)\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe repository maintained a stable state throughout this period with no new bugs reported or existing issues closed. The focus remains on the review and integration of incoming pull requests rather than troubleshooting existing registry infrastructure.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was characterized by external contributions to the plugin ecosystem. The submission of the Blockrun plugin demonstrates active engagement from third-party developers looking to leverage the ElizaOS framework for decentralized applications. The activity suggests a healthy, growing interest in the modularity of the registry, as developers contribute specialized tools that extend the core framework's utility in the Web3 space."

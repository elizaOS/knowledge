  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 1, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis was a quiet week for the registry, with development focused on expanding its Web3 capabilities. The primary activity was the submission of a new plugin proposal aimed at providing Solana trading insights. No major code changes were merged, and issue triage was minimal, indicating a period of stability or preparation for future work.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nNo pull requests were merged or direct code changes were completed during this reporting period. The development focus was on the review of incoming contributions rather than the integration of new features or fixes.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe issue tracker remained static throughout the week, with no new issues opened or existing ones closed.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were resolved or closed this week.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and there was no significant discussion on existing active issues.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity activity centered on expanding the plugin ecosystem. A new pull request, [#237](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/237), was opened to add the `@laurabee19802025-max/plugin-kolscan - Solana Trading Insights` plugin. This contribution highlights the project's continued growth into the Web3 space, particularly within the Solana ecosystem."

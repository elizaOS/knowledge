  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Jun 22 - 28, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts centered on expanding the ElizaOS ecosystem through the addition of new plugins and addressing foundational challenges in custom development and core architecture. The plugin registry grew with proposals for Polkadot, Mattermost, and TokenMetrics integrations, and the addition of the Bonsai plugin. Concurrently, significant community discussions took place around improving custom plugin stability, resolving user identity management issues, and exploring webhook support for better performance. A key bug causing agent response failures was also resolved, improving the reliability of agent communication.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nThe primary focus of completed work was the expansion of the plugin registry, enhancing the capabilities available to ElizaOS agents.\n\n### Plugin Registry Expansion\nThe registry was updated with several new plugins, broadening the integration landscape for developers and users:\n- The `plugin-bonsai` was added to the registry's `index.json` ([#181](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/181)).\n- A proposal was made to add the `@bealers/plugin-mattermost` for integration with the Mattermost messaging platform ([#183](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/183)).\n- The `TokenMetrics` plugin was proposed for addition to the registry ([#182](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/182)).\n- A pull request to add the `@esscrypt/plugin-polkadot` is pending review ([#180](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/180)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThis week saw the resolution of a critical agent communication bug, while discussions continued on several important architectural and usability issues. No new issues were opened.\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **Agent Response Failure:** Issue [#5279](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5279) (\"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\") was closed. The problem was resolved by ensuring the agent's character file correctly included the `openai` plugin, which fixed the embedding error and allowed the agent to respond.\n\n### New & Active Issues\nDiscussions on active issues highlighted key areas for future development and improvement:\n- **Custom Plugin Development:** In issue [#5260](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5260), developers struggling with custom plugins received guidance suggesting that sending responses via both a callback and a return value simultaneously may be the cause of instability.\n- **Core Architecture & Usability:**\n    - **User Identity:** A discussion in [#105](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/105) explored solutions for handling GitHub username changes, with a proposal to use internal GitHub IDs as the primary key. This change is noted as complex due to the current database schema.\n    - **Webhook Integration:** Progress was made on [#6](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6), with confirmation that the ElizaOS server can support plugin-mounted routes, making webhook implementation a feasible alternative to polling.\n    - **File Size Limits:** A request was made in [#5268](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5268) to increase the character file size limit to 100MB.\n- **Plugin-Specific Bugs:** The Twitter plugin continues to have issues with newline formatting ([#26](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/26)) and failing to post replies ([#29](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/29)), which remain under investigation.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration was strong this week, with community members actively proposing new plugins and engaging in detailed technical discussions to solve complex problems. Issue threads like [#5260](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5260) and [#105](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/105) demonstrate a healthy feedback loop, where users report issues and maintainers provide analysis and potential solutions. The influx of new plugin proposals indicates growing interest and contribution from the wider developer community."

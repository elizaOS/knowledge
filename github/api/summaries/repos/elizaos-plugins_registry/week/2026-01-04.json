  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Jan 4 - 10, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week, the ElizaOS plugin registry continued its steady expansion, focusing on the core philosophy of modularity and composability. The primary activity centered on the integration of new community-contributed plugins, broadening the ecosystem's capabilities in both general utility and specialized routing. These additions signify ongoing momentum in building a decentralized repository of tools for autonomous AI agents.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Ecosystem Expansion & Plugin Integration\nThe registry saw the addition of two significant community plugins, enhancing the diversity of tools available to ElizaOS developers.\n\n*   **General Utility Integration:** A new contribution was submitted to incorporate the `@kamiyo/eliza` plugin into the official registry ([#246](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/246)). This addition supports the project's goal of creating a comprehensive, one-stop repository for agent extensions.\n*   **Specialized Routing:** The registry's capabilities for managing complex agent workflows were bolstered by the introduction of the `@zane-archer/plugin-aimo-router` ([#247](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/247)). This development points toward an increasing focus on sophisticated task handling and routing within the modular framework.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nDuring this period, the project maintained a streamlined focus on pull request management. No new issues were opened or closed, and there were no reported blockers or critical bugs. The activity remained concentrated on the review and integration of the newly proposed plugin additions.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe week's activity highlights the project's open collaboration model, with new contributions originating from diverse community members such as **kamiyo** and **zane-archer**. The submission of these plugins demonstrates a healthy, decentralized contribution pipeline where developers are actively building and sharing modular components to enhance the collective intelligence of the ElizaOS framework."

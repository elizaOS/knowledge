  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Aug 24 - 30, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts focused on expanding the plugin ecosystem and enhancing repository automation. Several new plugins were added or proposed, including `polymarket` and `@standujar/plugin-composio`, broadening the capabilities available to ElizaOS agents. Significant strides were made in developer tooling with the integration of Claude AI for automated code reviews and the implementation of alphabetical sorting for registry generation, improving consistency and quality control. Meanwhile, a persistent issue regarding agent knowledge retrieval (#14) saw further community reports, highlighting it as a key challenge to address.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on growing the plugin registry and improving the contribution workflow.\n\n- **Plugin Registry Expansion:** The registry grew with the addition of new tools for users.\n    - The `polymarket` plugin was successfully added to the registry ([#205](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/205)).\n    - The `@standujar/plugin-composio` plugin was also integrated, making it discoverable within the ecosystem ([#209](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/209)).\n    - A proposal was made to add the Vercel AI Gateway Plugin ([#204](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/204)).\n\n- **Repository Automation and Quality:** New automation was introduced to streamline development and ensure consistency.\n    - The registry generation script was updated to sort entries alphabetically, ensuring a consistent and predictable order in `index.json` ([#207](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/207)).\n    - Claude AI was integrated into the CI/CD pipeline via new GitHub Actions workflows to provide automated code reviews and comprehensive validation for new plugin contributions ([#206](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/206), [#208](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/208)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nNo new issues were opened or closed this week, but key discussions continued on existing items.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - **Agent Knowledge Retrieval Challenges ([#14](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/14)):** This critical issue gained more attention as user `bbsdevcollab` confirmed the problem, reporting that agents fail to use ingested document knowledge for responses. This corroborates earlier reports and points to a persistent problem with RAG context awareness that needs investigation.\n    - **Token Metrics Plugin Integration ([#202](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/202)):** Progress was noted on this issue, with maintainer `wtfsayo` prompting for a pull request to be opened for the new plugin, indicating it is ready for submission.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was evident in both issue discussions and new contributions. The ongoing conversation in issue #14 shows active participation from multiple users (`bbsdevcollab`, `0xRabbidfly`, `matteo-brandolino`) collaborating to diagnose a shared problem. Additionally, the guidance provided by `wtfsayo` on issue #202 demonstrates healthy maintainer-contributor interaction aimed at facilitating new plugin submissions. The influx of new plugins highlights a growing and active contributor base."

  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Sep 14 - 20, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's activity centered on expanding the plugin ecosystem while actively addressing several key user-facing issues. The primary achievement was the addition of the new `plugin-octav` to the registry, growing the capabilities available to ElizaOS agents. Concurrently, active discussions took place around improving the user experience, including a debate on the clarity of Web UI documentation, the logic for alpha version update notifications, and troubleshooting a persistent SQL database error in the Twitter plugin.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n### Plugin Registry Expansion\nThe registry was expanded with the addition of a new plugin. A pull request ([#230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/230)) was opened and subsequently completed to add `plugin-octav` to the `index.json` file, making it available within the ElizaOS ecosystem.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n### Closed Issues\nNo issues were closed this week.\n\n### New & Active Issues\nWhile no new issues were opened, several active discussions highlighted key areas for improvement and troubleshooting:\n\n*   **Update Notifications for Alpha Versions ([#5971](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5971)):** A discussion continued around preventing update notifications for alpha versions from appearing for users on stable channels. While a contributor indicated a willingness to address it, another comment suggested this may have already been fixed, noting the current stable, alpha, and beta version numbers.\n*   **Web UI Dashboard Documentation ([#5857](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5857)):** A user report about a lack of documentation for the Web UI dashboard sparked a conversation. A contributor asserted that documentation has been present in the quickstart guide, highlighting a potential need to improve documentation discoverability.\n*   **Twitter Plugin SQL Error ([#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/39)):** Multiple users reported a significant `insert into \"memories\"` SQL database error when using the Twitter plugin. The community is actively trying to diagnose the problem by gathering specific version information to reproduce the bug.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity engagement was evident in both direct contributions and issue discussions. The addition of `plugin-octav` via PR [#230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/230) represents a tangible expansion of the project's ecosystem.\n\nIn the issues section, contributor `standujar` volunteered to tackle the update notification issue ([#5971](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5971)), demonstrating proactive community involvement. Furthermore, the active threads for the Twitter plugin error ([#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/39)) and UI documentation ([#5857](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5857)) show a healthy feedback loop between users reporting issues and contributors working to diagnose and resolve them."

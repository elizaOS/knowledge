  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Aug 10 - 16, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's efforts focused on expanding and stabilizing the plugin ecosystem. Key progress was made in enriching the registry with new plugins and more detailed metadata, alongside critical bug fixes to improve compatibility detection. Significant enhancements were also completed for the scenario testing framework, enabling more sophisticated agent behavior validation. Concurrently, the community actively triaged a critical plugin publishing issue, providing detailed analysis and support.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week centered on growing the registry's offerings and hardening its core functionality.\n\n- **Registry Expansion and Stability:** The registry was enhanced to include additional repository metadata, making plugin discovery more informative ([#198](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/198)). Three new plugins were successfully integrated: `@elizaos/plugin-clanker`, `@elizaos/plugin-defillama`, and another unnamed plugin ([#197](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/197)). A critical bug fix was merged to correct v1 compatibility detection and semver handling in the registry generation script, preventing potential crashes ([#199](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/199)).\n\n- **New Plugin Proposals:** The community proposed adding two new plugins to the registry: `plugin-fal-ai` ([#201](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/201)) and `plugin-asd123` ([#200](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/200)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management focused on closing out major testing enhancements and diagnosing a critical publishing failure.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** A significant effort to improve scenario testing was completed, closing three major issues:\n    - **Natural Language Interaction:** Implemented natural language interaction and response validation for testing agent behavior ([#5727](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5727)).\n    - **Dynamic Plugin Loading:** Scenarios can now declare required plugins directly in their YAML files ([#5725](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5725)).\n    - **Advanced Mocking:** The mocking system was upgraded to support conditional and complex responses ([#5726](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5726)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened. Discussion on a critical plugin publishing failure ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5754)) was the primary focus. The issue involves the CLI reporting success even when an npm publish fails. Analysis suggests the root cause is a user configuration problem related to scoped package names (`@elizaos/`) without proper npm organization access. A solution was proposed to use an unscoped package name and update the `package.json` to align with the current template.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity activity was characterized by both contribution and collaborative support. The submission of two new plugins ([#200](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/200), [#201](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/201)) shows continued interest in expanding the ElizaOS ecosystem. Furthermore, the detailed analysis and proposed fix by user `yungalgo` on the active publishing issue ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5754)) highlights a healthy dynamic of community members assisting each other with complex, environment-specific problems."

A new pull request was opened to add the `plugin-coinrailz` to the registry, expanding the ecosystem. Meanwhile, an important ongoing discussion regarding wallet migration issues saw a community member provide detailed potential workarounds, highlighting active user engagement and problem-solving within the issue tracker. No major code was merged, indicating a period focused on review and community support rather than new feature development.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nNo new features or bug fixes were merged this week. Development activity consisted of a new submission for review.\n\n*   **New Plugin Submission**\n    *   A pull request ([#245](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/245)) was opened to add `plugin-coinrailz` to the plugin registry. This submission is now pending review.\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nIssue management focused on supporting users with existing problems, with no new issues opened or closed.\n\n*   **Closed Issues:**\n    *   No issues were resolved or closed this week.\n\n*   **New & Active Issues:**\n    *   No new issues were reported.\n    *   Discussion continued on issue [#6211](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6211), which concerns problems with AI16Z → ElizaOS migration, snapshot eligibility, and Tangem wallet connections. A community member provided detailed advice, suggesting two potential solutions: importing the cold wallet's seed phrase into a hot wallet for the migration, or contacting the team via the official Discord for a manual migration.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCommunity involvement was the primary driver of activity this week. The submission of a new plugin in PR [#245](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/245) shows continued interest in expanding the ElizaOS ecosystem.

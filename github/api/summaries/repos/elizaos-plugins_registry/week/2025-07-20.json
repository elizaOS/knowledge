  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Jul 20 - 26, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's activity centered on expanding the plugin ecosystem and providing crucial community support. The registry grew with the successful integration of `plugin-coti`, which adds capabilities for private transactions on the COTI blockchain. Another new plugin, `plugin-my`, was also submitted for inclusion. On the support front, a key issue involving the Google API plugin was resolved, clarifying configuration requirements and providing valuable troubleshooting guidance for users.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n### New Plugin Integrations\nThe registry was enhanced with new plugins, expanding the toolset available to ElizaOS agents.\n\n-   **`plugin-coti` Added:** A new plugin, `plugin-coti`, was successfully merged, enabling ElizaOS agents to perform private token operations and encrypted transactions on the COTI blockchain ([#193](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/193)).\n-   **`plugin-my` Submitted:** A pull request was opened to add `plugin-my` to the registry, signaling continued growth in community contributions ([#192](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/192)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n### Closed Issues\nA significant user-facing configuration issue was investigated and resolved this week.\n\n-   **Google API Plugin Troubleshooting:** An issue where an agent failed to respond when using the Google API was resolved ([#5664](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5664)). The investigation confirmed the existence of the `@elizaos/plugin-google-genai` plugin and identified the root cause as an incorrectly set `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` environment variable. The resolution provided clear steps for users to verify and correctly configure their API key.\n\n### New & Active Issues\nNo new or other active issues were reported in this period.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe week highlighted active community engagement through both new contributions and user support. The submission and integration of new plugins ([#192](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/192), [#193](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/193)) demonstrate a healthy and growing ecosystem. Furthermore, the detailed discussion and resolution of the Google API issue ([#5664](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5664)) showcased effective collaboration in helping users troubleshoot and successfully deploy their agents."

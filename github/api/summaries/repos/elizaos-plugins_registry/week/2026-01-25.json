  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Jan 25 - 31, 2026)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week, development focused on expanding the ElizaOS ecosystem through strategic additions to the plugin registry. The primary theme of the work was enhancing the framework's utility in financial transactions and agent interoperability. Key milestones included the integration of a new payment gateway and the introduction of specialized discovery tools for agent endpoints, reinforcing our commitment to a modular and extensible AI architecture.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\n\n### Financial Ecosystem Expansion\nTo broaden the platform's financial capabilities and support Web3/Web2 payment workflows, the registry now includes a new payment integration.\n*   **AsterPay Integration:** A reference for the AsterPay plugin was added to the core `index.json` file, facilitating easier access to this payment gateway for developers building on the framework ([#251](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/251)).\n\n### Agent Discovery & Interoperability\nEfforts were made to improve how agents interact and find one another within the ecosystem, focusing on standardized discovery protocols.\n*   **x402 Endpoint Discovery:** The registry introduced an Agent Index plugin specifically designed for x402 endpoint discovery. This addition is a step toward more robust decentralized intelligence by allowing agents to locate and communicate with specific service endpoints more efficiently ([#252](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/252)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\nThe activity for this period was primarily focused on the submission of new features via pull requests. \n*   **Closed Issues:** No specific issues were reported as closed during this timeframe.\n*   **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened during this period, as the focus remained on direct registry updates and plugin submissions.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nThe week's activity demonstrates a steady cadence of contributions aimed at the core registry. The focus on payment gateways and discovery protocols suggests active collaboration between plugin developers and the registry maintainers to ensure new tools are properly indexed and available to the wider ElizaOS community. The submission of these plugins indicates a healthy, growing ecosystem where contributors are actively modularizing specialized functions for the benefit of all users."

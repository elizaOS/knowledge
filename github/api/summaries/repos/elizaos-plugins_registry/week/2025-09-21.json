  "content": "# elizaos-plugins/registry Weekly Report (Sep 21 - 27, 2025)\n\n## 🚀 Highlights\nThis week's activity centered on the growth and maintenance of the plugin registry. Development focused on expanding the ecosystem with submissions for two new plugins, `@leopham/plugin-u2u` and `plugin-beacon`. Alongside this expansion, a key bug fix was implemented to correct the package namespace for the token metrics plugin, ensuring the registry remains accurate and reliable. Overall, it was a week of steady progress in both expanding functionality and maintaining the integrity of the existing registry.\n\n## 🛠️ Key Developments\nWork this week involved one critical bug fix and the submission of two new plugins.\n\n### Registry Maintenance & Bug Fixes\nA necessary maintenance update was completed to ensure the registry accurately reflects upstream package locations. A bug was fixed where the token metrics plugin referenced an outdated organization namespace. The pull request updated the package name from `@token-metrics` to `@token-metrics-ai`, resolving the issue and ensuring correct referencing within the registry ([#232](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/232)).\n\n### New Plugin Submissions\nThe registry saw continued growth with the submission of two new plugins, which are now awaiting review:\n- **`@leopham/plugin-u2u`**: A pull request was opened to add this new plugin to the registry ([#231](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/231)).\n- **`plugin-beacon`**: A separate pull request was submitted to integrate the `plugin-beacon` ([#233](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/233)).\n\n## 🐛 Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were reported, and there were no noteworthy discussions on existing issues.\n\n## 💬 Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was demonstrated through the submission of new plugins to the registry. The proposals to add `@leopham/plugin-u2u` and `plugin-beacon` indicate active development and a desire from the community to expand the ElizaOS ecosystem."

  "content": "On Feb 3, 2026, the ElizaOS project saw significant activity in the `plugin-n8n-workflow` repository with enhancements to workflow control and cloud compatibility, alongside a new release preparation and numerous new issues opened in the `eliza` core repository covering performance, authentication, and a new plugin proposal. The `elizaos.github.io` repository had no development activity.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Workflow Control and Reliability Enhancements\n*   **Enhanced Workflow Control for Multi-Step Operations**: A new `awaitingUserInput` flag was introduced to allow multi-step loops to pause for user confirmation, preventing auto-confirmation for complex workflows in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow#13](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/13).\n*   **Improved Cloud Compatibility and Context Handling**: Critical fixes were implemented to ensure correct plugin functionality in cloud environments, including updating `buildConversationContext` and removing an unused `runtime` parameter in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/12).\n*   **Accurate Action Status Reporting**: All action callbacks now explicitly include a `success: true/false` status, resolving a bug where failed actions appeared successful in the cloud UI in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow#11](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/11).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n*   **elizaos/eliza**:\n    *   [#6449](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6449) - Prepare `v1.5.12-alpha.2` alpha release.\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n*   **elizaos/eliza**:\n    *   [#6450](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6450) - Investigate and address significant latency (8+ seconds) during agent interaction, identifying cold start and encoding as root causes.\n    *   [#6451](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6451) - Critical bug reported regarding `Runtime getSetting()` where user settings fail to override agent settings, leading to API key issues on Eliza Cloud.\n    *   [#6452](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6452) - Task created to record a demo video for Google OAuth verification, showcasing end-to-end functionality with Google Calendar/Gmail integration.\n    *   [#6453](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6453) - Integration of Microsoft OAuth for Outlook email and calendar support proposed as an alternative to Google services.\n    *   [#6455](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6455) - Issue opened to revert previous authentication changes and restore the authentication page.\n    *   [#6454](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6454) - New plugin, SOLPRISM, proposed for verifiable AI reasoning on Solana, enabling agents to commit SHA-256 hashes of reasoning traces on-chain.\n    *   [#6456](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6456) - Milestone issue created for the Eliza App MVP launch, targeting the end of the week with a focus on a functional end-to-end user experience."

  "content": "On December 26, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant foundational improvements, including enhancements to multi-step workflows in the core `eliza` repository and critical updates to plugin capabilities, such as Farcaster cast processing with embeds and media, and batch embedding for knowledge management. Additionally, the OpenAI plugin received a dependency update to enable streaming support, ensuring better compatibility across the ecosystem.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Framework Enhancements\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai**: Updated the `@elizaos/core` dependency to version `1.7.0` to enable streaming support, improving interaction and data handling within the plugin. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/22))\n\n### Plugin Feature Development\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster**: Implemented support for processing embeds and media within Farcaster casts, allowing agents to interpret image and link content more effectively through the introduction of an `EmbedManager`. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/16))\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge**: Added a batch embedding pipeline, including `EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE=100` and `generateEmbeddingsBatch`, to optimize performance when generating document embeddings. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#50](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/50))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Enhance multi-step workflows by adding retry logic and parameter extraction capabilities. ([elizaos/eliza#6286](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6286))\n    - Standardize message server route naming. ([elizaos/eliza#6285](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6285))"

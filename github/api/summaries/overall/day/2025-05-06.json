  "content": "Today's development focused on enhancing the ElizaOS framework through critical bug fixes, particularly resolving Discord service timeout issues and improving client interface scrolling. Documentation links were updated to ensure accessibility, and several user experience issues were closed, though a gap in `settings.discord.autoPost` implementation for Eliza v2 was identified.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### System Stability & User Experience Improvements\n- Resolved timeout issues during Discord agent unregistration ([elizaos/eliza#4450](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4450)).\n- Fixed double scrollbars and improved scrolling behavior on the main page for a cleaner interface ([elizaos/eliza#4465](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4465)).\n- Corrected detection issues for `bunx` and `npx` to enhance command-line functionality ([elizaos/eliza#4463](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4463)).\n- Updated broken links in Eliza documentation, replacing outdated URLs with current ones ([elizaos/eliza#4460](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4460)).\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**: Identified that `settings.discord.autoPost` is not yet implemented in Eliza v2 ([elizaos/eliza#4461](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4461)).\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**: Closed issues related to user interactions, including blocking unwanted accounts and enhancing CLI tool instructions ([elizaos/eliza#4117](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4117), [elizaos/eliza#4113](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4113)).\n- **elizaos/eliza**: Addressed a syntax error related to module exports in the core library ([elizaos/eliza#4046](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4046))."

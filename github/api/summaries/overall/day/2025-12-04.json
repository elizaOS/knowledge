  "content": "On Dec 4, 2025, ElizaOS significantly advanced its core framework by unifying the API for serverless Node.js environments, enhancing stability across examples, and modernizing the SQL plugin. These efforts streamline development and improve the robustness of the agent framework.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Framework Enhancements\n- Unified the API for serverless Node.js environments, streamlining core functionalities within `elizaos/eliza`. ([elizaos/eliza#6201](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6201))\n- Improved example stability by ensuring user-defined `LOG_LEVEL` settings are respected in `standalone-cli-chat.ts` within `elizaos/eliza`. ([elizaos/eliza#6203](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6203))\n- Modernized the SQL plugin by migrating to the `messageService` API and introducing automatic PGLite directory creation in `elizaos/eliza`. ([elizaos/eliza#6202](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6202))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [#6205](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6205) fix(service): enhance simple response detection logic\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [#6204](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6204) SQL Plugin Directory Handling: A new issue was opened regarding the necessity of the `.eliza` directory for the `plugin-sql` to function, suggesting it should be auto-created to prevent crashes."

  "content": "On September 21, 2025, ElizaOS saw important updates across its ecosystem, with a focus on CLI stability in the core `eliza` repository and a significant dependency upgrade in `plugin-knowledge`. The `eliza` CLI received a critical bug fix preventing infinite restart loops, while `plugin-knowledge` began migrating to AI SDK v2 and Bun for testing. These efforts collectively enhance the robustness and modernize the underlying technologies of the ElizaOS framework.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### CLI Stability Improvements\n- Fixed an infinite dev restart loop and improved client directory detection in `elizaos/eliza` by adding recursion prevention logic ([elizaos/eliza#5991](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5991)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge**:\n  - Update AI SDK dependencies to v2 and migrate tests to Bun ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#40](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/40))"

  "content": "On Dec 24, 2025, ElizaOS saw significant progress in API performance with configurable rate limits for the knowledge plugin and substantial code refactoring in the Farcaster plugin for improved maintainability. Concurrently, two critical issues related to web search and agent response smoothness were closed in the core `eliza` repository, while a cluster of new issues emerged across multiple repositories concerning agent chat behavior, UI consistency, and monorepo documentation.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6281): This issue regarding opening the most recent conversation in agent chat has an auto-generated implementation plan and suggested assignees, requiring review and action.\n    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6282): This issue concerning duplicated conversations when switching agents has an auto-generated plan and suggested assignees, and is identified as a possible duplicate of #6281, needing clarification.\n    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#6283](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6283): This UI spacing issue has an auto-generated plan and suggested assignee, requiring review and action.\n    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#6284](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6284): This monorepo documentation issue has an auto-generated plan and suggested assignee, requiring review and action.\n    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster#6281](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/6281): This issue regarding opening the most recent conversation in agent chat has an auto-generated implementation plan and suggested assignees, requiring review and action.\n    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster#6282](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/6282): This issue concerning duplicated conversations when switching agents has an auto-generated plan and suggested assignees, and is identified as a possible duplicate of #6281, needing clarification.\n    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster#6283](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/6283): This UI spacing issue has an auto-generated plan and suggested assignee, requiring review and action.\n    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster#6284](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/6284): This monorepo documentation issue has an auto-generated plan and suggested assignee, requiring review and action.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### API Performance & Reliability\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge**: Configurable rate limits were introduced for high-throughput APIs, including options to disable limits and settings for concurrent requests, requests per minute, tokens per minute, and batch delay. Default limits were also increased fivefold. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#49](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/49))\n\n### Codebase Refinements & Consistency\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster**: Significant refactoring was completed to improve maintainability and consistency, including DRY improvements with a centralized helper for FID retrieval and consistent logging practices. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/15))\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster**: Farcaster interaction handling was unified through Message and Cast services, a thread context provider was added, the build system switched to Bun, and logging/error handling were standardized. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster#14](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/14))\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter**: A bug fix was implemented to ensure consistent handling of posting enablement, specifically addressing the immediate application of settings.

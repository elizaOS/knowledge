  "content": "On September 16, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in CI/CD workflow enhancements, critical bug fixes across the CLI and `plugin-sql`, and architectural improvements in `plugin-farcaster` with new webhook support. A new plugin, `plugin-octav`, was added to the registry, while discussions continued regarding update notifications for alpha versions across multiple repositories.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos-plugins/registry#5971](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5971), [elizaos/eliza#5971](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5971), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster#5971](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5971): `standujar` has indicated a willingness to address the issue of not showing update available notifications for alpha versions to users not on alpha distribution, if time permits.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **CI/CD Workflow Enhancements**:\n    - Concurrency control was added to the Claude code review workflow, ensuring previous runs are canceled on new commits to prevent resource waste and ensure reviews are based on the latest code. [elizaos/eliza#5984](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5984)\n- **CLI and Plugin Stability Improvements**:\n    - Quotes were removed from file paths in Windows tests to resolve CI failures. [elizaos/eliza#5981](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5981)\n    - The `elizaos dev` command logic was enhanced for better client development server detection in monorepos and standalone plugins. [elizaos/eliza#5979](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5979)\n    - Redundant migration steps in the CLI agent start were addressed, and spurious adapter warnings in `plugin-sql` were demoted. [elizaos/eliza#5978](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5978)\n- **Farcaster Plugin Architectural Improvements**:\n    - Webhook support was added as an alternative to polling, significantly improving real-time responsiveness and addressing cost concerns through a complete architectural refactor. [elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster#11](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/11)\n    - A critical build error was resolved, and the SDK was updated across various core files.

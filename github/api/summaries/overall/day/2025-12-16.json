  "content": "On December 16, 2025, the ElizaOS project significantly expanded its plugin ecosystem with a new self-hosted Farcaster plugin, enabling local Snapchain/Hubble hub integration. Concurrently, efforts were made to refine the user experience within the `eliza` application, particularly concerning plugin selection and the initial stages of agent creation and knowledge integration. Discussions also began on incorporating web search capabilities, indicating a focus on both backend extensibility and frontend usability.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Plugin Ecosystem Expansion\n- A new self-hosted Farcaster plugin (`plugin-farcaster-local-hub`) was introduced to the registry, allowing for local Snapchain/Hubble hub integration without external API dependencies and including fixes for Farcaster timestamp epoch and Hub API parameters. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243))\n\n### UI/UX Enhancements for Plugin Selection\n- Improvements were made to the visual feedback for plugin selection, transitioning to a more prominent full background color change, and refining the interaction with a toggle selection mechanism. ([elizaos/eliza#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235), [elizaos/eliza#6236](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6236))\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Agent creation and knowledge integration: An issue was opened to address pre-uploading files for RAG knowledge during agent creation to improve UI/UX. ([elizaos/eliza#6245](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6245))\n    - Web search integration: A new issue was created to discuss implementing web search capabilities. ([elizaos/eliza#6246](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6246))\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Plugin selection UI/UX enhancements: Issues related to improving visual feedback and interaction for plugin selection were closed. ([elizaos/eliza#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235), [elizaos/eliza#6236](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6236))"

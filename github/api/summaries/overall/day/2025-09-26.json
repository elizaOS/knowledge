  "content": "Today, ElizaOS focused on enhancing plugin management with new auto-installation capabilities and critical refinements to runtime initialization for improved stability and environment variable handling. Discussions are ongoing regarding the Eliza agent's awareness of the `plugin-evm`, with troubleshooting steps being actively explored.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention \n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#15](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/15): The Eliza agent is still not recognizing the `plugin-evm`, requiring further investigation into plugin naming, versioning, and environment variable configuration.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **Core Runtime Stability and Configuration**:\n    - Improved runtime initialization to ensure correct settings at creation, resolving a race condition with environment variables like Postgres URL ([elizaos/eliza#6008](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6008)).\n    - Refined environment variable loading for monorepo awareness and improved Ollama fallback logic ([elizaos/eliza#6005](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6005)).\n- **Enhanced Plugin Management**:\n    - Implemented automatic installation of missing plugins in the server's PluginLoader to prevent runtime failures and streamline development ([elizaos/eliza#6006](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6006)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n- **New Pull Requests**:\n    - **elizaos/eliza**:\n        - [#6009](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6009) chore: fix typo in comment\n        - [#6007](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6007) Fix(runtime): Ensure agent creation handles missing agent gracefully"

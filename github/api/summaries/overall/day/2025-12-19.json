  "content": "On Dec 19, 2025, the ElizaOS project significantly advanced its data infrastructure by implementing new static JSON API endpoints for both leaderboard and summary data across multiple repositories, streamlining data access and consistency. Concurrently, core platform stability and user experience were enhanced through critical bug fixes in the `eliza` repository and improved Discord bot permissions.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### API & Data Infrastructure Enhancements\n*   **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**: Enhanced the static JSON API to include summary endpoints, generating JSON alongside markdown for data consistency and simplifying the API structure by removing unnecessary pagination fields from the leaderboard API ([#186](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/186)).\n*   **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**: Introduced new static JSON API endpoints for leaderboard data, including API versioning (v1.0) and pagination metadata ([#184](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/184)).\n*   **elizaos-plugins/registry**: Improved the registry generation script to detect and warn about package version and core dependency mismatches, and correctly set `supports` flags based on actual core dependencies ([#244](https://github.elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/244)).\n\n### Core Platform Stability & User Experience\n*   **elizaos/eliza**: Fixed a significant bug in the `plugin-bootstrap` module, correcting action/provider format changes and resolving an `initPromise` bug across multiple packages ([#6261](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6261)).\n*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord**: Implemented a new tiered permission system for Discord bot invite URLs, featuring a 3x2 matrix of role levels and voice options ([#33](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/33)).\n*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord**: Added hybrid slash-command permissions, incorporating Discord permissions, channel-whitelist bypass, and custom validators, along with a safer command registration pipeline and fixes for DM channel handling ([#29](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/29)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### Active Discussions\n*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord**: Issue [#185](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/185) discusses extending the static JSON API for summaries, with a refined approach to generate JSON alongside markdown during summarization and proposed `SummaryAPIResponse` shape.\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### Closed Issues\n*   **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**: Implemented JSON API Endpoints for Summaries, extending the static JSON API to include summary endpoints with a refined approach to \"piggyback\" JSON generation alongside markdown ([#185](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/185)).\n*   **elizaos-plugins/registry**: Closed a feature request to extend the static JSON API to include summary endpoints, with discussions on refining the approach to piggyback JSON generation alongside markdown and enhancing the response shape ([#185](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/185)).\n*   **elizaos/eliza**: Resolved multiple UI/UX and performance enhancements, including fixing the voices page layout ([#6252](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6252)), removing a redundant container list header ([#6251](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6251)), addressing a white flash during login ([#6253](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6253)), fixing sidebar hover effects ([#6254](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6254)), and gallery tab refresh behavior ([#6256](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6256)).\n*   **elizaos/eliza**: Investigated and resolved slow image loading in the gallery ([#6255](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6255)).\n*   **elizaos/eliza**: Optimized model selection in Agent Builder to use faster models for initial configuration ([#6185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6185)).\n*   **elizaos/eliza**: Renamed the chat assistant to \"Agent Builder\" to avoid user confusion ([#6258](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6258)).\n*   **elizaos/eliza**: Added the ability to export JSON without deploying ([#6259](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6259)).\n*   **elizaos/eliza**: Fixed markdown rendering for bullet points in the agent builder chat ([#6257](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6257)).\n*   **elizaos/eliza**: Addressed redundant Privy re-authentication calls, consolidating multiple checks into a single authentication check per session ([#6249](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6249)).\n*   **elizaos/eliza**: Closed issue [#185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/185) after merging the implementation of JSON API endpoints for summaries, which involved generating JSON alongside markdown and defining an enhanced API response shape."

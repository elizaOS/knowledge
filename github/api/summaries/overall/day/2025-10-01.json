  "content": "On October 1, 2025, ElizaOS focused on core maintenance and quality improvements across the project, including significant dependency updates, critical bug fixes for plugin functionality, and code formatting standardization in the `eliza` repository. Concurrently, the `plugin-openrouter` repository received a crucial update to AI SDK v5, enhancing tool results extraction and step content parsing. These efforts collectively aim to improve stability, compatibility, and overall system performance.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n\n### Core System Maintenance & Quality\n*   **Dependency Updates**: Multiple core dependencies, including TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, and Langchain, were updated across the `eliza` project to leverage the latest features and security patches.

  "content": "ElizaOS made significant strides today in enhancing scenario testing with dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations, alongside numerous developer experience improvements and critical bug fixes for logging and configuration. The plugin registry also saw a substantial expansion with ten new additions, increasing the available tools for ElizaOS agents.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention \n- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738): The `bun run clean` command continues to fail due to TypeScript errors in `@elizaos/core`, blocking testing of complex scenarios. `standujar` cannot reproduce, suggesting it might be fixed, but confirmation is needed.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813): A plugin successfully published to NPM is not visible in the PR, likely due to incorrect npm package scoping. A fix has been suggested to change `npmPackage` from `\"plugin-delta\"` to `\"@1BDO/plugin-delta\"`.\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#4921](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4921): The agent is not responding to Twitter mentions. `standujar` is asking if the issue persists after previous suggestions to update CLI and `plugin-twitter`.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **Enhanced Scenario Testing**:\n    - Dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations was implemented in ElizaOS scenarios, significantly improving the sophistication of testing with more complex and realistic conversational flows, including new examples and updated documentation. [elizaos/eliza#5824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5824)\n- **Developer Experience & Stability Improvements**:\n    - Improvements were made to the development workflow, including fixes for the CLI, logging cleanup, and file watching optimizations, particularly benefiting monorepo setups with client UIs. [elizaos/eliza#5881](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5881)\n    - Critical bugs related to logging and environment configuration were resolved, fixing `LOG_JSON_FORMAT` issues, preventing excessive error logging for `SECRET_SALT`, and adding `SERVER_HOST` support to the `dev` command. [elizaos/eliza#5885](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5885), [elizaos/eliza#5884](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5884), [elizaos/eliza#5883](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5883)\n- **Plugin Registry Expansion**:\n    - Ten new plugins were added to the registry, significantly increasing the available tools for ElizaOS agents, including various \"gorpy\" and \"jello\" themed plugins.

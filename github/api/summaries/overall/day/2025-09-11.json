  "content": "On September 11, 2025, ElizaOS focused on enhancing core stability by fixing test flakiness and improving environment variable handling, alongside significant architectural planning for future database adapters, core entity refactoring, and SDK integration. Several new issues were opened to guide these upcoming developments, while minor documentation improvements were also completed.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **Core Stability and Test Reliability**\n    - Fixed test flakiness related to `SECRET_SALT` reads being cache-aware, improving the reliability of `plugin-bootstrap` tests in `elizaos/eliza`. ([elizaos/eliza#5968](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5968))\n- **Documentation Improvements**\n    - Addressed a broken LLM documentation link and other minor documentation issues in `elizaos/eliza`. ([elizaos/eliza#5954](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5954), [elizaos/eliza#5967](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5967))\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### elizaos/eliza\n- **New Issues**:\n    - Outlined the implementation of a WASM PGLite adapter for browser database functionality. ([elizaos/eliza#5964](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5964))\n    - Proposed refactoring duplicated database entities (rooms, worlds, channels, servers) into consolidated abstractions. ([elizaos/eliza#5965](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5965))\n    - Planned support for an SDK-first hooks mode for direct browser instantiation and separate server hooks for REST/SSE. ([elizaos/eliza#5966](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5966))\n    - Created a task to send a list of partners to the backend for plugins. ([elizaos/eliza#5969](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5969))\n- **Closed Issues**:\n    - Fixed a broken link in LLM documentation. ([elizaos/eliza#5954](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5954))\n    - Addressed miscellaneous documentation nitpicks. ([elizaos/eliza#5967](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5967))"

  "content": "On May 28, 2025, ElizaOS focused on refining server environment configurations, particularly `.env` file management for robust secret handling, and enhancing plugin flexibility with parameterized routes. Several critical issues were addressed, including a plugin integration problem, while new challenges emerged in end-to-end testing and CLI-less agent file execution.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Environment and Configuration Enhancements\n*   Merged functionality to manually write the `.env` file to Fly.io and merge `process.env` variables, ensuring secrets are properly handled in server hosting environments ([elizaos/eliza#4808](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4808), [elizaos/eliza#4806](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4806)).\n\n### Plugin and Routing Improvements\n*   Introduced support for parameterized routes in plugins, enhancing routing capabilities ([elizaos/eliza#4817](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4817)).\n\n### Testing and Stability Fixes\n*   Fixed various typos and improved test configurations related to TEE tests ([elizaos/eliza#4816](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4816), [elizaos/eliza#4807](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4807)).\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n*   **elizaos/eliza**:\n    *   Failures in end-to-end tests for the new sample project were reported ([elizaos/eliza#4814](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4814)).\n    *   Concerns were raised about starting agent files without the CLI and the removal of the `the-org` package ([elizaos/eliza#4810](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4810)).\n    *   Difficulties finding definition files for Node or Jest were encountered ([elizaos/eliza#4805](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4805)).\n\n### Closed Issues\n*   **elizaos/eliza**:\n    *   The issue regarding the inability to use the `@elizaos/plugin-evm` plugin was resolved ([elizaos/eliza#4803](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4803))."

Additionally, new pull requests were opened to improve the build process and integrate an AI Gateway plugin for broader model access.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Framework Enhancements\n*   **elizaos/eliza**: A comprehensive scenario testing system was introduced, supporting YAML-based test definitions, local and E2B sandboxed testing, a robust evaluation engine with action tracking and LLM judges, and mock service support. This significantly improves the ability to test and validate agent behavior across diverse tasks. ([elizaos/eliza#5723](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5723))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n*   **elizaos/eliza**:\n    *   Proposes a change to the build process to use Bun and remove Tsup. ([elizaos/eliza#5807](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5807))\n    *   Introduces an AI Gateway plugin designed to provide universal access to over 100 AI models. ([elizaos/eliza#5806](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5806))\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n*   **elizaos/eliza**:\n    *   An issue was opened to validate the functionality of Polygon-related plugins, specifically checking if they work correctly by cloning the plugin repo and running `elizaos dev`, highlighting a need to test plugins like `plugin-quickswap`. ([elizaos/eliza#5808](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5808))\n    *   An issue was reported regarding image generation not working in Discord, despite images appearing in the web UI, where the agent states an image has been created and describes it, but it does not show up in Discord. ([elizaos/eliza#5809](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5809))"

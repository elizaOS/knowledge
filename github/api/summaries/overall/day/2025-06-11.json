  "content": "On Jun 11, 2025, the ElizaOS project focused on stability and user experience, with significant bug fixes in the `elizaos/eliza` repository addressing memory creation logic, API routes, and health checks. Documentation was improved with a CLI-first approach, and a major refactor was temporarily reverted to ensure system integrity.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### System Stability & Bug Fixes\n- Fixed memory creation logic in the SQL plugin to ensure correct agentId usage in database operations ([elizaos/eliza#5045](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5045)).\n- Resolved small issues with API routes to enhance functionality ([elizaos/eliza#5062](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5062)).\n- Updated the health check URL to make `bun run dev` operational ([elizaos/eliza#5054](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5054)).\n- Reverted a major refactor of actions logic to maintain stability while a long-term solution is developed ([elizaos/eliza#5068](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5068)).\n\n### Documentation & Testing Improvements\n- Updated the README to adopt a CLI-first approach, providing a comprehensive installation guide and command reference for improved user experience ([elizaos/eliza#5059](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5059)).\n- Removed mock tests from the CLI package, emphasizing the use of extensive real tests for better reliability ([elizaos/eliza#5065](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5065)).\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**: Proposed the addition of optional Stream responses to improve response times in the /message API, addressing delays in LLM responses ([elizaos/eliza#5060](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5060)).\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**: Fixed the issue of inactive agents being incorrectly shown as active in the sidebar ([elizaos/eliza#4929](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4929)).\n- **elizaos/eliza**: Addressed access errors with the OpenAI API key for GPT-4o, providing clarity on model access ([elizaos/eliza#5023](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5023)).\n- **elizaos/eliza**: Resolved the problem of custom characters not loading after an upgrade to version 1.0.7, restoring functionality ([elizaos/eliza#5039](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5039))."

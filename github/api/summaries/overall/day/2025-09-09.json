  "content": "On September 9, 2025, ElizaOS significantly enhanced user experience with client-side navigation improvements and a modernized README, while resolving critical plugin management and CI stability issues. A substantial number of new issues were opened, outlining future development around core API redesign, message bus simplification, and comprehensive frontend integration, signaling a strong focus on architectural refactoring and developer experience.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n\n### User Experience & Client Navigation\n*   The `README.md` was modernized with a better structure and quick start guide, improving the initial experience for new users ([elizaos/eliza#5896](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5896)).\n*   URL synchronization was added for DM channel switching and direct navigation in the client, allowing users to bookmark and share specific conversation links ([elizaos/eliza#5941](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5941)).\n*   A bug was fixed in the client to remove a redundant `navigate()` call in the force new chat flow, resolving URL inconsistency issues ([elizaos/eliza#5945](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5945)).\n\n### Plugin Management & CI Stability\n*   Issues related to custom plugin schema migration were resolved, with detailed analysis provided on proper plugin schema structure, dependencies, and server-level migration registration ([elizaos/eliza#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588)).\n*   A problem with publishing plugins not being visible in PRs was addressed, clarifying the `elizaos publish` command usage and registry submission process ([elizaos/eliza#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)).\n*   The default branch for migrated/1.x supported plugins was set ([elizaos/eliza#5690](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5690)).\n*   Core CI tests were fixed, resolving issues with the `tee starter` breaking ([elizaos/eliza#5715](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5715)).\n\n### Prompt and Action Refinements\n*   Action names were corrected and prompts improved for multi-step processes, affecting `packages/core/src/prompts.ts` and `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/index.ts` ([elizaos/eliza#5942](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5942)).\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n\n### New Issues\n*

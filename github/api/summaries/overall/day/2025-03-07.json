  "content": "On Mar 7, 2025, ElizaOS focused on refining the core Eliza framework, transitioning to Patchright for improved testing, and addressing several critical bugs related to asynchronous handling and client connectivity. Documentation was also updated for clarity, and new linting rules were implemented to maintain code quality.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Testing Infrastructure Improvements\n- Transitioned from Playwright to Patchright to improve testing processes in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#3791](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3791)).\n\n### Core Framework Bug Fixes\n- Resolved async handling issues in the `getTweets` method by adding `await` to ensure proper promise handling in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#3796](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3796)).\n- Fixed issues related to the functionality of the Telegram client and RAG with the Postgres adapter in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#3793](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3793)).\n\n### Documentation and Code Quality\n- Updated outdated links in the documentation to enhance clarity and accessibility in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#3792](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3792)).\n- Corrected formatting issues in `intro.md` to improve readability in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#3788](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3788)).\n- Implemented linting and formatting commands to maintain code quality and consistency in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#3800](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3800)).\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Model initialization failures causing loops during user interaction ([elizaos/eliza#3801](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3801)).\n    - Text generation service not found in freshly installed instances ([elizaos/eliza#3802](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3802)).\n    - Connectivity issues with the Telegram client due to IPv6 defaults ([elizaos/eliza#3798](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3798)).\n    - Problems enabling default RAG with the Postgres adapter, leading to errors in embedding retrieval ([elizaos/eliza#3797](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3797)).\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Resolved issue regarding the `parseJSONObjectFromText` function breaking in versions 0.25.9 and earlier ([elizaos/eliza#3779](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3779)).\n    - Resolved issues with the Telegram client not initializing properly ([elizaos/eliza#3758](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3758))."

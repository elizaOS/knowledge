  "content": "On August 25, 2025, the ElizaOS project focused heavily on stabilizing the core `eliza` runtime with critical bug fixes and refining prompt logic for improved agent behavior. A significant new initiative was launched to enable dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations, aiming to enhance the sophistication of agent testing and interaction.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819): Discussion has begun with a detailed proposal for implementing dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations, including schema extensions, termination conditions, and evaluation schemas. Input is needed to move forward with this significant feature.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **Core Runtime Stability and Prompt Logic Refinements**:\n    - Fixed core runtime stability issues by reverting a `processActions` change and correcting a typo. [elizaos/eliza#5817](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5817)\n    - Refined prompt logic to enforce user ID requirements for authenticated actions. [elizaos/eliza#5815](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5815)\n    - Streamlined prompt generation by removing a duplicate block from the message handler template. [elizaos/eliza#5812](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5812)\n    - Improved the summary generation for the `exchangeDeliveredOrderItems` action for clearer descriptions. [elizaos/eliza#5818](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5818)\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n- **Active Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819): Detailed proposal for dynamic prompting in multi-turn conversations is under discussion, outlining schema extensions and implementation details.\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n- **New Issues**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819): Implement dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813): Plugin visibility after publishing.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5814](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5814): Analysis of options for the MCP Gateway."

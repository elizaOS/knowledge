  "content": "Overall Project Summary:\nToday's focus across ElizaOS involved significant enhancements to core testing infrastructure and API capabilities within `elizaos/eliza`, including E2E test coverage for all starter templates and integration of the new Sessions API. Concurrently, efforts began to debug a critical `pdfjs-dist` crashing issue in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge`, which also prompted a request for more user information to aid reproduction. A new issue regarding outdated documentation and the ElizaOS blog was also raised.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/37) and [elizaos/eliza#37](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/37): User `0xbbjoker` requires more information (setup details, loading methods, specific PDFs) from the issue creator to reproduce a critical `pdfjs-dist` crashing error.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5722](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5722): Discussion needed regarding the outdated `CHANGELOG.md` and the status of the ElizaOS blog.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **Enhanced Testing Infrastructure**:\n    - Enabled End-to-End (E2E) testing for all starter templates, addressing previous inconsistencies and allowing for more robust integration validation: [elizaos/eliza#5720](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5720).\n- **API Client Expansion and Core Cleanup**:\n    - Updated the API client to include support for the new Sessions API, providing a simplified interface for managing conversational state: [elizaos/eliza#5717](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5717).\n    - Removed unused plugin specification systems from the core package, streamlining the codebase: [elizaos/eliza#5724](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5724).\n- **Database Support Improvements**:\n    - Implemented a fix to ensure proper support for `plugin-mysql`, allowing its use before `plugin-sql` is enforced: [elizaos/eliza#5718](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5718).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n- **New Pull Requests**:\n    - elizaos/eliza:\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5723](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5723): Add a comprehensive scenario testing system.\n- **Active Discussions**:\n    - elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge:\n        - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/37): Debugging efforts are underway for a `pdfjs-dist` crashing issue, with attempts to reproduce the error.\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n- **New Issues**:\n    - elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge:\n        - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/37): Plugin Crashing with `pdfjs-dist` due to `TypeError: process.getBuiltinModule is not a function`.\n    - elizaos/eliza:\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5722](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5722): `CHANGELOG.md` not updated since January, questioning the whereabouts of the ElizaOS blog.\n\n## ✨ Contributor Spotlight\n- **0xbbjoker**: Actively engaged in debugging and attempting to reproduce the critical `pdfjs-dist` crashing issue ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#37](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/37), [elizaos/eliza#37](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/37)), providing detailed reproduction attempts and requesting necessary information to move forward."

  "content": "Today, the ElizaOS project saw significant dependency updates across core and development libraries, enhancing stability and leveraging new features. Concurrently, the core `eliza` repository focused on critical bug fixes for authentication, event emission, and plugin stability, alongside introducing a new `unregisterAction` method to the core runtime. A key issue regarding \"Entity not found\" in the reflection evaluator was clarified as intended behavior, while new issues emerged concerning embedding inconsistencies and prompt character limits.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#6380](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6380): This new issue highlights a problem where `USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING` is not respected, leading to a mismatch between the 384-dim zero vector fallback and the database adapter expecting a `dim_1536` column, requiring immediate investigation.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#6381](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6381): A new issue has been opened to address the 500-character limit in the first application prompt, which may impact agent functionality.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Dependency and Development Environment Upgrades\n- **Core Library Updates**:\n    - `zod` was bumped from 3.25.76 to 4.3.5, improving performance and incorporating new features ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#212](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/212)).\n    - `tailwind-merge` was updated from 2.6.0 to 3.4.0 ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#211](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/211)).\n    -

`@types/minimatch` was bumped from 5.1.2 to 6.0.0 ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#205](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/205)).\n- **Minor and Patch Dependency Bumps**:\n    - A group of minor and patch dependencies, including `prettier` and `task-master-ai`, were updated across the project to maintain consistency ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#215](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/215)).\n\n### Core Runtime and Stability Improvements\n- **Core Runtime Enhancements**:\n    - An `unregisterAction` method was added to the core runtime, enhancing flexibility in managing agent actions ([elizaos/eliza#6375](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6375), [elizaos/eliza#6372](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6372)).\n- **Authentication and Environment Variable Handling Fixes**:\n    - Proper loading of `.env` files in agent commands for authentication was implemented ([elizaos/eliza#6376](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6376), [elizaos/eliza#6374](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6374)).\n    - Directory path validation was added to `ensureDir` in CLI operations to prevent `ENOENT` errors ([elizaos/eliza#6379](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6379)).\n- **Plugin and Server Stability Improvements**:\n    - Entity connections are now ensured before saving facts in the reflection evaluator within `plugin-bootstrap` ([elizaos/eliza#6371](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6371), [elizaos/eliza#6370](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6370)).\n    - The `MESSAGE_SENT` event is now correctly emitted after sending to the central server ([elizaos/eliza#6378](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6378)).\n    - Action callbacks are now sent to the user in multi-step mode ([elizaos/eliza#6373](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6373)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    -

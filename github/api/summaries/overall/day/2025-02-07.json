  "content": "On Feb 7, 2025, the ElizaOS project significantly advanced its core framework by transitioning from pnpm to Bun for enhanced performance and implementing a generic model loading system with OpenAI-compatible endpoints. Key dependency and build issues were resolved, improving compatibility and stability across the system. The team also expanded integration capabilities by supporting the Anthropic provider.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:\n    - Missing `cors` and `multer` dependencies in `@elizaos/agent` are causing build issues, requiring immediate attention to resolve ([elizaos/eliza#3365](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3365)).\n    - The `pnpm run dev --characters` command is not loading specified characters, defaulting to Eliza, which impacts character-specific development and testing ([elizaos/eliza#3362](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3362)).\n    - The UI fails to load correctly when starting the service with a specific character file, hindering development and user experience ([elizaos/eliza#3360](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3360)).\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Framework Enhancements & Performance\n- Replaced pnpm with Bun to improve performance and enable future enhancements ([elizaos/eliza#2852](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/2852)).\n- Cleaned up the codebase for better maintainability ([elizaos/eliza#3116](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3116)).\n- Resolved a merge conflict to maintain code integrity ([elizaos/eliza#3367](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3367)).\n\n### Model Integration & Compatibility\n- Implemented a generic model loading system with OpenAI-compatible endpoints, simplifying provider setup ([elizaos/eliza#3114](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3114)).\n- Added support for the Anthropic provider, expanding integration capabilities ([elizaos/eliza#3364](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3364)).\n- Added `adapter-sqlite` to dependencies to ensure it loads as the default adapter when no other plugins are present ([elizaos/eliza#3357](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3357)).\n- Fixed build issues in core to target Node 23, enhancing compatibility ([elizaos/eliza#3371](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3371)).\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Missing `cors` and `multer` dependencies in the `@elizaos/agent` package, causing build issues ([elizaos/eliza#3365](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3365)).\n    - The command `pnpm run dev --characters` does not load the specified character, defaulting to the Eliza character instead ([elizaos/eliza#3362](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3362)).\n    - UI fails to load correctly when starting the service with a specific character file ([elizaos/eliza#3360](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3360)).\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Resolved a build failure issue from a recent release, ensuring the system compiles correctly ([elizaos/eliza#3322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3322))."

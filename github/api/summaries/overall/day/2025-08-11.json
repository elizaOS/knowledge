  "content": "Today, ElizaOS significantly advanced its core agent capabilities with a new character type system and enhanced OpenAI API compliance for tool calls, alongside integrating a new EVM plugin for blockchain tooling. Core infrastructure was also strengthened with a Hono server and refactored agent registry, while critical build and testing issues were addressed.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention \n- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738): Build failure in `@elizaos/core` is blocking testing of complex scenarios and requires an update on its resolution.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5719](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5719): The `startAgent` hanging issue needs an update on its resolution, as it impacts CLI functionality.\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738): jkbrooks is asking for an update on whether the build failure issue has been resolved.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5719](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5719): jkbrooks is asking for an update on whether the `startAgent` hanging issue has been resolved.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **Enhanced Agent Capabilities & API Compliance**:\n    - A new character type system, including \"JesseXBT,\" was introduced to improve API consistency for agents. [elizaos/eliza#5756](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5756)\n    - The chat completions API now supports visibility of intermediate tool calls and results while maintaining full OpenAI API compliance. [elizaos/eliza#5755](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5755)\n- **Core Infrastructure & EVM Integration**:\n    - The ElizaOS agent registry was refactored with the addition of a Hono server, enabling OpenAI-compatible API interaction with agents. [elizaos/eliza#5753](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5753)\n    - A new EVM plugin was integrated, providing wallet and blockchain tooling, including services for managing EVM chains and clients, and tools for token and wallet balance retrieval. [elizaos/eliza#5752](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5752)\n- **Build System & Testing Improvements**:\n    - Failing component tests in the project-starter template were fixed by replacing `mock.module` with `spyOn` for consistent logger testing. [elizaos/eliza#5748](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5748)\n    - Import paths were standardized by converting to `@/` aliases and barrel imports, along with a new Cursor rule for import consistency. [elizaos/eliza#5751](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5751)\n    - A temporary revert to relative import paths was performed as part of the import path standardization process. [elizaos/eliza/pull/5750](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5750)\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n- **New Issues**:\n    - elizaos/eliza:\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5749](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5749): Highlights the need for implementing runtime method mocking for deterministic agent testing, specifically for LLM interactions.\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5754](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5754): Reports that plugin publishing fails with false success reports, where `elizaos publish --npm` indicates success despite a 404 error."

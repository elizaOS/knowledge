  "content": "**Daily Project Summary: Aug 7, 2025**\n\nToday, the ElizaOS project significantly advanced its monorepo and release workflows, addressing critical CLI stability issues, while also making substantial progress on advanced scenario features like natural language agent interaction and dynamic plugin loading, though these are currently blocked by a persistent plugin loading bug.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention \n- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5727](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5727) Natural language agent interaction is complete but blocked by a plugin loading hang issue (#5719), preventing full testing.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5725](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5725) Dynamic plugin parsing and validation are complete but blocked by the same plugin loading hang issue (#5719), preventing real-world testing.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Monorepo & Release Workflow Improvements\n- Migrated to `workspace:*` versioning for improved dependency synchronization and consistency across packages ([elizaos/eliza#5731](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5731)).\n- Refined the release workflow by removing automatic `main` to `develop` merges, providing more control ([elizaos/eliza#5732](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5732)).\n\n### CLI Stability & Version Handling\n- Fixed a critical bug in the CLI's `update` command related to monorepo version handling, ensuring consistent CI test passes ([elizaos/eliza#5733](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5733)).\n\n### Scenario Runtime & Environment Fixes\n- Resolved issues with scenario runtime dependency auditing and evaluators ([elizaos/eliza#5640](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5640)).\n- Fixed an integration issue where environment providers were bypassing sophisticated logic ([elizaos/eliza#5639](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5639)).\n- Addressed an environment variable parsing issue where quotes were not handled correctly ([elizaos/eliza#5590](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5590)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5736](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5736) Fix action chaining\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5735](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5735) allow iframes when web ui is enabled in production\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5729](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5729) Update README.md to fix error\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5728](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5728) feat: ability to cancel current run before any calls to LLM are made\n\n### Active Discussions\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5726](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5726) Conditional Mocking and Complex Response Structures: Fix for JSON parsing error in E2B provider confirmed, core features 85% complete.\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5727](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5727) Natural language agent interaction and response validation.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5725](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5725) Plugin specification and dynamic loading within scenarios.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5726](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5726) Conditional mocking and complex response structures for testing.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5734](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5734) Eliza CLI failing to build projects due to `logger.info` formatting error.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5730](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5730) Release workflow incorrectly replacing `@elizaos` packages with version numbers in the monorepo.\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5640](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5640) Fix for runtime dependency auditing and evaluators.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5639](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5639) Integration fix for environment providers bypassing logic.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5590](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5590) Environment variables with quotes not being read correctly.\n\n## ✨ Contributor Spotlight\n- **Monilpat**: Provided significant updates and progress on advanced scenario features, including natural language agent interaction ([elizaos/eliza#5727](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5727)), dynamic plugin loading ([elizaos/eliza#5725](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5725)), and conditional mocking ([elizaos/eliza#5726](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5726))."

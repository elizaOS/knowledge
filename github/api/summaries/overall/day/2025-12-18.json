  "content": "On Dec 18, 2025, ElizaOS saw significant advancements in core streaming capabilities for text generation, alongside enhanced configuration options for the Anthropic plugin and improved Discord integration for memory management. User-facing features on the project website were also updated, including profile data export and streamlined configuration.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Pull Requests to Review**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263): A refactor to optimize provider handling in `MultiStep` within the default message service.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#6262](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6262): Remove the reassignment of `runtime.db` to individual connections.\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#6264](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6264): General documentation improvements are needed.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core AI Agent Enhancements\n- **Enhanced Streaming for Text Generation**: A major feature was introduced to enhance streaming support for text generation models across core, server, client, and API client packages, providing an opt-in streaming API via a `stream: true` parameter while maintaining backward compatibility. ([elizaos/eliza#6212](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6212))\n- **Anthropic Plugin Configuration**: The Anthropic plugin now supports configurable CoT (Chain of Thought) budgets and the `topP` option for text generation models, offering more granular control. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic#11](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/11))\n\n### Discord Plugin & Memory Management\n- **Discord Channel History and Memory Management**: Implemented a Discord channel history spider with persisted state, centralized the process of building memories from messages, and upgraded utilities for attachments and voice transcription with better logging and chunking capabilities. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord#30](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/30))\n\n### Website & Configuration Improvements\n- **User Profile Functionality**: Added a new feature to allow users to copy their profile data to LLMs and updated the site name from \"Contributor Analytics\" to \"HiScores.\" ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#183](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/183))\n- **Streamlined Configuration Management**: The site's `SITE_NAME` can now be configured directly from the pipeline config file, removing the dependency on GitHub secrets and simplifying setup for forks. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#182](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/182))\n- **Repository Cleanup**: Various development-related files and directories were cleaned up, contributing to a more organized and efficient codebase. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#181](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/181))\n\n### Testing Infrastructure\n- **CLI Test Runner Improvements**: Improvements were made to the CLI test runner, specifically within the e2e-tests actions and general test runner utilities, contributing to a more robust testing environment. ([elizaos/eliza#6212](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6212))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - A refactor to optimize provider handling in `MultiStep` within the default message service has been opened ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)).\n    - A pull request to remove the reassignment of `runtime.db` to individual connections has been opened ([#6262](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6262)).\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - A new issue has been opened regarding general documentation improvements ([#6264](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6264))."

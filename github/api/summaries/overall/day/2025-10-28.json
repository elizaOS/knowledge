  "content": "On October 28, 2025, ElizaOS saw a critical bug fix in the `eliza` repository addressing configuration management for character settings, ensuring proper merging of `.env` variables. Concurrently, the `docs` repository received a new pull request to integrate comprehensive documentation for x402 payment and Nginx deployment.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Configuration Management\n- A significant bug was resolved in `elizaos/eliza` that previously caused `.env` variables to be ignored when `character.settings.secrets` existed, ensuring global default configurations and character-specific overrides are correctly merged, preventing data loss and improving reliability. ([elizaos/eliza#6102](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6102))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/docs**: Documentation for X402 Payment Integration and Nginx Deployment ([elizaos/docs#77](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/77))"

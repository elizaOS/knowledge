  "content": "On March 22, 2025, the ElizaOS project focused on refining the core framework, with significant progress in user experience through a new drag-and-drop environment upload feature and critical bug fixes for Discord voice functionality. Several new issues emerged, primarily related to import errors, pre-commit hooks, and API key configurations, which will require attention.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n\n### User Experience & Documentation Improvements\n- Introduced a drag & drop option for environment uploading in `elizaos/eliza`, enhancing user interaction ([elizaos/eliza#4033](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/4033)).\n- Updated documentation in `elizaos/eliza` to correct the add plugin command in `quickstart.md` ([elizaos/eliza#4047](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/4047)).\n\n### Core Functionality Bug Fixes\n- Resolved issues with Discord voice functionality in `elizaos/eliza` by fixing underlying code and addressing an opus dependency problem ([elizaos/eliza#4036](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/4036), [elizaos/eliza#4035](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/4035)).\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Encountered a syntax error when trying to import `generateText` from `@elizaos/core`, indicating a missing export ([elizaos/eliza#4046](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/4046)).\n    - A Husky pre-commit error was reported, preventing successful commits due to an execution format error ([elizaos/eliza#4048](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/4048)).\n    - An error related to a missing Anthropic API key was logged, affecting voice channel operations ([elizaos/eliza#4049](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/issues/4049))."

  "content": "On Oct 6, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in core framework stability and agent management, with key refactoring efforts for the ElizaOS/Server, migration to UUID-only agent identification, and critical bug fixes addressing plugin reloading and runtime initialization. An emerging challenge involves TypeScript import errors in Eliza CLI 1.61, which is actively being investigated.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**: [elizaos/eliza#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031) Discussion continues regarding TypeScript import errors in Eliza CLI 1.61, with detailed output provided, indicating a potential package-related issue that needs further investigation.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Framework Refactoring & Configuration\n- Continued the multi-phase refactoring of the ElizaOS/Server, integrating new config and plugin modules to enhance modularity and extensibility. [elizaos/eliza#6037](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6037)\n- Added support for `SERVER_PORT` configuration, improving flexibility for deployment environments. [elizaos/eliza#6038](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6038)\n\n### Agent & Plugin Stability\n- Migrated to a UUID-only agent identification system, streamlining agent management and consistency. [elizaos/eliza#6036](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6036)\n- Addressed a critical bug where agent plugins were not reloading correctly on `PATCH` updates and resolved a service stop race condition. [elizaos/eliza#6040](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6040)\n- Fixed an issue in plugins to use the correct `ZodError.issues` API, ensuring proper error handling for invalid plugin configurations. [elizaos/eliza#6035](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6035)\n\n### Runtime & Service Reliability\n- Ensured that the runtime database is initialized before task access, preventing potential errors and improving task execution reliability. [elizaos/eliza#6039](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6039)\n- Implemented a fix in service interfaces to skip test execution for types-only packages, optimizing the build process. [elizaos/eliza#6034](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6034)\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/eliza**\n    - [fix: agent plugins not reloading on PATCH update and service stop race condition](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6040)\n    - [fix(task): ensure runtime database is initialized before task access](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6039)\n    - [support SERVER_PORT](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6038)\n    - [feat(core): add config and plugin modules - phase 4 - refactor ElizaOS/Server](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6037)\n    - [feat: migrate to UUID-only agent identification](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6036)\n    - [fix(plugins): use correct ZodError.issues API instead of .errors](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6035)\n    - [fix(service-interfaces): skip test execution for types-only package](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6034)\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### Active Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**\n    - [TypeScript Import Errors in Eliza CLI 1.61](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)\n\n## ✨ Contributor Spotlight\n- **matteo-brandolino**: Provided detailed diagnostic output for the TypeScript import errors in Eliza CLI 1.61, significantly aiding in narrowing down the issue."

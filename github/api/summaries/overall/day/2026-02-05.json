  "content": "On Feb 5, 2026, ElizaOS saw significant progress in core infrastructure with numerous closed issues related to messaging, OAuth, and database migrations in `elizaos/eliza`, alongside new feature development for workflow management in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow` and the expansion of the plugin registry with an AI agent job marketplace in `elizaos-plugins/registry`. The day also brought new issues focusing on user experience, AI model optimization, and further integration capabilities.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Infrastructure and Integration Enhancements\n- **elizaos/eliza**: Integrated a Twilio plugin for SMS fallback ([#6400](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6400)), implemented a \"poke-style\" onboarding flow ([#6413](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6413)), created a dedicated Eliza App landing page ([#6412](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6412)), and set up Telegram webhook registration ([#6425](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6425)). The messaging connection UI and routing service were also addressed ([#6431](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6431)).\n- **elizaos/eliza**: Verified serverless multi-tenant support ([#6415](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6415)), fixed a 3-second MCP plugin initialization delay ([#6432](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6432)), and provisioned a second Blue.io number for the dev environment ([#6446](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6446)). OAuth provider rollout for various services was completed ([#6437](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6437)), and a demo video for Google OAuth verification was recorded ([#6452](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6452)). Research into SMTP alternatives for Gmail OAuth was also concluded ([#6460](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6460)).\n\n### Database and Authentication Fixes\n- **elizaos/eliza**: Fixed a critical bug where user settings did not override agent settings, causing API key issues ([#6451](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6451)).\n- **elizaos/eliza**: Completed Drizzle migration cleanup, addressing issues with manual migration scripts ([#6444](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6444)), and reverted authentication implementation while restoring the auth page ([#6455](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6455)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow**:\n    - [#14](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/14) Add feature for modifying existing workflows and validating output schemas.\n- **elizaos-plugins/registry**:\n    - [#255](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/255) Add `plugin-moltbazaar`, an AI Agent Job Marketplace on Base.\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [#6461](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6461) Update dependencies, training pipeline, and tests for the 2048 game example.\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [#6462](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6462) Enforce single OAuth connections per platform per user and link Eliza App users to existing Cloud users.\n    - [#6463](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6463) Deploy and test MCP servers for various OAuth integrations like Linear, GitHub, Slack, Notion, and HubSpot.\n    - [#6464](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6464) Map out user journeys for the Eliza App, covering both utility-first and conversational flows.\n    - [#6465](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6465) Propose a feedback system for NPC posts to improve character consistency.\n    - [#6466](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6466) Plan a system for injecting top news stories with community voting into Babylon.\n    - [#6467](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6467) Address the optimization of AI model usage for the coding process.\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [#6400](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6400) Integrate Twilio plugin for SMS fallback.\n    - [#6413](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6413) Implement \"poke-style\" onboarding flow.\n    - [#6412](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6412) Create dedicated Eliza App landing page.\n    - [#6425](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6425) Set up Telegram webhook registration.\n    - [#6431](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6431) Address messaging connection UI and routing service.\n    - [#6415](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6415) Verify serverless multi-tenant support.\n    - [#6432](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6432) Fix 3-second MCP plugin initialization delay.\n    - [#6446](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6446) Provision a second Blue.io number for the dev environment.\n    - [#6437](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6437) Complete OAuth provider rollout for various services.\n    - [#6452](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6452) Record demo video for Google OAuth verification.\n    - [#6460](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6460) Conclude research into SMTP alternatives for Gmail OAuth.\n    - [#6451](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6451) Fix bug where user settings did not override agent settings, causing API key issues.\n    - [#6444](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6444) Complete Drizzle migration cleanup.\n    - [#6455](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6455) Revert authentication implementation and restore auth page."

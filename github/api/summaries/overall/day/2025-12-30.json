  "content": "On December 30, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in core logging and agent interaction fixes within the `elizaos/eliza` repository, alongside the introduction of new features like unified hooks with multi-transport support. Additionally, the `elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai` repository began implementing image description fixes and caching for audio and image handlers.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core System Stability & Logging\n*   Resolved a critical bug in `elizaos/eliza` where streaming LLM calls were not being logged to the database, ensuring all model interactions are now properly recorded. ([elizaos/eliza#6296](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6296))\n\n### User Interface & Agent Experience Improvements\n*   Fixed an issue in `elizaos/eliza` where agent cards were not resizing correctly to match dashboard agent cards. ([elizaos/eliza#6291](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6291))\n*   Corrected the behavior in `elizaos/eliza` where clicking on an agent with existing conversations would start a new chat instead of opening the existing one. ([elizaos/eliza#6295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6295))\n\n### Documentation & Code Quality\n*   Addressed spacing issues in numbered items within `elizaos/eliza`. ([elizaos/eliza#6283](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6283))\n*   Completed fixes for monorepo documentation in `elizaos/eliza`. ([elizaos/eliza#6284](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6284))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai**\n    *   [#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/23): Fix image descriptions and add caching to audio and image handlers.\n*   **elizaos/eliza**\n    *   [#6300](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300): Introduce unified hooks with multi-transport support (HTTP/SSE/WebSocket).\n    *   [#6297](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6297): Correct a typo from \"saftey\" to \"safety\".\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n*   **elizaos/eliza**\n    *   [#6298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6298): Identified architectural issues within the messaging API, including double/triple processing of messages and dead code.\n    *   [#6299](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6299): Opened to address the need for \"Unslop Apps\" and improve application structure.\n\n### Closed Issues\n*   **elizaos/eliza**\n    *   [#6291](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6291): Agent card not resizing to match dashboard agent cards.\n    *   [#6295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6295): Clicking on agent with existing conversations leads to brand new chat.\n    *   [#6283](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6283): Spacing in numbered items.\n    *   [#6284](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6284): Monorepo documentation fixes."

  "content": "On December 30, 2025, ElizaOS saw significant progress in core runtime stability with a critical fix for LLM call logging in `elizaos/eliza`, alongside new feature development including unified hooks for multi-transport support and image description fixes with caching in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai`. The day also included several UI/UX improvements and documentation updates, while new issues highlighted architectural concerns in the messaging API and general application polish.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Runtime Stability & Logging\n*   Fixed a critical bug in `elizaos/eliza` where streaming LLM calls were not being logged to the database due to incorrect code placement, ensuring all LLM calls are now properly recorded ([elizaos/eliza#6296](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6296)).\n\n### UI/UX Improvements & Documentation\n*   Resolved issues related to spacing in numbered items in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#6283](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6283)).\n*   Addressed an issue in `elizaos/eliza` where agent cards were not resizing to match dashboard agent cards ([elizaos/eliza#6291](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6291)).\n*   Fixed the behavior in `elizaos/eliza` where clicking an agent always led to a brand new chat instead of an existing conversation if one existed ([elizaos/eliza#6295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6295)).\n*   Fixed and updated documentation for the monorepo in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#6284](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6284)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai**\n    *   [#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/23): Fixes image descriptions and implements caching for audio and image handlers.\n*   **elizaos/eliza**\n    *   [#6300](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300): Introduces unified hooks with multi-transport support for HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket.\n    *   [#6297](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6297): Minor fix addressing a typo (\"saftey\" to \"safety\").\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n*   **elizaos/eliza**\n    *   [#6298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6298): Highlights several architectural problems within the current messaging API, including double/triple processing of messages and dead code related to WebSocket handling.\n    *   [#6299](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6299): \"Unslop Apps\" - indicates a need to address general application sloppiness or lack of polish."

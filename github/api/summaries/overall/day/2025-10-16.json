  "content": "Today, the project saw significant advancements in both core framework architecture and plugin capabilities. The `elizaos/eliza` repository focused on streamlining the CLI by integrating server/core functionalities and refining plugin error handling, while `elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana` made critical progress on Token-2022 support and bug fixes, enhancing wallet data management and application resilience. These efforts collectively improve the framework's stability, modularity, and ability to interact with advanced blockchain features.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n\n### Core CLI Simplification and Architectural Alignment\n- The CLI has been significantly simplified by removing redundant module loaders and integrating server/core functionalities directly, reducing duplication and improving overall architecture. [elizaos/eliza#6060](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6060)\n- Server code was refactored to utilize ElizaOS global functions, and bootstrap logic was decoupled from the CLI, centralizing it within the core for a cleaner architecture. [elizaos/eliza#5933](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5933)\n\n### Enhanced Plugin Error Handling\n- Plugin error handling was improved to correctly use the `ZodError.issues` API, ensuring consistent and proper error reporting across different plugin starters. [elizaos/eliza#6035](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6035)\n\n### Solana Plugin Token-2022 Support and Wallet Data\n- The Solana plugin now includes Token-2022-aware token parsing, supporting symbols, mutability, and supply, along with batch symbol backfill and combined SPL+Token-2022 account discovery. [elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana#14](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/14)\n\n### Solana Plugin Bug Fixes and Resilience\n- Critical TypeScript errors were resolved, logging was improved, and the application now continues in standalone mode if trading services are unavailable, enhancing stability. [elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/15)\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/eliza**\n    - [elizaos/eliza#6069](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6069): refactor(tests): Move character builder logic to core (Draft)\n    - [elizaos/eliza#6068](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6068): feat(server): auto-inject bootstrap and SQL plugins (Draft)\n    - [elizaos/eliza#6067](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6067): fix: current chat and user messages filters in memory viewer (Draft)\n    - [elizaos/eliza#6066](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6066): feat: make evaluators run asynchronously in background (Draft)\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana**\n    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/16): This pull request introduces further improvements, type fixes, and incorporates items from a previous PR9, indicating ongoing refinement and integration efforts.\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5933](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5933): Core Refactoring and CLI Decoupling - This issue was closed following a significant refactoring effort to align server code with ElizaOS global functions and decouple bootstrap logic from the CLI."

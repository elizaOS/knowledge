  "content": "Today's development focused on critical bug fixes and documentation improvements across the `eliza` and `plugin-knowledge` repositories. Key achievements include resolving a bug preventing the saving of large character files in `eliza` and enhancing contextual knowledge processing and UI components in `plugin-knowledge`. Other repositories had no development activity.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core System Stability & Documentation\n*   **eliza**: Fixed a critical bug preventing the saving of large character files by increasing the Express JSON payload limit, including a regression test to prevent future occurrences ([elizaos/eliza#5308](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5308)).\n*   **eliza**: Enhanced documentation to clarify that `plugin-bootstrap` is mandatory for basic agent functionality, improving clarity for new users ([elizaos/eliza#5309](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5309)).\n\n### Plugin Enhancements & Reliability\n*   **plugin-knowledge**: Resolved critical bugs related to contextual knowledge functions and document loading, improving error handling and refining the document processing pipeline ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#29](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/29)).\n*   **plugin-knowledge**: Improved logging with better rate limiting and enhanced UI components like the search bar and document list view for a more polished user experience ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#29](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/29)).\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### Closed Issues\n*   **eliza**: The issue where users could not save large character files due to a \"request entity too large\" error has been resolved by increasing the server's JSON payload limit ([elizaos/eliza#5268](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5268))."

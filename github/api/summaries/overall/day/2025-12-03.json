  "content": "On December 3, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw foundational development with new pull requests opened for a unified serverless API and robust JWT authentication in the `eliza` repository, alongside significant enhancements to the MCP provider and tool response handling in `plugin-mcp`. These efforts collectively advance the framework's core capabilities and plugin flexibility.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Plugin Enhancements\n- The `plugin-mcp` repository enhanced its MCP provider with an optional `mcpText` field for formatted configuration and improved tool response handling by changing `handleToolResponse` to return a `Memory` object and enhancing `callTool`. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/19))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Implement unified serverless API for Node.js ([#6201](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6201))\n    - Implement JWT authentication and user management ([#6200](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6200))"

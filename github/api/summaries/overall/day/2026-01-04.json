  "content": "On January 4, 2026, the ElizaOS project focused primarily on identifying and documenting new areas for improvement, particularly within the `elizaos/eliza` repository, with several new issues opened concerning agent interaction, UI/UX consistency, and conversation management. No new code was contributed or merged across the project today.\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n- **New Issues**:\n    - An issue was opened regarding the inability to easily re-find an agent after closing a chat, highlighting a need for an \"agent following\" or bookmarking feature ([#6321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6321)).\n    - A problem with agent sorting not functioning as expected was reported ([#6319](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6319)).\n    - A request was made to change the term \"Chat\" to \"Talk\" across the platform for consistency ([#6320](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6320)).\n    - A bug was identified where a page refresh is required for a deleted conversation to visually disappear ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322))."

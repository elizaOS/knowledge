  "content": "Today, ElizaOS focused on enhancing core stability and expanding plugin capabilities. Key achievements include significant improvements to CLI stability and the update mechanism, particularly for Windows environments, and the addition of a new plugin, `plugin-octav`, to the registry. Ongoing discussions address critical issues such as Web UI documentation, update notifications for alpha versions, and a persistent SQL database error affecting the Twitter plugin.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Stability and Update Mechanism Enhancements\n*   Comprehensive improvements to Windows CI tests and dev command enhancements to fix flakiness and process management issues on Windows environments ([elizaos/eliza#5982](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5982)).\n*   The CLI update checker now respects distribution channels, ensuring users only receive update notifications relevant to their current channel ([elizaos/eliza#5980](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5980)).\n\n### Release Process and Build System Fixes\n*   Addressed critical issues in client bundling, dev-loop restarts, and database runtime modes, and enforced TypeScript type-check failures to halt builds ([elizaos/eliza#5985](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5985)).\n\n### Plugin Registry Expansion\n*   A new plugin, `plugin-octav`, was added to the registry's `index.json` file, expanding available plugins ([elizaos-plugins/registry#230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/230)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### Active Discussions\n*   **Web UI Dashboard Documentation**: Discussions continue regarding the lack of documentation for the Web UI dashboard, with contributors asserting documentation exists in the quickstart guide while users question UX prioritization ([elizaos-plugins/registry#5857](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5857), [elizaos/eliza#5857](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5857)).\n*   **Update Notification Logic for Alpha Versions**: Further comments were made on the issue concerning update notifications for alpha versions when a user is not on an alpha distribution, with confirmation that the issue has been fixed ([elizaos-plugins/registry#5971](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5971), [elizaos/eliza#5971](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5971)).\n*   **Twitter Plugin SQL Database Error**: Users reported and discussed an error with the Twitter plugin related to SQL database operations, with requests for version information to reproduce and inquiries about workarounds ([elizaos-plugins/registry#39](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/39), [elizaos/eliza#39](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/39))."

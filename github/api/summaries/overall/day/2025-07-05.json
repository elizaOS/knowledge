  "content": "Overall Project Summary:\nToday's development saw significant progress in the `elizaos/eliza` core, with a critical bug fix for DM channel creation logic and new PRs addressing Windows plugin loading and CLI command refinements. Concurrently, `elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter` initiated foundational work to switch its test setup to Bun, aligning with ElizaOS standards. Other repositories remained quiet.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n*   **Core Logic Refinements**\n    *   Fixed an issue in `elizaos/eliza` where stale `latestChannelMessages` state led to incorrect DM channel reuse or creation by refactoring the logic to fetch live message counts. ([elizaos/eliza#5411](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5411))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n*   **New Pull Requests**\n    *   **elizaos/eliza**\n        *   Fix Windows plugin loading issues.

([elizaos/eliza#5413](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5413))\n    *   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter**\n        *   Update testing infrastructure by migrating from Vitest to a Bun-based configuration to improve test coverage and align with ElizaOS standards. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter#35](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/35))\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n*   **New Issues**\n    *   **elizaos/eliza**\n        *   JSDoc parameter mismatches within the core package are causing documentation warnings during the build process. ([elizaos/eliza#5410](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5410))\n    *   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter**\n        *   Proposes switching from the existing Vitest setup to a working Bun setup for improved test coverage and alignment with ElizaOS project standards.

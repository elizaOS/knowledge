  "content": "ElizaOS made significant strides today, enhancing its core architecture with standardized interfaces and improved CLI tooling, including a new backend-only plugin template, while also implementing multi-repository summarization for improved reporting. A new plugin, `plugin-bonsai`, was published to the registry, though ongoing discussions persist regarding Twitter API rate limits affecting timeline fetching.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention \n- **Urgent Discussions**: The \"Twitter API Rate Limit and Timeline Fetching Issues\" ([elizaos-plugins/registry#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/38), [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#38](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/38), [elizaos/eliza#38](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/38)) requires clarification on the specific rate limit for the $200/month Twitter API tier to determine if it's a viable solution for users.\n- **Blocked Issues/PRs**: The \"Plugin Schema Migration Challenges\" ([elizaos/eliza#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588)) needs investigation into why `DatabaseMigrationService` is not registered as a runtime service, potentially blocking custom plugin schema migrations.\n- **Blocked Issues/PRs**: The \"Environment Variable Parsing Issue\" ([elizaos/eliza#5590](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5590)) needs attention to resolve issues with environment variable reading when values are enclosed in quotes.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Framework Enhancements\n- **Standardized Service Interfaces**: Implemented service types and standardized interfaces, including a `getServicesByType()` method, to improve modularity and extensibility for building abstract plugins. ([elizaos/eliza#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565))\n- **CLI Tooling Improvements**: Introduced a new `plugin-quick-starter` template for backend-only plugins, improved CI tests for the CLI, and migrated to Bun's native process spawning for better performance. ([elizaos/eliza#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589), [elizaos/eliza#5586](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5586))\n- **Critical Bug Fixes**: Addressed issues such as improved `bunx` detection, correct `installModelPlugin` calls, handling of port conflicts, and removal of plaintext passwords from test constants, enhancing stability and security. ([elizaos/eliza#5599](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5599), [elizaos/eliza#5598](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5598), [elizaos/eliza#5597](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5597), [elizaos/eliza#5592](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5592))\n- **Ollama Plugin Refinement & Type Safety**: Made Ollama plugin integration conditional, resolved TypeScript `any` type violations, and removed duplicate interface definitions, improving type safety and build stability. ([elizaos/eliza#5594](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5594), [elizaos/eliza#5593](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5593), [elizaos/eliza#5587](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5587), [elizaos/eliza#5596](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5596))\n\n### Reporting & Plugin Registry\n- **Multi-Repository Summarization**: Implemented a major new feature enabling the generation of overall project summaries across all repositories, significantly improving reporting and analytical capabilities. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#142](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/142))\n- **New Plugin Publication**: The `plugin-bonsai` has been successfully published to the registry, meeting all inclusion checklist items. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#191](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/191))\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Plugin Schema Migration Challenges ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588)): Difficulties with custom plugin schema migrations due to `DatabaseMigrationService` not being registered.\n    - Environment Variable Parsing Issue ([#5590](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5590)): Problem reading environment variables when values are enclosed in quotes.\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**:\n    - Multi-Repository Summarization ([#141](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/141)): Successfully completed the implementation of multi-repository summarization.\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Service Type System Implemented ([#4914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914)): Completed the implementation of service types and the `getServicesByType()` method.\n\n## ✨ Contributor Spotlight\n- The team behind the multi-repository summarization feature in `elizaos/elizaos.github.io` for significantly enhancing the project's reporting capabilities.\n- The developers who implemented the enhanced service architecture and standardized interfaces in `elizaos/eliza` for improving modularity and extensibility.\n- The contributors who published `plugin-bonsai` to the `elizaos-plugins/registry`, expanding the available plugins."

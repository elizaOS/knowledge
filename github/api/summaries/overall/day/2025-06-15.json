  "content": "Today, ElizaOS saw significant architectural advancements with the server package separation from the CLI, enhancing modularity and independent usage. Extensive bug fixes across core components and plugins improved stability, complemented by comprehensive documentation updates and expanded testing infrastructure. Key discussions continued on Bedrock LLM integration and API endpoint clarifications.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention \n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - elizaos/eliza#5117: The discussion around integrating Bedrock as an LLM continues, with a dedicated plugin for Bedrock being developed and soon to be released, requiring feedback.\n    - elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster#5117: The discussion around integrating Bedrock as an LLM continues, with a dedicated plugin for Bedrock being developed and soon to be released, requiring feedback.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Architecture & Modularity\n- The server functionality was extracted into a new, independent `@elizaos/server` package, maintaining backward compatibility and enabling independent usage of server components. [elizaos/eliza#5122](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5122)\n\n### Stability & Bug Fixes\n- Critical CLI test failures caused by circular dependencies and missing runtime methods were resolved. [elizaos/eliza#5135](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5135)\n- Typographical errors in plugin documentation and action responses were corrected. [elizaos/eliza#5130](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5130), [elizaos/eliza#5127](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5127)\n- Agent thinking state synchronization and evaluator callbacks were improved. [elizaos/eliza#5128](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5128), [elizaos/eliza#5129](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5129)\n- The CLI codebase underwent strict typing and dependency updates for enhanced robustness. [elizaos/eliza#5126](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5126)\n- An error when enabling 'post' and 'dryrun' settings from the `.env` file in the Farcaster plugin was fixed. [elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/1)\n\n### Testing & Documentation Enhancements\n- Comprehensive tests were added for core, server, project-starter, and plugin-starter, including new Cypress tests for frontend components. [elizaos/eliza#5125](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5125)\n- Documentation received a major overhaul with extensive accuracy and consistency updates across API router documentation, CLI overviews, and quickstart guides. [elizaos/eliza#5134](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5134)\n- A duplicated link in the sidebars was removed. [elizaos/eliza#5119](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5119)\n- Docstrings were added to `refactor/farcaster-post-to-cast-nomenclature` to improve code documentation.

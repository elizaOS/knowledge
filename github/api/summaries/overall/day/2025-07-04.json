  "content": "Today's focus was on significant UI/UX enhancements and critical bug fixes within the `eliza` core, alongside a major refactoring of the `plugin-twitter` for API v2 migration. Foundational improvements for testing and CLI consistency were also implemented, while discussions continued on standardizing GUI terminology.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussion**: The issue [#5377](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5377) (also active in `elizaos-plugins/registry` and `elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter`) regarding the \"Actions\" tab in the GUI needs final confirmation on renaming to \"Model Calls\" as a developer has already proceeded with this change.\n- **New Issue**: Plugin loading failures on Windows for `@elizaos/plugin-openai` and `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` were reported in [#5407](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5407) in `elizaos/eliza` and require investigation.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n\n### Enhanced User Experience & Client-Side Refinements (elizaos/eliza)\n- Improved client-side UI with a new header dropdown for agent actions, refined cursor pointer interactions, and a redesigned DM chat header. Avatar handling and styling consistency were also improved, and the 'Actions' tab was updated to 'Model Calls' for clarity. ([#5403](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5403), [#5397](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5397), [#5392](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5392), [#5391](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5391), [#5390](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5390))\n\n### Critical Bug Fixes & Stability Improvements (elizaos/eliza)\n- Addressed several significant bugs including a group chat crash, new chat creation issues, and avatar preservation during secret updates. Agent card behavior for new chat initiation was refactored, and backward compatibility for agent bios was ensured. CI stability was also improved by standardizing memory allocation and test execution. ([#5406](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5406), [#5405](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5405), [#5402](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5402), [#5400](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5400), [#5399](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5399), [#5398](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5398), [#5387](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5387))\n\n### Foundational Development & CLI Consistency (elizaos/eliza)\n- Introduced a base setup for Bun tests for the `app` package and migrated the CLI to `@clack/prompts` for all input methods, ensuring consistency and improved user experience. ([#5368](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5368), [#5359](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5359))\n\n### Plugin API Migration & Codebase Cleanup (elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter)\n- Completed a major refactoring of the Twitter plugin, migrating from unofficial GraphQL endpoints to the official Twitter API v2 and removing over 3,500 lines of legacy code to improve maintainability. ([#33](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/33))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - CLI Command Refinements: [#5409](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5409) (addressing nitpicks in the CLI `create` command)\n    - CI Workflow for Claude Code: [#5394](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5394) (proposing Claude Code integration)\n- **elizaos-plugins/registry**:\n    - Add `plugin-desearch`: [#186](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/186) (to add `plugin-desearch` to the registry)\n\n### Active Discussions\n- **elizaos/eliza**, **elizaos-plugins/registry**, **elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter**:\n    - Review of Actions Tab in GUI: [#5377](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5377) (discussion on renaming the 'Actions' tab to 'Model Calls' in the GUI)\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Plugin Loading Failures on Windows: [#5407](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5407) (failure to load `@elizaos/plugin-openai` and `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` on Windows)\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - CLI Input Method Standardization: [#5295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5295) (migration of remaining CLI input methods to `@clack/prompts` for consistency)"

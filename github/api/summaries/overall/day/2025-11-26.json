  "content": "Overall Project Summary:\nToday's development saw a significant, project-wide initiative to implement structured logging across several `elizaos-plugins` repositories, including `plugin-knowledge`, `plugin-telegram`, `plugin-openrouter`, and `plugin-discord`. Concurrently, the core `elizaos/eliza` repository addressed a critical TypeScript declaration bug and saw a substantial influx of new issues focused on UI/UX improvements, agent builder optimizations, and new feature proposals like crypto payments and an affiliate system.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core System Stability\n*   **elizaos/eliza**: A critical TypeScript declaration build failure related to `instanceof` checks on generic types was resolved by adding a new `isPlainObject` type guard and replacing manual `instanceof` checks in `runtime.ts` to improve type safety and build stability ([elizaos/eliza#6170](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6170)).\n\n### Codebase Hygiene and Maintainability\n*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord**: Dead/commented code was removed and clarifying comments were added around interaction handling and channel ID notes in the Discord service, improving maintainability without introducing functional changes ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord#28](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/28)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge**:\n    *   [#48](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/48) refactor: implement structured logging\n*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram**:\n    *   [#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/21) implement structured logging\n*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter**:\n    *   [#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/20) refactor: standardize logging format\n*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord**:\n    *   [#27](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/27) refactor: implement structured logging\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n*   **elizaos/eliza**:\n    *   **Agent Builder and Studio Enhancements**:\n        *   [#6185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6185) Optimize model selection for speed\n        *   [#6186](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6186) Fix image/video tab functionality\n        *   [#6189](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6189) Implement inline image/video generation\n        *   [#6190](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6190) Add capability toggles for performance\n        *   [#6183](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6183) \"Unsaved Changes\" warning\n        *   [#6176](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6176) Distinct visual theme for \"Build Mode\"\n    *   **UI/UX and Navigation Refinements**:\n        *   [#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173) Consolidate \"Chat\" and \"Creator\" into \"My Agents\"\n        *   [#6174](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6174) Clean up sidebar user info redundancy\n        *   [#6175](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6175) Move billing/credits to top-level navigation\n        *   [#6177](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6177) Add \"$\" to credit balances\n        *   [#6178](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6178) Update status dot colors\n        *   [#6179](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6179) Remove \"Quick Presets\" from Generation Studio\n    *   **Landing Page and Deployment Fixes**:\n        *   [#6180](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6180) Fix landing page \"Enter\" key event\n        *   [#6181](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6181) Persist landing page prompts to builder\n        *   [#6187](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6187) Container deployment bug\n    *   **New Features and Integrations**:\n        *   [#6172](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6172) Affiliate system for cloud mini-apps\n        *   [#6184](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6184) Redirect billing to Stripe Checkout\n        *   [#6191](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6191) Implement crypto payments for credits"

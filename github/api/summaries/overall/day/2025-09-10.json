  "content": "ElizaOS's development on September 10, 2025, focused on significant enhancements to monitoring and debugging capabilities within the core `eliza` repository, alongside foundational work for backend runs tracking. Additionally, a new plugin was added to the registry, and a utility for boolean parsing was introduced in `plugin-twitter`. Critical bug fixes and dependency updates also contributed to overall system stability.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n\n### Enhanced Monitoring and Debugging\n*   Sentry's Vercel AI integration was added to the server for improved error tracking ([elizaos/eliza#5963](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5963)).\n*   The Sentry browser SDK was removed from the core package to optimize size and prevent conflicts ([elizaos/eliza#5961](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5961)).\n*   Client-side debugging was enhanced with sourcemaps and improved React version handling ([elizaos/eliza#5962](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5962)).\n\n### Backend Infrastructure Development\n*   Foundational backend components for runs tracking were implemented across the server, core, bootstrap, and API client packages, including structured logging and new API client services ([elizaos/eliza#5953](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5953)).\n\n### Plugin Ecosystem Updates\n*   The `@standujar/plugin-composio` plugin was added to the registry's `index.json` file ([elizaos-plugins/registry#217](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/217)).\n\n### Critical Bug Fixes and Dependency Updates\n*   A `Buffer` to `Blob` type compatibility error in the API client was resolved ([elizaos/eliza#5960](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5960)).\n*   TypeScript build errors in `plugin-bootstrap` were fixed ([elizaos/eliza#5959](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5959)).\n*   Action notifications were fixed to only send for `client_chat` messages ([elizaos/eliza#5957](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5957)).\n*   The `vite` dependency in the client package was updated from 6.1.6 to 6.3.6 ([elizaos/eliza#5946](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5946)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n\n### New Pull Requests\n*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter**\n    *   Introduce `parseBooleanFromText` utility ([#42](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/42))\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n\n### New Issues\n*   **elizaos/eliza**\n    *   Broken LLM link in docs ([#5954](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5954))\n    *   Clear out docs-related issues ([#5956](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5956))\n    *   Fully wrap up browser support ([#5958](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5958))\n    *   ETH Tokyo Workshop preparation ([#5955](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5955))\n    *   Integrate `plugin-quickswap` ([#5947](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5947))\n    *   Integrate `plugin-alethea` ([#5948](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5948))\n    *   Integrate `plugin-rofl` ([#5949](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5949))\n    *   Integrate `plugin-polymarket` ([#5950](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5950))\n    *   Integrate `plugin-polygon-zkevm` ([#5951](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5951))\n    *   Integrate `plugin-polygon` ([#5952](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5952))\n\n### Closed Issues\n*   **elizaos/eliza**\n    *   Implement Tau-Bench in v2 ([#5765](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5765))\n    *   Fix broken logger ([#5886](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5886))"

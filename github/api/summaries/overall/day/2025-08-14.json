  "content": "On Aug 14, 2025, the ElizaOS project focused on enhancing the CLI's publishing capabilities and release workflows, alongside resolving critical issues related to agent startup and project building. Key fixes included addressing CLI publish command bugs and resolving agent startup hangs, while discussions continued on Eliza agent deployment strategies.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention \n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5244](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5244): Discussions are ongoing regarding the best strategies for deploying custom Eliza agents, with a recent suggestion to explore AWS.\n- **New Issues**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5770](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5770): Guidance is needed for persistent testing errors encountered during plugin development, specifically `bun test` failures.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **CLI & Release Workflow Improvements**:\n    - Fixed a bug in the `elizaos publish` command affecting `--test` and `--npm` flags, ensuring a smoother publishing process. ([elizaos/eliza#5763](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5763))\n    - Adjusted CI release workflow by removing an automatic 'merge main to develop' step and synchronizing package metadata. ([elizaos/eliza#5775](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5775))\n- **Agent & Project Stability Fixes**:\n    - Resolved an issue where `startAgent` would hang, particularly when `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` was omitted or included, improving agent startup reliability. ([elizaos/eliza#5719](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5719))\n    - Fixed the Eliza CLI's failure to build projects upon creation due to a `TS2345` error, enabling successful project initialization. ([elizaos/eliza#5734](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5734))\n- **Scenario Evaluation Feature**:\n    - Completed the feature request to add an evaluator for measuring per-step execution duration and asserting against bounds in scenarios. ([elizaos/eliza#5757](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5757))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n- **New Pull Requests**:\n    - **elizaos/eliza**:\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5774](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5774) fix: correct comma placement when adding entries to registry index.json\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5773](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5773) fix: fix: phala CLI argument handling and tee starter docker build\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - **New Issues**:\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5770](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5770) Plugin Testing Guidance\n    - **Closed Issues**:\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5719](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5719) Agent Startup and Plugin Handling Fixes\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5734](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5734) CLI Project Build Resolution\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5757](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5757) Scenario Execution Time Evaluator"

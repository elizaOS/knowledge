  "content": "Today, ElizaOS significantly expanded its AI capabilities by integrating Google Generative AI and improved CLI performance through lazy loading. The client UI received substantial enhancements for agent settings and responsiveness, while core system stability was boosted with extensive bug fixes and code cleanup. A new \"kudo\" plugin was added to the registry, and critical guidance was provided for the `elizaos update` command.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#4924](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4924) The web client continues to display an incorrect version number, triggering update banners and causing confusion, despite previous attempts to resolve it.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5216](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5216) The `sendAgentResponseToBus` function is not emitting the `EventType.MESSAGE_SENT` event, which could impact central server API communication.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5218) Inconsistent `bun run test` behavior across packages is leading to unreliable test execution and an inconsistent developer experience.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **AI and CLI Enhancements**:\n    - Integrated Google Generative AI (Gemini) support into the ElizaOS CLI and refactored CLI prompts for clarity. ([elizaos/eliza#5217](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5217), [elizaos/eliza#5215](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5215))\n    - Implemented lazy loading for test dependencies and the Discord plugin in starter templates, reducing initial project size and speeding up `elizaos create`. ([elizaos/eliza#5214](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5214))\n- **UI/UX Improvements and Agent Management**:\n    - Added new agent settings to the client for better configuration and user experience. ([elizaos/eliza#5202](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5202))\n    - Ensured documentation links open in new tabs for improved navigation. ([elizaos/eliza#5213](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5213))\n    - Addressed UI bugs including responsive issues with agent cards, saving environment settings, and editing/adding new secrets in the secret panel. ([elizaos/eliza#5223](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5223), [elizaos/eliza#5212](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5212), [elizaos/eliza#5210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5210), [elizaos/eliza#5209](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5209))\n- **Core System Stability and Maintenance**:\n    - Removed all CI caching to prevent issues and corrected incorrectly scoped plugin names. ([elizaos/eliza#5225](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5225), [elizaos/eliza#5220](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5220))\n    - Resolved the `__dirname` issue for ES modules in the copy-template utility and updated CLI create option tests. ([elizaos/eliza#5219](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5219), [elizaos/eliza#5206](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5206))\n    - Performed significant code cleanup in the `core` and `plugin-sql` packages and removed CLI tests from integration tests to avoid duplication. ([elizaos/eliza#5224](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5224), [elizaos/eliza#5222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5222), [elizaos/eliza#5226](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5226))\n- **Documentation and Plugin Registry Updates**:\n    - Added comprehensive documentation for GitHub Actions workflows, data pipeline architecture, and development work. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#129](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/129))\n    - Expanded the plugin registry by adding a new \"kudo\" plugin. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#179](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/179))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n- **New Pull Requests**:\n    - **elizaos/eliza**:\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5221) fix: look for client/dist in multiple locations\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5205](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5205) fix: unit and integration tests\n- **Active Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#4931](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4931) Users are seeking a method to verify currently loaded plugins when an agent is running via `elizaos start`.\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n- **New Issues**:\n    - **elizaos/eliza**:\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5216](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5216) Message Event Not Emitting\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5218) Inconsistent Test Execution\n- **Closed Issues**:\n    - **elizaos/eliza**:\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5198](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5198) CLI Update Mechanism Resolved (Users advised to use `bun install -g @elizaos/cli@latest` for initial global updates)\n    - **elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge**:\n        - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#5198](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5198) CLI Update Command Resolution\n    - **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**:\n        - [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#5198](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5198) CLI Update Functionality\n    - **elizaos-plugins/registry**:\n        - [elizaos-plugins/registry#5198](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5198) CLI Update Mechanism Resolution\n\n## ✨ Contributor Spotlight\n- **standujar**: Provided crucial guidance on how to check currently loaded plugins in the agent's log output, assisting users with debugging and understanding agent behavior."

  "content": "On October 3, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in dependency management, particularly with the ongoing migration to Zod v4 across multiple plugins, alongside codebase cleanup in `plugin-sql`. A critical issue emerged regarding import errors with Eliza CLI 1.61, which is actively being investigated as it impacts new project creation.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention \n- **Urgent Discussions**: The `Imports Not Found with Eliza CLI 1.61` issue ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/6031), [elizaos/eliza#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) requires further investigation and input, as it prevents new projects from running correctly for some users, despite troubleshooting steps provided.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Dependency Updates & Codebase Refinement\n- **Dependency Upgrades**: The `plugin-autocoder` application version was bumped to 1.3.3, and key dependencies, including Zod v4, were upgraded for improved stability. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/pull/1))\n- **Codebase Cleanup**: Unused `SchemaFactory` code and its associated integration tests were removed from the `plugin-sql` package in `elizaos/eliza`, streamlining the codebase. ([elizaos/eliza#6029](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6029))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### Active Discussions\n- **Zod v4 Migration**: The migration of all dependencies and plugins to Zod v4 is actively underway, with approximately 20-25 PRs initiated across various plugins by Stan to update core, bootstrap, langchain/ai/vercel, and other dependencies. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder#5999](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-autocoder/issues/5999), [elizaos/eliza#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999))\n\n## ✨ Contributor Spotlight\n- **Stan**: Initiated approximately 20-25 PRs across various plugins, including `plugin-autocoder`, to update core, bootstrap, langchain/ai/vercel, and other dependencies to the latest compatible Zod v4 version, driving a significant project-wide dependency migration."

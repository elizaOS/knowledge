  "content": "Today, ElizaOS focused on core service enhancements in the `eliza` repository, including a new `MessageService` and `PATCH` method support, alongside significant code formatting and a `develop` to `main` merge. Concurrently, the `elizaos.github.io` repository initiated work on adaptive rate limiting to improve multi-repository data ingestion performance.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Service & API Enhancements\n- Added `MessageService` interface and default implementation to improve message handling capabilities in `eliza`. [elizaos/eliza#6048](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6048)\n- Added `PATCH` method support to the `Route` type, expanding API flexibility in `eliza`. [elizaos/eliza#6076](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6076)\n- Ensured `channelId` is consistently included in session API responses in `eliza`, improving data consistency. [elizaos/eliza#6079](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6079)\n\n### Codebase Maintenance & Optimization\n- Merged the `develop` branch into `main` in `eliza`, integrating recent development work. [elizaos/eliza#6078](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6078)\n- Applied consistent code formatting and style across the `eliza` codebase. [elizaos/eliza#6077](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6077)\n- Made the embedding service optional in `eliza`, functioning as a no-op when no `TEXT_EMBEDDING` model is registered, optimizing resource usage. [elizaos/eliza#6075](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6075)\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**:\n    - Add adaptive rate limiting with low-volume optimization to improve data ingestion efficiency. [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#160](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/160)\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**:\n    - Performance Enhancement for Multi-Repo Ingestion: Created to address slow sequential processing in multi-repository pipelines and propose adaptive rate limiting for 60% faster ingestion. [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#159](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/159)"

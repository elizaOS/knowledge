No significant technical developments were completed, and no issues were closed or newly opened today.\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n*   **elizaos/eliza**:\n    *   [#5679](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5679) (Fix typo)\n*   **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**:\n    *   [#148](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/148) (Feature/mcp server)"

([elizaos/eliza#5201](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5201))\n    - New Bun tests were added to core packages, significantly expanding test coverage. ([elizaos/eliza#5188](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5188))\n- **Agent Memory & Server Refinements**:\n    - A new feature was added to allow clearing agent memories, providing better control over agent state. ([elizaos/eliza#5187](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5187))\n    - Significant refactoring and cleanup were performed across the server codebase, enhancing runtime capabilities and improving overall code quality. ([elizaos/eliza#5204](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5204))\n    - Database schema consistency was addressed by standardizing ID types to UUIDs. ([elizaos/eliza#5189](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5189))\n- **UI/UX & Documentation Improvements**:\n    - User interface issues related to scroll behavior in agent settings and environment panels were fixed, improving usability. ([elizaos/eliza#5193](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5193), [elizaos/eliza#5192](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5192))\n    - A comprehensive documentation overhaul was completed, consolidating redundant pages and refining the structure for better clarity. ([elizaos/eliza#5182](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5182))\n- **Plugin & Registry Enhancements**:\n    - `plugin-knowledge` now supports custom LLM integration with configurable caching and provider selection. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#13](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/13))\n    - The `elizaos-plugins/registry`'s `index.json` was updated to reflect the migration of repositories to new GitHub organizations. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#172](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/172))\n- **Infrastructure & Wallet Management**:\n    - `elizaos.github.io` now incorporates a `wallet_addresses` table with CAIP-2/10 adoption, improving handling and standardization of wallet addresses. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#128](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/128))\n    - A significant update to `repoconfig` was implemented to support multiple repositories within the pipeline, laying groundwork for scalable data ingestion.

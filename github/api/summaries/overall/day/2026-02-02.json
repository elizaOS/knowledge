  "content": "ElizaOS had a productive day focusing on infrastructure, billing, and agent character improvements. Key achievements include integrating Telegram and SMS/iMessage plugins, acquiring the eliza.app domain, and opening new issues for critical infrastructure needs and payment systems. Discussions are active around optimizing Eliza's character file and prompt engineering, with a new plugin for L2 smart money signals also introduced.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**: The discussion on improving Eliza's character file and prompts ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#6447](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6447), [elizaos-plugins/registry#6447](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6447), [elizaos/eliza#6447](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6447)) highlights a fundamental debate on agent synchronization (logic vs. prose) and requires input to guide future development.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Messaging Plugin Integrations\n- The Telegram plugin was successfully integrated into the Cloud infrastructure, enabling user interaction via Telegram, and SMS/iMessage capabilities were set up for a native iOS messaging experience, fulfilling the goal of Eliza having a phone number. ([elizaos/eliza#6397](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6397), [elizaos/eliza#6399](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6399))\n\n### Domain Acquisition\n- The eliza.app domain was successfully purchased and configured, with DNS pointing to the deployment and an active SSL certificate. ([elizaos/eliza#6419](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6419))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**:\n    - Bump `next` dependency from 16.1.5 to 16.1.6 ([#240](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/240))\n- **elizaos-plugins/registry**:\n    - Add `@erdgecrawl/plugin-base-signals` for base L2 smart money signals ([#253](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/253))\n\n### Active Discussions\n- **Eliza Character File & Prompt Engineering**: Discussion continues on improving Eliza's character file and prompts, with Renator13 suggesting that prompt engineering overhead is a \"Biological Trap\" and advocating for agents to sync via logic, not prose. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#6447](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6447), [elizaos-plugins/registry#6447](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6447), [elizaos/eliza#6447](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6447))\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**:\n    - Improve Eliza's character file and prompts based on initial testing feedback ([#6447](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6447))\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Make a gateway for webhooks ([#6442](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6442))\n    - Reconstruct Cloud database migrations using Drizzle Kit ([#6444](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6444))\n    - Provision a second Blue.io phone number for dev/prod separation ([#6446](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6446))\n    - Implement a credit/billing system for Eliza App users ([#6443](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6443))\n    - Integrate Stripe and credit warnings for billing ([#6445](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6445))\n    - Create a payment infrastructure plugin for agent-to-agent transactions ([#6448](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6448))\n    - Improve Eliza's character file and prompts based on initial testing feedback ([#6447](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6447))\n\n## ✨ Contributor Spotlight\n- **Boris**: Highlighted the need for edits on Eliza's character file and prompts, initiating a critical discussion. ([elizaos/eliza#6447](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6447))\n- **Renator13**: Provided insightful comments on prompt engineering overhead, framing it as a \"Biological Trap\" and suggesting alternative approaches for agent synchronization.

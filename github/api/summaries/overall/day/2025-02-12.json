  "content": "On Feb 12, 2025, ElizaOS development focused on enhancing the CLI utility with new plugin management features and addressing critical bugs, particularly in client speech-to-text functionality. While significant progress was made in resolving issues like the `supressInitialMessage` property and LlamaService initialization hangs, new challenges emerged with client startup errors related to sqlite-vec extensions and a re-occurrence of the `supressInitialMessage` issue.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention \n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - elizaos/eliza#3450: The `supressInitialMessage` property is still not functioning correctly, requiring further investigation.\n    - elizaos/eliza#3464: Client startup errors related to sqlite-vec extensions are preventing smooth operation and need immediate attention.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **CLI Utility Enhancements**:\n    - Introduced a new CLI utility for managing plugins in the ElizaOS V1 repository, enabling users to list and add plugins via commands like `npx elizos` ([elizaos/eliza#3429](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3429)).\n- **Bug Fixes & Stability Improvements**:\n    - Resolved multiple issues with client speech-to-text functionality ([elizaos/eliza#3461](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3461), [elizaos/eliza#3454](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3454)).\n    - Addressed minor linting issues related to biome preferences ([elizaos/eliza#3462](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3462)).\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n- **New Issues**:\n    - elizaos/eliza#3450: Reported that the `supressInitialMessage` property is still not functioning correctly.\n    - elizaos/eliza#3464: Raised regarding startup errors related to sqlite-vec extensions preventing the client from running.\n- **Closed Issues**:\n    - elizaos/eliza#3450: Closed the issue regarding the `supressInitialMessage` property not functioning as expected in actions (though it was later re-opened).\n    - elizaos/eliza#3448: Resolved an issue where \"pnpm start\" would hang during LlamaService initialization."

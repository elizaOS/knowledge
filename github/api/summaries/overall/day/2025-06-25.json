  "content": "ElizaOS significantly advanced agent capabilities today by implementing agent-scoped plugins for enhanced flexibility and completing the migration to `@elizaos/api-client`. Critical bug fixes improved chat stability and API documentation, while new development workflows were integrated.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5260](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5260): Custom plugin development challenges, specifically regarding agent processing only one message and UI display issues, require input on response handling (callback vs. return).\n    - [elizaos/eliza#29](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/29) and [elizaos/eliza#26](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/26): Twitter plugin issues (not posting replies, newline formatting) need further investigation into response delivery and template behavior.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Agent Core & API Client Refinement\n- **Enhanced Agent Plugin Management**: Refactored plugin architecture from project-scoped to agent-scoped, allowing unique plugin sets per agent for greater flexibility. ([elizaos/eliza#5270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5270))\n- **API Client Migration & Documentation**: Completed migration of `packages/client` to `@elizaos/api-client`, restoring GUI chat title generation and updating API documentation. ([elizaos/eliza#5263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5263), [elizaos/eliza#5280](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5280), [elizaos/eliza#5275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5275))\n\n### Chat Stability & Development Workflow\n- **Chat Stability Improvements**: Fixed issues causing chat to get stuck on \"agent is thinking\" and improved attachment formatting for better message display. ([elizaos/eliza#5274](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5274), [elizaos/eliza#5273](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5273))\n- **New Development Workflow**: Integrated a GitHub Actions workflow for Claude Code, introducing an AI coding agent to assist with repository development. ([elizaos/eliza#5269](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5269))\n\n### Infrastructure & Plugin Configuration\n- **Wallet Address Ingestion Optimization**: Improved wallet address ingestion speed by implementing batched GraphQL requests and migrating fetching to pipelines. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#134](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/134), [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#132](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/132), [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#130](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos/issues/130))\n- **GitHub Data Fetching Refactor**: Removed `githubService` and integrated its functionality into `github.ts` for centralized and maintainable GitHub data interactions. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#132](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/132), [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#133](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/133))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [#5278](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5278): Fixes a database schema type mismatch for server agents within the `plugin-sql` package.\n    - [#5276](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5276): Aims to normalize paths for Windows compatibility.\n    - [#5272](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5272): Addresses a failing core attachment test.\n- **elizaos-plugins/registry**:\n    - [#180](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/180): Adds `@esscrypt/plugin-polkadot` to the registry.\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge**:\n    - [#28](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/28): \"chore: rollback to multer\".\n\n### Active Discussions\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [#5260](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5260): Custom plugin development challenges, including agents stopping plugin usage after one message and UI display issues.\n    - [#29](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/29): Twitter plugin not posting replies to mentions or tags.\n    - [#26](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/26): Newlines in Twitter timeline replies are replaced with `\\n\\n`.\n- **elizaos-plugins/registry**:\n    - [#5260](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5260): Custom plugin development challenges, including agents stopping plugin usage after one message and UI display issues.\n    - [#26](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/26): Newlines in Twitter timeline replies are replaced with `\\n\\n`.\n    - [#29](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/29): Twitter plugin not posting replies to mentions or tags.\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge**:\n    - [#5260](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5260): Custom plugin development challenges, including agents stopping plugin usage after one message and UI display issues.\n    - [#26](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/26): Newlines in Twitter timeline replies are replaced with `\\n\\n`.\n    - [#29](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/29): Twitter plugin not posting replies to mentions or tags.\n- **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**:\n    - [#5260](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5260): Custom plugin development challenges, including agents stopping plugin usage after one message and UI display issues.\n    - [#29](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/29): Twitter plugin not posting replies to mentions or tags.\n    - [#26](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/26): Newlines in Twitter timeline replies are replaced with `\\n\\n`.\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [#5268](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5268): Large character files (approx. 150kb) can be imported but not saved due to \"Error 500: request entity too large\".\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [#5279](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5279): Resolved \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\" by ensuring the agent character file included the OpenAI plugin.\n- **elizaos-plugins/registry**:\n    - [#5279](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5279): Resolved \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\" by ensuring the agent character file included the `openai` plugin.\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge**:\n    - [#5279](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5279): Resolved \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\" by adding `@elizaos/plugin-openai` to the agent character file.\n- **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**:\n    - [#130](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/130): Resolved wallet address fetching during NextJS build by migrating to pipelines.\n    - [#5279](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5279): Fixed \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\" error by adding `@elizaos/plugin-openai` to the agent character file."

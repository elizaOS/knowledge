  "content": "Today's focus was on critical bug fixes, particularly improving chat stability, resolving Windows compatibility issues for project loading, and enhancing JSON serialization robustness. A significant documentation guide for AI assistants was also added, and a new plugin was proposed for the registry, while a long-standing knowledge management issue was confirmed resolved.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention \n- **Urgent Discussions**: \n    - [elizaos/eliza#5017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5017): The issue regarding plugin action callbacks not reaching the user response is still active, with requests for users to perform clean installations and verify fixes for `plugin-evm` and `plugin-mcp`.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5155](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5155): Windows project loading issues due to `import()` not using the `file://` prefix need immediate attention.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5161](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5161): The `elizaos start` command crashing on Windows after accessing `localhost:3000` is a critical blocker for Windows users.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **Core Stability & Compatibility Fixes**:\n    - Fixed message filtering to correctly scope messages to the current chat/channel, preventing cross-chat display issues ([elizaos/eliza#5149](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5149)).\n    - Resolved GUI freezing when an agent ignored a user or sent an empty response ([elizaos/eliza#5151](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5151)).\n    - Addressed a critical bug preventing project loading on Windows machines ([elizaos/eliza#5156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5156)).\n    - Implemented a fix to prevent infinite recursion in the JSON sanitizer by handling circular references ([elizaos/eliza#5152](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5152)).\n- **Agent Prompting & Codebase Refinements**:\n    - Removed unnecessary evaluator choices from the `messageHandler` prompt, streamlining agent decision-making ([elizaos/eliza#5148](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5148)).\n    - Refactored the codebase by removing OpenTelemetry instrumentation from socket message processing ([elizaos/eliza#5153](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5153)).\n- **Documentation & Knowledge Management**:\n    - Added a comprehensive `CLAUDE.md` file providing detailed guidance for AI assistants on project architecture and workflow ([elizaos/eliza#5158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5158)).\n    - The knowledge management (RAG) functionality issue was resolved and confirmed working in version 1.0.9 ([elizaos/eliza#5004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5004), [elizaos-plugins/registry#5004](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5004)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n- **New Pull Requests**:\n    - **elizaos/eliza**:\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5163](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5163) fix: Windows compatibility for plugin imports and asset serving\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5157](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5157) fix: tests\n    - **elizaos-plugins/registry**:\n        - [elizaos-plugins/registry#175](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/175) Add @yungalgo/plugin-coconut\n- **Active Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5017): Discussion continues on plugin action callbacks not reaching the user response, with ongoing verification for `plugin-evm` and `plugin-mcp`.\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n- **New Issues**:\n    - **elizaos/eliza**:\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5155](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5155): Windows compatibility issue with `import()` not using `file://` prefix.\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5161](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5161): `elizaos start` crashes on Windows after accessing `localhost:3000`.\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5159](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5159): Feature request to add Ollama as an AI provider option in the `create` command.\n- **Closed Issues**:\n    - **elizaos/eliza**:\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5004): Knowledge management (RAG) functionality confirmed working in 1.0.9.\n    - **elizaos-plugins/registry**:\n        - [elizaos-plugins/registry#5004](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5004): Knowledge management (RAG) functionality confirmed working in 1.0.9."

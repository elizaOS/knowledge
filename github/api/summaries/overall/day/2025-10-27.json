  "content": "On October 27, 2025, ElizaOS significantly advanced its core infrastructure and community engagement. Key developments included the implementation of a unified messaging API and a new Jobs API for one-off agent messaging, alongside the introduction of an MVP badge system to recognize contributor achievements and adaptive rate limiting for GitHub API operations. These efforts enhance performance, streamline agent communication, and foster community participation.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Agent Messaging and Cloud Integration\n*   A unified messaging API (`elizaOS.sendMessage()`) was implemented to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability across ElizaOS clients, alongside a new Jobs API for one-off agent messaging, enabling stateless integrations for external systems. ([elizaos/eliza#6095](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6095), [elizaos/eliza#6098](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6098))\n*   A new `elizaos login` CLI command was added to facilitate cloud authentication, integrating ElizaOS with its cloud services. ([elizaos/eliza#6100](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6100))\n\n### Platform Performance and Community Engagement\n*   Adaptive rate limiting with low-volume optimization was implemented for GitHub API operations, significantly improving performance for high-volume repositories while maintaining zero overhead for typical workloads. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#160](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/160))\n*   A minimal viable product (MVP) badge/achievement system with 5 badge types across 3 tier levels was introduced to recognize contributor achievements, designed with DRY and YAGNI principles to minimize code overhead. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#161](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/161))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n*   **elizaos/eliza**\n    *   [#6101](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6101) feat: Add PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) multi-tenant isolation\n    *   [#6099](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6099) feat(server): Add x402 payment middleware to Jobs API\n    *   [#6097](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6097) feat: Add Jobs API for one-off agent messaging\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### Closed Issues\n*   **elizaos/eliza**\n    *   [#6096](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6096) The issue concerning the implementation of a unified messaging API through the ElizaOs Wrapper was closed."

  "content": "Today, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in core stability and ecosystem expansion, with multiple bug fixes and build improvements in the `eliza` repository, the addition of a new plugin to the `registry`, and updates to repository tracking on `elizaos.github.io`.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n\n### Core Stability and Build Improvements\n- Enhanced event handling by ensuring runtime inclusion in emitted events and introducing an `initPromise` property in `eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#5827](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5827)).\n- Improved browser build exports and type definitions for the core package in `eliza`, resolving build issues and enhancing compatibility ([elizaos/eliza#5832](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5832)).\n- Corrected `AgentLog` type structure and fixed action viewer mapping in the `eliza` client, addressing display issues ([elizaos/eliza#5834](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5834)).\n- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in the `plugin-bootstrap` package in `eliza` by correcting `logger.error` parameter order in the `imageGeneration` action ([elizaos/eliza#5833](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5833)).\n- Made environment loading lazy in the `eliza` CLI to prevent warnings during startup, improving user experience ([elizaos/eliza#5829](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5829)).\n\n### Ecosystem Expansion\n- The `@standujar/plugin-composio` plugin was added to the public plugin registry, making it discoverable and available for use ([elizaos-plugins/registry#209](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/209)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [#5836](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5836) Main\n    - [#5835](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5835) fix: CI test failures in core and cypress tests\n    - [#5828](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5828) feat: browser compat core (draft)\n- **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**:\n    - [#151](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/151) Add elizaos/docs repo tracking and claude bot exclusion\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [#5830](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5830) Proposed analyzing options for MCP Gateway, adding MCP servers, and integrating an x402 layer to enhance agent communication infrastructure.\n    - [#5831](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5831) Suggested adding functionality to show actions called and their results directly in the chat UI for better user feedback.\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [#5619](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5619) Resolved an issue where Windows CI tests were failing due to incorrect path handling in CLI agent start command tests."

  "content": "On Dec 8, 2025, ElizaOS saw significant progress in enhancing streaming capabilities across multiple plugin repositories, with new pull requests opened for OpenRouter, OpenAI, and Anthropic plugins to introduce streaming support. Concurrently, the core `eliza` repository underwent a major dependency update to resolve compatibility issues and also opened a PR to further enhance text generation streaming.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Dependency Management & Ecosystem Stability\n- A major effort was undertaken to update all dependencies to their latest versions, specifically addressing conflicting `drizzle-orm` versions across the monorepo, ensuring compatibility and stability within the ElizaOS ecosystem. [elizaos/eliza#6210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6210)\n\n### Plugin Functionality and Configuration\n- An issue regarding the necessity of `.eliza` files for `plugin-sql` to function correctly, and the need for its auto-creation, was closed as it was previously fixed in an alpha version. [elizaos/eliza#6204](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6204)\n\n### Deepseek API Integration Clarification\n- An inquiry about using the Deepseek API was closed, confirming that while direct integration might be possible via OpenAI compatible endpoints, Deepseek can be used with `plugin-openrouter` by configuring custom models. [elizaos/eliza#6156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6156)\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter**\n    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21): Add streaming support, remove tools support, and complete test specifications.\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai**\n    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21): Introduce streaming support and associated tests.\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic**\n    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12): Add streaming support and test.\n- **elizaos/eliza**\n    - [elizaos/eliza#6212](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6212): Enhance streaming support in text generation.\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**\n    - [elizaos/eliza#6204](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6204): Closed an issue regarding `.eliza` files for `plugin-sql` functionality.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#6156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6156): Closed an inquiry about using the Deepseek API."

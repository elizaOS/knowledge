  "content": "Jan 21, 2026\n\nToday, ElizaOS saw significant progress in enhancing plugin compatibility and user interface, alongside foundational work on public agent discovery. Key achievements include implementing structured logging and resolving TypeScript errors in `plugin-telegram` for improved code quality and ElizaOS 1.7.x compatibility, and enabling markdown rendering in the `elizaos.github.io` profile summary card. Additionally, the `eliza` repository closed two issues related to public agent discovery and linking, while `plugin-discord` prepared for a new release with dependency updates.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n\n### Plugin Compatibility and Code Quality\n*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram**: Structured logging was implemented across the repository, standardizing log formats and adding ESLint with a structured logging rule for improved code quality and maintainability ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/21)).\n*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram**: TypeScript errors related to `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x compatibility were resolved, involving the removal of deprecated `serverId` and casting `serverId` to `UUID` for type safety, along with fixing custom event payload typing and `MessagePayload` to use proper `Memory` ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24)).\n*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram**: The messaging API was refactored to implement a unified approach with ElizaOS support, streamlining communication within the plugin ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n\n### User Interface Enhancements\n*   **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**: Markdown rendering was implemented for the profile summary card using `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm`, replacing plain text rendering for enhanced display ([#202](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/202)).\n\n### Release Preparation and Dependency Updates\n*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord**: A new release was prepared, involving a version bump from `1.3.6` to `1.3.7` in `package.json` and an upgrade of the `@elizaos/core` dependency, including a refresh of the `bun.lock` file ([#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44)).\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n\n### New Issues\n*   **elizaos/eliza**: A new issue, [#6385](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6385), was opened to discuss removing the timer in the app builder and implementing a manual refresh request window when time expires.\n\n### Closed Issues\n*   **elizaos/eliza**: Issue [#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302) was closed, addressing the addition of an agent discovery module to the landing page and dashboard for listing public agents with sorting and search capabilities.\n*   **elizaos/eliza**: Issue [#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304) was closed, defining the public agent link format as `elizacloud.ai/chat/[username]`."

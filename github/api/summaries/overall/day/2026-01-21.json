  "content": "On January 21, 2026, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in enhancing user experience and developer tooling, alongside crucial preparations for upcoming releases. Key achievements include improved markdown rendering for profile summaries on the website, substantial code quality and compatibility updates for the Telegram plugin, and foundational work on agent discovery within the core Eliza platform.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n\n### Frontend Enhancements\n- Implemented markdown rendering for the profile summary card using `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm` in `elizaos/elizaos.github.io`, replacing plain text for richer content display ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#202](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/202)).\n\n### Plugin Development & Quality\n- Implemented structured logging across `elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram`, standardizing log formats and adding ESLint with a structured logging rule and `lint:check` script for CI ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/21)).\n- Resolved TypeScript errors in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram` for compatibility with `@elizaos/core` 1.7.x, including removing deprecated `serverId` from `ensureConnection` calls, casting `serverId` to `UUID`, and fixing custom event payload typing ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24)).\n- Refactored the messaging API in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram` to implement a unified approach with elizaOS support ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)).\n\n### Release Preparation\n- Prepared a new release for `elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord`, involving a version bump from `1.3.6` to `1.3.7` and an upgrade of the `@elizaos/core` dependency, along with a `bun.lock` file refresh ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord#44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44)).\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**: A new issue, [#6385](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6385), was opened to remove the timer in the app builder and implement a manual refresh request window.\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**: Two issues related to agent discovery and public agent linking were closed. Issue [#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302) focused on adding an agent discovery module to the landing page and dashboard, and issue [#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304) established the public agent link format."

  "content": "Today, ElizaOS focused on enhancing user experience and system stability, notably by adding a typing indicator to Telegram bots and implementing critical bug fixes for plugin initialization. New issues were identified concerning documentation clarity and logging configuration, highlighting areas for future improvement.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### User Experience & Bot Interaction\n- Added a typing indicator to Telegram bots to simulate human-like interactions, enhancing user experience ([elizaos/eliza#4280](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4280)).\n\n### System Stability & Code Maintenance\n- Implemented a check to ensure the `init` function exists before calling it, preventing errors related to plugin loading ([elizaos/eliza#4278](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4278)).\n- Removed deprecated `hapi__shot` types to clean up the codebase and improve maintainability ([elizaos/eliza#4275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4275)).\n- Improved logging for transcription models to enhance debugging and monitoring capabilities ([elizaos/eliza#4283](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4283)).\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - A need for clearer documentation regarding the contributing guide was identified, specifying the installation process for contributors versus users ([elizaos/eliza#4285](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4285)).\n    - A bug was reported where changes to the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable do not reflect in the program's logging behavior ([elizaos/eliza#4282](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4282))."

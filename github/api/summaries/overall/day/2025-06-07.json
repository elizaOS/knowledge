  "content": "On Jun 7, 2025, ElizaOS saw significant progress in feature development, including a new split button component and responsive design improvements for the character form, alongside critical bug fixes in the CLI and environment management. Two new issues were reported concerning plugin dependency management and testing errors, which will require attention.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention \n- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:\n    - elizaos/eliza#4997: The CLI is not loading/registering dependencies from plugins, which needs to be addressed for proper functionality.\n    - elizaos/eliza#4996: An \"unable to register again\" error is occurring when testing default plugins, indicating a potential race condition during builds.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **Feature Enhancements**:\n    - Introduced a new split button component for grouping related actions with dropdown functionality. [elizaos/eliza#5000](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5000)\n    - Added a scenario test to bootstrap for verifying agent interactions with a hello world response.

[elizaos/eliza#4987](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4987)\n    - Fixed CLI port validation and character file handling issues, ensuring immediate validation during argument parsing. [elizaos/eliza#4985](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4985)\n    - Addressed empty string validation in the plugins command to prevent random plugin installations. [elizaos/eliza#4984](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4984)\n- **Documentation and Testing Improvements**:\n    - Removed obsolete steps from integration tests and improved CI reliability by removing cache from cli-tests.

  "content": "On Aug 26, 2025, ElizaOS significantly advanced its core infrastructure with a major migration to a Bun-based build system for ElizaOS packages, enhancing build efficiency and consistency. Concurrently, the plugin ecosystem saw improvements in automation with the integration of Claude Code for automated reviews and the expansion of the plugin registry. These efforts collectively streamline development workflows and expand the platform's capabilities.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n\n### Core System Modernization & Modularity\n*   **Build System Overhaul:** Replaced the `tsup` build system with a new Bun-based approach across ElizaOS packages, introducing reusable utilities for `@elizaos/api-client` and `@elizaos/cli`. [elizaos/eliza#5807](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5807)\n*   **Enhanced Plugin Action Handling:** Updated the `GENERATE_IMAGE` handler in `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` to consistently return an `ActionResult`, aligning with the core `Action` contract. [elizaos/eliza#5823](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5823)\n*   **Improved Template Modularity:** Moved core multi-step templates to the core layer, enabling characters to define their own template overrides for greater flexibility. [elizaos/eliza#5822](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5822)\n\n### Plugin Registry Automation & Expansion\n*   **Automated Code Review with Claude AI:** Integrated Claude Code via new GitHub Actions workflows for automated code reviews, including comprehensive validation for plugin registry contributions and NPM package validation. [elizaos-plugins/registry#206](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/206), [elizaos-plugins/registry#208](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/208)\n*   **Enhanced Registry Generation:** Implemented alphabetical sorting for entries in the registry generation process, ensuring consistent ordering of the `index.json` output. [elizaos-plugins/registry#207](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/207)\n*   **New Plugin Added:** Expanded the available plugins by successfully adding \"polymarket\" to the registry. [elizaos-plugins/registry#205](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/205)\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n\n### New Pull Requests\n*   **elizaos/eliza:**\n    *   [#5826](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5826) merge develop\n    *   [#5825](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5825) multi step\n    *   [#5824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5824) feat: scenarios dynamic prompting + spec\n    *   [#5821](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5821) feat: create @elizaos/utils package for shared build utilities\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n\n### New Issues\n*   **elizaos/eliza:**\n    *   [#5820](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5820) Native Venice AI Provider Integration: A new feature request to integrate a native Venice AI provider to support privacy-focused, uncensored AI options."

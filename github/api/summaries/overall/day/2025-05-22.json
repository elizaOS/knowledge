  "content": "On May 22, 2025, ElizaOS significantly advanced its core framework by enhancing multi-platform support for Tauri, improving CLI dependency management, and resolving critical issues related to character environment loading and Docker voice functionality. These updates contribute to a more robust and adaptable AI agent framework, with a focus on security and continuous integration/delivery.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n\n### Multi-Platform & CI/CD Enhancements\n- Configured Tauri for multi-platform CI/CD and mobile support, enabling builds for Linux, macOS, Windows, Android, and iOS ([elizaos/eliza#4699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4699)).\n- Deployed a GitHub action for automatic CLI package deployment on changes and version bumps ([elizaos/eliza#4712](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4712)).\n\n### Core Framework Stability & Security\n- Resolved character environment loading issues and updated the default character ([elizaos/eliza#4716](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4716)).\n- Fixed Docker voice functionality to ensure proper operation in TEE deployments ([elizaos/eliza#4715](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4715)).\n- Added `.env` to the plugin-starter's `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive data exposure during publishing ([elizaos/eliza#4703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4703)).\n- Made runtime logger public to enhance logging capabilities ([elizaos/eliza#4696](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4696)).\n\n### CLI & Client Improvements\n- Updated CLI to use beta versions if exact versions are not found, improving dependency management ([elizaos/eliza#4711](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4711), [elizaos/eliza#4710](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4710)).\n- Improved filtering for client chat ignores and addressed issues with command setup directories ([elizaos/eliza#4709](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4709), [elizaos/eliza#4708](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4708)).\n- Enhanced tweet text formatting for better readability ([elizaos/eliza#4706](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4706))."

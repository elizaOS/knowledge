  "content": "On Jan 5, 2026, ElizaOS significantly advanced its core agent framework with unified client-side hooks and multi-transport support, alongside critical SQL plugin stability fixes and CI workflow enhancements. Documentation coverage for the project also saw a major expansion, reaching 95%, while the ElizaOS website improved its RSS feed readability and integrated automated dependency management.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n\n### Core Agent Framework & Client-Side Enhancements\n*   **Unified Client Hooks**: Introduced a new `useElizaChat` hook in the client package, unifying chat functionalities across HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket transports, streamlining client-side interaction with the ElizaOS agent. [elizaos/eliza#6300](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300)\n*   **SDK-first Development**: Fully supported the SDK-first hooks mode, allowing direct instantiation of Eliza in the browser via hooks. [elizaos/eliza#5966](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5966)\n*   **Messaging API Refinements**: Resolved issues related to double processing and transport alignment within the Messaging API. [elizaos/eliza#6298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6298)\n*   **Agent Lifecycle Management**: Implemented lifecycle management hooks, such as `useAgentList`, `useStartAgent`, and `useStopAgent`. [elizaos/eliza#5929](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5929)\n\n### SQL Plugin Stability & Reliability\n*   **PostgreSQL `SET LOCAL` Fix**: Fixed an issue in the `plugin-sql` where PostgreSQL `SET LOCAL` commands failed due to incorrect parameterization. [elizaos/eliza#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)\n*   **PGLite Shutdown & Pool Configuration**: Addressed critical issues in `plugin-sql`, including adding pool configuration, an error handler, and fixing PGLite shutdown problems to prevent runtime crashes and connection issues. [elizaos/eliza#6323](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6323)\n\n### Documentation & Website Improvements\n*   **Comprehensive Documentation Expansion**: Completed a major documentation update, significantly increasing coverage to 95% and adding new guides and reference material, including a new guide on streaming responses (SSE/WebSocket) and extensive updates across agents, CLI, guides, plugins, and REST API references. [elizaos/docs#81](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/81)\n*   **RSS Feed Readability**: Enhanced the ElizaOS website's RSS feed with an XSL stylesheet for improved browser rendering and updated the content type for XSLT rendering. [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#188](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/188)\n*   **Automated Dependency Management**: Integrated Dependabot into the `elizaos.github.io` repository to automate dependency updates. [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#188](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos/pull/188)\n\n### CI/CD & Automation Enhancements\n*   **Claude CI Workflow Upgrade**: Upgraded all Claude-powered CI workflows to use the stable v1 action and the Opus 4.5 model, improving AI-driven code reviews and security checks. [elizaos/eliza#6324](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6324)\n*   **New CI Workflows**: Added two new automated workflows for security and maintenance jobs to the CI pipeline. [elizaos/eliza#6324](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6324)\n*   **Cursor Bot Integration**: Configured CI workflows to allow the Cursor bot to trigger Claude-related actions, enhancing automated code review processes.

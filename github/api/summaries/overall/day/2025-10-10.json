  "content": "On Oct 10, 2025, ElizaOS saw significant progress in core runtime and project management enhancements within the `eliza` repository, with several long-standing issues closed, while the `plugin-solana` repository initiated work on fixing TypeScript errors and improving logging. Discussions also advanced on the direct API calls for agent interactions, and new issues were opened for mobile and agent frontend development.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - `elizaos/eliza` - Direct API Calls [#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5923): Clarification is needed on the scope of the `generate()` API, specifically whether it should be text-only or encompass all model types, with a proposal for `generateText(input: string, options?: GenerateTextOptions)` awaiting feedback.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Runtime and Project Management Enhancements\n- Simplified runtime internals and made state programmatically accessible in `elizaos/eliza` [#5910](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5910).\n- Implemented programmatic project loading via `ElizaOS.loadProject(data)` in `elizaos/eliza` [#5912](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5912).\n- Enhanced runtime access with features like hot-reloading and introspection tools in `elizaos/eliza` [#5913](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5913).\n\n### System Observability and Resilience\n- Added metrics hooks for active agent counts, memory usage, and runtime statistics, and provided standardized error surfaces in `elizaos/eliza` [#5914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5914).\n\n### Testing and Verification\n- Strengthened the testing framework by adding integration tests for initialization, reloads, and propagation of edits in `elizaos/eliza` [#5915](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5915).\n\n### Cloud Development and Configuration\n- Agreed on cloud wireframes in `elizaos/eliza` [#6019](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6019).\n- Addressed a configuration issue regarding the default port in `elizaos/eliza` [#6051](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6051).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana**:\n    - Fix TypeScript errors and improve logging [#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/15)\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Develop a Cloud Mobile App for iOS and Android platforms [#6053](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6053).\n    - Develop an Otaku agent frontend [#6054](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6054).\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Simplify runtime internals and make state programmatically accessible [#5910](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5910).\n    - Implement programmatic project loading via `ElizaOS.loadProject(data)` [#5912](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5912).\n    - Enhance runtime access with features like hot-reloading and introspection tools [#5913](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5913).\n    - Add metrics hooks and standardized error surfaces [#5914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5914).\n    - Add integration tests for initialization, reloads, and propagation of edits [#5915](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5915).\n    - Agree on cloud wireframes [#6019](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6019).\n    - Configuration issue regarding the default port [#6051](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6051)."

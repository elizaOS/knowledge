  "content": "On August 20, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in core functionalities with enhanced session management and service load handling in `elizaos/eliza`, alongside the closure of a major epic related to the Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System across both `elizaos/eliza` and `elizaos-plugins/registry`, indicating a push towards robust testing infrastructure.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core System Enhancements\n*   **Enhanced Session Management**: The sessions API in `elizaos/eliza` received a significant upgrade, introducing comprehensive timeout management, auto-renewal capabilities, and robust error handling for improved session lifecycle control ([elizaos/eliza#5799](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5799)).\n*   **Core Runtime and Plugin Improvements**: A new `getServiceLoadPromise` interface was added to the runtime in `elizaos/eliza`, improving how services are loaded. Additionally, component queries in the `plugin-sql` were fixed to be more flexible and robust, particularly concerning date handling ([elizaos/eliza#5801](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5801)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n*   **elizaos/eliza**:\n    *   Add a bench plugin locally ([elizaos/eliza#5800](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5800))\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### Closed Issues\n*   **elizaos-plugins/registry**:\n    *   The epic for the Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System has been closed, signifying the completion of this major development initiative ([elizaos-plugins/registry#5781](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5781)).\n*   **elizaos/eliza**:\n    *   The \"Epic: Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System\" was closed today, focusing on creating a robust CLI tool for executing scenarios across various configurations ([elizaos/eliza#5781](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5781))."

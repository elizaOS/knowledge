  "content": "The ElizaOS project saw significant progress today with major enhancements to the core framework, particularly in Telegram and plugin functionalities, including new model integrations. Efforts also focused on improving user interaction, addressing several bugs, and conducting code cleanup for better maintainability. A new issue was identified concerning inefficiencies in the Twitter plugin.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Framework & Plugin Enhancements\n- Introduced the ability to choose embedding models in the OpenAI plugin, enhancing flexibility in model selection ([elizaos/eliza#4140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4140)).\n- Integrated Kluster AI as a model provider, expanding the options for AI model hosting ([elizaos/eliza#3938](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3938)).\n- Added Mem0 as an AI SDK provider, further diversifying the framework's capabilities ([elizaos/eliza#3927](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3927)).\n\n### Telegram Feature Development\n- Added a community manager feature for Telegram to greet new users and manage timeouts ([elizaos/eliza#4134](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4134)).\n- Enhanced Telegram functionalities with new middleware documentation and synchronization for chat member events ([elizaos/eliza#4128](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4128)).\n\n### Bug Fixes & Quality Improvements\n- Fixed issues with starter project and audio utility imports to ensure proper functionality ([elizaos/eliza#4139](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4139)).\n- Resolved a bug related to incorrect payloads sent to event handlers for message events ([elizaos/eliza#4131](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4131)).\n- Improved plugin publishing workflow to enhance the developer experience ([elizaos/eliza#4132](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4132)).\n- Addressed inconsistencies in template variables within the Twitter post template ([elizaos/eliza#4029](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4029)).\n- Conducted a cleanup of the browser plugin to remove duplicate code and improve organization ([elizaos/eliza#4129](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4129)).\n- Removed unused packages and redundant JSON imports to streamline the codebase ([elizaos/eliza#4135](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4135), [elizaos/eliza#4030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4030)).\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**: Identified a problem with the Twitter plugin where redundant checks on interactions and mentions are causing unnecessary API calls, leading to inefficiencies ([elizaos/eliza#4127](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4127))."

  "content": "Today, ElizaOS saw significant progress in core agent functionality with the migration to UUIDs for agent identification and asynchronous evaluator execution. Critical documentation and scaffolding issues were resolved across both `elizaos.github.io` and `eliza`, alongside enhancements to analytics tracking and the opening of new issues for deployment and ingestion pipeline improvements. The team also focused on framework consistency and stability, closing several long-standing issues.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Agent Functionality & Stability\n- Agent identification migrated to UUIDs, updating loader, runtime, server, and database components, enabling duplicate agent names ([elizaos/eliza#6036](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6036)).\n- Evaluators now run asynchronously with improved error handling, and bootstrap messages trigger non-blocking evaluator execution ([elizaos/eliza#6066](https://github.com/eliza/pull/6066)).\n- Character builder logic moved to the core package, centralizing business logic and adding 27 new tests ([elizaos/eliza#6069](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6069)).\n- Critical bugs in the memory viewer were addressed, specifically regarding chat and user message filtering ([elizaos/eliza#6067](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6067)).\n- Framework consistency and stability issues were closed, ensuring CLI and server adhere to ElizaOS defaults, consolidating duplicated helpers, and enforcing consistent logging ([elizaos/eliza#5934](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5934)).\n\n### Documentation & Scaffolding Improvements\n- Incorrect plugin documentation and scaffolding problems were fixed, including template lookup paths and CLI command syntax in multiple READMEs ([elizaos/eliza#6072](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6072), [elizaos/eliza#6071](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6071), [elizaos/eliza.github.io#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6070)).\n\n### Analytics & Deployment Enhancements\n- The analytics pipeline was updated to track the `elizaos/docs` repository and exclude \"claude\" from bot users for more accurate reporting ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#151](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/151)).\n- Progress was made on enhancing plugin capabilities and deployment options, including improving `plugin-autocoder`, integrating Eigen TEE, and implementing a unified Cloud API plugin ([elizaos/eliza#5685](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5685), [elizaos/eliza#5986](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5986), [elizaos/eliza#6049](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6049)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**\n    - Deployment Guide for Forks: [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#158](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/158)\n    - Dynamic Stats Copying: [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#157](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/157)\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**\n    - Deployment Workflow Hardcoding: [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#153](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/153)\n    - Missing Deployment Guide for Forks: [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#154](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/154)\n    - API Cost Estimation for Ingestion Pipeline: [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#156](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/156)\n    - Graceful Shutdown for CLI Pipeline: [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#155](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/155)\n- **elizaos/eliza**\n    - Logging Standardization: [elizaos/eliza#6073](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6073)\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**\n    - Plugin Documentation and Scaffolding Fixes: [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6070)\n- **elizaos/eliza**\n    - Framework Consistency and Stability: [elizaos/eliza#5934](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5934)\n    - Plugin and Deployment Enhancements: [elizaos/eliza#5685](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5685), [elizaos/eliza#5986](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5986), [elizaos/eliza#6049](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6049)\n    - Plugin Documentation and Scaffolding Fixes: [elizaos/eliza#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6070)"

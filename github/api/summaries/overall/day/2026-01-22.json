  "content": "On Jan 22, 2026, the ElizaOS project made significant strides in API reliability and V2.0.0 compatibility, primarily by resolving critical issues related to API index and overall summary generation across multiple repositories. Key achievements include fixing missing API files, ensuring consistent summary generation even for inactive days, and enhancing Python example testing and plugin compatibility. These efforts aim to provide more robust data access and a smoother transition to the V2.0.0 release.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#225](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/225) API index and contributor profiles were not being exported due to a missing `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines` workflow, resulting in 404 errors on production. This issue has been fixed by adding dynamic `SITE_URL` detection.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#226](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/226) Overall summary API endpoints returned 404 for dates with no repository activity. This issue has been fixed by modifying `generateOverallSummaryForInterval()` to always generate summaries.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### API Reliability and Data Consistency\n- **API Data Export and Consistency Improvements**: A significant bug was addressed that prevented the export of the API index and contributor profiles due to a missing `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines` workflow. This fix ensures that all 1,433 contributor profiles and the API index are correctly generated and accessible. Additionally, a problem where overall summaries were not generated for days without repository activity, leading to 404 errors, was resolved. Now, a \"No activity recorded\" message is provided for such days, ensuring consistent API behavior. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#229](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/229))\n- **Resolution of API Export Failures**: Two critical issues causing API endpoints to return 404 errors were resolved. The first involved the `/api/index.json` and contributor profile endpoints, which were not being exported due to a missing `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines` workflow. This was fixed by adding dynamic `SITE_URL` detection. The second issue addressed overall summary API endpoints returning 404 for dates with no repository activity; now, a \"No activity recorded\" summary is generated for such days, ensuring consistent API responses. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#225](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/225), [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#226](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/226))\n- **API Export and Contributor Profile Fixes**: A critical issue preventing the export of `/api/index.json` and 1,433 contributor profiles was resolved. The fix involved dynamically detecting the `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines.yml` workflow, ensuring these essential API endpoints are correctly generated. This addresses the 404 errors previously encountered for these endpoints. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#225](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/225))\n- **Consistent Overall Summary Generation**: The system was updated to consistently generate overall summaries, even for days with no repository activity. Previously, such days resulted in 404 errors for summary API endpoints. Now, a \"No activity recorded\" message is generated, ensuring consistent API behavior and a clear distinction between a pipeline not running and a day with no activity. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#226](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/226))\n\n### Python Example and Plugin Enhancements\n- **Python Example and Plugin Enhancements**: Added Python quickstart documentation, fixed the chat example to include `inmemorydb` plugin for database support and added `dotenv` loading, and corrected the `inmemorydb` plugin to use proper Plugin. ([elizaos/eliza#6358](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358))\n\n### V2.0.0 Compatibility and Runtime Fixes\n- **V2.0.0 Compatibility and Runtime Fixes**: Opened pull requests to fix the avatar example and ElevenLabs plugin for V2.0.0, and to address A2A example, protobuf compatibility, and runtime errors for V2.0.0. ([elizaos/eliza#6387](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6387), [elizaos/eliza#6386](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6386))\n\n### Pipeline Ordering for Contributor Summaries\n- **Pipeline Ordering for Contributor Summaries**: A pipeline ordering issue was identified and fixed, which previously caused contributor summaries to always appear as `null` in exported stats files. The correction ensures that contributor summaries are re-exported after their generation, providing accurate data in the `stats_*.json` files. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#229](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/229))\n- **Fix for Null Contributor Summaries in Stats Files**: A problem where contributor summaries were consistently `null` in exported stats files was identified and closed. The root cause was a pipeline ordering issue, which has now been addressed to ensure that contributor summaries are correctly included in the stats files.

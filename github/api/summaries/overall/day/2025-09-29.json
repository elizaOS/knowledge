  "content": "On Sep 29, 2025, ElizaOS significantly enhanced agent run visualization with a new client-side timeline, addressed critical package publishing issues on NPM, and improved security by restricting local environment access in production.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Framework & Client Enhancements\n- A comprehensive agent runs visualization timeline was added to the client, providing detailed insights into execution flow and performance ([elizaos/eliza#6016](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6016)).\n\n### Package Management & Security\n- Critical fixes were implemented for new package publishing on NPM, ensuring `@elizaos/service-interfaces` is publicly accessible and extending the release workflow ([elizaos/eliza#6012](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6012)).\n- A security measure was added to disable local environment endpoint access in production, preventing exposure or mutation of local `.env` via API ([elizaos/eliza#6015](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6015)).\n- The `zod` package was updated across the monorepo to version `4.1.11` ([elizaos/eliza#6014](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6014)).\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - A new issue proposes adding a configuration option to the Eliza Discord plugin, allowing the agent to respond only when explicitly mentioned or called by its configured name ([elizaos/eliza#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013)).\n    - An issue was reported regarding `elizaos dev` and `elizaos start` commands not functioning correctly within plugin directories, specifically failing to load plugins with test characters ([elizaos/eliza#6017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6017))."

  "content": "On Apr 29, 2025, ElizaOS development focused on enhancing core framework capabilities, including improved logging, searchable knowledge scoping, and automated monorepo package building. Significant progress was made in bug resolution, particularly for agent deletion and local AI errors, alongside UI refinements and codebase streamlining.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Framework Enhancements\n- Introduced model/plugin name logging for improved transparency in `elizaos/eliza` ([#4394](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4394)).\n- Implemented searchable knowledge scoped by entityId, worldId, or roomId in `elizaos/eliza` ([#4390](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4390)).\n- Added automatic detection and building of core monorepo packages during development in `elizaos/eliza` ([#4388](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4388)).\n- Included a `.env.example` file in the project starter for user setup assistance in `elizaos/eliza` ([#4387](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4387)).\n\n### Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements\n- Resolved an import issue affecting the derive key provider in `elizaos/eliza` ([#4385](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4385)).\n- Fixed an error preventing agent deletion when agents owned worlds in `elizaos/eliza` ([#4395](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4395)).\n- Addressed error handling for scenarios with insufficient disk space in `elizaos/eliza` ([#4389](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4389)).\n- Corrected an undefined error thrown by the local AI in `elizaos/eliza` ([#4396](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4396)).\n\n### Codebase Refinement and UI/UX\n- Enhanced UI with cleaner design and minor improvements, including naming updates from `room` to `group` in `elizaos/eliza` ([#4393](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4393)).\n- Removed the EVM plugin package and related configurations from the monorepo in `elizaos/eliza`, streamlining the codebase ([#4386](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4386), [#4399](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4399)).\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### elizaos/eliza\n- **Closed Issues**: No issues were closed today.\n- **New Issues**: No new issues were reported today."

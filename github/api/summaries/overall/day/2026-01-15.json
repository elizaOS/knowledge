  "content": "On Jan 15, 2026, ElizaOS development focused on critical bug fixes in the core framework, including resolving an infinite rebuild loop and enhancing security by preventing environment variable leakage. Concurrently, API documentation for the website was significantly improved, though a new issue emerged regarding Discord plugin compatibility with the latest ElizaOS version.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Framework Stability & Security\n- An infinite rebuild loop in `dev-watch` mode was fixed by modifying `packages/cli/src/scripts/generate-version.ts` and `scripts/dev-watch.js`. ([elizaos/eliza#6361](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6361))\n- Security was enhanced by preventing shell environment variables from leaking into ElizaOS plugin loading decisions and agent secrets, involving changes across several files in `packages/cli` and `packages/core`. ([elizaos/eliza#6360](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6360))\n\n### Documentation Enhancement\n- Comprehensive improvements were made to the API documentation page, including complete JSON response examples for all endpoints and realistic 200 responses. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#213](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/213))\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**: An issue was opened to remove unused dependencies, specifically `@radix-ui/react-accordion`. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#214](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/214))\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord**: A new issue was reported concerning Discord not working with the latest ElizaOS version, specifically an \"this.runtime.elizaOS.sendMessage' is undefined\" error. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord#43](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/43))"

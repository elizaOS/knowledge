  "content": "Today, ElizaOS focused on enhancing core stability and expanding voice capabilities. Key achievements include resolving critical database foreign key violations in the `eliza` server and significantly improving voice feature compatibility in `plugin-openai` by enabling Buffer and Node.js stream handling. Additionally, efforts were made to refine the end-to-end testing infrastructure and streamline CLI operations.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Stability & Database Integrity\n- Fixed foreign key violation errors when starting agents in PostgreSQL environments, ensuring agent records exist before references are created. ([elizaos/eliza#6059](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6059))\n\n### Voice Feature Enhancements & Compatibility\n- Implemented support for Buffer input for the `TRANSCRIPTION` model and added functionality to convert Web `ReadableStream` to Node.js `Readable` for `TEXT_TO_SPEECH`.

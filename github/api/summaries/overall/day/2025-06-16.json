  "content": "Today's development significantly enhanced the ElizaOS framework's stability and test coverage, with critical fixes to CI/autodoc workflows and expanded testing across core components. Concurrently, the `plugin-knowledge` gained a new vector search UI feature, and the `plugin-farcaster` refined its terminology for better ecosystem alignment. Ongoing discussions address callback issues from plugins and the implementation of service types.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - `elizaos/eliza` [#5017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5017): Callback from plugin action not making it to end user response in chat. `jonathanprozzi` is planning a fresh project test after updating to 1.0.9, and `alex-nax` noted an unwanted reply before the desired action.\n    - `elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster` [#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/5017): Callback from plugin action not making it to end user response in chat. `jonathanprozzi` is planning a fresh project test after updating to 1.0.9, and `alex-nax` noted an unwanted reply before the desired action.\n    - `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge` [#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5017): Callback from plugin action not making it to end user response in chat. `jonathanprozzi` is planning a fresh project test after updating to 1.0.9, and `alex-nax` noted an unwanted reply before the desired action.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core System Stability & Test Coverage\n- **Expanded Test Coverage**: Added extensive tests across CLI, server, and `plugin-sql` to significantly increase code coverage and improve robustness. [elizaos/eliza#5136](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5136)\n- **CI/Autodoc Workflow Fixes**: Resolved multiple critical issues in CI/autodoc workflows, including TypeScript parser robustness, `--frozen-lockfile` errors, npm cache issues, and git authentication, ensuring smoother documentation generation and build processes. [elizaos/eliza#5147](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5147), [elizaos/eliza#5146](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5146), [elizaos/eliza#5145](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5145), [elizaos/eliza#5144](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5144), [elizaos/eliza#5143](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5143)\n- **Core Utility Refactoring**: Moved `getContentTypeFromMimeType` to core utils for better reusability across the framework. [elizaos/eliza#5138](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5138)\n\n### GUI & API Enhancements\n- **GUI Functionality Fix**: Fixed the resend (retry) button functionality in the GUI for newly sent messages. [elizaos/eliza#5141](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5141)\n- **API Media Type Support**: Ensured the server API supports all media types for broader compatibility. [elizaos/eliza#5137](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5137)\n\n### Plugin Enhancements & Bug Fixes\n- **Farcaster Terminology Refinement**: Refactored `plugin-farcaster` to use \"cast\" instead of \"post\" for Farcaster-native terminology, improving integration and consistency. [elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster#4](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/4)\n- **Knowledge Plugin Vector Search UI**: Added vector search capabilities to the `plugin-knowledge` UI, serving as an educational example for semantic search. [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/23)\n- **Knowledge Plugin Data Handling Fixes**: Corrected an invalid regex for base64 content validation and resolved a bug causing non-unique Knowledge/Memory IDs in `plugin-knowledge`. [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/18), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/17)\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5139](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5139): Add chat title evaluator and fix UI component props.\n\n### Active Discussions\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [#4914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914): Service Types and Test Services Implementation.

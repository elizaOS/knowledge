  "content": "On July 30, 2025, ElizaOS saw significant progress in documentation standardization, with `bun:test` now exclusively used across `elizaos/eliza`, alongside critical bug fixes for knowledge path configuration in `plugin-knowledge`. A key challenge emerged regarding missing auto-deployment CI files for migrated 1.x plugins, affecting both `elizaos/eliza` and `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge`, which requires immediate attention to unblock deployments.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:\n    - `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#5691`: Missing auto-deployment CI files for migrated plugins are preventing deployment; `@ai16z-demirix` has been directly asked for assistance.\n    - `elizaos/eliza#5691`: Some migrated `1.x` plugins are missing auto-deployment CI files and are not being deployed.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **Documentation & Consistency Improvements**:\n    - Standardized all project documentation and rules files in `elizaos/eliza` to exclusively use `bun:test` as the standard testing framework, impacting `cli`, `client`, `core`, `docs`, and various `plugin` related directories. ([elizaos/eliza#5681](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5681))\n    - Completed the \"Full Docs Nitpick Review\" in `elizaos/eliza`, indicating a significant step towards improving overall documentation quality. ([elizaos/eliza#5665](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5665))\n- **Plugin Functionality & Bug Fixes**:\n    - Fixed a bug in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge` that prevented the knowledge path from being read correctly from runtime settings, now allowing character-based path configurations. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#36](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/36))\n    - Improved the document loading process in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge`, affecting `bun.lock`, `package.json`, `src/docs-loader.ts`, and `src/service.ts`.\n    - Resolved several issues in `elizaos/eliza` concerning specific plugins including `aave`, `clanker`, `defi-llama`, and `moon-well`. ([elizaos/eliza#5646](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5646), [elizaos/eliza#5645](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5645), [elizaos/eliza#5647](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5647), [elizaos/eliza#5648](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5648))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n- **New Pull Requests**:\n    - **elizaos/eliza**:\n        - Refactoring `plugin.ts` to adopt functional programming patterns. ([elizaos/eliza#5692](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5692))\n        - Fixing subprocess mocks and CI path issues within tests. ([elizaos/eliza#5689](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5689))\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n- **New Issues**:\n    - **elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge**:\n        - Missing Auto-Deployment CI Files for Migrated Plugins: Migrated 1.x plugins are missing auto-deployment CI files and are not being deployed (e.g., `plugin-dexscreener`). ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#5691](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5691))\n    - **elizaos/eliza**:\n        - Development Environment and CLI Issues: `elizaos dev` command does not function correctly within a `plugin` folder unless `@elizaos/cli` is explicitly added as a dependency. ([elizaos/eliza#5687](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5687))\n        - Frontend Rendering and Display Issues: Markdown rendering on the frontend chat view has too wide spacing between lines. ([elizaos/eliza#5688](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5688))\n        - Plugin Deployment and Branch Management: Proposing to set `1.x` as the default branch for migrated and `1.x` supported plugins. ([elizaos/eliza#5690](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5690))\n        - Plugin Deployment and Branch Management: Some migrated `1.x` plugins are missing auto-deployment CI files and are not being deployed. ([elizaos/eliza#5691](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5691))\n\n## ✨ Contributor Spotlight\n- **wtfsayo**: Initiated discussion and directly requested assistance on the critical `plugin-knowledge#5691` issue, highlighting a deployment blockage."

  "content": "On September 2, 2025, ElizaOS development focused heavily on refining the core CLI architecture for greater modularity and decentralization, alongside significant UI/UX improvements for real-time chat visualization. Critical bug fixes, particularly for logger compatibility in `plugin-mcp`, and ongoing Dockerization efforts for project starters also marked the day's progress, aiming for enhanced stability and deployment flexibility.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**: The ongoing discussion on refactoring the Eliza CLI ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5860), [elizaos-plugins/registry#5860](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5860), [elizaos/eliza#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)) requires continued input, especially regarding the division of responsibilities between `@eliza/server`, `@eliza/cli`, and project starters to avoid logic duplication.\n- **Pull Requests to Review**:\n    - [elizaos-plugins/registry#216](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/216) and [elizaos-plugins/registry#215](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/215) both aim to add `@testorg-eliza/plugin-sourcegraph` to the registry and need review.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core System & CLI Enhancements\n- **CLI Versioning and Release Workflow**: The CLI now embeds its version into build output for better debugging, and a new alpha NPM release workflow has been implemented for streamlined deployments. ([elizaos/eliza#5869](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5869), [elizaos/eliza#5863](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5863))\n- **Logger Compatibility Fix**: A critical bug related to logger compatibility was addressed, ensuring proper logging functionality within `plugin-mcp`. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/15))\n\n### UI/UX & Project Starter Improvements\n- **Real-time Chat UI**: The chat user interface was significantly enhanced to display real-time action calls and their results, improving user transparency. ([elizaos/eliza#5865](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5865))\n- **Dockerization for Project Starters**: Docker files were added to `project-starter` to enable local development, image creation, and cloud deployment, with minor improvements to `project-tee-starter`'s Docker configuration. ([elizaos/eliza#5859](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5859), [elizaos/eliza#5858](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5858))\n\n### Code Quality & Build Fixes\n- **Comprehensive Code Linting**: Extensive linting was performed across core utility and action files in `plugin-mcp` to maintain code quality and consistency.\n- **Build System and Plugin Fixes**: Several build warnings and CSS syntax errors were resolved, image generation was re-enabled for Discord channels, and a broken path in `project-tee-starter`'s README was fixed. ([elizaos/eliza#5851](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5851), [elizaos/eliza#5861](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5861), [elizaos/eliza#5866](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5866))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5867](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5867) feat: Add Sentry Node telemetry support\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5864](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5864) refactor: centralize business logic in server package\n- **elizaos-plugins/registry**:\n    - [elizaos-plugins/registry#216](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/216) Add @testorg-eliza/plugin-sourcegraph to registry\n    - [elizaos-plugins/registry#215](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/215) Add @testorg-eliza/plugin-sourcegraph to registry\n\n### Active Discussions\n- **Refactor Eliza CLI** ([elizaos/eliza#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)): Ongoing discussions about streamlining the CLI, delegating execution, and defining responsibilities for a new `@eliza/server` package.\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5862](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5862) New Platform Integrations: Feature request for Matrix platform integration.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868) Enhanced Observability: Request for a GUI for event run observability.\n\n## ✨ Contributor Spotlight\n- **standujar**: Provided a detailed progress update and proposed a clear division of responsibilities for the Eliza CLI refactor, restarting from a clean slate on the issue.\n- **wtfsayo**: Contributed to the CLI refactoring discussion by suggesting the Mintlify CLI model and agreeing with proposed changes for minimal project modifications."

Key achievements include the introduction of a configuration for Twitter post generation and fixes for duplicated dependencies and the quick-intel plugin. The team also identified several new issues, primarily related to testing coverage for various plugins and formatting errors in Twitter outputs.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n\n### Core Framework Enhancements\n- Introduced a new configuration option to enable or disable Twitter post generation ([elizaos/eliza#3219](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3219)).\n- Resolved duplicated dependencies in the project ([elizaos/eliza#3215](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3215)).\n\n### Plugin Optimizations & Bug Fixes\n- Implemented optimizations and fixes for the quick-intel plugin ([elizaos/eliza#3208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3208)).\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Identified the need for enhanced testing coverage for the Cronos plugin due to balance and transfer actions ([elizaos/eliza#3249](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3249)).\n    - Reported failing tests in the Conflux plugin related to transfer actions ([elizaos/eliza#3246](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3246)).\n    - Raised concerns about formatting errors in Twitter posts and replies ([elizaos/eliza#3245](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3245)).\n    - Documented issues with bridging and swapping tokens in the EVM plugin ([elizaos/eliza#3234](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3234)).\n    - Noted a recurring bug where the bot replies with a default message after each tweet ([elizaos/eliza#3252](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3252)).\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Resolved a Twitter logging bug that caused errors during tweet generation ([elizaos/eliza#3201](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3201))."

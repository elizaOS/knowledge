  "content": "Today's focus was on critical infrastructure improvements, primarily a widespread logger migration from `pino` to `adze` across multiple repositories to ensure compatibility with Bun builds, with the core migration code now complete and awaiting verification. Concurrently, significant progress was made on plugin development, including adding Ollama support to `plugin-knowledge` and addressing several CLI and plugin creation stability issues in the `eliza` repository. A new issue was also opened regarding the `autofun` smart contract's architecture.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos-plugins/registry#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5673): The `pino` to `adze` logger migration is code-complete and requires verification by running `bun install`, `bun test`, and `bun build`.\n    - [elizaos/auto.fun#5673](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/5673): The `pino` to `adze` logger migration is code-complete and requires verification by running `bun install`, `bun test`, and `bun build`.\n    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5673): The `pino` to `adze` logger migration is code-complete and requires verification by running `bun install`, `bun test`, and `bun build`.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### CLI and Plugin Stability Improvements\n- Critical fixes were implemented to enhance the reliability of the CLI and plugin creation process, including ensuring `.gitignore` files are correctly included in published npm packages and correcting a spelling error in the plugin starter.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5675](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5675)\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5674](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5674)\n- Several issues related to the CLI and plugin creation were resolved, improving the developer experience, such as fixing an agent not responding in the GUI and resolving a `zod` module error when publishing newly created plugins.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5617](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5617)\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5657](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5657)\n\n### Documentation Updates\n- Documentation for action-chaining was updated to provide clearer guidance on usage, callbacks, and avoiding double responses.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5656](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5656)\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos-plugins/registry**:\n    - [#194](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/194): Add \"plugin-hehe\" to the registry.\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge**:\n    - [#35](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/35): Optimize knowledge graph.\n    - [#34](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/34): Add Ollama as a supported provider for `plugin-knowledge` and embeddings.\n\n### Active Discussions\n- **elizaos-plugins/registry**:\n    - [#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5673): Discussion on `pino-pretty` errors in export builds from Bun, with `adze` migration code-complete.\n- **elizaos/auto.fun**:\n    - [#5673](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/5673): Discussion on `pino-pretty` errors in export builds from Bun, with `adze` migration code-complete.\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge**:\n    - [#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5673): Discussion on `pino-pretty` errors in export builds from Bun, with `adze` migration code-complete.\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/auto.fun**:\n    - [#521](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/521): Smart Contract Review - notes that the autofun smart contract is based on an older version of the Pumpfun smart contract and lacks a global vault.\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [#5673](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5673): Logger Compatibility for Bun Builds - addresses `pino-pretty` errors in export builds from Bun, proposing a migration from `pino` to `adze`.\n    - [#5676](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5676): DevRel Agent Notes - ensures the DevRel Agent always provides the most up-to-date content from documentation.\n\n## ✨ Contributor Spotlight\n- **claude**: Completed the core code migration from `pino` to `adze` across `elizaos-plugins/registry`, `elizaos/auto.fun`, and `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge` to resolve critical logger compatibility issues with Bun builds."

  "content": "On May 17, 2025, ElizaOS development focused heavily on improving testing infrastructure with the addition of local AI tests and performance logging, alongside significant bug fixes across the `eliza` repository addressing data handling, authentication, and UI accuracy. A new issue was raised concerning username synchronization on the leaderboard, highlighting a need for profile update mechanisms.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n\n### Testing & Performance Enhancements\n- Added functionality to log time taken in tests to improve performance tracking ([elizaos/eliza#4621](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4621)).\n- Introduced local AI tests to enhance testing coverage and reliability ([elizaos/eliza#4619](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4619)).\n\n### Bug Fixes & Code Quality\n- Resolved linter errors for type mismatches in the DB adapter, improving code quality ([elizaos/eliza#4612](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4612)).\n- Improved handling of missing or null data for agent and task fields, ensuring consistent defaults ([elizaos/eliza#4624](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4624)).\n- Fixed client authentication issues to enhance security ([elizaos/eliza#4625](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4625)).\n- Corrected the logic for displaying sender names in recent messages, ensuring accurate representation ([elizaos/eliza#4616](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4616)).\n\n### Workflow Improvements\n- Enhanced workflow cache management by clearing only necessary directories and automating model file downloads for tests.\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**: A new issue was raised regarding the need to update username changes on the leaderboard, as the user's GitHub profile name has changed but the dashboard reflects the old name ([elizaos/eliza#4632](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4632)).\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**: Closed the issue regarding the functionality of the Eliza CLI, confirming that the CLI interface is still available for interacting with agents ([elizaos/eliza#4159](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4159))."

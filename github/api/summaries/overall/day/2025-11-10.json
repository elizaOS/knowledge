  "content": "ElizaOS Daily Project Summary - Nov 10, 2025\n\nToday, the project saw significant progress in enhancing PDF text extraction capabilities by migrating to `unpdf` for broader environment support and reduced dependency size. Several critical bug fixes were addressed in the `eliza` core, including improvements to environment variable loading and Row-Level Security validation, while a new `onStepFinish` callback was introduced for text generation functions in `plugin-openrouter`.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention \n- **Urgent Discussions**: The \"Web UI Endpoint Blocking Bug Investigation\" ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter#6138](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6138), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#6138](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6138), [elizaos/eliza#6138](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6138)) is still under investigation despite being prematurely closed, and needs further attention if it resurfaces.\n- **Urgent Discussions**: The \"Agent Response Error\" ([elizaos/eliza#6140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6140)) reports a critical error where the agent does not respond, requiring immediate investigation.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core System Stability & Security\n- **Environment Variable Handling**: Fixed how environment variables are loaded by switching from `.env` files to `process.env` to ensure proper configuration ([elizaos/eliza#6141](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6141)).\n- **Row-Level Security (RLS) Enhancements**: Proposed a fix for an issue where RLS `server_id` validation checks were blocking all users when RLS isolation was disabled ([elizaos/eliza#6139](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6139)).\n- **API Stability Improvements**: Removed a message emit in the `src` API to prevent race conditions ([elizaos/eliza#6137](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6137)).\n\n### Plugin Enhancements\n- **Enhanced PDF Text Extraction**: Migrated from `pdfjs-dist` to `unpdf` for universal PDF text extraction, enabling support across browser, serverless, and Node.js environments, and significantly reducing dependency size ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#46](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/46)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter**:\n    - Add `onStepFinish` callback to text generation functions ([#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/18))\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Load environment variables from `process.env` instead of `.env` files ([#6141](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6141))\n    - Fix RLS `server_id` validation blocking users when RLS isolation is disabled ([#6139](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6139))\n    - Remove message emit in `src` API to avoid race conditions ([#6137](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6137))\n\n### Active Discussions\n- **Dashboard Redesign Discussion**: Rassakia expressed interest in contributing to the \"Dashboard Redesign\" issue, which aims to rebuild the \"My Agents\" dashboard using a new Figma layout, add sidebar navigation, implement agent list and filters, and integrate with a new layout system ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter#6119](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6119), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#6119](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6119), [elizaos/eliza#6119](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6119)).\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Agent does not respond to questions, with \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_LARGE\" error ([#6140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6140))\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter**:\n    - Web UI blocking all endpoints when disabled (prematurely opened and still under investigation) ([#6138](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6138))\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge**:\n    - Web UI blocking all endpoints when disabled (prematurely opened and still under investigation) ([#6138](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6138))\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Web UI blocking all endpoints when disabled (prematurely opened and still under investigation) ([#6138](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6138))\n\n## ✨ Contributor Spotlight\n- **Rassakia**: Expressed interest in contributing to the \"Dashboard Redesign\" across multiple repositories, indicating potential future contributions to a significant UI overhaul."

  "content": "On Jan 20, 2026, the ElizaOS project saw the opening of a new pull request in `elizaos/eliza` to introduce a dynamic execution engine for V2.0.0, alongside the successful resolution of a critical SQL error related to embedding dimensions. This progress indicates continued development on core functionalities and important bug fixes.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Functionality & Bug Fixes\n- **SQL Embedding Dimension Fix**: An issue where the database adapter was hardcoded to use a `dim_1536` column, leading to errors when creating entities, has been resolved. This fix addresses a critical SQL error related to a 384-dim zero vector fallback when `USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING` was not respected. [elizaos/eliza#6380](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6380)\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Introduce dynamic execution engine for V2.0.0, focusing on testing context handling. [elizaos/eliza#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384)\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - SQL Embedding Dimension Fix: Resolved a SQL error related to a 384-dim zero vector fallback.

  "content": "On Jul 11, 2025, ElizaOS development was primarily concentrated in the `elizaos/eliza` repository, with significant advancements in code quality automation, CI/CD pipeline refinement, and user experience improvements. Key efforts included establishing robust code analysis tools, enhancing Claude automation for workflow efficiency, and critical bug fixes, alongside improvements to the CLI and client-side UX.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5499](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5499) `plugin-local-ai` is failing to load on Windows, with a potential fix available in `v1.2.1` that needs verification.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **Code Quality & Automation Enhancements**:\n    - Comprehensive tools for daily code quality checks and documentation consistency were added ([elizaos/eliza#5532](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5532)).\n    - Claude automation was enhanced for verbose logging and issue creation ([elizaos/eliza#5543](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5543)).\n    - Critical fixes were implemented for the code quality workflow, addressing GitHub issue body character limits ([elizaos/eliza#5544](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5544), [elizaos/eliza#5541](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5541), [elizaos/eliza#5540](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5540), [elizaos/eliza#5539](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5539), [elizaos/eliza#5538](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5538), [elizaos/eliza#5535](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5535), [elizaos/eliza#5534](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5534)).\n    - Permissions were granted for the Claude workflow to enable issue creation and bun/GitHub CLI commands ([elizaos/eliza#5553](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5553), [elizaos/eliza#5550](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5550)).\n- **CLI & Core Utility Improvements**:\n    - The CLI's robustness was improved by replacing `execa` with `bun.Spawn` for better logging and silent install failure detection ([elizaos/eliza#5531](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5531)).\n    - Core prompt logic was refined to enforce correct fenced code block formatting ([elizaos/eliza#5525](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5525)), reduce unnecessary LLM provider selection ([elizaos/eliza#5526](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5526)), and clarify prompt exclusivity for `IGNORE` actions ([elizaos/eliza#5528](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5528)).\n    - Ambiguity handling bugs in LLM responses were addressed ([elizaos/eliza#5529](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5529)).\n- **Client-Side UX & Character Management**:\n    - The chat input textarea was made auto-resizing for improved user experience ([elizaos/eliza#5546](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5546)).\n    - Automatic V1 to V2 character conversion during JSON import, including plugin matching, was added ([elizaos/eliza#5536](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5536), [elizaos/eliza#5537](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5537)).\n    - The agent settings page now keeps the user on the page after saving changes ([elizaos/eliza#5548](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5548)).\n- **Configuration & Package Management**:\n    - A new \"configs\" package was introduced to unify ESLint, TSConfig, and Prettier configurations across the monorepo ([elizaos/eliza#5508](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5508), [elizaos/eliza#5524](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5524)).\n    - The `plugin-forms` package was removed from the main repository ([elizaos/eliza#5527](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5527)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n- **New Pull Requests**:\n    - **elizaos/eliza**:\n        -

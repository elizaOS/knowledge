  "content": "Today, the ElizaOS project made significant strides in enhancing its testing and reporting infrastructure, with a strong focus on comprehensive data collection, analysis, and visualization for scenario testing. Key achievements include the implementation of a robust reporting command with dynamic HTML and PDF export, standardization of evaluation output, and the completion of the scenario matrix configuration and run orchestration systems.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Enhanced Scenario Testing and Evaluation Framework\n*   Completed the design and implementation of the scenario matrix configuration schema, including YAML definition, TypeScript interfaces, and robust validation, providing a structured way to define test matrices ([elizaos/eliza#5778](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5778)).\n*   Implemented the `elizaos scenario matrix` CLI command, enabling basic parsing and validation of scenario matrix configuration files, crucial for initiating matrix test runs ([elizaos/eliza#5779](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5779)).\n*   Developed the core logic for the parameter override system, including the `MatrixCombination` interface, `generateMatrixCombinations` function, and Cartesian product generation, allowing for dynamic modification of scenarios based on matrix parameters ([elizaos/eliza#5780](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5780)).\n*   Implemented a standardized `EvaluationResult` interface and refactored evaluators to produce structured JSON output, enhancing the detail and usability of evaluation results ([elizaos/eliza#5783](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5783)).\n*   Introduced the ability to define scenario capabilities within the LLM judge evaluation schema, allowing for more targeted and relevant assessments of agent performance ([elizaos/eliza#5784](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5784)).\n*   Implemented a non-invasive method for logging agent trajectories, capturing thought, action, and observation steps for detailed post-run analysis ([elizaos/eliza#5785](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5785)).\n*   Established a centralized schema (`ScenarioRunResult`) and utility (`RunDataAggregator`) for collecting and serializing all run data, ensuring comprehensive and consistent data storage ([elizaos/eliza#5786](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5786)).\n\n### Comprehensive Reporting and Data Visualization\n*   Implemented the `elizaos report generate` CLI command to create detailed performance reports from scenario matrix run data, including data ingestion, validation, aggregation, and structured output generation ([elizaos/eliza#5787](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5787)).\n*   Designed and built a self-contained HTML report template with a clear, hierarchical layout, modern styling, and placeholders for dynamic data, integrating Chart.js for visualization ([elizaos/eliza#5788](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5788)).\n*   Enabled dynamic rendering of reports by injecting aggregated JSON data into the HTML template, populating DOM elements, generating charts (bar, grouped bar, pie), and rendering interactive tables with search functionality ([elizaos/eliza#5789](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5789)).\n*   Added PDF export functionality for reports using Puppeteer, ensuring print-friendly styling and high-fidelity output from the generated HTML reports ([elizaos/eliza#5790](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5790)).\n\n### CLI and Publisher Module Refinements\n*   Improved TypeScript type safety and error logging within the publisher module, replacing generic types with specific interfaces ([elizaos/eliza#5796](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5796)).\n*   Corrected comma placement logic in `publisher.ts` to ensure proper JSON formatting when adding entries to the registry's `index.json` file ([elizaos/eliza#5774](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5774)).\n*   Addressed code formatting inconsistencies and updated dependencies across various packages, including `plugin-bootstrap` and `project-tee-starter` ([elizaos/eliza#5795](https://github.elizaos/eliza/pull/5795)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n*   **elizaos/eliza**:\n    *   [#5797](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5797) feat: Cross-Environment Logger Support. This PR introduces support for logging across different environments.\n\n### Active Discussions\n*   **elizaos/eliza**:\n    *   [#5782](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5782) Run Orchestration & Isolation: The implementation is fully complete and awaiting final testing before closure.\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### Closed Issues\n*   **elizaos/eliza**:\n    *   [#5778](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5778) Scenario Matrix Configuration\n    *   [#5779](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5779) CLI Command for Scenario Matrix\n    *   [#5780](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5780) Parameter Override System\n    *   [#5783](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5783) Structured JSON Output from Evaluators\n    *   [#5784](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5784) Scenario Capability Definitions\n    *   [#5785](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5785) Agent Trajectory Logging\n    *   [#5786](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5786) Centralized and Serialized Run Data\n    *   [#5787](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5787) `elizaos report generate` Command\n    *   [#5788](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5788) HTML Report Template\n    *   [#5789](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5789) Dynamic Report Rendering\n    *   [#5790](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5790) PDF Export\n\n## ✨ Contributor Spotlight\n*   **monilpat**: Completed the robust implementation of run orchestration and isolation, including comprehensive progress tracking, full run isolation, seamless integration with parameter overrides, and resource management, bringing issue [#5782](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5782) to completion."

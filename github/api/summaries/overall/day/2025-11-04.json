  "content": "ElizaOS made significant strides today in foundational system development, with major implementations across billing, authentication, and voice infrastructure, alongside substantial progress in documentation and chat performance. The team also focused on expanding integration capabilities with new Farcaster and Chrome extension developments, while actively planning for anonymous user support and free inference tiers.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussion**: The issue \"[elizaos/eliza#6121](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6121)\" highlights that \"The Changelog hasn't been updated since January,\" indicating a critical need for documentation maintenance.\n- **Blocked Issue**: The issue \"[elizaos-plugins/registry#6122](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6122)\" regarding the relocation of `packages/docs/` is awaiting clarification, as CodeRabbit AI's plan did not produce file changes.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core System Infrastructure\n- **Billing and Payments System**: A full Stripe-backed billing subsystem was implemented, including new database tables, six backend API routes, and a complete frontend billing page. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#6123](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6123))\n- **Container Billing Logic**: An automated monthly container billing system was introduced, featuring new database schemas, a `BillingService` for cron jobs, payment processing, and email notifications. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#6124](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6124))\n- **Voice Infrastructure Development**: A comprehensive voice infrastructure was implemented, including browser-based voice generation, server voice endpoints for premium users, and integration for generating embeddings from voice transcriptions. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#6130](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6130))\n- **Spartan MCP and X402 Implementation**: A large-scale X402 MCP (Multi-Chain Protocol) was implemented within `spartan-mcp`, including new agent files for analytics, Birdeye, charting, and CoinGecko. ([elizaos/spartan#16](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/pull/16))\n\n### User Experience and Documentation\n- **Enhanced Chat Performance and Reliability**: Significant improvements were made to Eliza chat responsiveness, including a `ModelPerformanceMonitor`, per-model timeouts, and integration of fast model providers. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#6127](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6127))\n- **New Documentation UI and API Explorer**: A new public `/docs` UI was built, featuring an OpenAI-style API explorer, character setup guides, and an overview of the cloud architecture. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#6128](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6128))\n- **Documentation and Docker Enhancements**: Various documentation URLs and content were updated, and Docker configurations were streamlined to simplify the development setup process. ([elizaos/spartan#22](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/pull/22), [elizaos/spartan#21](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/pull/21), [elizaos/spartan#20](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/pull/20))\n\n### New Application Integrations\n- **Farcaster Miniapp**: A Farcaster miniapp was introduced as a work-in-progress integration. ([elizaos/spartan#19](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/pull/19))\n- **Chrome Extension**: A Chrome extension leveraging existing routes was added. ([elizaos/spartan#17](https://github.com/elizaos/spartan/pull/17))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - New Middleware and Prompt Frameworks: \"[#6114](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6114)\" (x402 middleware), \"[#6113](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6113)\" (Framework for adjusting prompts).\n- **elizaos-plugins/registry**:\n    -

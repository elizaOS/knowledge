  "content": "Today, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in core stability and configuration with critical bug fixes and enhanced schema validation in `elizaos/eliza`, alongside key optimizations in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge` for improved performance and memory usage. A major cross-repository issue regarding Eliza CLI import errors was thoroughly diagnosed, revealing a problem with `@elizaos/core@1.6.1`'s TypeScript declaration files.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - **elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana**: The `Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61` issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/issues/6031) requires the ElizaOS team to consider upgrading to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later, potentially yanking v1.6.1 from npm, and adding publish-time validation.\n    - **elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge**: The `Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61` issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6031) needs the ElizaOS team to consider deprecating v1.6.1 of `@elizaos/core` and adding publish-time validation.\n    - **elizaos/eliza**: The `Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61` issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031) requires the ElizaOS team to consider yanking/deprecating v1.6.1 of `@elizaos/core` from npm.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core System Stability & Configuration\n- Fixed a critical bug preventing agent plugins from reloading correctly after PATCH updates and addressing a race condition during service initialization in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#6040](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6040)).\n- Implemented robust validation for CLI `--port` and `SERVER_PORT` configurations, with warnings and default fallbacks in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#6046](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6046), [elizaos/eliza#6038](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6038)).\n- Exposed `stateCache` for better state management and refactored bootstrap types to consume it, along with minor fixes to prompt and provider access in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#6045](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6045)).\n- Improved the `parseBooleanFromText` utility to directly handle boolean inputs in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#6042](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6042)).\n- Ensured `BOOTSTRAP_KEEP_RESP` functions correctly even when not explicitly ignored in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#6041](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6041)).\n\n### Knowledge Graph & Character Schema Enhancements\n- Enhanced knowledge retrieval algorithms and improved memory management for large knowledge bases in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge` ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#35](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/35)).\n- Optimized `src/frontend/ui/memory-graph-optimized.tsx` and related UI components for efficiency in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge` ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#35](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/35)).\n- Significantly enhanced character schema validation with comprehensive Zod schema definitions, including detailed descriptions and improved type safety in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#6044](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6044)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana**:\n    - Token 2022 upgrades ([#14](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/14))\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - docs: fixed old and broken link ([#6047](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6047))\n    - feat(core): Add comprehensive Zod descriptions to character schema ([#6043](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6043))\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Core Cleanup ([#5911](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5911))\n    - Clean Core Build Proof ([#5976](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5976))\n    - Fully wrap up browser support ([#5958](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5958))\n    - Browser Database Adapter ([#5964](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5964))\n    - Analyze options for MCP Gateway ([#5814](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5814))\n    - Add MCP servers and x402 layer ([#5830](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5830))\n    - Send list of partners to BD (plugins) ([#5969](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5969))\n\n## ✨ Contributor Spotlight\n- **claude** provided a detailed root cause analysis for the critical `Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61` issue across multiple repositories, identifying the problem with `@elizaos/core@1.6.1`'s TypeScript declaration files.\n- **matteo-brandolino** provided crucial system details and confirmed the persistence of the CLI import issue, aiding in its diagnosis."

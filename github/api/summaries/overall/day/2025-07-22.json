  "content": "Today, ElizaOS saw significant progress in plugin expansion with the addition of `plugin-coti`, alongside critical security and stability enhancements to the `plugin-training` module. A major recurring user support issue concerning Google API integration was definitively resolved across multiple repositories, and new initiatives for documentation and video production were launched.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Plugin Expansion & Integration\n- **New Plugin Added**: The `plugin-coti` was successfully integrated into the registry, enabling private token operations and encrypted transactions on the COTI blockchain for ElizaOS agents. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#193](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/193))\n\n### Core Module Security & Stability\n- **Enhanced Security for Command Execution**: Improvements were made to validate model parameters for `bunExec` to prevent command injection and remove double escaping from prompts, enhancing security within the `plugin-training` module. ([elizaos/eliza#5663](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5663), [elizaos/eliza#5661](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5661))\n- **Training Module Stability Improvements**: A key fix corrected the dataset path for HuggingFace uploads, and a change was implemented to prevent the use of undefined models during restoration, improving overall system stability. ([elizaos/eliza#5662](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5662), [elizaos/eliza#5660](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5660))\n\n### Workflow & Infrastructure Enhancements\n- **Workflow Optimization and Multi-Repo Compatibility**: Streamlined workflow parameters and improved compatibility for multi-repository setups were implemented. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#147](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/147), [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#146](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/146))\n- **New Modular GitHub Action**: A new modular GitHub Action was introduced to provide flexible summary generation with new summary types and enhanced control over interval settings. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#146](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/146))\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Documentation and Video Production Planning: Several new issues were opened to plan and track the creation of new documentation and video tutorials, including a comprehensive review of existing documentation and production of videos on getting started, creating agents, and managing multiple agents/characters. ([elizaos/eliza#5665](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5665), [elizaos/eliza#5668](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5668), [elizaos/eliza#5666](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5666), [elizaos/eliza#5667](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5667))\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos-plugins/registry**:\n    - Google API Plugin Troubleshooting and Resolution: An issue concerning an ElizaOS agent not providing a reply when using the Google API was investigated and resolved, with the root cause identified as a missing or incorrectly configured `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#5664](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5664))\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - Resolved API Integration and Agent Response Issues: A critical issue where an agent using the Google API was not providing a reply was resolved by identifying the problem as a missing or incorrectly configured `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`. ([elizaos/eliza#5664](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5664))\n    - Project Creation Without Keys: An issue preventing project creation without using keys was closed. ([elizaos/eliza#5605](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5605))\n\n## ✨ Contributor Spotlight\n- **claude**: Provided a comprehensive solution and debugging steps for the recurring Google API key issue, guiding users to a resolution.\n- **wtfsayo**: Corrected initial misdiagnoses and provided valuable insights into the Google API issue, confirming plugin existence and noting potential unreliability of the free Google API.\n- **1BDO**: Actively participated in troubleshooting and confirmed the fix for the Google API issue, helping to validate the solution."

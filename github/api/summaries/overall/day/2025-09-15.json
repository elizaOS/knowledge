  "content": "On September 15, 2025, the ElizaOS project focused on critical bug fixes within the `eliza` core, resolving image display issues in the web client and enabling JSON imports in project templates, alongside preparing the `plugin-farcaster` for future updates by addressing SDK and build errors. A new significant issue was opened to clean up the core build, aiming for a pure JS/TS implementation compatible across multiple environments.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Core Bug Fixes & Enhancements\n*   Resolved an issue where generated images from the OpenRouter plugin were not displaying correctly in the web client by transforming local file paths to API URLs. ([elizaos/eliza#5890](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5890))\n*   Enabled JSON imports in `project-starter` and `project-tee-starter` templates, fixing compilation failures when users imported JSON files. ([elizaos/eliza#5975](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5975))\n*   Added a missing `uuid` dependency to the `plugin-sql` package, ensuring its proper functionality. ([elizaos/eliza#5977](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5977))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster**\n    *   Update SDK ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster#10](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/10))\n    *   Fix build error ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster#9](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/9))\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n*   **elizaos/eliza**\n    *   Remove all hacks/forks from the core, deliver a fully working, clean build of `/core` (pure JS/TS), and validate compatibility across Node, Bun, and browser builds in CI/CD. ([elizaos/eliza#5976](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5976))"

  "content": "On July 14, 2025, ElizaOS development focused on enhancing CLI stability and developer experience in the `eliza` repository with critical bug fixes and core type safety improvements, alongside expanding the plugin registry with the addition of the Mattermost plugin. Discussions continued on persistent issues related to custom plugin callback interference and Twitter client initialization errors across multiple repositories.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention \n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#4947](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4947) and [elizaos-plugins/registry#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947): The issue where a custom plugin's callback is replaced by the `ATTACHMENTS` provider requires further input to resolve the conflict and implement the proposed fix.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#31](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/31) and [elizaos-plugins/registry#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31): The ongoing Twitter Client Initialization Errors need continued investigation and a definitive solution, especially regarding the feasibility of autonomous Twitter agents and potential API limitations.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **CLI Stability and Developer Experience Enhancements**:\n    - The `elizaos start` command now automatically builds the project before starting the server, mirroring the `dev` command's behavior, improving the developer workflow ([elizaos/eliza#5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504)).\n    - Graceful shutdown for the `elizaos dev` server on `Cmd+C` (SIGINT/SIGTERM) was implemented, preventing orphaned processes and resolving a critical server shutdown issue ([elizaos/eliza#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562), [elizaos/eliza#5559](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5559)).\n    - A related fix addressed the usage of the auto-build test flag, contributing to overall CLI robustness ([elizaos/eliza#5581](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5581)).\n- **Core Library Robustness and Integration**:\n    - Significant work was done to improve the robustness of the core library by addressing type safety and testing issues, including comprehensive tests for the `asUUID()` function and planning types, and refining error handling ([elizaos/eliza#5580](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5580)).\n    - The `llama_local` provider in v1 was mapped to `@elizaos/plugin-ollama`, streamlining provider integration ([elizaos/eliza#5582](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5582)).\n- **Plugin Ecosystem Expansion**:\n    - The `plugin-mattermost` was added to the registry, expanding the available plugins within the ElizaOS ecosystem ([elizaos-plugins/registry#188](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/188)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n- **New Pull Requests**:\n    - **elizaos/eliza**:\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5585](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5585) Sync develop into develop devel\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5583](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5583) [DRAFT] Docker Infrastructure Enhancement Proposal\n- **Active Discussions**:\n    - **elizaos/eliza**:\n        - [elizaos/eliza#4947](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4947) Custom Plugin Callback Interference: Discussion continues on the issue where a custom plugin's callback is getting replaced by the `ATTACHMENTS` provider.\n        - [elizaos/eliza#31](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/31) Twitter Client Initialization Errors: Users are still reporting issues with Twitter Client Initialization Errors when creating or starting agents using the Twitter plugin.\n    - **elizaos-plugins/registry**:\n        - [elizaos-plugins/registry#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947) Custom Plugin Callback Interference: Discussion continued on a bug where a custom plugin's action callback is being replaced by the `ATTACHMENTS` provider.\n        - [elizaos-plugins/registry#31](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/31) Twitter Client Initialization Error: Continued reports of the Twitter client initialization error.\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n- **New Issues**:\n    - **elizaos/eliza**:\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584) Agent-to-Agent Communication Challenges: A new issue was opened regarding forwarding messages between agents without polling, specifically for a Blockchain Agent and a Support Agent.\n- **Closed Issues**:\n    - **elizaos/eliza**:\n        - [elizaos/eliza#5559](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5559) CLI Server Shutdown Fix: The issue where `Cmd + C` on the `elizaos dev` server did not kill the server process has been resolved.\n\n## ✨ Contributor Spotlight\n- **tcm390**: Provided a valuable suggestion for debugging the custom plugin callback interference issue in [elizaos/eliza#4947](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4947) and [elizaos-plugins/registry#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947).\n- **claude**: Identified the root cause and proposed a fix for the custom plugin callback interference issue in [elizaos/eliza#4947](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4947) and [elizaos-plugins/registry#4947](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/4947)."

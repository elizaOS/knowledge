  "content": "Today, the ElizaOS project significantly enhanced model selection flexibility by adding OpenRouter support and refined Ollama embedding. Key improvements were made to the CLI's user experience and plugin management, alongside numerous bug fixes across core infrastructure and client-side UI. Discussions continued on critical issues like character file size limits and user identity management.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5268](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5268): The team needs to increase the character file size limit to 100MB and implement a regression test.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#105](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/105): A decision is needed on whether to transition user tracking from GitHub usernames to internal IDs to resolve \"split personality\" issues.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Model and Embedding Selection Enhancements\n- Added OpenRouter support for both language and embedding models, improving flexibility. [elizaos/eliza#5264](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5264), [elizaos/eliza#5285](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5285)\n- Refined Ollama embedding selection to prevent unnecessary plugin loading. [elizaos/eliza#5285](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5285)\n\n### CLI and Plugin Management Improvements\n- Improved the CLI's environment variable prompting experience with a more user-friendly interface. [elizaos/eliza#5291](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5291)\n- Fixed plugin management, ensuring the \"hello world\" plugin returns a response and restricting plugin removal to the 'X' icon. [elizaos/eliza#5296](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5296), [elizaos/eliza#5290](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5290)\n\n### Core Infrastructure and Client-Side Bug Fixes\n- Resolved critical bugs including group creation success handling, Docker post-install hook issues, SQL plugin foreign key constraints, and agent panel loading problems. [elizaos/eliza#5293](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5293), [elizaos/eliza#5289](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5289), [elizaos/eliza#5287](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5287), [elizaos/eliza#5282](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5282)\n- Fixed core package imports for Bun. [elizaos/eliza#5284](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5284)\n\n### Deployment Workflow and Data Handling Optimization\n- Corrected triggers for the deploy workflow, ensuring proper initiation of deployments. [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#136](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/136)\n- Removed wallet address caching logic to streamline data processing.

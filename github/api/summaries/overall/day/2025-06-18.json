  "content": "ElizaOS's development on June 18, 2025, focused on expanding AI provider options with Ollama integration and streamlining CLI commands for a more consistent user experience. Significant progress was made in enhancing data integrity through robust character validation and improving database management with cascade delete functionality. The project also saw the resolution of several long-standing issues related to agent responses, API behavior, and plugin action callbacks, alongside the addition of new plugins to the registry.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention \n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5017): The `plugin-mcp` responses still need verification, and a new issue might be required if problems persist.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5181](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5181): Advisory locking for `DatabaseMigrationService` is proposed to prevent race conditions during horizontal scaling.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5185): A migration to `bun:test` is proposed for testing framework standardization across the monorepo.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5172](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5172): The Twitter plugin is not running correctly when both the plugin and client are used together in a character, leading to consent violation warnings.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **Core System Stability & AI Provider Expansion**:\n    - Ollama was added as an AI provider option for the `create` command, expanding user choices. ([elizaos/eliza#5160](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5160))\n    - CLI commands were consolidated, merging the `stop` command into `agent stop --all` for consistency. ([elizaos/eliza#5175](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5175))\n    - Global environment variable loading issues were fixed, and plugin template dependencies were resolved. ([elizaos/eliza#5174](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5174), [elizaos/eliza#5173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5173))\n    - Media content display was improved for better color contrast and text handling. ([elizaos/eliza#5165](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5165))\n- **Data Integrity & Database Management**:\n    - Character validation was enhanced with Zod-based validation and safe JSON parsing. ([elizaos/eliza#5167](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5167))\n    - Database relationship management was improved with cascade delete functionality for agents. ([elizaos/eliza#5171](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5171))\n- **Documentation & Codebase Refinement**:\n    - Documentation links were updated to the new official ElizaOS URL, and core documentation files were refreshed. ([elizaos/eliza#5162](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5162), [elizaos/eliza#5164](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5164))\n    - Code refactoring began to consolidate character loading logic, reducing duplication. ([elizaos/eliza#5154](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5154), [elizaos/eliza#5169](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5169))\n- **Plugin Ecosystem Expansion**:\n    - Two new plugins, `@yungalgo/plugin-jellie` and `@yungalgo/plugin-jello`, were added to the registry. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#177](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/177), [elizaos-plugins/registry#176](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/176))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n- **New Pull Requests**:\n    -

  "content": "ElizaOS significantly advanced its core CLI today with major enhancements to environment variable management and the introduction of an AI-powered plugin upgrade tool, alongside critical UI improvements and bug fixes. Development teams also focused on addressing long-standing issues related to testing consistency, documentation, and agent deployment strategies across multiple repositories.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention \n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5234](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5234): Documentation overhaul needs input on creating separate tracks for simple users and developers, with detailed feedback already provided on current shortcomings.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5244](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5244): Discussion on best ways to deploy custom Eliza agents, with `claude` making progress on deployment configuration files and `bealers` offering \"elizify\" as a community project.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5295): Migration of CLI input methods to `@clack/prompts` needs review for PR #5359.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **Enhanced CLI Functionality and User Experience**:\n    - Refactored environment variable system for improved maintainability and user-friendliness, now utilizing `clack` for prompts ([elizaos/eliza#5326](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5326)).\n    - Fixed the `create` command to correctly display project types and clean up on interruption ([elizaos/eliza#5321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5321), [elizaos/eliza#5337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5337)).\n    - Implemented automatic installation of AI model plugins during project creation ([elizaos/eliza#5335](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5335)).\n    - Simplified `.env` file creation to use templates only, preventing clutter from runtime environment pollution ([elizaos/eliza#5340](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5340)).\n    - Ensured agent secrets are automatically updated with local variables if empty ([elizaos/eliza#5329](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5329)).\n- **AI-Powered Plugin Migration Tool**:\n    - Introduced a new AI-powered migration tool to streamline the upgrade process for ElizaOS plugins from version 0.x to 1.x, featuring a stepwise migration guide ([elizaos/eliza#5311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5311)).\n- **UI/UX Improvements and Server Control**:\n    - Added an environment variable to toggle Web UI availability, enhancing control in production environments ([elizaos/eliza#5304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5304)).\n    - Restructured character form action buttons for improved layout and user experience ([elizaos/eliza#5342](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5342)).\n    - Enabled the GUI to dynamically display the server version, fetched from a new server endpoint ([elizaos/eliza#5339](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5339)).\n- **Bug Fixes and Stability**:\n    - Resolved a critical bug in `plugin-knowledge` where `processKnowledgeAction` generated the same `clientDocumentId` for every memory, ensuring unique identification for new memories ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/16)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n- **New Pull Requests**:\n    -

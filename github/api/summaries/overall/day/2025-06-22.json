  "content": "Today's focus was on enhancing API stability and developer experience across ElizaOS, with significant updates to API documentation and critical bug fixes for database connections and file uploads. While core API functionality was confirmed, ongoing discussions highlight the need to address deployment and configuration issues causing \"API endpoint not found\" errors.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention \n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5230](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5230), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#5230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/5230), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter#5230](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/5230) \"API endpoint not found\" errors are still being investigated, with recent analysis suggesting deployment/configuration issues rather than code defects, requiring team attention to diagnostic steps and recommendations.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### API Documentation & Stability\n- **API Specification Alignment**: The `eliza.postman.json` file was updated, and REST API documentation was extensively refreshed to align with the latest Eliza AI Framework API specification v1, standardizing formatting and updating descriptions. ([elizaos/eliza#5239](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5239), [elizaos/eliza#5236](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5236))\n- **Robust Database Error Handling**: A bug fix was implemented to provide more precise error reporting for database connection issues, improving debugging capabilities. ([elizaos/eliza#5235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5235))\n\n### Plugin Enhancements & Bug Fixes\n- **File Upload Stability Improvement**: A significant bug causing \"Unexpected end of form\" errors during file uploads in `plugin-knowledge` was resolved by removing duplicate middleware processing. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#25](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/25))\n- **Twitter Plugin Authentication Clarification**: An issue regarding the `plugin-twitter` attempting password-based authentication instead of API keys was reported and resolved, clarifying that the user was likely using an outdated version from `node_modules`. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter#28](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/28))\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos/eliza**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5242](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5242) Next\n    - [elizaos/eliza#5241](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5241) feat: migrate client to use type-safe API client\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter**:\n    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter#28](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/28) API Key and Credential Usage / Authentication Method Clarification (closed same day).\n\n## ✨ Contributor Spotlight\n- **ChristopherTrimboli**: Provided initial analysis and updates on API documentation alignment for `elizaos/eliza`.\n- **iQiexie**: Contributed to the ongoing discussion on API endpoint issues, highlighting discrepancies in documentation.\n- **Claude**: Provided a comprehensive analysis and diagnostic steps for the \"API endpoint not found\" issue across multiple repositories, concluding that the API implementation is functional and the problem is likely environmental."

  "content": "On Jan 14, 2026, ElizaOS saw new development in voice utilities for the Discord plugin and a significant refactor of domain stores in the `plugin-sql` module. A critical issue regarding a reflection evaluator failure was reported across both `elizaos/eliza` and `elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord`, highlighting a potential data consistency problem.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord#6364](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6364): The \"Reflection evaluator fails with 'Entity not found'\" issue requires attention as `UPDATE_CONTACT` fails due to `ensureConnection()` not being called, leading to \"No ownership data found for world\" logs. A proposed fix in `reflection.ts` before `UPDATE_CONT` needs evaluation.\n    - [elizaos/eliza#6364](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6364): This issue, mirroring the one in `plugin-discord`, also details the reflection evaluator failure and includes logs and a proposed fix that needs review.\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n- **New Pull Requests**:\n    - **elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord**:\n        - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord#42](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/42): \"voice-pr: utilities & other fixes\"\n    - **elizaos/eliza**:\n        - [elizaos/eliza#6366](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6366): Refactor `plugin-sql` module by extracting domain stores from `BaseDrizzleAdapter`.\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n- **New Issues**:\n    - **elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord**:\n        - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord#6364](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6364): \"Reflection evaluator fails with 'Entity not found' - UPDATE_CONTACT requires entity initialization\"\n    - **elizaos/eliza**:\n        - [elizaos/eliza#6364](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6364): \"Reflection evaluator fails with 'Entity not found'\"\n        - [elizaos/eliza#6365](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6365): \"AI Agent Payment Implementation Guide\""

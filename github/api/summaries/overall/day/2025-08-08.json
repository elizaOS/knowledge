  "content": "On Aug 8, 2025, the ElizaOS project made significant strides in codebase refinement, standardizing dependencies, and enhancing build systems, including a migration to `bunx`. Critical logger compatibility issues were addressed across multiple repositories, though a persistent build failure in `@elizaos/core` and the Eliza CLI continues to block testing and project creation.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention \n- **Blocked Issue: Build Failure in @elizaos/core:** [elizaos/eliza#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738) and [elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp#5738](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5738) and [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738) This issue, confirmed to exist on the latest branch, is blocking testing of advanced mocking, natural language agent interaction, and dynamic plugin loading.\n- **Blocked Issue: Eliza CLI Project Build Failure:** [elizaos/eliza#5734](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5734) and [elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp#5734](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/issues/5734) and [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#5734](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5734) This issue, related to missing logger placeholders, is still active and potentially fixed in an upcoming version.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Codebase Refinement & Standardization\n- **Comprehensive Code Formatting and Linting:** Improved code quality, consistency, and maintainability across the ElizaOS codebase. [elizaos/eliza#5740](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5740)\n- **Dependency Standardization:** Standardized all internal package dependencies to use the workspace protocol and removed obsolete `llms.txt`. [elizaos/eliza#5744](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5744)\n\n### Build System & Core Enhancements\n- **Migration to `bunx`:** Improved build efficiency by migrating GitHub workflows and package scripts from `npx` to `bunx`. [elizaos/eliza#5742](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5742)\n- **XML Parser Enhancement:** Replaced an unsafe fallback regex with a linear scan in the XML parser to prevent potential issues. [elizaos/eliza#5741](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5741)\n\n### Logging System & Compatibility Fixes\n- **Pino Logger Refactor:** Addressed missing pino logger refactors, converting logger calls to object-first structured logging to align with pino typings and resolve TS/DTS errors. [elizaos/eliza#5737](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5737)\n- **Logger Compatibility Fix in `plugin-knowledge`:** Standardized error logging across the application for improved consistency and readability. [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#38](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/38)\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp**\n    - Logger Compatibility Fix: [#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/15)\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### New Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**\n    - Build System Failures: [elizaos/eliza#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738) (Build failure in `@elizaos/core` during DTS build)\n    - Cloud-Related Bug Fixing: [elizaos/eliza#5747](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5747) (Tracking bugs in `eliza-cloud`)\n\n### Closed Issues\n- **elizaos/eliza**\n    - Release Workflow Correction: [elizaos/eliza#5730](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5730) (Fixed incorrect package version replacement in monorepo)\n\n## ✨ Contributor Spotlight\n- **Kemystra:** Identified and provided a fix for the missing placeholder in `logger.info` calls within templates, addressing the Eliza CLI project build failure.\n- **monilpat:** Confirmed the `@elizaos/core` build failure issue and its impact on testing, providing crucial context.\n- **wtfsayo:** Provided updates on the Eliza CLI build failure, suggesting a potential fix in version 1.4.x."

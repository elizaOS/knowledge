  "content": "On May 30, 2025, the ElizaOS project significantly advanced its core framework, focusing on enhancing the CLI and agent management functionalities with new features like improved agent configuration and AI model prompt integration. Critical bug fixes were implemented across testing and CLI operations, alongside substantial documentation and code quality improvements, ensuring a more robust and user-friendly developer experience.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n\n### CLI and Agent Management Enhancements\n- Improved agent configuration management on restart, enhancing validation processes ([elizaos/eliza#4755](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4755)).\n- Introduced AI model prompts during new agent creation via CLI, improving user experience ([elizaos/eliza#4826](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4826)).\n- Updated plugin discovery to fetch the registry from Vercel API, ensuring up-to-date plugin lists ([elizaos/eliza#4824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4824)).\n- Enhanced CLI update notifications and reduced verbose logging for better clarity ([elizaos/eliza#4845](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4845)).\n\n### Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements\n- Resolved E2E test compilation failures, ensuring tests are correctly compiled and executed ([elizaos/eliza#4813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4813)).\n- Prevented the `elizaos update` command from running in non-project directories, addressing user confusion ([elizaos/eliza#4812](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4812)).\n- Fixed issues with plugin publishing failures related to registry references ([elizaos/eliza#4847](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4847)).\n\n### Documentation and Code Quality\n- Standardized CLI documentation to correct inaccuracies and improve clarity ([elizaos/eliza#4827](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4827)).\n- Added docstrings for better code readability and maintenance ([elizaos/eliza#4834](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4834)).\n- Refactored CLI commands to utilize a standardized directory detection utility, enhancing code consistency ([elizaos/eliza#4849](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4849))."

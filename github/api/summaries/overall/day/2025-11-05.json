  "content": "Today, the ElizaOS project enhanced runtime flexibility by adding an option to skip plugin migrations during initialization and fixed critical PostgreSQL entity serialization issues, ensuring more robust data handling.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### Runtime Control & Data Handling Improvements\n*   Added an optional `skipMigrations` parameter to the `initialize()` method in `IAgentRuntime` for conditional skipping of plugin migrations, providing greater control over startup processes ([elizaos/eliza#6132](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6132)).\n*   Resolved PostgreSQL entity creation failures by normalizing the `names` field to an array, fixing issues with `Set` objects during database operations ([elizaos/eliza#6133](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6133)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n### New Pull Requests\n*   **elizaos/eliza**:\n    *   [#6134](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6134) fix(plugin-sql): correct types path in package.json exports"

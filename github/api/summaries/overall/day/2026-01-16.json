  "content": "Today, the ElizaOS project saw a significant refactoring of the `plugin-sql` package in `elizaos/eliza` to enhance modularity and maintainability, alongside the closure of two user experience issues. New issues were opened concerning future capabilities like smart contract deployment and AI model integration, as well as a migration bug.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n### SQL Plugin Refactoring\n- The `BaseDrizzleAdapter` in the `plugin-sql` package was refactored into composable domain stores, improving maintainability and separation of concerns without altering the public API. [elizaos/eliza#6366](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6366)\n\n### User Experience Improvements\n- The '+' symbol was removed from personality traits and topics of interest fields, enhancing the user interface. [elizaos/eliza#6350](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6350)\n- Users are now correctly redirected to their last agent chat session after logging in or signing up, instead of the dashboard. [elizaos/eliza#6354](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6354)\n\n## 🐞 Issue Triage\n### elizaos/eliza\n**New Issues**:\n- Ability to deploy smart contracts on-chain. [elizaos/eliza#6367](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6367)\n- Integration of Opus 4.5 into ElizaOS applications. [elizaos/eliza#6368](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6368)\n- Migration eligibility mismatch and snapshot bug related to a Tangem hardware wallet. [elizaos/eliza#6369](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6369)\n\n**Closed Issues**:\n- Removed '+' symbol from personality traits and topics of interest fields. [elizaos/eliza#6350](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6350)\n- Resolved redirection to dashboard instead of last agent chat session after login/signup.

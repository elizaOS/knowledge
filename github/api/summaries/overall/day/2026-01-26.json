  "content": "Overall Project Summary for Jan 26, 2026:\n\nToday, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in core infrastructure and plugin integrations, with critical AI Gateway credits topped up and key plugins like GitHub and Code Execution integrated. Concurrently, there was a strong focus on future development, with numerous new issues opened for UX enhancements, diverse plugin integrations, and foundational infrastructure improvements, alongside routine dependency updates in the documentation repository.\n\n## 🚨 Needs Attention\n- **Urgent Discussions**:\n    - [elizaos/eliza#6390](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6390) and [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#6390](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6390): Clarification is needed on the naming convention for \"Opus - pro\" and \"Ultra - sonnet\" models, as there appears to be a discrepancy in current usage.\n\n## ✅ Completed Work\n- **Critical Infrastructure & Research Blockers Resolved**:\n    - AI Gateway credits were topped up, unblocking all AI inference and development work ([elizaos/eliza#6393](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6393)).\n    - Initial competitive analysis findings from Claudebot and Poke research were compiled ([elizaos/eliza#6396](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6396)).\n    - Research into a hosted Claudebot-like experience was explored ([elizaos/eliza#6423](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6423)).\n- **Plugin Integration & QA Readiness**:\n    - The integration of the GitHub Plugin was closed, indicating progress on code and repository management capabilities ([elizaos/eliza#6406](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6406)).\n    - The integration of a Code Execution Plugin was closed, enabling Eliza to write and execute code ([elizaos/eliza#6408](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6408)).\n    - Recruitment for consumer testers was completed, preparing for user feedback and bug backlog generation ([elizaos/eliza#6420](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6420)).\n    - The Coin Railz x402 Micropayment Services plugin submission was closed, indicating a decision or completion regarding its integration ([elizaos/eliza#6148](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6148)).\n- **Core Bug Fixes**:\n    - An import statement in `elizaos.js` was updated to use a package alias, resolving a potential pathing issue ([elizaos/eliza#6389](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6389)).\n- **Dependency Updates**:\n    - Several key dependencies were updated to their latest versions, enhancing stability and incorporating new features, including `@commander-js/extra-typings` from 12.1.0 to 14.0.0 ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#220](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/220)), `ora` from 7.0.1 to 9.0.0 ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#218](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/218)), and `date-fns` from 3.6.0 to 4.1.0 ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#217](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/217)).\n\n## 🏗️ Work in Progress\n- **New Pull Requests**:\n    -

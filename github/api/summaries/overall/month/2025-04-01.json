  "content": "# Overall Project Monthly Summary (April 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nApril was a month of significant growth for ElizaOS, focused on expanding agent capabilities and enhancing the overall user experience. We shipped major improvements to our AI provider integrations, social media plugins, and user interfaces, making our agents smarter and the framework more accessible for developers and users.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Expanding Agent Intelligence and Real-World Capabilities**\nTo advance our mission of creating autonomous and adaptable agents, we focused on broadening their skills and contextual awareness.\n-   Agents can now leverage new AI providers, including OpenAI for Text-to-Speech, Kluster AI for models, and Mem0 for SDK support, giving them a wider range of tools to complete tasks in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   Social media capabilities were enhanced, with agents now able to post long-form tweets, delete their posts, and act as community managers in Telegram, allowing for more sophisticated online interactions in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   We introduced a foundational \"world state\" provider and scopable knowledge systems, enabling agents to understand and recall information with greater context, a key step toward more advanced reasoning in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n\n**Making the Framework More Accessible and User-Friendly**\nWe believe that powerful tools should also be easy to use, so we invested in simplifying the experience for both new and existing users.\n-   The command-line interface (CLI) was overhauled with better plugin management and an automatic update notification system, streamlining the developer workflow in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   The graphical user interface (GUI) is now more intuitive, featuring an interactive onboarding tour for new users, easier agent creation via JSON import, and safer group management in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n\n**Strengthening the Core for Modularity and Reliability**\nTo ensure the long-term health and scalability of the project, we made foundational improvements to the framework's architecture.\n-   The plugin system was enhanced to support more complex integrations and a more robust installation and publishing workflow, reinforcing our commitment to a modular architecture in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   We refactored the core event system for improved type safety and reliability, making the entire platform more stable in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   Numerous critical bugs were resolved across Discord, Twitter, and AI model provider integrations, significantly improving platform stability and performance in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core framework saw extensive development, focusing on new features, usability enhancements, and critical bug fixes.\n\n**Key Features & Enhancements:**\n-   **AI & Model

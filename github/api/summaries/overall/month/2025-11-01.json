  "content": "# Overall Project Monthly Summary (November 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nNovember's efforts focused on expanding our AI agents' capabilities in the Web3 space and strengthening the core platform's stability and security. We saw significant community contributions that add new financial analysis tools, while internal work focused on improving agent reliability and foundational AI features.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Expanding Agent Capabilities in Web3 and Finance**\nThis initiative directly supports our mission to build an AI framework that thrives in both Web2 and Web3 ecosystems by equipping agents with specialized, decentralized tools.\n-   The plugin registry saw proposals for three new community-contributed plugins focused on providing trading insights for Solana and other on-chain sources, expanding the toolset available to agents in [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry).\n\n**Strengthening Core Stability and AI Foundations**\nThis work is crucial for ensuring the long-term health, reliability, and intelligence of the entire ElizaOS ecosystem.\n-   A critical bug was fixed in the core framework, ensuring agent settings are now correctly saved and persist across restarts, which significantly improves agent reliability in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n-   Work began to add support for text embedding models, a foundational step toward enabling more advanced reasoning and data analysis capabilities for our agents in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter).\n-   Development started on a new security feature to provide more granular data control within the platform, a key step towards building more robust and secure autonomous systems in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n\n**Aligning Plugins with Core Framework Updates**\nTo ensure the stability of our modular ecosystem, plugins must remain compatible with the latest enhancements to the core framework.\n-   The MCP plugin was updated to align with the latest version of `@elizaos/core`, ensuring it benefits from recent improvements and maintains compatibility across the platform. This foundational work was done in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n-   Improved agent stability by fixing a critical bug that caused agent settings to be lost during restarts, ensuring configurations now persist correctly ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).\n-   Initiated work on a significant security enhancement to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to provide more granular data control ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\n-   Received proposals to add three new community-contributed plugins for financial and on-chain analysis, enhancing agent capabilities in the Web3 space:\n    -   A plugin for Solana Trading Insights ([#237](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/237)).\n    -   Two related plugins for AI16z Trading Insights ([#238](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/238), [#239](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/239)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp\n-   Improved the clarity of the plugin's interface by renaming core actions (e.g., `CALL_TOOL` to `CALL_MCP_TOOL`) while maintaining backward compatibility. This effort also included updating the `@elizaos/core` dependency to align with the latest framework version ([#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/18)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter\n-   Began development to broaden the plugin's capabilities by adding support for `TEXT_EMBEDDING` models, which will enhance the versatility of agents using the OpenRouter service ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/17))."

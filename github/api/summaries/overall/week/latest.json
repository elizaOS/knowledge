  "content": "# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Jan 25 - 31, 2026)\n\nThis week, ElizaOS focused on stabilizing the developer experience and laying the groundwork for a more powerful, consumer-ready AI application ecosystem. By resolving critical setup blockers and expanding how agents interact with the world—through better security, code execution, and automation—the project is moving from a framework toward a comprehensive service platform.\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe team successfully restored the project's \"front door\" by fixing a critical bug that prevented new developers from starting projects. With the foundation stabilized, the focus shifted to strategic expansion, including the development of a new \"Eliza App\" and the integration of advanced automation tools like N8N to make AI agents more capable in professional environments.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Restoring and Improving the Developer Onboarding Experience**\n*Goal: To ensure that anyone wanting to build with ElizaOS can get started in minutes without technical errors.*\n*   Fixed a major \"Project Generation\" failure that was blocking new users from creating projects, restoring the primary entry point for the community ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Updated all official guides to use the correct installation commands, ensuring new developers have a smooth, error-free setup process ([elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs)).\n\n**Expanding Agent Capabilities and Intelligence**\n*Goal: To give AI agents the tools they need to perform complex tasks, like writing code or managing business workflows.*\n*   Launched a \"Code Execution\" plugin that allows agents to write and run their own code natively to solve problems ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Introduced \"Broker Authentication\" for Twitter, allowing for more secure and professional automated social media management ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter)).\n*   Began integrating the N8N workflow engine, which will allow agents to connect to thousands of different business apps and automate complex sequences of tasks ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n\n**Strengthening Project Infrastructure and Security**\n*Goal: To make the ElizaOS ecosystem more secure, transparent, and easier to manage as it grows to hundreds of sub-projects.*\n*   Established a formal security protocol to ensure vulnerabilities can be reported and fixed safely ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   Deployed a new analytics system to track and monitor the health of over 300 different code repositories within the ElizaOS organization ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n*   Modernized the core web framework and database tools to improve performance and keep the platform secure against modern threats ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\nThis week featured a highly synchronized effort to fix a critical system failure that spanned multiple parts of the project:\n*   **The \"Create\" Command Fix**: When the command to start a new project broke, it required a three-pronged solution. The core team fixed the underlying code in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), the plugin team verified the fix in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter), and the documentation team updated the user guides in [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs). This coordinated effort ensured that the fix was not just implemented, but also communicated clearly to the community.\n\n---\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n*   **Restored Project Creation**: Resolved a critical failure in the `elizaos create` command ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6388)) and updated internal pathing to prevent future environment errors ([#6389](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6389)).\n*   **New Agent Tools**: Finalized the **GitHub Plugin** for repository management ([#6406](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6406)) and the **Code Execution Plugin** ([#6408](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6408)).\n*   **Strategic Planning**: Initiated research for the \"Eliza App\" by analyzing market competitors ([#6394](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6394)) and began planning for multi-platform messaging (WhatsApp, Telegram) via a new webhook service ([#6429](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6429)).\n*   **Security & Reliability**: Created a formal `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting ([#6428](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6428)) and resolved a block on AI inference by topping up gateway credits ([#6393](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6393)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter\n*   **Enhanced Security**: Implemented a new \"Broker Authentication\" mode to support enterprise-grade automated workflows ([#47](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/pull/47)).\n*   **Ecosystem Stability**: Actively participated in the cross-repo troubleshooting of the CLI initialization failure ([#6388](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter/issues/6388)).\n\n### elizaos/docs\n*   **Onboarding Fix**: Corrected the installation instructions to use the new scoped `@elizaos/cli` package, which was the root cause of project generation failures ([#83](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/83)).\n*   **Community Support**: Validated workarounds provided by community contributors to ensure users remained unblocked during the transition.\n\n### elizaos/elizaos.github.io\n*   **Advanced Analytics**: Launched a new GitHub Analytics server to provide deep insights into contributor data and repository health ([#238](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/238)).\n*   **Repository Visibility**: Updated the tracking pipeline to ensure all 300+ organization repositories are visible and monitored in the project dashboard ([#231](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/231)).\n*   **Tech Stack Modernization**: Upgraded the core framework to Next.js 16.1.4 and updated several critical utility libraries to improve speed and security ([#236](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/236), [#237](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/237))."

  "content": "# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Feb 1 - 7, 2026)\n\nThis week, ElizaOS made significant strides toward the launch of the Eliza App MVP, focusing on connecting AI agents to everyday messaging platforms and hardening security for professional use. Beyond technical fixes, the community began a major strategic shift, moving away from complex \"word-based\" instructions toward more reliable \"logic-based\" systems to make agents smarter and more efficient.\n\n## Executive Summary\nThe project successfully integrated major messaging services like Telegram, Discord, and SMS into a unified cloud environment while securing the `eliza.app` domain. By implementing new \"multi-tenant\" security features and expanding Web3 financial tools, ElizaOS is transitioning from an experimental framework into a robust, production-ready ecosystem for autonomous AI agents.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Expanding Connectivity and User Reach**\n*Goal: To make AI agents accessible on the apps people use every day.*\n*   The core team successfully deployed Discord, Telegram, and native iOS messaging integrations, allowing agents to communicate across multiple platforms simultaneously ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n*   The project secured the `eliza.app` domain and finalized a new \"poke-style\" onboarding flow to make it easier for new users to get started ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n\n**Hardening Security and Multi-User Privacy**\n*Goal: To ensure that when multiple people use the same agent, their private data and API keys remain completely separate and secure.*\n*   Introduced \"Per-User Connections,\" which allows the system to safely inject individual API keys based on who is talking to the agent, preventing data leaks in shared environments ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp)).\n*   Implemented new transaction validation \"guardrails\" to ensure that agents performing financial tasks operate within safe, pre-defined limits ([elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry)).\n\n**Improving Reliability and Cost Transparency**\n*Goal: To make agents more predictable in their actions and easier to manage financially.*\n*   A new \"Cost Evaluator\" was proposed to track exactly how much money an agent is spending on AI processing (tokens) in real-time ([elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry)).\n*   The workflow system was updated with a \"human-in-the-loop\" feature, allowing users to review and approve an agent's plan before it executes complex tasks ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow)).\n\n**Rethinking Agent Intelligence (The \"Biological Trap\")**\n*Goal: To reduce the \"overhead\" of long text prompts by using structured logic, making agents faster and more capable.*\n*   Across multiple repositories, the community began a high-level debate on moving away from prose-heavy instructions toward logic-based synchronization, aiming to solve performance bottlenecks at the architectural level ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n\n**Unified Ecosystem Expansion**\nThe project demonstrated tight coordination between the core framework and the plugin ecosystem to prepare for the MVP launch.\n*   **Workflow Integration**: The `elizaos.github.io` repository updated its tracking pipeline to include the `n8n-workflow` plugin, ensuring that automated task management is a first-class citizen in the ElizaOS documentation and examples ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#241](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/241)).\n*   **Security Synchronization**: Security audits in the core `eliza` repository were synchronized with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) plugin updates to ensure that new multi-user privacy features were implemented consistently across the entire stack ([elizaos/eliza#6472](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6472)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n*   **Messaging Expansion**: Integrated Discord as an AWS service ([#6398](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6398)) and added native iOS messaging via Blue.io ([#6399](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6399)).\n*   **Architectural Modularity**: Introduced `RequestContext` to allow the system to remember user-specific settings without messy code workarounds ([#6457](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6457)).\n*   **Stability Fixes**: Resolved a critical issue where user settings were being ignored by the cloud, which previously caused API key conflicts ([#6451](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6451)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp\n*   **User Isolation**: Implemented per-user connections for the Model Context Protocol, a vital step for keeping user data private in multi-tenant apps ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/23)).\n*   **State Management**: Began fixing \"shared-state\" bugs to prevent different users' data from accidentally mixing during agent interactions ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/24)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\n*   **Web3 Utility**: Added new plugins for \"Smart Money\" signals on Base L2 ([#253](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/253)) and an AI Agent Job Marketplace ([#255](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/255)).\n*   **Safety Guardrails**: Integrated the Proofgate plugin to validate agent transactions before they are sent to the blockchain ([#254](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/254)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow\n*   **User Confirmation**: Added an `awaitingUserInput` flag so agents pause for permission before running complex automated workflows ([#13](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/13)).\n*   **Reliability**: Improved how agents identify user intent and fixed errors in how they report if a task was successful or not ([#8](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/8), [#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/12))."

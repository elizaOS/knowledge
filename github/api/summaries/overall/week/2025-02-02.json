  "content": "# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Feb 2 - 8, 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis week, ElizaOS underwent a foundational architectural evolution, moving to a more dynamic, plugin-based system. This strategic shift enhances our modularity and extensibility, making it easier for developers to add new capabilities and accelerating our progress toward a truly adaptable and decentralized AI framework.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Pivoting to a Fully Modular, Plugin-Driven Architecture**\nThis core initiative directly supports our philosophy of modularity and composability, allowing developers to easily add or modify agent capabilities without altering the central framework.\n- The core architecture was refactored to dynamically load functionality through plugins, replacing the former, more rigid \"verifiable inference\" concept ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n- The project's build system was migrated from pnpm to Bun, improving performance and preparing the groundwork for future runtime enhancements ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n\n**Expanding Agent Capabilities in Web3 and DeFi**\nTo ensure our agents can operate effectively in decentralized ecosystems, we are continuously adding tools for interacting with blockchain data and services.\n- New plugins were introduced to pull market data from CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, giving the agent access to real-time crypto information ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n- The agent's ability to interact with the MultiversX blockchain was improved, and new plugins were added for DeFi platforms like DESK Exchange and Edwin ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n\n**Refining Agent Communication Across Social Platforms**\nWe are giving users more granular control over how the agent communicates, ensuring its actions are appropriate and intentional on platforms like Discord, Telegram, and Twitter.\n- Functionality was added to selectively suppress agent actions on Discord, Telegram, and Twitter, preventing unwanted posts and improving user control ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n- Several long-standing bugs related to Twitter login and message formatting were resolved, improving the reliability of the agent's social media interactions ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe main repository saw a major architectural overhaul focused on creating a more modular and extensible plugin system. This was complemented by significant expansion of Web3 capabilities and improvements to client integrations.\n\n**Key Updates:**\n- **Architectural Shift**: Implemented a dynamic handlers pattern for service integration ([#3339](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3339), [#3376](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3376)) and removed the verifiable inference concept in favor of a more flexible plugin-based approach ([#3344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3344)).\n- **Performance & Tooling**: Replaced pnpm with Bun as the primary package manager to improve build performance ([#2852](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/2852)).\n- **Web3 & DeFi Integrations**:\n    - Added a new plugin for CoinMarketCap ([#3134](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3134)) and enhanced the existing CoinGecko plugin ([#3124](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3124)).\n    - Introduced new plugins for DESK Exchange ([#3096](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3096)) and Edwin for DeFi operations ([#3045](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3045)).\n    - Improved the MultiversX plugin by adding a `CREATE_POOL` action ([#3209](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3209)).\n- **Client Enhancements**:\n    - Added the ability to suppress automated actions in Discord ([#3284](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3284)), Telegram ([#3285](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3285)), and Twitter ([#3286](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3286)).\n    - Resolved critical Twitter login issues ([#1431](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/1431), [#3112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3112)) and fixed message formatting bugs ([#3245](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3245)).\n- **Code Quality**: Integrated the Biome linter/formatter across numerous plugins to standardize code style and improve maintainability ([#3186](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3186), [#3181](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3181))."

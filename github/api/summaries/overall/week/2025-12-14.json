  "content": "# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis week, the project advanced on two key fronts: strengthening the platform's core architecture for future growth and laying the groundwork for a major user experience overhaul. Foundational refactoring began in key plugins to improve modularity, while critical bug fixes in the core platform enhanced stability. This work was complemented by a strategic push toward decentralization with the release of a new self-hosted plugin, directly supporting our mission of user autonomy.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n-   **Strengthening the Architectural Foundation**\n    This foundational work is crucial for building a more modular, scalable, and maintainable system, enabling faster development of future capabilities.\n    -   Work began on a significant refactor in the **[elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram)** to create a standardized way for it to communicate with the core framework.\n    -   A similar initiative was started in **[elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord)** to improve its internal message handling logic, enhancing the codebase's structure.\n\n-   **Advancing Decentralization and User Control**\n    In line with our core philosophy, this initiative reduces reliance on centralized services and gives users greater control over their data and infrastructure.\n    -   A new self-hosted Farcaster plugin was added to the **[elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry)**, empowering users to connect to their own Farcaster hub and removing dependency on third-party APIs.\n\n-   **Improving Stability and Planning for a User-Friendly Future**\n    We are focused on ensuring the platform is reliable for current users while strategically planning to make it more accessible for broader adoption.\n    -   A critical fix was merged in **[elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)** to ensure users on older versions have a smooth, error-free data migration when updating the platform.\n    -   A comprehensive plan for a major user experience overhaul was detailed in **[elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)**, with a focus on simplifying onboarding, using more intuitive language, and streamlining agent management.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw a dual focus on immediate stability improvements and strategic planning for a major user experience enhancement.\n-   **Stabilization:**\n    -   The SQL plugin was enhanced to ensure smooth data migration for users updating from older versions, preventing breaking changes ([#6215](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6215)).\n    -   A test failure in the CLI was resolved to improve the reliability of the development environment ([#6207](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6207)).\n-   **User Experience:**\n    -   Two UI improvements were rapidly implemented to make the plugin selection process more intuitive ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235), [#6236](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6236)).\n    -   A detailed roadmap for a UI/UX overhaul was established through numerous new issues, with key themes including a redesigned dashboard ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)), guided user onboarding ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221)), and simplifying technical jargon like \"Knowledge\" to \"Files\" ([#6237](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6237)).\n-   **Future Features:**\n    -   Planning began for significant new capabilities, including web search functionality ([#6246](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6246)) and a guide for AI agent payments ([#6244](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6244)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\nThis repository advanced the project's decentralization goals with a key feature release.\n-   A new self-hosted Farcaster plugin was merged ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), allowing the system to connect to a user-run hub and reducing reliance on centralized third-party services.\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\nWork in this repository focused on a strategic architectural improvement to align better with the core framework.\n-   A pull request was opened to begin implementing a unified messaging API ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)), a foundational change to standardize communication and improve modularity.\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord\nDevelopment activity was centered on improving the plugin's internal code structure for long-term health.\n-   Work began on refactoring the core message handling logic ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) to enhance the codebase's structure and maintainability."

  "content": "# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis week, the project advanced core agent capabilities by merging a new pluggable architecture and enhancing client-side streaming. However, this progress was coupled with significant challenges; a dependency cleanup introduced a critical installation bug, and direct community feedback highlighted severe friction in the developer onboarding experience, making these issues our highest priority to resolve.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Responding to Critical Developer Feedback**\n_Goal: To make our framework more accessible and intuitive for new developers by directly addressing community pain points and improving documentation._\n-   In response to a user's detailed feedback on \"bad documentation,\" the team used an AI agent to identify and fix multiple errors in the plugin scaffolding process, resolving a major barrier to entry in [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs) ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6070)).\n-   A comprehensive documentation overhaul was completed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), closing numerous gaps in core concepts, developer guides, and release processes ([#5938](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5938), [#5939](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5939)).\n-   To streamline the builder journey, a new \"Launch Resources\" page was created in [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs), consolidating key information into a single location ([#76](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/76)).\n\n**Advancing Core Framework and Agent Intelligence**\n_Goal: To enhance the modularity, power, and observability of our AI agents._\n-   The core framework was significantly updated by merging the `develop` branch in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), introducing a new pluggable message service and a unified server configuration ([#6078](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6078)).\n-   Agents were made more capable by allowing plugins to access the results of previous actions, enabling more complex reasoning ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) [#6081](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6081)).\n-   The framework's capabilities were expanded into Web3 identity with the addition of the \"nuggets\" plugin for self-sovereign identity in the [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) ([#236](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/236)).\n-   The user experience was modernized by integrating streaming AI responses into the client, allowing for real-time text generation ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) [#6082](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6082)).\n\n**Strengthening the Plugin Ecosystem**\n_Goal: To improve the stability, consistency, and feature set of individual plugins._\n-   The Solana plugin was updated in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana) to support the modern Token-2022 standard, expanding its utility within the Web3 ecosystem ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/16)).\n-   The Telegram plugin was made more stable and easier to debug by refactoring its message handling system and fixing a critical crash related to button interactions in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram) ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/17), [#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/19)).\n-   Build processes were standardized across plugins, with fixes in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana) and [elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram) to ensure greater consistency and reliability ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/17), [#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/issues/5673)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n\n-   **Response to Developer Onboarding Issues:** A critical feedback thread initiated in [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6070)) about frustrating plugin documentation was discussed by the core team in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) and ultimately resolved with a documentation fix in [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs). This demonstrates a coordinated, cross-project effort to respond to community needs.\n-   **Impact of Core Dependency Changes:** A CLI refactor in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to remove Anthropic dependencies ([#6087](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6087)) inadvertently introduced a critical, project-wide installation bug ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6088)). The issue was identified by the community and is being tracked across multiple repositories, highlighting its broad impact and status as a top-priority fix.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n-   The `develop` branch was merged into `main`, integrating a new pluggable `MessageService`, a unified server configuration, and a `generateText` API ([#6078](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6078)).\n-   The CLI was streamlined by removing Anthropic Claude dependencies, but this introduced a critical installation bug ([#6087](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6087), [#6088](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6088)).\n-   Agent intelligence was improved by allowing plugins to access action results ([#6081](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6081)) and ensuring the agent's `thought` is included in completion events ([#6083](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6083)).\n-   The client was enhanced with Streamdown to support streaming AI responses ([#6082](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6082)).\n-   A major documentation effort was completed, closing issues related to core concepts, developer guides, and release processes ([#5938](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5938), [#5939](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5939)).\n\n### elizaos/docs\n-   A critical issue with faulty plugin scaffolding documentation was resolved using an AI agent to identify and correct errors in template paths and CLI commands ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6070)).\n-   A new \"Launch Resources\" page was created to centralize information for builders ([#76](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/76)).\n-   The \"API Reference\" was renamed to \"REST Reference\" for improved clarity and consistency ([#75](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/75)).\n-   A new, high-priority bug was reported that prevents the CLI from running after a standard npm installation ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6088)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\n-   The plugin ecosystem was expanded with the addition of the \"nuggets\" plugin for self-sovereign identity ([#236](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/236)).\n-   A critical CLI installation bug causing `Cannot find module` errors was identified and reported ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6088)).\n-   A community discussion highlighted severe user frustration with plugin documentation, identifying a key pain point in the developer onboarding experience ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6070)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana\n-   The plugin's capabilities were enhanced with support for parsing Token-2022 metadata, crucial for modern Solana token standards ([#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/16)).\n-   The build script was updated to align with other ElizaOS plugins, fixing an import error and improving ecosystem consistency ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-solana/pull/17)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram\n-   The message handling system was refactored to improve traceability and make debugging easier ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/17)).\n-   A critical bug that caused the plugin to crash when handling Telegram buttons was resolved ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/19)).\n-   The logging system was migrated to `adze` to resolve a build failure with Bun, improving overall stability ([#5673](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin"

  "content": "# Overall Project Weekly Summary (May 25 - 31, 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis week, ElizaOS achieved a major milestone with its official v1 release, graduating the core framework, CLI, and documentation from beta. This launch was supported by significant enhancements to the developer experience and a major expansion of agent capabilities, particularly in the Web3 ecosystem, reinforcing our commitment to modular, decentralized AI.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Launching ElizaOS v1 and Maturing the Platform**\n*Strategic Importance: To signal platform stability and readiness for wider community and enterprise adoption, moving from an experimental phase to a production-ready framework.*\n- The official v1 release of the core ElizaOS framework was completed, removing beta labels and marking a significant step in the project's maturity ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n- The core logging system was enhanced for better visibility, making it easier to develop and debug stable agents ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4784)).\n- Critical bugs were fixed, including an API endpoint that failed to report agent activity and an issue with environment variable handling, improving overall reliability ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4762), [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4772)).\n\n**Enhancing the Developer Experience**\n*Strategic Importance: To make it faster and more intuitive for developers to build, publish, and manage AI agents, which is critical for growing our open-source community.*\n- The process for publishing new agent plugins was streamlined into a single command, simplifying distribution to GitHub, npm, and the official registry ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4795)).\n- The command-line interface (CLI) was made easier to use with improved update notifications and more concise commands ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4845)).\n- We added helpful AI model prompts to the agent creation workflow, allowing for more customized and intelligent agent setup from the start ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4826)).\n\n**Expanding Agent Capabilities in Web3 and AI**\n*Strategic Importance: To increase the power and adaptability of agents across diverse ecosystems, fulfilling our mission to build a framework that thrives in both Web2 and Web3.*\n- A new plugin for Polygon zkEVM was completed, expanding our agents' ability to operate on cutting-edge blockchain infrastructure ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4801)).\n- We released an enhanced Polymarket plugin, giving agents sophisticated capabilities for participating in prediction markets ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4842)).\n- The plugin system was overhauled to support dependencies, allowing developers to build more complex and modular agents that can leverage each other's functionality ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4789)).\n- Support was added for more AI/ML API providers, giving developers greater flexibility in choosing the intelligence that powers their agents ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4828)).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw a landmark week, culminating in the official v1 release. Work focused on improving the developer toolchain, expanding Web3 functionality through new plugins, and hardening the platform by fixing key bugs.\n\n**Key Features & Enhancements:**\n- Streamlined the CLI `publish` command to handle GitHub, npm, and registry workflows in a single step ([#4795](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4795), [#4793](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4793)).\n- Completed the Polygon zkEVM plugin, expanding blockchain integration capabilities ([#4801](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4801)).\n- Introduced an enhanced Polymarket plugin with comprehensive trading actions for prediction markets ([#4842](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4842)).\n- Overhauled the plugin registration system to support dependencies between plugins, enabling more complex agent builds ([#4789](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/4789)).\n- Added support for new AI/ML API model providers, increasing developer choice ([#4828](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4828)).\n- Migrated agent knowledge features into a dedicated plugin and added a graph view for memories, improving modularity and user insight ([#4766](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4766)).\n\n**Key Fixes:**\n- Fixed a critical API endpoint bug that caused agent rooms to return empty lists, restoring correct state reporting ([#4762](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4762)).\n- Resolved module import errors for `@elizaos/core` that were impacting the development environment ([#4536](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4536)).\n- Addressed an issue where the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable was not being respected, improving debugging control ([#4772](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4772)).\n- Fixed TypeScript definition issues that were causing build and test failures with Node and Jest ([#4805](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4805))."

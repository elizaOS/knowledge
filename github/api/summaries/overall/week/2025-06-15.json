  "content": "# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis week, the ElizaOS project made significant strides on two parallel fronts: dramatically expanding the platform's AI capabilities and undertaking a major effort to harden the core framework. We integrated new AI models from Ollama and Google, launched a dedicated AWS Bedrock plugin, and grew our plugin ecosystem, while simultaneously overhauling our testing infrastructure and resolving critical stability bugs to build a more robust and reliable foundation for future growth.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Expanding AI Capabilities and the Plugin Ecosystem**\n*Our goal is to create a versatile and extensible framework, and this week we significantly broadened the tools and models available to developers.*\n-   The core framework now directly supports **Ollama** and **Google's Gemini models**, giving users more choice and flexibility in their AI agent setups ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n-   A new, dedicated plugin for **AWS Bedrock** was released, fulfilling a key community request for integration with Amazon's generative AI services ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n-   The **Knowledge Plugin** was enhanced with a new vector search UI and the ability to use custom LLM providers for document processing, expanding its data retrieval power ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge)).\n-   The plugin ecosystem continued to grow with the addition of **four new community-contributed plugins** to the official registry ([elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry)).\n\n**Strengthening the Core Framework for Stability and Reliability**\n*To support our growing ecosystem, we are focused on making the underlying platform more modular, scalable, and bug-free.*\n-   The server was extracted into its own independent package, a key architectural change that improves modularity and allows it to be used standalone ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n-   We began a strategic overhaul of our testing infrastructure by migrating to `bun:test`, aiming to standardize and accelerate our validation processes ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n-   The project's central data pipeline was refactored to support multiple repositories, a crucial step for scaling our ability to track contributions across the entire organization ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n-   A critical, long-standing bug that prevented plugin actions from communicating back to the user chat was resolved, restoring essential functionality for many plugins ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n\n**Improving the Developer and User Experience**\n*We are committed to making ElizaOS easier and more intuitive to use for both developers building on the platform and end-users interacting with agents.*\n-   The command-line interface was improved by speeding up project creation and consolidating commands for a more consistent workflow ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n-   Key bugs affecting developers on Windows were fixed, improving cross-platform compatibility ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n-   User profiles on our community site now display a verification checkmark for linked wallets, improving trust and recognition ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)).\n-   We responded quickly to a community request for more flexible logging, with a detailed implementation plan already in progress to give developers more control ([elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n\n**Resolving the Critical Plugin Callback Bug**\nA major collaborative success this week was the resolution of a bug ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5017)) where plugins could perform actions but couldn't report the results back to the user. This issue was reported by users of `plugin-evm` and other plugins, diagnosed by maintainers, fixed within the core `elizaos/eliza` repository, and verified by the community. This single fix restored critical functionality across the entire plugin ecosystem, demonstrating the interconnected nature of our framework.\n\n**Coordinated Response to Feature Requests**\nThe integration of AWS Bedrock ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5117)) and the new request for a customizable logger ([#5183](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5183)) highlight our process for addressing community needs. Discussions that began in the context of one plugin were recognized as project-wide needs. The Bedrock request resulted in a new, dedicated plugin from the core team, while the logger request is being centrally planned to benefit all downstream projects, ensuring a consistent and powerful solution for everyone.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n-   **AI Provider Expansion**: Added native support for **Ollama** ([#5160](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5160)) and **Google Generative AI (Gemini)** ([#5217](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5217)) to the `create` command.\n-   **Architectural Refinement**: The server was extracted into a new `@elizaos/server` package to improve modularity and enable standalone use ([#5122](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5122)).\n-   **Testing Overhaul**: Began a strategic migration from `vitest` to `bun:test` to standardize and speed up the testing suite, starting with the CLI tests ([#5199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5199)).\n-   **Developer Experience**: Added a feature to clear agent memories for better state control ([#5187](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5187)) and lazy-loaded template dependencies to speed up `elizaos create` ([#5214](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5214)).\n-   **Critical Bug Fixes**: Resolved an infinite recursion bug in the JSON sanitizer ([#5152](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5152)) and fixed critical Windows compatibility issues related to project loading ([#5156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5156)) and plugin imports ([#5163](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5163)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\n-   **Ecosystem Growth**: Expanded the registry with four new plugins: `plugin-coconut` ([#175](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/175)), `plugin-jello` ([#176](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/176)), `plugin-jellie` ([#177](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/177)), and the \"kudo\" plugin ([#179](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/179)).\n-   **Stability and Triage**: Confirmed the resolution of several major bugs affecting the ecosystem, including the plugin callback failure ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5017)), issues with Knowledge Management (RAG) ([#5004](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5004)), and the Bedrock integration request ([#5117](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5117)).\n-   **New Feature Planning**: A new request for a customizable root logger ([#5183](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/5183)) was opened and saw immediate, detailed planning for implementation.\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm\n-   **Issue Resolution**: A critical bug preventing transaction callbacks from appearing in user chat was confirmed fixed and closed ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/5017)), restoring essential user feedback.\n-   **Community-Driven Features**: A new issue was opened to explore adding token swap capabilities, potentially using Chainlink CCIP ([#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-evm/issues/20)), signaling community interest in expanding DeFi functionality.\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster\n-   **Code Clarity and Refinement**: Undertook a significant refactoring effort to replace the generic term \"post\" with Farcaster's native term \"cast\" throughout the codebase for better ecosystem alignment ([#3](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/3), [#4](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/4), [#5](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/5)).\n-   **Bug Fixes**: Resolved a bug that prevented settings from being correctly read from `.env` files, unblocking users who rely on this configuration method ([#1](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/issues/1)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge\n-   **Major Feature Release**: Added support for using custom LLM providers for document processing, giving users more flexibility ([#13](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/13)).\n-   **UI Enhancements**: Implemented a new vector search UI in the Knowledge tab, providing a powerful semantic search capability ([#23](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/23)).\n-   **Data Integrity**: Fixed bugs related to non-unique memory IDs ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/17)) and invalid base64 validation ([#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/"

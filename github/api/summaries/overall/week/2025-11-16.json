  "content": "# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Nov 16 - 22, 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis week, the project focused on strengthening its foundations by modernizing core dependencies while actively engaging with our community to address critical feedback and guide future development. Key efforts improved platform stability and made our plugin ecosystem more accessible for developers, reinforcing our commitment to a modular and collaborative framework.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Platform's Foundation**\n*To ensure the long-term stability and maintainability of the ElizaOS framework, we proactively address technical debt and modernize core components.*\n- The core system was migrated away from an outdated and deprecated dependency (`LangChain v0.3`), resolving a significant technical debt item and enhancing the stability of the entire platform ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n\n**Enhancing Developer Experience and Usability**\n*To empower our community to build powerful and adaptable AI agents, we are continuously improving the tools and documentation for our modular architecture.*\n- In the knowledge plugin, we simplified the process of using document context in prompts by making the list of available documents directly accessible as a state value ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge)).\n- We published comprehensive documentation and examples for the text embedding feature in the OpenRouter plugin, making this powerful capability more accessible to all developers ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter)).\n\n**Actively Engaging with Community Feedback**\n*Our progress is driven by open collaboration, and we prioritize responding to user needs to ensure the project evolves in a direction that serves our community.*\n- We began triaging a high-priority user report regarding migration issues, demonstrating our commitment to addressing critical problems quickly ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n- We captured valuable feature requests for new integrations like the DeepSeek API and support for Farcaster/Base applications, which will help inform our future roadmap ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)).\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n\n**Shared Dependencies**\nThe modernization of a core dependency in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) required coordinated updates across plugin starter packages. This foundational work ensures that as the core platform evolves, the entire ecosystem of plugins remains stable and compatible, reflecting our modular design philosophy.\n\n**Community-Driven Integration**\nA community discussion about integrating the DeepSeek API ([#6156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6156)) highlighted the composable nature of our ecosystem. The conversation, spanning both the core [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) and [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge) repositories, pointed to solutions involving `plugin-openrouter`, showcasing how different components of ElizaOS can be combined to extend functionality.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\n- **Modernized Core Dependencies:** Migrated from the deprecated `langchain` v0.3 to `@langchain/textsplitters`, resolving a long-standing stability concern and closing issue [#6145](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6145) via PR [#6152](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6152).\n- **Triaged Critical Community Issues:** Began investigating a high-priority migration issue reported by a user, covering snapshot eligibility and wallet connection problems ([#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158)).\n- **Captured New Feature Requests:** The community proposed several valuable enhancements, including DeepSeek API integration ([#6156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6156)), support for Farcaster and Base ([#6161](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6161)), and a UI improvement for clickable addresses ([#6160](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6160)).\n- **Improved Documentation:** Corrected outdated links in the CLI documentation to improve user experience ([#6050](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6050)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge\n- **Improved Document Accessibility:** Merged a feature that exposes the list of available documents as a state value, making it significantly easier for developers to bind document context into prompts ([#47](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/47)).\n- **Fostered Community Collaboration:** An active discussion on using the Deepseek API ([#6156](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6156)) saw community members guiding a user toward potential solutions using other plugins, demonstrating a healthy, collaborative ecosystem.\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter\n- **Enhanced Text Embedding Documentation:** Formalized the documentation for the `TEXT_EMBEDDING` model type by updating the README with comprehensive details and configuration examples, making the feature fully documented and easier to use ([#19](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/19))."

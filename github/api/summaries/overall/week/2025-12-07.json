  "content": "# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Dec 7 - 13, 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis week, ElizaOS made a significant push toward more responsive, real-time agent interactions by implementing streaming support across the core framework and key model plugins. This foundational work was complemented by major efforts to improve platform stability, enhance security, and expand our ecosystem with new community-contributed plugins for DeFi and communication.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Enabling Real-Time Agent Interactions**\nThis initiative focuses on making agents feel more responsive and conversational by enabling them to process and generate text in a continuous stream.\n-   Work began to add streaming support to the core text generation services in the main [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) framework.\n-   The OpenAI, Anthropic, and OpenRouter plugins were all updated to support this new streaming capability, ensuring a consistent, real-time experience across different models.\n\n**Improving Core Platform Stability and Security**\nTo ensure the long-term health and reliability of our framework, we dedicated significant effort to reducing technical debt and addressing critical bugs.\n-   A major codebase cleanup was performed in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), updating dependencies and fixing build errors to improve stability.\n-   A security vulnerability related to the encryption of character secrets was fixed, strengthening the platform's security posture.\n-   Numerous user interface bugs were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), leading to a smoother and more intuitive user experience.\n\n**Expanding the Plugin Ecosystem through Community Collaboration**\nIn line with our mission of open collaboration, we expanded the platform's capabilities by integrating new tools from our community.\n-   The [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry) was updated to include a new Moralis DeFi plugin, deepening our agents' capabilities within the Web3 ecosystem.\n-   A new OpenChat plugin was also added to the registry, providing agents with another powerful tool for communication tasks.\n\n**Identifying Key Community Needs**\nBy actively monitoring community feedback, we identified important areas for future improvement to better serve our users.\n-   Community reports in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) highlighted a recurring challenge for users with Tangem wallets during the migration process, flagging a key gap to address.\n-   A long-standing issue with the Twitter plugin was confirmed to still be active, providing valuable data to help prioritize a future fix.\n\n### Cross-Repository Coordination\n**Implementing End-to-End Streaming Support**\nA coordinated effort was made this week to enable real-time, responsive interactions between users and AI agents. Work was initiated in the core `eliza` framework to handle streaming text generation, while parallel updates were made in the `plugin-openai`, `plugin-anthropic`, and `plugin-openrouter` repositories. This synchronized work ensures that the new streaming feature will function consistently across multiple foundational models, laying the groundwork for a more dynamic user experience.\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThe core repository saw a major focus on improving codebase health, security, and user experience, alongside initial work on new features.\n-   **Codebase Health:** A series of pull requests were merged to improve stability, including a monorepo-wide dependency update ([#6210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6210)), a large-scale code cleanup and refactor ([#6213](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6213)), and a fix for TypeScript build errors ([#6218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).\n-   **Security:** A critical bug in the character secret encryption process was fixed to ensure correct operation ([#6217](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).\n-   **Feature Development:** Work began on enhancing streaming support for text generation ([#6212](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6212)) and integrating Eliza Cloud services with the CLI ([#6216](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6216)).\n-   **UI/UX Improvements:** Several issues were closed to enhance the user experience, including a documentation site overhaul ([#6128](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6128)), a streamlined \"My Agents\" view ([#6173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6173)), and an \"Unsaved Changes\" warning ([#6183](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6183)).\n-   **Community Feedback:** New issues highlighted migration problems for Tangem wallet users ([#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6211), [#6158](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6158)), and a persistent bug in the Twitter plugin was confirmed ([#39](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/39)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/registry\nThe plugin registry grew this week with two new community-contributed integrations, expanding the capabilities available to all ElizaOS agents.\n-   A Moralis DeFi plugin (`@pyboom/plugin-moralis-v2`) was added to provide agents with Web3 functionalities ([#235](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/235)).\n-   An OpenChat integration plugin (`@tonyflam/plugin-openchat`) was merged, enabling agents to use OpenChat for communication ([#242](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/242)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai\nDevelopment focused on a single, high-impact feature to improve real-time interactions.\n-   A new pull request was opened to introduce streaming support, complete with tests to ensure stability ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic\nWork this week centered on enhancing the plugin's responsiveness.\n-   Streaming support was introduced via a new pull request to enable more dynamic, real-time agent behavior ([#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/12)).\n\n### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter\nThe plugin was updated to align with the project-wide push for streaming and to refine its core focus.\n-   A pull request was opened to add streaming support while simultaneously removing tools support, signaling a strategic simplification of the plugin's features ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/21))."

These foundational improvements focused on enhancing modularity, stability, and the overall developer experience, paving the way for more advanced features and broader community collaboration.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Strengthening the Core Framework for Future Growth**\nTo support our long-term vision of a modular and scalable AI framework, we invested heavily in reorganizing the foundational code to make the system more robust and easier to build upon.\n- The core API was restructured into a more logical, domain-based system, improving maintainability and clarity for developers working with our services in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n- We re-architected the database layer to support dynamic table loading and migrations, making our data handling more flexible and scalable in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n- Core system types and services were refactored into smaller, more manageable modules, which improves code organization and enhances our agents' ability to search and understand the codebase in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n\n**Enhancing Developer Experience and API Usability**\nTo accelerate development and make our platform more accessible, we delivered major improvements to our tools and documentation.\n- A comprehensive Postman collection with over 90 documented REST API endpoints was released, making it significantly easier for developers to understand and integrate with the platform in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n- The command-line interface (CLI) was modernized with a more intuitive and user-friendly prompt system, improving the developer workflow in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n- Development and CI environments were optimized for faster project creation by implementing Bun's offline mode, reducing setup times for contributors in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n\n**Improving Stability and User Interaction**\nWe focused on resolving critical bugs and polishing the user interface to create a more reliable and engaging experience for both agents and human users.\n- Version 1.0.9 was released, incorporating numerous fixes that deliver substantial improvements to platform stability and performance in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n- Key bugs in agent communication were resolved, ensuring agents are correctly recognized as channel participants and can interact reliably in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n- The chat UI was enhanced with animated markdown rendering and improved styling for code blocks, creating a more polished and readable user experience in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).\n\n## Repository Spotlights\n\n### elizaos/eliza\nThis week's work focused on a major architectural refactor to improve modularity, developer experience, and overall stability, culminating in the v1.0.9 release.\n\n**Key Enhancements:**\n- **Architectural Overhaul**: Completed a major refactoring of the type system ([#4999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4999), [#5020](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5020)), API routes ([#5010](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5010)), and CLI commands ([#5036](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5036)) into a more modular and maintainable structure.\n- **Database Improvements**: Rebuilt the SQL plugin with migration capabilities ([#5092](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5092)) and implemented dynamic loading for database tables ([#5018](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5018)).\n- **API and Developer Tooling**: Released a comprehensive Postman collection with 90+ endpoints ([#5047](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5047)) and upgraded the CLI to use `@clack/prompts` for a better user experience ([#5016](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5016)).\n- **UI/UX Polish**: Enhanced the chat UI with an animated markdown component ([#5111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5111)) and improved code block styling ([#5105](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5105)).\n- **Real-time Communication**: Implemented real-time message deletion via SocketIO ([#4968](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4968)) and added API endpoints to manage agents across channels ([#5113](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5113)).\n\n**Notable Resolved Issues:**\n- Fixed a critical issue preventing agents from being recognized as channel participants ([#4972](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4972)).\n- Resolved errors related to GPT-4o model access ([#5023](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5023)) and the inability to load custom agent characters after upgrades ([#5039](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5039)).\n- Addressed UI bugs where inactive agents showed as active ([#4929](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4929)) and page refreshes caused errors ([#4927](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4927))."

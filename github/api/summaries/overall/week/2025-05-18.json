  "content": "# Overall Project Weekly Summary (May 18 - 24, 2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis week, ElizaOS took a major leap forward by significantly enhancing agent intelligence and user interaction. We introduced a powerful new knowledge system that allows agents to learn from PDF documents and rolled out comprehensive support for image and video chat, making the platform more capable and engaging for all users.\n\n### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes\n\n**Making Agents Smarter and More Knowledgeable**\n*To advance our goal of agent autonomy, we are giving agents more powerful ways to ingest and reason about external information.*\n-   Our knowledge management system was refactored into a dedicated plugin, making it more modular and easier to extend in the future. ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza))\n-   Agents can now learn directly from PDF documents, expanding their ability to work with diverse, real-world knowledge sources. ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza))\n-   A new service registry was introduced, allowing plugins to communicate more effectively and paving the way for more complex, collaborative agent behaviors. ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza))\n\n**Creating a Richer, More Interactive User Experience**\n*We are focused on building an intuitive and powerful interface that allows users to collaborate with agents on complex, multi-modal tasks.*\n-   Launched full support for images and video in chat, enabling agents to see, process, and discuss visual information for the first time. ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza))\n-   Implemented real-time log streaming to give users instant feedback on agent activity, with a smart fallback system for improved reliability. ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza))\n-   Improved the user interface for managing chat history and agent memory, making the platform easier to navigate and control. ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza))\n\n**Strengthening the Foundation for Developers and Future Growth**\n*A robust and scalable infrastructure is critical for supporting our growing community and enabling future innovation.*\n-   Streamlined the developer workflow by improving how environment configurations are handled and enhancing the plugin publishing process. ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza))\n-   Expanded our continuous integration pipeline to support mobile platforms, laying the groundwork for bringing ElizaOS to more devices. ([elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza))\n-   Enhanced the core database and API systems to support new features like chat rooms and improve overall performance.

On January 11, 2026, ElizaOS saw significant infrastructure improvements with critical dependency updates for GitHub Actions and core packages in `elizaos.github.io`, enhancing stability and security. Concurrently, the `eliza` repository focused on performance and database optimizations, UI/UX refinements, and introduced new documentation and a plugin for x402 micropayments. The project also closed several long-standing issues across both repositories, streamlining development efforts.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Infrastructure & Dependency Updates
*   **GitHub Actions Workflow Updates:** Critical GitHub Actions dependencies were bumped to their latest versions, including `actions/configure-pages` from 4 to 5 ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#191](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/191)), `actions/checkout` from 4 to 6 ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#190](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/190)), and `actions/upload-pages-artifact` from 3 to 4 ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#189](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/189)). These updates enhance the stability and security of the deployment and testing workflows.
*   **Core Package Dependency Bumps:** The `minor-and-patch` group of dependencies saw significant updates, including `drizzle-orm` from `0.41.0` to `0.45.1` and `lucide-react` among others, across the project's root directory ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#201](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/201)). This ensures the project leverages the latest features and bug fixes from its core libraries.

### Performance and Database Optimization
*   **Runtime Optimization:** Optimized runtime initialization by adding missing checks and removing redundant lookups, and explored parallelization for independent operations ([elizaos/eliza#6334](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6334)).
*   **Database Query Patterns:** Implemented UPSERT patterns for database queries, replacing check-then-insert with `onConflictDoNothing()` and optimizing `getEntitiesByIds()` to avoid cartesian products ([elizaos/eliza#6335](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6335)).

### UI/UX and Content Refinements
*   **UI Element Standardization:** Standardized the size of certain UI elements ([elizaos/eliza#6344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6344)).
*   **Web Search Functionality:** Resolved intermittent web search functionality problems ([elizaos/eliza#6345](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6345)).
*   **Agent Name Capitalization:** Implemented default capitalization for agent names in the mobile agent builder ([elizaos/eliza#6346](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6346)).
*   **New Copy for Agent Sections:** Introduced new copy for both the agent edit ([elizaos/eliza#6347](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6347)) and agent builder ([elizaos/eliza#6348](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6348)) sections.

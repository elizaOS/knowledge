On Jan 11, 2026, ElizaOS saw significant progress in project stability and core development, with critical GitHub Actions and Drizzle ORM dependencies updated in `elizaos.github.io`, alongside the closure of several deployment and rate limit issues. Concurrently, the `eliza` repository focused on performance and database optimizations, UI/UX improvements, and initiated new work on core documentation and x402 micropayment integration.

## ✅ Completed Work

### Dependency & CI/CD Updates
*   **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**: Updated critical GitHub Actions dependencies (`actions/configure-pages` from v4 to v5, `actions/checkout` from v4 to v6, `actions/upload-pages-artifact` from v3 to v4) to enhance CI/CD reliability and security ([#191](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/191), [#190](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos/pull/190), [#189](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/189)).
*   **elizaos/elizaos.github.io**: Upgraded core dependencies, including `drizzle-orm` from `0.41.0` to `0.45.1` and `lucide-react`, improving project stability and compatibility ([#201](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/201)).

### Performance & Database Optimization
*   **elizaos/eliza**: Optimized runtime initialization by adding missing checks and removing redundant lookups, and explored parallelization of independent operations ([#6334](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6334)).
*   **elizaos/eliza**: Implemented UPSERT patterns for database queries, replacing check-then-insert operations with `onConflictDoNothing()`, and optimized `getEntitiesByIds()` to prevent cartesian products ([#6335](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6335)).

### UI/UX & Content Improvements
*   **elizaos/eliza**: Standardized the size of display boxes ([#6344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6344)).
*   **elizaos/eliza**: Resolved intermittent web search functionality problems ([#6345](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6345)).
*   **elizaos/eliza**: Implemented changes to the agent builder on mobile to default agent names to start with a capital letter ([#6346](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6346)).
*   **elizaos/eliza**: Updated textual content for the agent edit interface ([#6347](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6347)) and the agent builder interface ([#6348](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6348)).

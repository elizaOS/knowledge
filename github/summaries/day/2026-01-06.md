Today, the project saw a significant focus on identifying and documenting critical issues across several repositories, including a "Model not found" error impacting API usage in `elizaos/eliza`, a publishing error in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord`, and a `TypeError` in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram` related to image processing. Additionally, new documentation efforts have begun for configuring agent memory in `elizaos/docs`.

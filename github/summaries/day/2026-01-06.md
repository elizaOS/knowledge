On Jan 6, 2026, the ElizaOS project saw significant activity in identifying critical bugs across several repositories, including a publishing failure in the Discord plugin, an image processing crash in the Telegram plugin, and "Model not found" errors in the core Eliza agent. Documentation efforts began for agent memory configuration, while a performance concern regarding excessive memory consumption by the Turbo build tool was also raised.

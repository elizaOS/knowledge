# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining core agent functionalities, streamlining the CLI by removing Claude dependencies, and addressing several documentation and release process issues.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Agent Runtime Enhancements
The agent runtime received updates to improve action result accessibility and thought processing. A new public method was added to `IAgentRuntime` to allow plugins to access action results, enhancing plugin capabilities. Additionally, the computation of 'thought' for action events was optimized to ensure its availability for all action runs.
- feat: add get action results ([#6081](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6081))
- fix: action thought ([#6084](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6084))

### CLI Streamlining and Dependency Reduction
The CLI underwent significant changes with the removal of Anthropic Claude Code dependencies and AI-powered plugin generation/upgrade functionalities. This change aims to reduce the CLI's footprint and simplify its architecture.
- feat: remove claude code / upgrade / plugin gen from CLI ([#6087](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6087))

### API Client Type Refinement
The `Agent.description` field in API client types was replaced with `bio` (string | string[]), aligning with a more consistent naming convention across the platform.
- chore(types): replace Agent.description with bio ([#6085](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6085))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### The documentation for plugins isn't correct. ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6070))
The discussion on this issue highlights significant frustration from users regarding the plugin documentation and scaffolding process. Initial reports indicated that following the documentation led to errors, with one user expressing extreme dissatisfaction and switching to another framework. A core contributor, yungalgo, engaged with the user, offering to understand the specific challenges faced. Claude AI was used to identify and fix the root causes, which included incorrect CLI command syntax in documentation (`-t` instead of `--type`) and issues with template lookup paths during scaffolding. The fixes involved adding fallback paths for templates and correcting CLI syntax across multiple README files. The issue was closed after Claude's intervention, with the fixes aimed at resolving the reported plugin scaffolding errors.

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW
Today, ElizaOS focused on refining core functionalities, streamlining the CLI by removing Claude dependencies, and addressing several documentation-related issues.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Runtime Enhancements
The core runtime received updates to improve agent interaction and data access. A new feature was added to allow plugins to access action results, enhancing their capabilities [#6081](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6081). Additionally, a bug was fixed to ensure that the `thought` property is consistently computed and included in `ACTION_STARTED/COMPLETED` events [#6084](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6084).

### CLI Streamlining and Dependency Reduction
The CLI underwent significant changes to remove Anthropic Claude Code dependencies and associated AI-powered plugin generation and upgrade functionalities [#6087](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6087). This aims to reduce the CLI's footprint and simplify its architecture.

### Agent Type Definition Refinement
The `Agent.description` field in API client types was replaced with `bio` (string | string[]), aligning with a more descriptive agent profile. This change will be followed by updates to tests and existing usages [#6085](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6085).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Comprehensive Documentation Overhaul
Several issues related to documentation were closed, indicating a significant effort to improve the clarity and completeness of ElizaOS's guides and references. This includes expanding core documentation [#5938](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5938), improving developer guides [#5939](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5939), and enhancing learning aids and discovery mechanisms [#5940](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5940).

### Release Process and Automation Improvements
Work on refining the release process and automation was completed. This involved improving the overall documentation and release process [#5936](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5936) and implementing release automation steps [#5937](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5937).

### Miscellaneous Documentation and Analysis
Other closed issues include integrating the `build.eliza` page into the main documentation [#5974](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5974) and completing a SWOT analysis for agents [#6018](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6018).

## NEW ISSUES

### CLI Installation and Dependency Problems
A critical issue was reported regarding the CLI's inability to find the `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` module after installation, despite it being listed as a dependency [#6088](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6088). This points to a potential bundling or packaging problem.

### Documentation and Navigation Enhancements
Several new issues focus on improving the ElizaOS documentation and user interface. These include requests for updates to the left menu items [#6086](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6086), adding Discord and Farcaster buttons to the navigation [#6089](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6089), and creating a dedicated API/SDK section in the documentation [#6090](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6090).

### Brand Kit and Developer Tools
Other new issues involve updating the Brandkit on GitHub to ensure it's in sync with the latest version [#6091](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6091) and exploring the concept of an ElizaOS DevTools MCP Server for various developer utilities [#6092](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6092).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Plugin Documentation and Scaffolding Challenges [#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6070)
The discussion on this issue highlights significant frustration from a user regarding the plugin documentation and scaffolding process. The user, @ryanmstokes, reported spending a week trying to get the framework to work, encountering "endless issues in almost every feature," and ultimately moving to another framework due to the poor documentation. @yungalgo acknowledged the frustration and offered to connect to understand the specific difficulties, noting that open-source projects can have temporary discrepancies between codebase and documentation. Claude AI was used to address the issue, identifying and fixing template path issues and incorrect CLI command syntax in multiple README files. The fixes included adding fallback paths for templates and correcting `elizaos create -t` to `elizaos create --type`. @yungalgo thanked @ryanmstokes for the feedback, and @ryanmstokes committed to providing detailed feedback on the challenges faced.

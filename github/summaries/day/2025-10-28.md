# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 28, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a critical bug fix addressing the merging of `.env` variables with character settings, ensuring proper configuration and preventing data loss. This enhancement improves the robustness of the ElizaOS core.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Configuration Merging Bug Fix
A significant bug was resolved that previously caused `.env` variables to be ignored when `character.settings.secrets` existed. This fix ensures that global `.env` configurations are correctly merged with character-specific overrides, preventing data loss and improving configuration reliability.

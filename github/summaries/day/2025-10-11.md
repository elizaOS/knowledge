# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, primarily addressing database foreign key violations and refining the e2e test infrastructure. These efforts enhance the stability and reliability of the ElizaOS server and testing suite.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Server Stability and Database Integrity
A significant bug fix was implemented to prevent foreign key violation errors when starting agents in PostgreSQL environments. This ensures that agent records exist in the database before any foreign key references are created, improving the robustness of the server's database interactions. ([#6059](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6059))

### E2E Test Infrastructure Refinement
The end-to-end test runner was updated to remove outdated `AgentManager` references. All usages of `AgentManager` have been replaced with `AgentServer`'s built-in `startAgents` method, streamlining the testing process and aligning it with current architectural changes. ([#6056](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6056))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **CLI Simplification**: A new pull request aims to simplify the CLI by leveraging the server and core components, potentially streamlining command-line operations. ([#6060](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6060))

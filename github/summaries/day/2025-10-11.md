# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, primarily addressing database integrity issues in the server and refining the e2e test infrastructure. A new feature request for CometAPI support was also opened.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Server Stability and Database Integrity
Efforts were made to enhance server stability by resolving a foreign key violation error in PostgreSQL environments. This fix ensures that agent records exist in the database before creating foreign key references, preventing startup issues. ([#6059](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6059))

### E2E Test Infrastructure Refinement
The end-to-end test runner was updated to remove outdated `AgentManager` references. This involved replacing all `AgentManager` usages with `AgentServer`'s built-in `startAgents` method, streamlining the testing process. ([#6056](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6056))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#6060](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6060), was opened to simplify the CLI by leveraging the server and core components.

## CLOSED ISSUES

## NEW ISSUES
### Feature Request: Unified LLM API Support
A new feature request, [#6055](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6055), was opened to add CometAPI support to ElizaOS. This aims to provide a unified API for accessing various LLM providers, building upon existing support for OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, Llama, and Grok.

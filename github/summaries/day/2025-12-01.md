# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Dec 1, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant code refactoring in the server for optimization and reorganization, alongside crucial bug fixes to improve markdown rendering in the client UI.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Server Optimization and Reorganization
A major refactoring effort was completed in the server, focusing on optimization and reorganization of the codebase. This involved changes across numerous files, including API endpoints, services, and utilities, with a low to medium risk due to potential Socket.IO configuration impacts and import path changes, all of which were tested and verified. ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199))

### Client Markdown Spacing Improvements
Two bug fixes were implemented to address markdown content spacing issues in the client. These changes aim to improve the visual consistency of AI-generated responses by fixing excessive vertical spacing and refining heading, separator, and blockquote spacing. ([#6159](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6159), [#6197](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6197))

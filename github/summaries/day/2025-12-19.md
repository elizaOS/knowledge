## CLOSED ISSUES

### UI/UX and Performance Enhancements
Several issues related to user interface and performance were resolved. This includes optimizing the Agent Builder model selection for faster initial configuration ([#6185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6185)), fixing slow image loading in the gallery ([#6255](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6255)), and addressing various layout and display inconsistencies on pages like "voices" ([#6252](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6252)). Other fixes include removing redundant headers ([#6251](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6251)), smoothing login transitions ([#6253](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6253)), and correcting sidebar hover effects ([#6254](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6254)).

### Agent Builder and Content Rendering Improvements
Improvements were made to the Agent Builder experience, including renaming the chat assistant to "Agent Builder" for clarity ([#6258](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6258)) and allowing JSON export without requiring deployment ([#6259](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6259)). Additionally, a fix was implemented for markdown bullet point rendering in the agent builder chat ([#6257](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6257)).

### Authentication and Navigation Fixes
Issues related to authentication and navigation were addressed, specifically reducing redundant Privy re-authentication calls ([#6249](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6249)) and fixing gallery tab refresh behavior to enable client-side navigation ([#6256](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6256)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### JSON API Endpoints for Summaries
Discussion on [#185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/185) focused on extending the static JSON API to include summary endpoints. The refined approach, based on data engineering review, proposes generating JSON alongside markdown during the `summarize` command, rather than a separate export step. Key design decisions include generating full exports due to manageable volume, keeping `export-summaries` as a backfill tool, and enhancing the response shape with versioning, content hashing, and source last updated timestamps. The plan outlines specific dated and latest pointer endpoints, as well as index files. Implementation changes will involve modifying existing summary generation scripts to write JSON and adding shared utilities for hashing, response building, and updating latest/index pointers. This approach aims for better synchronization, no extra workflow steps, efficient client-side caching, and an upgrade path for incremental exports. The issue was subsequently merged.

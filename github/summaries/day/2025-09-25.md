## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Four new pull requests were opened today, primarily focusing on core refactoring and documentation.
- **Core Runtime Refinements:** Two pull requests, [#6004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6004) and [#6001](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6001), aim to make runtime initialization idempotent and enhance service registration coordination.

- **Documentation Fix:** A minor documentation typo fix is addressed in [#6000](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6000).

## CLOSED ISSUES

Two issues were closed today, addressing CLI refactoring and Zod v4 loading problems.
- **CLI Refactoring Completed:** The extensive refactoring of the Eliza CLI, aimed at simplifying its structure and delegating logic to project directories, has been closed [#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860). This involved defining clear responsibilities for the server package, CLI, and starter projects, and restructuring the project starter.
- **Zod v4 Loading Issue Resolved:** The problem with Zod v4 not loading in version 1.5.10, which caused several plugins to fail, has been closed [#5995](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5995). The issue was resolved by manually adding `zod` via `bun add zod`.

## NEW ISSUES

Two new issues were reported today, highlighting unhandled exceptions and a dependency migration task.
- **Unhandled Exception in Runtime:** A new issue [#6003](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6003) reports an unhandled exception when `getAgents()` fails in `runtime.ts`, specifically if the agents table does not exist.
- **Zod v4 Migration Task:** Issue [#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999) outlines the need to migrate the Eliza monorepo and all plugins from Zod v3 to Zod v4, noting that some PRs have already been initiated for dependency bumps.

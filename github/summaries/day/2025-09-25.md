## CLOSED ISSUES

### CLI Refactoring and Simplification
The issue concerning the refactoring of the Eliza CLI was closed. The discussion highlighted the need to simplify the CLI by delegating logic to project directories and streamlining its role to configuration and execution. The proposed solution involves a clear distinction of responsibilities between the server package, CLI, and starter projects.

### Dependency Migration and Plugin Compatibility
An issue related to `zod/v4` not loading and causing several plugins to fail was closed. The problem was resolved by manually adding `zod` using `bun add zod`, indicating a dependency management issue that was temporarily fixed.
- [#5995](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5995)

## NEW ISSUES

### Unhandled Exceptions in Runtime Initialization
A new issue was reported regarding unhandled exceptions when `getAgents()` fails in `runtime.ts`, specifically if the agents table is missing. This indicates a potential robustness issue during `AgentRuntime` initialization.
- [#6003](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6003)

### Zod v4 Migration Across Monorepo
A new issue was opened to track the migration of all dependencies and plugins within the Eliza monorepo from Zod v3 to Zod v4. This is a significant undertaking, with initial steps already taken to update dependencies in various plugins.
- [#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)

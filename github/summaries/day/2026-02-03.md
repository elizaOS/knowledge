On Feb 3, 2026, the ElizaOS project saw significant activity in the `plugin-n8n-workflow` repository with enhancements to workflow control and cloud compatibility, alongside a new release preparation and numerous new issues opened in the `eliza` core repository covering performance, authentication, and a new plugin proposal. The `elizaos.github.io` repository had no development activity.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Workflow Control and Reliability Enhancements
*   **Enhanced Workflow Control for Multi-Step Operations**: A new `awaitingUserInput` flag was introduced to allow multi-step loops to pause for user confirmation, preventing auto-confirmation for complex workflows in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow#13](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/13).
*   **Improved Cloud Compatibility and Context Handling**: Critical fixes were implemented to ensure correct plugin functionality in cloud environments, including updating `buildConversationContext` and removing an unused `runtime` parameter in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow#12](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/12).
*   **Accurate Action Status Reporting**: All action callbacks now explicitly include a `success: true/false` status, resolving a bug where failed actions appeared successful in the cloud UI in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow#11](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow/pull/11).

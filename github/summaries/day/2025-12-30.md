On December 30, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in core logging and agent interaction fixes within the `elizaos/eliza` repository, alongside the introduction of new features like unified hooks with multi-transport support. Additionally, the `elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai` repository began implementing image description fixes and caching for audio and image handlers.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core System Stability & Logging
*   Resolved a critical bug in `elizaos/eliza` where streaming LLM calls were not being logged to the database, ensuring all model interactions are now properly recorded. ([elizaos/eliza#6296](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6296))

### User Interface & Agent Experience Improvements
*   Fixed an issue in `elizaos/eliza` where agent cards were not resizing correctly to match dashboard agent cards. ([elizaos/eliza#6291](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6291))
*   Corrected the behavior in `elizaos/eliza` where clicking on an agent with existing conversations would start a new chat instead of opening the existing one. ([elizaos/eliza#6295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6295))

### Documentation & Code Quality
*   Addressed spacing issues in numbered items within `elizaos/eliza`. ([elizaos/eliza#6283](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6283))
*   Completed fixes for monorepo documentation in `elizaos/eliza`. ([elizaos/eliza#6284](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6284))

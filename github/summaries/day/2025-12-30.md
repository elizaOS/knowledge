On December 30, 2025, ElizaOS saw significant progress in core runtime stability with a critical fix for LLM call logging in `elizaos/eliza`, alongside new feature development including unified hooks for multi-transport support and image description fixes with caching in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai`. The day also included several UI/UX improvements and documentation updates, while new issues highlighted architectural concerns in the messaging API and general application polish.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core Runtime Stability & Logging
*   Fixed a critical bug in `elizaos/eliza` where streaming LLM calls were not being logged to the database due to incorrect code placement, ensuring all LLM calls are now properly recorded ([elizaos/eliza#6296](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6296)).

### UI/UX Improvements & Documentation
*   Resolved issues related to spacing in numbered items in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#6283](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6283)).
*   Addressed an issue in `elizaos/eliza` where agent cards were not resizing to match dashboard agent cards ([elizaos/eliza#6291](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6291)).
*   Fixed the behavior in `elizaos/eliza` where clicking an agent always led to a brand new chat instead of an existing conversation if one existed ([elizaos/eliza#6295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6295)).
*   Fixed and updated documentation for the monorepo in `elizaos/eliza` ([elizaos/eliza#6284](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6284)).

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 9, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, ElizaOS focused on enhancing user experience with a modernized README and improved client-side navigation. Several long-standing issues related to plugin schema migrations and publishing were resolved, while a significant number of new issues were opened to outline future development, particularly around core API redesign, message bus simplification, and frontend integration.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Enhanced User Experience & Client Navigation**
    *   The `README.md` was modernized with a better structure and quick start guide, improving the initial experience for new users ([#5896](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5896)).
    *   URL synchronization was added for DM channel switching and direct navigation in the client, allowing users to bookmark and share specific conversation links ([#5941](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5941)).
    *   A bug was fixed in the client to remove a redundant `navigate()` call in the force new chat flow, resolving URL inconsistency issues ([#5945](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5945)).

*   **Prompt and Action Refinements**
    *   Action names were corrected and prompts improved for multi-step processes, affecting `packages/core/src/prompts.ts` and `packages/plugin-bootstrap/src/index.ts` ([#5942](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5942)).

## NEW ISSUES

*   **Core API and Runtime Refactoring**
    *   Plans for establishing `ElizaOS` as the single programmatic entry point, including lifecycle methods and bulk operations for agents, were outlined ([#5905](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5905), [#5906](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5906)).
    *   Issues were created for core cleanup, including auditing type definitions, removing legacy code, and unifying plugin loading ([#5911](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5911)).
    *   Simplification of runtime internals and programmatic state access were proposed ([#5910](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5910)).
    *   New issues address project management, runtime access, introspection, observability, resilience, and testing for core functionalities ([#5912](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5912), [#5913](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5913), [#5914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5914), [#5915](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5915)).

*   **Message Bus and Agent Interaction Redesign**
    *   A major redesign of the message bus was proposed, aiming for a cleaner, class-based API with chat-server-like semantics (rooms, direct messages) and optionality for single-agent setups ([#5916](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5916), [#5917](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5917)).
    *   New features for the message bus include message filtering, replay/recovery, backpressure, rate limiting, and metrics ([#5918](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5918)).
    *   Modernization efforts include replacing Node EventEmitter with Bunâ€™s EventTarget ([#5919](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5919)).
    *   Integration and migration plans for the new message bus, along with testing and validation, were outlined ([#5920](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5920), [#5921](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5921)).
    *   Simplified agent interaction through direct API calls (`agent.generate(input)`) and variants were proposed ([#5922](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5922), [#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5923)).

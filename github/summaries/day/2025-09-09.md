# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 9, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in client-side features with URL synchronization for DM channels and a fix for chat navigation. Documentation was improved with a modernized README, and several core issues were closed. A large number of new issues were opened, focusing on core API redesign, developer experience, and documentation.

## NEW ISSUES

### Core API and Runtime Refinement
- Proposed establishing `ElizaOS` as the single programmatic entry point, defining its lifecycle methods, and implementing bulk operations for agents ([#5905](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5905), [#5906](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5906)).
- Focused on cleaning up runtime internals, making state programmatically accessible, auditing type definitions, and removing legacy code paths ([#5910](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5910), [#5911](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5911)).
- Addressed project management with `ElizaOS.loadProject(data)` for editable projects and replacing CLI loaders with explicit programmatic loading ([#5912](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5912)).
- Introduced issues for runtime access and introspection, including a read-only runtime accessor, hot-reload capabilities, and introspection tools ([#5913](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5913)).
- Highlighted the need for observability and resilience through metrics hooks and standardized error surfaces ([#5914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5914)).
- Focused on testing and verification, including integration tests for initialization, reloads, and propagation of edits ([#5915](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5915)).

### Message Bus and Agent Interaction Redesign
- Proposed simplifying the message bus with a clean, optional, class-based API, defining new `MessageBus` class methods, and implementing chat-server-like semantics ([#5916](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5916), [#5917](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5917)).
- Addressed features and resilience for the message bus, including message filtering, replay/recovery, backpressure, and rate limiting ([#5918](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5918)).
- Suggested modernizing the message bus by replacing Node EventEmitter with Bunâ€™s EventTarget ([#5919](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5919)).
- Focused on integration and migration, including refactoring existing bus code, ensuring plugin compatibility, and writing a migration guide ([#5920](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5920)).
- Emphasized testing and validation for multi-agent messaging flows, SSE streaming, and recovery scenarios ([#5921](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5921)).
- Aimed to simplify agent interaction by exposing direct APIs for agents (e.g., `agent.generate(input)`) without requiring listeners ([#5922](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5922), [#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5923)).

### Developer Experience and Frontend Integration
- Focused on advanced output and flows, including structured return types, streaming responses, and multi-turn sessions ([#5924](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5924)).
- Addressed error handling and debugging with timeout/retry patterns, debug mode logging, and performance benchmarks ([#5925](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5925)).
- Proposed improvements to developer experience through serverless script examples, migration docs, and direct integration of agent output into workflows ([#5926](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5926)).
- Focused on frontend integration with hooks and SSE, including `useEliza` and `useElizaChat` hooks, agent lifecycle management, and a mock client for testing ([#5927](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5927), [#5928](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5928), [#5929](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5929)).

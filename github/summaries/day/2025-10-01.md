# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 1, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on essential maintenance and quality improvements, including a significant dependency update, critical bug fixes for plugin functionality, and code formatting standardization. Obsolete development files were also removed, streamlining the repository.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Dependency and Tooling Updates
A major update was performed to bump various dependencies across the project, including TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, Puppeteer, dotenv, langchain, uuid, and Sentry, ensuring the project leverages the latest features and security patches. ([#6025](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6025))

### Plugin Functionality Restoration and Fixes
A critical bug was fixed in the bootstrap plugin, restoring the `shouldRespondProvider` registration and export, which was accidentally removed. This ensures the correct `shouldRespond` logic in the plugin. ([#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024))

### Code Quality and Formatting Standardization
Code formatting was standardized across the codebase, primarily by converting double quotes to single quotes in CLI and client files. This also included a fix for a `const` declaration. ([#6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027))

### Repository Cleanup
Obsolete Docker and devcontainer files, including `Dockerfile.docs` and `docker-compose-docs.yaml`, were removed, streamlining the repository and removing unneeded configurations. ([#6026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6026))

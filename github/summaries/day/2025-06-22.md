## ACTIVE ISSUES

### API Endpoint Not Found Error Investigation
Issue [#5230](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5230) reports "API endpoint not found" errors across most endpoints, with only the agents endpoint working. Initial analysis by ChristopherTrimboli on June 22nd suggested that the API documentation had been fully updated to the latest 1.0.10 APIs, implying the issue might be related to outdated documentation rather than missing endpoints. However, on July 3rd, iQiexie commented that the documentation still doesn't represent the actual API, citing missing parameters in error responses for the `submit-message` endpoint and a non-existent `send-message` endpoint. Most recently, on July 13th, Claude provided a comprehensive analysis, concluding that the API implementation is fully functional and the reported 404 errors are likely due to deployment or configuration issues, not missing endpoints. Claude verified that all documented endpoints are properly implemented and suggested potential root causes such as server initialization issues, environment configuration, port/network problems, or database issues. Diagnostic steps and recommendations were provided to help resolve the environmental factors.

On December 16, 2025, the ElizaOS project significantly expanded its plugin ecosystem with a new self-hosted Farcaster plugin, enabling local Snapchain/Hubble hub integration. Concurrently, efforts were made to refine the user experience within the `eliza` application, particularly concerning plugin selection and the initial stages of agent creation and knowledge integration. Discussions also began on incorporating web search capabilities, indicating a focus on both backend extensibility and frontend usability.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Plugin Ecosystem Expansion
- A new self-hosted Farcaster plugin (`plugin-farcaster-local-hub`) was introduced to the registry, allowing for local Snapchain/Hubble hub integration without external API dependencies and including fixes for Farcaster timestamp epoch and Hub API parameters. ([elizaos-plugins/registry#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243))

### UI/UX Enhancements for Plugin Selection
- Improvements were made to the visual feedback for plugin selection, transitioning to a more prominent full background color change, and refining the interaction with a toggle selection mechanism.

Today's development focused on enhancing API client capabilities with a new type-safe package, alongside critical bug fixes for testing infrastructure and documentation. Significant refactoring of CLI packages also contributed to a more streamlined codebase.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Enhanced API Client with Type Safety:** A new `@elizaos/api-client` package was introduced, providing a comprehensive, type-safe client for the ElizaOS server API. This includes full TypeScript support and a clean, service-based architecture for various API endpoints, significantly improving developer experience and reducing potential errors.

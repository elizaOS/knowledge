# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing scenario testing capabilities with new evaluators for LLM interactions and significant progress in mocking and plugin management. Several key issues related to scenario testing and dynamic plugin loading were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Scenario Testing Enhancements
The team introduced several new evaluators to provide more comprehensive metrics for LLM calls within scenarios. These include evaluators for token counts, execution time, and estimated cost, allowing for more precise performance and efficiency analysis. ([#5758](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5758), [#5757](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5757), [#5759](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5759))

### Advanced Mocking and Plugin Management
Significant strides were made in implementing conditional mocking and complex response structures, enabling more realistic and flexible testing environments. Concurrently, the dynamic loading of plugins was advanced, allowing scenarios to declare and manage required plugins more effectively. ([#5726](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5726), [#5725](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5725))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#5762](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5762): This pull request updates the checkout action to v5, likely for CI/CD pipeline improvements.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Enhanced Scenario Testing Capabilities
The issue of implementing natural language agent interaction and response validation ([#5727](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5727)) was closed. This feature enables scenarios to test agent behavior through natural language, moving beyond direct code execution. The implementation was complete but initially blocked by a plugin loading issue, which has now been resolved.

### Improved Plugin and Mocking Systems
The team successfully closed issues related to implementing plugin specification and dynamic loading ([#5725](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5725)) and conditional mocking with complex response structures ([#5726](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5726)). The plugin loading now supports dynamic parsing and validation, while the mocking system can handle conditional responses and intricate data structures, significantly improving testing flexibility.

## NEW ISSUES

### New Scenario Evaluators Proposed
Several new feature requests were opened to introduce advanced evaluators for scenario testing. These include:
- [#5758](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5758): Add a Token Count Evaluator to assert on input/output/total token counts for LLM calls.
- [#5757](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5757): Add an Execution Time Evaluator to measure and assert per-step execution duration.
- [#5759](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5759): Introduce a Cost Evaluator to assert the estimated dollar cost of LLM usage per step.
- [#5760](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5760): Add a Consistency Evaluator to run the same step multiple times and assert consistency over a chosen metric.
- [#5761](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5761): Add a Step Count Evaluator to assert on the number of agent/tool/action steps taken to complete a scenario step.

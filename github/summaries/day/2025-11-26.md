Overall Project Summary:
Today's development saw a significant, project-wide initiative to implement structured logging across several `elizaos-plugins` repositories, including `plugin-knowledge`, `plugin-telegram`, `plugin-openrouter`, and `plugin-discord`. Concurrently, the core `elizaos/eliza` repository addressed a critical TypeScript declaration bug and saw a substantial influx of new issues focused on UI/UX improvements, agent builder optimizations, and new feature proposals like crypto payments and an affiliate system.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core System Stability
*   **elizaos/eliza**: A critical TypeScript declaration build failure related to `instanceof` checks on generic types was resolved by adding a new `isPlainObject` type guard and replacing manual `instanceof` checks in `runtime.ts` to improve type safety and build stability ([elizaos/eliza#6170](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6170)).

### Codebase Hygiene and Maintainability
*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord**: Dead/commented code was removed and clarifying comments were added around interaction handling and channel ID notes in the Discord service, improving maintainability without introducing functional changes ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord#28](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/28)).

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a critical bug fix in the core TypeScript declarations, resolving an `instanceof` error. Additionally, a significant number of new issues were opened, primarily addressing UI/UX improvements, agent builder optimizations, and new feature implementations.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Type-Guard Enhancement
A critical TypeScript declaration build failure related to `instanceof` checks on generic types was resolved. This involved adding a new `isPlainObject` type guard and replacing manual `instanceof` checks in `runtime.ts` to improve type safety and build stability. ([#6170](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6170))

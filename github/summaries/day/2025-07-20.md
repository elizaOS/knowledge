# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on a critical bug fix in the `@elizaos/config` package, ensuring proper plugin functionality. Additionally, two new issues were opened, proposing enhancements to the LLM Judge and the migration of documentation to the monorepo setup.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Bug Fixes and Package Export
A significant bug was addressed in the `@elizaos/config` package. This fix resolves an issue where plugins relying on this package would fail due to incorrect file exports, specifically when files were located in the `src` directory and not properly included in the npm package export. This ensures the stability and functionality of plugins. ([#5635](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5635))

## NEW ISSUES

### LLM Judge Enhancements
A new feature request was opened to enhance the `llm_judge` evaluator. The current binary `PASS`/`FAIL` outcome is proposed to be expanded to include multi-level evaluation, allowing for more nuanced assessment of Large Language Model (LLM) responses. ([#5637](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5637))

### Documentation Migration
An issue was created to bring existing documentation into the monorepo setup. This will centralize and streamline documentation efforts for the project. ([#5638](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5638))

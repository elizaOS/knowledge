# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jun 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, ElizaOS significantly enhanced agent flexibility by transitioning plugins to an agent-scoped architecture and completed the migration to `@elizaos/api-client`. Several critical bug fixes were implemented, improving chat stability and API documentation accuracy.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Agent Plugin Management
The plugin architecture has been refactored from project-scoped to agent-scoped, allowing individual agents to have unique plugin sets. This change provides greater flexibility and customization for character configurations. ([#5270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5270))

### API Client Migration and Refinement
The migration of the `packages/client` to the new `@elizaos/api-client` package has been completed, streamlining API interactions. This was accompanied by critical fixes to restore GUI chat title generation and update API documentation for accuracy. ([#5263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5263), [#5280](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5280), [#5275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5275))

### Chat Stability and Message Formatting Improvements
Several fixes were deployed to address chat-related issues, including a bug where the chat would get stuck displaying "agent is thinking" after a failure and an update to attachment formatting for improved message display. ([#5274](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5274), [#5273](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5273))

### New Development Workflow Integration
A new GitHub Actions workflow for Claude Code integration has been added, introducing an AI coding agent to assist with repository development. ([#5269](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5269))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#5278](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5278): Fixes a database schema type mismatch for server agents within the `plugin-sql` package.
- [#5276](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5276): Aims to normalize paths for Windows compatibility.
- [#5272](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5272): Addresses a failing core attachment test.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Plugin Configuration and Agent Functionality
An issue where the `TEXT_EMBEDDING` delegate type had no handler was resolved by ensuring the agent character file included the necessary OpenAI plugin. This allowed the agent to successfully process messages and reply via the UI. ([#5279](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5279))

## NEW ISSUES

### Character File Size Limitations
A new issue reports that large character files (approx. 150kb) can be imported but cannot be saved due to an "Error 500: request entity too large". The expected behavior is to allow saving of such files, with a desired size limit of 100mb. ([#5268](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5268))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Custom Plugin Development Challenges
Users are encountering difficulties when developing custom plugins, specifically with an on-chain AI agent. The agent sometimes only processes one message before stopping plugin usage, and responses may appear in the terminal but not the UI. A recent comment suggests ensuring responses are sent via either callback or return in the action, but not both. ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5260))

### Twitter Plugin Reply Issues
The Twitter plugin is failing to post replies to mentions or tags, despite loading successfully and having relevant configuration options enabled. No errors are displayed, and the plugin appears to be running. It has been noted that newlines in timeline replies are replaced with `\n\n` instead of actual line breaks, which might be due to the template explicitly instructing the agent to use `\n`. Additionally, memories are being saved, but the response sometimes drops out before reaching the UI.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Resolved API Integration and Agent Response Issues
A critical issue where an agent using the Google API was not providing a reply was investigated and resolved. The problem was identified as a missing or incorrectly configured `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` environment variable, rather than a missing plugin implementation. The user was guided through setting up the API key correctly, leading to a resolution.

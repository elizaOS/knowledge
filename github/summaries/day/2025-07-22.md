# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 22, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's focus was on refining the `plugin-training` module with several critical fixes, including security enhancements and path corrections. Additionally, new issues were opened concerning documentation and video production, alongside the resolution of a Google API agent response issue.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Plugin Training Module Enhancements
Several updates were made to the `plugin-training` module to improve its robustness and security. This includes validating model parameters for `bunExec` to prevent potential command injection vulnerabilities ([#5663](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5663)), correcting the dataset path for HuggingFace uploads ([#5662](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5662)), and removing double escaping from the `bunExec` prompt ([#5661](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5661)).

### Reasoning Service Stability
A fix was implemented in the `simple-reasoning-service.ts` to prevent the use of undefined models, enhancing the stability of the reasoning process ([#5660](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5660)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Agent Functionality and API Key Configuration
The issue regarding an agent not responding when using the Google API was closed today ([#5664](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5664)). The problem was identified as a missing or incorrectly configured `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` environment variable, rather than a non-existent plugin. Solutions provided included ensuring the API key is correctly set and considering alternative plugin configurations for reliability.

### Project Creation Without Keys
The issue concerning the inability to create a project without using keys was closed today ([#5605](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5605)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Documentation and Video Production Planning
Several new issues were opened today focusing on content creation and documentation. These include a request for a full documentation nitpick review ([#5665](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5665)) and planning for a series of introductory videos: "Getting Started Right - CLI vs Monorepo" ([#5666](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5666)), "Your First Agent - Zero to Running" ([#5667](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5667)), and "Multiple Agents & Characters" ([#5668](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5668)).

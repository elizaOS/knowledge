## OVERVIEW 
Today's activity focused on addressing a critical plugin loading issue related to `zod/v4` and resolving a Discord DM functionality bug.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

## CLOSED ISSUES
### Discord DM Functionality Restored
The issue where Discord DMs stopped working in version 1.4.4 has been resolved. The problem was identified as a missing channel configuration in the `.env` file, which is required for DM functionality when specific channels are defined. Adding the necessary channel configuration fixed the problem. ([#5810](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5810))

## NEW ISSUES
### Plugin Loading Failure Due to `zod/v4`
A new issue has been reported where several plugins fail to load after updating to version 1.5.10, specifically due to problems with `zod/v4`. The problem was temporarily resolved by manually running `bun add zod`. A potential fix has been suggested in a related pull request for the `plugin-openrouter`. ([#5995](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5995))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### `zod/v4` Plugin Loading Issue Discussion
The discussion around [#5995](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5995) indicates that the `zod/v4` loading problem affects multiple plugins, not just `openrouter`. While `bun add zod` provides a temporary workaround, a more permanent solution is being explored, with a potential fix linked in a related pull request. The user confirmed that even a clean `elizaos create` build still exhibited the error, reinforcing the need for a systemic solution.

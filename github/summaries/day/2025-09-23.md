## CLOSED ISSUES

### Discord DM Functionality Restored
The issue where Discord DM functionality stopped working in version 1.4.4 has been resolved. The problem was traced to required channel configurations in the `.env` file, which, once added, restored proper DM responses. ([#5810](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5810))

## NEW ISSUES

### Plugin Loading Failure Due to Zod/v4
A new issue has been reported where several plugins fail to load after updating to version 1.5.10, specifically due to `zod/v4` not loading correctly. A temporary workaround involves manually adding `zod` using `bun add zod`. A potential fix related to `elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter` has been suggested. ([#5995](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5995))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Zod/v4 Plugin Loading Issue Discussion ([#5995](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5995))
The discussion around the `zod/v4` loading issue indicates that the problem affects multiple plugins, not just `openrouter`. While a suggested fix for `plugin-openrouter` exists, the user confirmed that manually running `bun add zod` resolved the issue for them. The user also noted that even a clean `elizaos create` build still presented the error, highlighting the need for a more robust solution.

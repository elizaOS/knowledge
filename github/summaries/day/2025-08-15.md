# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's focus was on dependency updates to improve compatibility and maintainability, alongside addressing critical issues related to plugin publishing and testing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dependency and Build System Enhancements
*   Updated `vite-plugin-node-polyfills` and other dependencies to improve compatibility and maintainability, specifically addressing issues with `bun run clean` and `bats-assert`. ([#5776](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5776))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   A new pull request, [#5777](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5777), was opened to introduce `streaming useModel /core` functionality.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Plugin Publishing and Naming Resolution
*   The critical issue where `elizaos publish --npm` reported success but failed to publish was resolved. The problem was identified as a combination of using a scoped package name (`@elizaos/plugin-polygon`) without the necessary npm organization access and an outdated plugin template. The solution involved updating the package name to an unscoped format and ensuring the `package.json` matched the current template structure. ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5754))

### Testing and Mocking Guidance
*   Guidance was provided and the issue closed for a user experiencing consistent test failures related to WebSocket mocks. The resolution involved ensuring mock setup occurred before imports and using consistent mocking libraries, with the user confirming that moving the mock setup resolved the issue. ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5770))

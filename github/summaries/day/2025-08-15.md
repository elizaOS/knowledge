# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's focus was on dependency updates to improve compatibility and maintainability, alongside addressing critical issues related to plugin publishing and testing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Dependency and Build System Improvements**
    *   Upgraded `vite-plugin-node-polyfills` and other dependencies to enhance compatibility and maintainability, specifically addressing issues with `bun run clean`, `bats-assert`, and polyfills. ([#5776](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5776))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   A new pull request, [#5777](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5777), was opened to introduce streaming capabilities for `useModel /core`.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Plugin Publishing Reliability**
    *   Resolved a critical issue where the `elizaos publish --npm` command reported false success for plugin publishing due to a 404 error from npm. The resolution involved updating the package name to be unscoped and ensuring the `package.json` matched the current plugin template structure. ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5754))
*   **Plugin Testing Guidance**
    *   Provided guidance and resolved an issue where a user encountered consistent errors during plugin testing. The solution involved proper WebSocket mock setup before imports to ensure the service uses the mock instead of real connections. ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5770))

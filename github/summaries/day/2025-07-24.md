# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 24, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's focus was on critical bug fixes, addressing issues with plugin creation and publishing, and initiating a significant logger migration for Bun compatibility.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CLI and Plugin Stability Improvements
Efforts were made to enhance the stability of the CLI and plugin generation. A crucial fix was implemented to ensure `.gitignore` files are properly included in published npm packages for plugin starters, preventing accidental commits of sensitive data ([#5675](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5675)). Additionally, a minor spelling error in the plugin starter was corrected ([#5674](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5674)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### CLI Plugin Creation and Publishing Resolved
Two critical issues related to the `elizaos create` and `elizaos publish` commands were successfully closed. This includes a bug where newly created agents did not respond in the GUI after setup ([#5617](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5617)) and a problem where `elizaos publish` failed due to a `zod` module error in new plugins ([#5657](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5657)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Logger Compatibility for Bun Builds
A new issue was opened to address problems with the current logger, `pino-pretty`, which is incompatible with Bun's binary compilation and build process ([#5673](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5673)). The proposed solution is to replace `pino` with `adze` to ensure compatibility. An automated agent (Claude) has already initiated work on this, completing the core migration to `adze` while maintaining API compatibility.

### DevRel Agent Documentation Sync
A new issue was created to ensure the DevRel Agent always provides the most up-to-date content from documentation, reflecting recent changes promptly ([#5676](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5676)).

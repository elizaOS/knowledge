## NEW ISSUES

### Logger Compatibility for Bun Builds
A new critical issue has been identified regarding the incompatibility of the current `pino` logger with Bun binary compilation and build processes. The proposed solution is to replace `pino` with `adze` to ensure compatibility. An automated attempt by Claude has already been made to address this, with a detailed plan for migration and verification.

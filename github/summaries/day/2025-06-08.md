# ElizaOS Daily Update (Jun 8, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development efforts focused on enhancing the modularity and readability of the codebase, alongside addressing critical bugs. Key achievements include the restructuring of type definitions and improvements to log management, which will contribute to a more efficient debugging process.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Feature Enhancements
- **Modular Type Definitions**: The file `types.ts` has been split into more granular files to improve organization and maintainability, as seen in [PR #4999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4999).
- **Log Management Improvements**: Text embedding content has been excluded from debug logs to enhance readability, detailed in [PR #5003](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5003).

### Bug Fixes
- **Typographical Corrections**: Fixed typos in the `gitcoin-passport.md` documentation, correcting `treshold` to `threshold` and `retrive` to `retrieve` in [PR #5008](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5008).
- **Log Viewer Fix**: Resolved an issue where the logs viewer incorrectly displayed an empty state when data was present, as addressed in [PR #5006](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5006).
- **Windows Compatibility**: Attempted to fix matrix run issues on Windows systems in [PR #5007](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5007).

## CLOSED ISSUES

## NEW ISSUES

### Logging Configuration Issues
- **LOG_LEVEL Configuration**: A bug has been reported where the `LOG_LEVEL` set in `.env` files is ignored, functioning only when set via command line. This issue is documented in [#5005](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5005).

### Knowledge Management Bug
- **RAG Implementation Issue**: A user reported that the Knowledge Management (RAG) feature is not functioning as expected in version 1.0.6, with relevant code commented out. This issue is tracked in [#5004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5004).

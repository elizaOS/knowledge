# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 30, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, ElizaOS focused on enhancing the client-side Agent Runs sidebar with an improved timeline UI, fixing critical configuration and CLI bugs, and refactoring dynamic migrations for the SQL plugin.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Agent Run Visualization and Client-Side Improvements
The Agent Runs sidebar received significant enhancements, including an improved Timeline UI, better space utilization, and enhanced data extraction. This update involved changes across numerous client-side components to optimize the user experience for viewing agent execution traces. ([#6023](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6023))

### Critical Bug Fixes for CLI and Configuration
Several important bugs were addressed, including the removal of invalid project references from the root `tsconfig.json` to resolve TypeScript errors. Additionally, a fix was implemented to ensure that `elizaos start` and `elizaos dev` commands correctly pass `ProjectAgent.plugins` to the server, resolving issues with plugin detection in development environments. ([#6022](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6022), [#6021](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6021))

### Refactoring of Dynamic SQL Migrations
A substantial refactoring effort was completed for dynamic migrations within the SQL plugin. This involved changes across various migration-related files, including configuration, test suites, and runtime migrator components, to improve the robustness and maintainability of database schema evolution. ([#5990](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5990))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Dependency Updates**: A new pull request, [#6025](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6025), was opened to bump dependencies, indicating ongoing efforts to keep the project's libraries up-to-date.
- **Plugin Registration Fix**: Pull request [#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024) aims to fix the registration and export of the `shouldRespondProvider` in the bootstrap plugin, addressing a potential issue with plugin functionality.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### CLI Plugin Loading Issue Resolved
The issue where `elizaos dev` and `elizaos start` commands failed to load plugins correctly when run from a plugin directory has been resolved. This fix ensures that plugins are properly detected and passed to the server during development and startup. ([#6017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6017))

## NEW ISSUES

### Cloud Infrastructure Planning
New issues have been opened to finalize the design and planning for cloud infrastructure, specifically focusing on the "Cloud Wireframes Sealed & Agreed On." ([#6019](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6019))

### Agent Analysis and Development Ideas
Discussions have begun on "SWOT Agent Analysis" to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to agents. Additionally, a new idea for "Ship Prank Caller / AI Crank Yankers" has been proposed, suggesting exploration into novel AI agent applications. ([#6018](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6018), [#6020](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6020))

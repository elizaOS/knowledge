## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Agent Run Visualization and UI
The Agent Runs sidebar received a major upgrade, featuring an improved Timeline UI, better space utilization, and enhanced data extraction capabilities. This significantly improves the user experience for monitoring and understanding agent activities. ([#6023](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6023))

### Core Configuration and CLI Stability Fixes
Critical bug fixes were implemented to resolve an invalid project reference in the root `tsconfig.json`, preventing TypeScript errors. Additionally, a fix ensures that `elizaos start` and `elizaos dev` commands correctly pass `ProjectAgent.plugins` to the server when run in a plugin directory, addressing a key issue with plugin loading. ([#6022](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6022), [#6021](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6021))

### Dynamic Migration Refactoring
Significant refactoring was performed on dynamic migrations within the `plugin-sql` package. This work involved updates across numerous files related to migration testing, runtime migrators, and Drizzle adapters, aiming to improve the robustness and maintainability of the migration system.

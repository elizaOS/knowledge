On Jan 14, 2026, ElizaOS saw new development in voice utilities for the Discord plugin and a significant refactor of domain stores in the `plugin-sql` module. A critical issue regarding a reflection evaluator failure was reported across both `elizaos/eliza` and `elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord`, highlighting a potential data consistency problem.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord#6364](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/6364): The "Reflection evaluator fails with 'Entity not found'" issue requires attention as `UPDATE_CONTACT` fails due to `ensureConnection()` not being called, leading to "No ownership data found for world" logs. A proposed fix in `reflection.ts` before `UPDATE_CONT` needs evaluation.
    - [elizaos/eliza#6364](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6364): This issue, mirroring the one in `plugin-discord`, also details the reflection evaluator failure and includes logs and a proposed fix that needs review.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Imports Not Found in `index.ts` with Eliza CLI 1.6.1
The discussion on [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031) continues to focus on an import issue with `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1. The latest comments confirm that the problem is specific to version 1.6.1 due to missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files during its publication. The issue is not reproducible in newer versions or older ones. Recommendations include upgrading to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later, and for the ElizaOS team to consider yanking v1.6.1 and adding publish-time validation. The user `matteo-brandolino` confirmed the issue persists with `bun x tsc --noEmit` and provided detailed error logs, while `0xbbjoker` and `wtfsayo` are actively investigating and diagnosing the problem.

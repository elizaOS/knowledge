# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 8, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on bug fixes, particularly addressing test execution for types-only packages and correcting outdated documentation links. Significant progress was also made in modernizing the Renovate configuration. Several core architectural issues were closed, indicating a push towards refining the framework's foundational elements.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Build Process and Dependency Management Improvements
Efforts were made to streamline the build process and enhance dependency management. A bug preventing test execution for the `@elizaos/service-interfaces` package was resolved by skipping tests for this types-only package, improving build efficiency and accuracy ([#6034](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6034)). Additionally, the Renovate configuration was modernized with a new preset for plugins, standardizing dependency updates and grouping rules for better maintainability ([#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033)).

### Documentation and Link Maintenance
Documentation quality was improved by fixing an old and broken link within the CLI's README, ensuring users have access to accurate and up-to-date information ([#6047](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6047)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#6050](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6050): This PR aims to fix old links to actual documentation.
- [#6048](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6048): This PR introduces a new `MessageService` interface and its default implementation to the core.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Core Framework Refinements
Several foundational issues related to the ElizaOS class and core API were closed, indicating significant progress in establishing the framework's programmatic entry point and lifecycle management. This includes defining the `ElizaOS` class skeleton with lifecycle methods and implementing bulk operations for agents ([#5905](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5905), [#5906](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5906)).

### Message Bus and API Modernization
A series of issues concerning the message bus and API redesign were closed, signifying a move towards a cleaner, class-based API. This involved replacing the complex bus with a simplified model, defining new `MessageBus` class methods, and modernizing the implementation by replacing Node EventEmitter with Bunâ€™s EventTarget ([#5916](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5916), [#5917](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5917), [#5918](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5918), [#5919](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5919), [#5920](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5920), [#5921](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5921)).

### Configuration and Persistence Enhancements
Issues related to defaults, validation, and state persistence were resolved. This includes ensuring global defaults are configurable, adding schema validation for agent configs, and implementing agent state persistence across restarts ([#5907](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5907), [#5908](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5908)).

### Extensibility and Developer Experience
Improvements to extensibility and developer experience were completed, such as providing orchestration hooks for custom lifecycle logic and consolidating duplicated database entities for rooms/channels/servers ([#5909](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5909), [#5931](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5931), [#5965](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5965)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Cloud API Integration
A new issue proposes implementing a unified Cloud API plugin to centralize API key management for framework-level LLM access, replacing current per-service plugins ([#6049](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6049)).

### Configuration Defaults
A new issue highlights a concern regarding the default port of 3000, suggesting the need for a different default port to avoid conflicts with other applications ([#6051](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6051)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Imports Not Found in `index.ts` with Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031))
The discussion on this issue revolves around type errors when creating new projects with `elizaos create`, specifically concerning missing exports like `logger` and `IAgentRuntime` from `@elizaos/core`. The latest comments indicate that the type errors seem to be resolved after a clean reinstall, suggesting the issue might be related to node/package type resolution rather than a specific bug. A detailed diagnosis by "claude" confirmed that the problem was specific to version 1.6.1 of `@elizaos/core`, which was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files. The recommendation is for users to upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later, and for the ElizaOS team to consider yanking v1.6.1 and adding publish-time validation to prevent similar issues. The user "matteo-brandolino" confirmed that newer versions work correctly and provided detailed error logs from `bun x tsc --noEmit` to illustrate the problem. "0xbbjoker" initially could not reproduce the issue and suggested trying a clean install and updating Node/Bun versions.

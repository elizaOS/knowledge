# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 8, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today saw significant progress in CLI usability and stability, with numerous fixes addressing SPA routing, global installations, and release workflows. A new image generation action was added, enhancing agent capabilities.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced CLI Stability and User Experience
Multiple fixes were implemented to improve the CLI's reliability and user experience. This includes resolving issues with global installations, ensuring correct SPA routing on refresh, and refining console output for clarity.
- Improved SPA routing for globally installed CLI installations, fixing refresh issues on non-home routes ([#5479](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5479), [#5477](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5477), [#5472](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5472), [#5469](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5469), [#5481](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5481)).
- Updated CLI output messages to include `elizaos dev` command option ([#5448](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5448)).
- Removed the `--dir` flag from the `create` command to simplify the interface ([#5443](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5443)).
- Prevented global plugin installations to avoid permission issues and conflicts ([#5450](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5450)).
- Fixed Windows plugin loading and `dev` command failures by addressing path normalization ([#5437](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5437)).
- Refined helper text and warning messages for the `create` command ([#5454](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5454)).

### Critical Bug Fixes for Application Reliability
Several critical bugs were addressed to enhance the overall stability and performance of the ElizaOS application, particularly concerning UI hydration, server errors, and chat management.
- Resolved React hydration errors and SPA routing issues, preventing UI glitches and warnings ([#5475](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5475)).
- Fixed "stream is not readable" server error by removing duplicate body parser ([#5458](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5458)).
- Prevented repeated DM channel creation on refresh by clearing `forceNew` state ([#5455](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5455)).
- Standardized text formatting and corrected spelling inconsistencies in documentation ([#5433](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5433)).
- Added `bun.lock` to `.gitignore` to prevent tracking of lock files ([#5471](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5471)).

### Release Workflow and CI/CD Improvements
Significant effort was put into stabilizing the release workflow and continuous integration processes, addressing Lerna publish failures and versioning issues.
- Fixed failing release workflow and simplified post-publish steps, resolving Lerna publish failures due to uncommitted changes ([#5467](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5467), [#5466](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5466), [#5463](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5463)).
- Ensured correct version display in the client UI after releases by bumping versions in Lerna before build ([#5461](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5461)).

### New Features and UI Refinements
New capabilities were introduced, and existing UI components were refined for better consistency and user interaction.
- Added a new `generateImageAction` to the agent pipeline, enabling image generation based on conversational context ([#5446](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5446)).
- Replaced `window.confirm` usages with `useConfirmation` hook for consistent, theme-aware modal confirmations ([#5444](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5444)).
- Improved code formatting consistency across several client components ([#5445](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5445)).
- Fixed the starter project's missing Eliza avatar by using a direct hosted image approach ([#5442](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5442)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Windows Plugin Loading and Dev Command Fixes
The persistent issue of plugins failing to load on Windows when running `elizaos dev` has been resolved. This involved addressing path normalization and localhost resolution problems that specifically affected Windows PowerShell users.
- [#5407](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5407) - Fails to load @elizaos/plugin-openai and @elizaos/plugin-bootstrap on Windows

### Server Stability and Token Handling
A critical bug that caused the server to crash if a Telegram token was not found has been fixed, improving the robustness of the server startup process.
- [#5432](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5432) - Don't crash server start (if telegram token not found)

## NEW ISSUES

### Eliza Hosted LLM and Embedding Endpoint
A new issue has been opened to explore setting up a rate-limited Eliza hosted LLM and embedding endpoint. The goal is to allow agents to notify users about rate limits and provide options for obtaining an API key, potentially leveraging LiteLLM.
- [#5438](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5438) - Set up rate limited Eliza hosted LLM and embedding endpoint

### CLI Update Command Display Issue
An issue was reported regarding the CLI displaying "update available" messages even during the execution of the update command, leading to redundant notifications.
- [#5447](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5447) - should not show update availble during update command

### Character Migrator Tool
A new issue has been created to track the development of a v1 to v2 character migrator tool, likely to assist users in upgrading their character configurations.
- [#5452](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5452) - v1 to v2 character migrator

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Eliza Hosted LLM and Embedding Endpoint ([#5438](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5438))
The discussion on this issue is highly active, with a focus on implementing a fallback mechanism to the ElizaNet LiteLLM instance. Claude has completed a Proof of Concept (POC) for this, integrating fallback logic into `runtime.useModel()` to handle rate limiting (429) and network errors (503, 502, 504). The POC includes handlers for text generation, embeddings, and image generation via the ElizaNet LiteLLM instance, with comprehensive logging and configurable options via environment variables and character settings. A test script and documentation have been created.

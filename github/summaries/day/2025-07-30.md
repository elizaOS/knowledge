# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 30, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the team focused on standardizing documentation to exclusively use `bun:test`, improving consistency across the project. Several new pull requests were opened for refactoring and bug fixes, while multiple issues related to plugin development and documentation were closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Standardization
All project documentation and rules files have been updated to exclusively use `bun:test` as the standard testing framework, ensuring consistency and clarity across the codebase. This significant documentation enhancement impacts various packages including `cli`, `client`, `core`, `docs`, and several `plugin` related directories. ([#5681](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5681))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Two new pull requests were opened today:
- [#5692](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5692) proposes refactoring `plugin.ts` to adopt functional programming patterns.
- [#5689](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5689) aims to fix subprocess mocks and CI path issues within tests.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Documentation Review Completion
The comprehensive "Full Docs Nitpick Review" issue has been closed, indicating a significant step towards improving overall documentation quality. ([#5665](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5665))

### Plugin-Related Issues Resolved
Several issues concerning specific plugins, including `aave`, `clanker`, `defi-llama`, and `moon-well`, have been closed. This suggests progress in addressing and resolving problems related to these individual plugin integrations. ([#5646](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5646), [#5645](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5645), [#5647](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5647), [#5648](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5648))

## NEW ISSUES

### Development Environment and CLI Issues
A new issue highlights that the `elizaos dev` command does not function correctly within a `plugin` folder unless `@elizaos/cli` is explicitly added as a dependency. ([#5687](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5687))

### Frontend Rendering and Display Issues
An issue was opened regarding the markdown rendering on the frontend chat view, noting that the spacing between lines is currently too wide. ([#5688](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5688))

### Plugin Deployment and Branch Management
Two new issues address challenges with plugin deployment:
- One proposes setting `1.x` as the default branch for migrated and `1.x` supported plugins. ([#5690](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5690))
- The other points out that some migrated `1.x` plugins are missing auto-deployment CI files and are not being deployed. ([#5691](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5691))

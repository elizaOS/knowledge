# ElizaOS Daily Update (Feb 7, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today, significant progress was made in enhancing the ElizaOS framework, including the transition from pnpm to Bun for improved performance and future capabilities. Key dependencies were addressed, and a generic model loading system was implemented. The team also resolved a build issue targeting Node 23, ensuring compatibility and stability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dependency and Build Improvements
- Replaced pnpm with Bun for faster performance and future enhancements ([#2852](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/2852)).
- Added `adapter-sqlite` to dependencies to ensure it loads as the default adapter when no other plugins are present ([#3357](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3357)).
- Fixed build issues in core to target Node 23, enhancing compatibility ([#3371](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3371)).

### Code Refactoring and Enhancements
- Cleaned up codebase for better maintainability ([#3116](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3116)).
- Implemented a generic model loading system with OpenAI-compatible endpoints, simplifying provider setup ([#3114](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3114)).
- Supported the anthropic provider, expanding integration capabilities ([#3364](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3364)).
- Resolved a merge conflict to maintain code integrity ([#3367](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/3367)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Build and Compatibility Resolutions
- Resolved a build failure issue from a recent release, ensuring the system compiles correctly ([#3322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3322)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Dependency and Functionality Challenges
- Missing `cors` and `multer` dependencies in the @elizaos/agent package, causing build issues ([#3365](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3365)).
- The command `pnpm run dev --characters` does not load the specified character, defaulting to the Eliza character instead ([#3362](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3362)).
- UI fails to load correctly when starting the service with a specific character file ([#3360](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/3360)).

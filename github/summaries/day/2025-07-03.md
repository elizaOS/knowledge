# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 3, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today, the ElizaOS team focused heavily on UI/UX enhancements, bug fixes across client and server, and documentation improvements, alongside routine maintenance and version bumps.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced User Interface and Experience
Significant progress was made on refining the client-side UI. This includes a redesigned sidebar for improved structure and clarity ([#5373](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5373)), visual tweaks to reduce spacing and avatar sizes ([#5371](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5371)), dynamic "Create New" button labels based on the active tab ([#5369](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5369)), and updated designs for group and agent cards ([#5361](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5361), [#5355](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5355)). Visual styling of tabs was also improved ([#5357](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5357)).

### Critical Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements
Several crucial bugs were addressed to enhance system stability and correctness. A duplicate `express.json` middleware causing overhead in the API router was removed ([#5384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5384)). Cypress tests were updated to reflect UI changes ([#5382](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5382)), and REST API documentation was corrected to match the actual server implementation ([#5380](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5380)). UI padding issues ([#5379](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5379), [#5363](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5363), [#5360](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5360), [#5354](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5354), [#5353](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5353), [#5352](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5352)) and import/export icon issues ([#5378](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5378), [#5374](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5374)) were resolved. A missing dependency was added to fix test issues ([#5366](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5366)), and the '+' button alignment was fixed ([#5362](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5362)).

### Infrastructure and Release Management
The `.env.example` file was refactored for better clarity and maintainability ([#5372](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5372)). The project version was bumped to 1.0.16 and 1.0.17 ([#5385](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5385), [#5383](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5383)). Log improvements were also implemented, including visual spinner animations for migrations ([#5348](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5348)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#5381](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5381): Fix for frontend refresh issues.
- [#5364](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5364): Adds comprehensive CLI testing infrastructure.
- [#5358](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5358): Addresses database migration advisory locking for horizontal scaling in the SQL plugin.
- [#5356](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5356): Implements plugin dependency resolution for the CLI.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Test Environment and Documentation Accuracy
Several issues related to testing and documentation were resolved. This includes fixing general test issues ([#5365](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5365)) and setting up the `bun test:app` base ([#5367](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5367)). Crucially, the REST API documentation was updated to accurately reflect the server's implementation, addressing misleading information ([#5370](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5370)).

### Development Workflow Improvements
Key development workflow issues were closed, including enabling client hot reloads in development ([#4889](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4889)), which significantly improves UI development speed. A dependency loop in the local AI plugin was also resolved ([#4912](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4912)).

## NEW ISSUES

### UI/UX and Feature Review
New issues were opened to review specific UI elements and potential features. This includes reviewing image generation capabilities ([#5375](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5375)) and the actions tab in the GUI ([#5377](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5377)).

### Plugin and System Architecture
Discussions around plugin migration strategies, specifically a hybrid AI + manual approach, were initiated ([#5376](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5376)). A new issue regarding security roles for wallets was also created ([#5386](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5386)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Server API Endpoint Verification ([#5230](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5230))
The discussion on this issue indicates that the reported 404 errors are likely due to deployment/configuration issues rather than missing API endpoints. A comprehensive analysis by Claude verified that all documented endpoints are properly implemented and the server is production-ready. Recommendations include checking server health, reviewing logs, testing authentication, verifying environment variables, and enabling debug logging.

### Twitter Plugin Client Initialization and Deprecation Warnings ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/31), [#32](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/32))
Users are reporting "Client Initialization Error" after successful authentication with the Twitter plugin, preventing agents from running autonomously on Twitter. This issue seems to persist even with newer versions of ElizaOS. Additionally, the `fetchSearchTweets` method is deprecated, and users are encountering errors related to this, suggesting the system is calling an old method. The latest `plugin-twitter` version 1.0.14 was expected to fix some issues, but new errors related to database inserts are now appearing.

### CLI Input Method Consistency ([#5295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5295))
The ongoing discussion focuses on standardizing CLI input methods to use `@clack/prompts` for consistency, moving away from a mix of `inquirer` and Bun's global `prompt()`. A pull request ([#5359](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5359)) is under review to address this.

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant bug fixes across the core, client, and plugin-bootstrap packages, improving stability and type definitions. A new feature was added to ensure runtime inclusion in emitted events. Several new pull requests were opened, and one issue related to Windows path handling was closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Runtime and Build Improvements

- Corrected the `AgentLog` type structure and fixed action viewer mapping in the client, addressing display issues ([#5834](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5834)).
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in the `plugin-bootstrap` package by correcting `logger.error` parameter order in the `imageGeneration` action ([#5833](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5833)).
- Made environment loading lazy in the CLI to prevent warnings during startup, improving user experience ([#5829](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5829)).

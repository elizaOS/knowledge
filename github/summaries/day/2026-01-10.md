On January 10, 2026, the primary development focus was on the `elizaos.github.io` repository, where significant enhancements were made to the leaderboard API. This included the implementation of an MMORPG-style character progression system and the transformation of focus areas into rich objects with detailed scores and percentages. The `eliza` repository had no development activity.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Leaderboard API Enhancements
- Implemented a new MMORPG-style character system for the leaderboard API, inspired by Ragnarok Online, and transformed focus areas into rich objects with scores and percentages, modifying several files across `src/lib`, `src/app`, `cli`, `drizzle`, and `public`.

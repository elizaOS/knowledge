# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 18, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in enhancing the ElizaOS CLI, particularly in the areas of scenario testing, reporting, and data management. Key achievements include robust bug fixes for the publisher module, comprehensive implementation of scenario matrix testing, and the development of a powerful reporting dashboard with HTML and PDF export capabilities.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **CLI Publisher Module Improvements**: Critical bug fixes were implemented in the CLI's publisher module. This includes correcting comma placement when adding entries to the registry's `index.json` and improving TypeScript type safety and error logging for more reliable publishing operations. ([#5774](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5774), [#5796](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5796))

*   **Advanced Scenario Matrix Testing**: Significant strides were made in the scenario matrix runner. This involved designing and implementing a configuration schema for scenario matrices, developing a parameter override system, and creating the `elizaos scenario matrix` CLI command for executing these tests. These features enable more comprehensive and automated testing of agent behaviors. ([#5778](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5778), [#5779](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5779), [#5780](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5780))

*   **Enhanced Data Collection & Reporting**: The framework now supports advanced data collection and reporting for agent evaluations. This includes implementing structured JSON output from evaluators, defining scenario capabilities for LLM judges, centralizing and serializing run data, and developing the `elizaos report generate` command. The reporting capabilities were further extended with dynamic HTML report rendering and PDF export functionality. ([#5783](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5783), [#5784](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5784), [#5785](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5785), [#5786](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5786), [#5787](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5787), [#5788](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5788), [#5789](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5789), [#5790](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5790))

*   **Code Formatting and Dependency Updates**: General code formatting improvements were applied, and dependencies were updated across various packages to maintain code quality and ensure compatibility. ([#5795](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5795), [#5794](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5794))

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Scenario Matrix Runner Foundation**: Several issues related to the core components of the Scenario Matrix Runner were closed. This includes the design and implementation of the scenario matrix configuration schema ([#5778](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5778)), the implementation of the `elizaos scenario matrix` CLI command ([#5779](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5779)), and the development of the parameter override system ([#5780](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5780)). All these components were thoroughly evaluated and marked as completed.

*   **Advanced Evaluation and Data Collection**: Significant progress was made in enhancing evaluation and data collection capabilities. This involved implementing structured JSON output from evaluators ([#5783](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5783)), defining scenario capability definitions for LLM judges ([#5784](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5784)), implementing agent trajectory logging ([#5785](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5785)), and centralizing and serializing run data ([#5786](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5786)). Each of these issues was evaluated as fully implemented.

*   **Performance Reporting Dashboard**: The initial set of features for the Performance Reporting Dashboard has been completed. This includes the implementation of the `elizaos report generate` command ([#5787](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5787)), the design and build of the HTML report template ([#5788](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5788)), the implementation of dynamic report rendering ([#5789](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5789)), and the capability for PDF export ([#5790](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5790)). All components were thoroughly reviewed and deemed complete.

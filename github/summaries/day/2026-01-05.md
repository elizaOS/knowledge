Today, ElizaOS made significant strides in core agent framework development with unified client hooks and critical SQL plugin fixes, while also substantially expanding documentation coverage to 95% and enhancing the project website's maintainability and user experience.

## ✅ Completed Work

### Core Agent Framework & Client Enhancements
*   Introduced a new `useElizaChat` hook for unified interaction across HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket transports, aligning transport naming conventions ([elizaos/eliza#6300](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300)).
*   Completed the implementation of core Eliza hooks, including `useEliza` and `useElizaChat`, enabling SDK-first development in the browser and separate server hooks for REST/SSE integration ([elizaos/eliza#5928](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5928), [elizaos/eliza#5966](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5966)).
*   Implemented hooks for agent lifecycle management (e.g., `useAgentList`, `useStartAgent`, `useStopAgent`) ([elizaos/eliza#5929](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5929)).
*   Resolved architectural issues in the Messaging API, addressing double processing and transport alignment ([elizaos/eliza#6298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6298)).

### SQL Plugin Stability & Reliability
*   Fixed PostgreSQL `SET LOCAL` command failures by correctly parameterizing with `sql.raw()` ([elizaos/eliza#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)).
*   Addressed critical issues in `plugin-sql`, including adding pool configuration, an error handler, and fixing PGLite shutdown problems to prevent runtime crashes ([elizaos/eliza#6323](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6323)).

### Documentation & Website Improvements
*   Expanded documentation coverage from approximately 60% to 95% by adding new guides (e.g., streaming responses), updating existing content, and improving clarity across various sections ([elizaos/docs#81](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/81)).
*   Enhanced the ElizaOS website's RSS feed readability by adding an XSL stylesheet and updating the content type for XSLT rendering ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#188](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/188)).
*   Integrated Dependabot for automated dependency management on the ElizaOS website, improving maintenance and security ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#188](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/188)).

### CI/CD Workflow Enhancements
*   Upgraded Claude-powered CI workflows to use the stable v1 action and the Opus 4.5 model ([elizaos/eliza#6324](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6324)).
*   Added two new automated workflows for security and maintenance ([elizaos/eliza#6324](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6324)).
*   Configured CI to allow the Cursor bot to trigger Claude workflows, improving integration and automation ([elizaos/eliza#6328](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6328)).

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 16, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on enhancing CI/CD workflows, particularly for Claude code reviews, and critical bug fixes across the CLI and plugin-sql, improving stability and developer experience.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CI/CD Workflow Enhancements
Concurrency control was added to the Claude code review workflow, ensuring that previous runs are canceled when new commits are pushed. This prevents resource waste and ensures reviews are always based on the latest code. ([#5984](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5984))

### CLI and Plugin Stability Improvements
Several critical bug fixes were implemented to improve the stability and functionality of the CLI and SQL plugin. This included:
- Removing quotes from file paths in Windows tests to resolve CI failures. ([#5981](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5981))
- Enhancing the `elizaos dev` command logic for better client development server detection in monorepos and standalone plugins. ([#5979](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5979))
- Addressing redundant migration steps in the CLI agent start and demoting spurious adapter warnings in `plugin-sql`. ([#5978](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5978))

### Update Available for Alpha Versions
Issue [#5971](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5971) discusses preventing "update available" notifications for alpha versions if the user is not on the alpha distribution channel. The latest comment from `standujar` indicates a willingness to address this if time permits.

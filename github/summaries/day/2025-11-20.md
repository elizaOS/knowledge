# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, including aligning server tests with ElizaOS API changes and enhancing CLI OpenRouter integration. Significant progress was also made in closing out issues related to dependency migration and container billing logic.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Server Test Alignment and API Updates
Server tests and routers have been aligned with new ElizaOS interfaces. This includes clarifying plugin auto-injection behavior and modernizing middleware, loader, socket, and utility tests, ensuring compatibility and stability across the server infrastructure. ([#6135](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6135))

### CLI OpenRouter Integration Enhancement
The ElizaOS CLI now supports native embedding for OpenRouter, removing the need for separate embedding provider configurations. This streamlines the user experience for OpenRouter users. ([#6142](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6142))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#6164](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6164), has been opened to improve the accepted formats for plugin names within plugin dependencies.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Dependency Migration to Zod v4 Completed
The migration of the Eliza monorepo and all plugins from Zod v3 to Zod v4 has been successfully completed. This involved numerous PRs across various plugins to update dependencies. ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999))

### Container Billing Logic Implemented
The container billing logic has been fully implemented, including a monthly cron job for cost deduction, container pausing for payment failures, a one-week retention period, and email notifications. ([#6124](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6124))

### UI Implementation and Wallet Connection Issues Resolved

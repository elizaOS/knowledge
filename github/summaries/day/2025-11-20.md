Today, ElizaOS saw significant progress in core infrastructure with server test alignment and enhanced CLI OpenRouter integration, alongside the completion of the Zod v4 dependency migration and container billing logic implementation. The `plugin-discord` also advanced its communication capabilities by integrating a unified messaging API.

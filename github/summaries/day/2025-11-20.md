# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, including aligning server tests with ElizaOS API changes and enhancing CLI functionality. Significant progress was also made in closing several long-standing issues.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Server Test Alignment and Modernization**: Server tests and routers were aligned with new ElizaOS interfaces, clarifying plugin auto-injection behavior. Middleware, loader, socket, and utility tests were deflaked and modernized, improving overall server stability and reliability ([#6135](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6135)).
*   **CLI OpenRouter Embedding Support**: The ElizaOS CLI now includes native embedding support for OpenRouter, simplifying integration by removing the need for separate embedding provider configurations ([#6142](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6142)).

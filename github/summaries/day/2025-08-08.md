# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 8, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the ElizaOS team focused on significant code quality improvements, dependency standardization, and migration to `bunx`. Key achievements include comprehensive code formatting, removal of obsolete files, and critical bug fixes related to XML parsing and logging. Several maintenance chores were also completed, updating package versions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Codebase Refinement and Standardization
The team implemented comprehensive code formatting and linting improvements across the entire ElizaOS codebase to enhance code quality, consistency, and maintainability ([#5740](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5740)). Additionally, obsolete `llms.txt` was removed, and all internal package dependencies were standardized to use the workspace protocol, streamlining dependency management ([#5744](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5744)).

### Build System and XML Parser Enhancements
Migration from `npx` to `bunx` was completed in GitHub workflows and package scripts, improving build efficiency. The XML parser was also enhanced, replacing an unsafe fallback regex with a linear scan to avoid potential issues ([#5742](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5742), [#5741](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5741)).

### Logging System Fixes
Missing `pino` logger refactors were addressed, converting logger calls across the repository to object-first structured logging. This aligns with `pino` typings and fixes TypeScript/DTS errors, improving type-safety and log structure without functional behavior changes ([#5737](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5737)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Release Workflow Fixes
A critical issue where the release workflow incorrectly replaced `@elizaos` packages with version numbers in the monorepo was identified and closed ([#5730](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5730)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Build and Development Environment Issues
A build failure in `@elizaos/core` was reported, causing `bun run clean` to fail due to TypeScript errors during the DTS build phase ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738)). This issue is currently blocking testing of advanced mocking, natural language agent interaction, and dynamic plugin loading.

### Cloud-Related Bug Fixing
A new issue was opened to track and fix bugs within `eliza-cloud` ([#5747](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5747)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Eliza CLI Project Build Failure
The issue regarding the ElizaOS CLI failing to build projects ([#5734](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5734)) remains active. The problem was identified as missing placeholders in `logger.info` calls within project templates, which was fixed by adding `%s` as per Pino documentation. The latest comment suggests that this issue might be resolved in version 1.4.x.

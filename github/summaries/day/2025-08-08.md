# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 8, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the ElizaOS team focused on significant code quality improvements, dependency standardization, and migration to `bunx`. Key achievements include comprehensive code formatting, removal of obsolete files, and critical bug fixes related to XML parsing and logging. Several maintenance chores were also completed, updating package versions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Codebase Refinement and Standardization
The team implemented comprehensive code formatting and linting improvements across the entire ElizaOS codebase to enhance code quality, consistency, and maintainability ([#5740](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5740)). Additionally, obsolete `llms.txt` was removed, and all internal package dependencies were standardized to use the workspace protocol, streamlining dependency management ([#5744](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5744)).

### Build System and XML Parser Enhancements
Migration from `npx` to `bunx` was completed in GitHub workflows and package scripts, improving build efficiency. The XML parser was also enhanced, replacing an unsafe fallback regex with a linear scan to prevent potential issues ([#5742](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5742), [#5741](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5741)).

### Logging System Fixes
A critical fix was deployed to address missing pino logger refactors, converting logger calls across the repository to object-first structured logging. This aligns with pino typings and resolves TS/DTS errors, improving type-safety and log structure without functional behavior changes ([#5737](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5737)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Release Workflow Correction
A critical issue related to the release workflow incorrectly replacing `@elizaos` package versions in the monorepo was successfully closed today ([#5730](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5730)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Build System Failures
A new issue was reported regarding a build failure in `@elizaos/core`, specifically during the DTS (type definition) build phase, causing `bun run clean` to fail ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738)). This issue is blocking testing of advanced mocking, natural language agent interaction, and dynamic plugin loading.

### Cloud-Related Bug Fixing
A new issue was opened to track and fix bugs identified in `eliza-cloud` ([#5747](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5747)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Eliza CLI Project Build Failure
The issue regarding the ElizaOS CLI failing to build projects ([#5734](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5734)) remains active. The problem was identified as a missing placeholder in `logger.info` calls within templates, which was fixed by adding `%s` as per Pino documentation. The latest comment suggests that this issue might be resolved in the 1.4.x release.

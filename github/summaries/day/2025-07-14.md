# ElizaOS Daily Update (Jul 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's focus was on improving developer experience and addressing critical bugs. Key achievements include fixing the auto-build process for the `elizaos start` command and ensuring graceful shutdown of the dev server.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Development Workflow
*   Implemented automatic building for the `elizaos start` command, mirroring the functionality of the `dev` command [#5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504).
*   Ensured graceful shutdown of the dev server upon receiving Cmd+C (SIGINT/SIGTERM), preventing orphaned processes [#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562).
*   Addressed issues related to type safety and testing identified in PR #5505, including comprehensive tests for the `asUUID()` function [#5580](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5580).
*   Corrected the usage of the auto-build test flag [#5581](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5581).

### Provider Mapping
*   Mapped the `llama_local` provider in v1 to `@elizaos/plugin-ollama` [#5582](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5582).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Resolved Server Management Issue
*   Closed issue [#5559](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5559) regarding the inability to kill the server process with Cmd+C on `elizaos dev`, which was addressed in PR #5562.

## NEW ISSUES

### Agent Communication Challenges
*   New issue [#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584) reported difficulties in forwarding messages between agents without polling, specifically between a Blockchain Agent and a Support Agent.

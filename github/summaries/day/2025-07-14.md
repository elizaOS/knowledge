# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 14, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing CLI stability and developer experience with critical bug fixes for `elizaos start` and `elizaos dev` commands, alongside significant improvements in core type safety and testing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CLI Stability and Developer Experience
Improvements were made to the command-line interface, ensuring a smoother developer experience. The `elizaos start` command now automatically builds the project before starting the server, mirroring the `dev` command's behavior ([#5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504)). Additionally, graceful shutdown for the `elizaos dev` server on `Cmd+C` (SIGINT/SIGTERM) was implemented, preventing orphaned processes ([#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562)). A related fix addressed the usage of the auto-build test flag ([#5581](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5581)).

### Core Type Safety and Testing Enhancements
Significant work was done to improve the robustness of the core library. This included addressing type safety and testing issues that arose from a previous PR, specifically adding comprehensive tests for the `asUUID()` function and planning types, and refining error handling ([#5580](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5580)).

### Provider Mapping Updates
A chore task was completed to map the `llama_local` provider in v1 to `@elizaos/plugin-ollama`, streamlining provider integration ([#5582](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5582)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#5585](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5585) Sync develop into develop devel
- [#5583](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5583) [DRAFT] Docker Infrastructure Enhancement Proposal

## CLOSED ISSUES

### CLI Server Shutdown Fix
The issue where `Cmd + C` on the `elizaos dev` server did not kill the server process has been resolved ([#5559](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5559)). The fix involved implementing proper signal handling to stop the dev server before process exit, importing `stopServer` for cleanup, and replacing immediate `process.exit` with a graceful shutdown function.

## NEW ISSUES

### Agent-to-Agent Communication Challenges
A new issue was opened regarding forwarding messages between agents without polling, specifically for a Blockchain Agent and a Support Agent ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584)). The user seeks help with direct agent-to-agent communication.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Custom Plugin Callback Interference
Discussion continues on the issue where a custom plugin's callback is getting replaced by the `ATTACHMENTS` provider ([#4947](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4947)). The latest comment from tcm390 suggests checking if the agent is calling back the action's `responseContent` and if a `GENERATE_IMAGE` action is already defined in the bootstrap, potentially causing the agent to use a default action instead of the custom one. Previous analysis by Claude confirmed this as a valid issue, identifying the root cause in the message handler flow where the `ATTACHMENTS` provider modifies the state before it's passed to action callbacks. Claude also proposed an immediate fix to separate provider state composition from action callback processing.

### Twitter Client Initialization Errors
Users are still reporting issues with Twitter Client Initialization Errors when creating or starting agents using the Twitter plugin ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/31)). Multiple users, including joaoCarvalho1000 and yasir23, confirmed experiencing the same problem. RolandOne noted that the latest `plugin-twitter` (1.0.14) should fix it but reported a new error related to database insertion. Ovodo questioned if this means autonomous Twitter agents are currently unfeasible, while nccuong-vikki suggested it might be due to limited features of free subscriptions preventing access to the Home Timeline.

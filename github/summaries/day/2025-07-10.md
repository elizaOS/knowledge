# ElizaOS Daily Update (Jul 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Significant progress was made today with enhancements to Claude code review, action chaining, and bug fixes across the ElizaOS platform, including CLI tests and documentation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Functionality Enhancements
*   Implemented action chaining, enabling sequential execution of actions with state management ([#5436](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5436)).
*   Updated action handlers to return `Promise<ActionResult>` for proper type compliance ([#5512](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5512)).

### Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements
*   Addressed CLI test failures due to version mismatch and `ActionResult` import issues ([#5515](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5515)).
*   Improved secret panel UX by resolving issues with global environment variable recognition ([#5501](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5501)).
*   Updated plugin-starter dependencies to use workspace version ([#5514](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5514)).
*   Fixed documentation build errors by removing deleted directories from the config ([#5513](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5513)).
*   Corrected a typo in `prompts.ts` ([#5516](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5516)).

### Code Review and Security
*   Enhanced the Claude code review workflow with ElizaOS-specific guidelines, including security checks for API keys, SQL injection, and XSS vulnerabilities ([#5519](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5519)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Plugin Issues
*   Reported type errors in the Knowledge Plugin after updating to eliza-1.2.0 ([#5518](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5518)).

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant feature additions like action chaining and enhanced code review, alongside critical bug fixes across CLI, documentation, and UI, ensuring a more robust and user-friendly ElizaOS.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Functionality & AI Workflow Enhancements
A major feature, action chaining, was implemented, allowing for more complex and sequential agent behaviors by storing action states and return values. Additionally, the Claude code review workflow was significantly enhanced with ElizaOS-specific security and quality guidelines, improving code integrity.

The issue [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5499) regarding the `plugin-local-ai` failing to load on Windows (and Mac) is ongoing. The latest comment from `wtfsayo` suggests deprecating the `local-ai` plugin in favor of Ollama, though it's noted that `local-ai` might work on a second startup. `ChristopherTrimboli` previously provided a link to a fixed version (v1.2.1) of the plugin.

## OVERVIEW 
Today, ElizaOS focused on refining core functionalities, including prompt format migration to XML for improved LLM reliability, critical bug fixes in CLI and SQL plugins, and documentation enhancements. New features include expanded examples for the default Eliza character.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Framework Refinements & Prompt Standardization
A significant refactoring effort was completed, migrating all JSON prompts to an XML format across the codebase, enhancing LLM response reliability. This change impacts core entities and the bootstrap plugin. ([#5623](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5623))

### CLI and Plugin Stability Improvements
Key bug fixes addressed CLI dev command test failures due to missing dependencies and resolved issues with JSON string handling in the SQL base plugin, ensuring more robust operations. ([#5641](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5641), [#5628](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5628))

### Feature Expansion and Documentation
New examples were added to the default Eliza character to support Twitter posting functionality. Documentation was also enhanced with critical clarifications on ElizaOS components (Services, Providers, Actions, Evaluators) in `CLAUDE.md`. ([#5652](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5652), [#5642](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5642))

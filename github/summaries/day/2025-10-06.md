# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 6, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant activity in pull requests, focusing on core framework refactoring, agent identification, and critical bug fixes related to plugin reloading and runtime initialization.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Framework Refactoring and Configuration
*   Continued the multi-phase refactoring of the ElizaOS/Server, integrating new config and plugin modules to enhance modularity and extensibility. ([#6037](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6037))
*   Added support for `SERVER_PORT` configuration, improving flexibility for deployment environments. ([#6038](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6038))

### Agent and Plugin Enhancements
*   Migrated to a UUID-only agent identification system, streamlining agent management and consistency. ([#6036](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6036))
*   Addressed a critical bug where agent plugins were not reloading correctly on `PATCH` updates and resolved a service stop race condition. ([#6040](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6040))
*   Fixed an issue in plugins to use the correct `ZodError.issues` API, ensuring proper error handling for invalid plugin configurations. ([#6035](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6035))

### Runtime and Service Stability
*   Ensured that the runtime database is initialized before task access, preventing potential errors and improving task execution reliability. ([#6039](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6039))
*   Implemented a fix in service interfaces to skip test execution for types-only packages, optimizing the build process. ([#6034](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6034))

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### TypeScript Import Errors in Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031))
Discussion continued regarding import errors in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61. The user `matteo-brandolino` provided detailed `bun x tsc --noEmit` output, showing 28 errors across 4 files, indicating that various core modules like `logger`, `IAgentRuntime`, `Project`, and `Plugin` are not being exported or found. This suggests a potential issue with the type definition files within the `@elizaos/core` package, possibly referencing non-existent source files in the published package. The user noted that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolves the problem, narrowing down the issue to version 1.6.1 specifically. `0xbbjoker` had previously suggested running `bun x tsc --noEmit` to diagnose the issue, suspecting an IDE TSC compiler problem, but the provided output confirms a deeper package-related issue.

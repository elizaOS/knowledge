# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 6, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant activity in core development with multiple new pull requests focusing on configuration, plugin architecture, and agent identification. Efforts were also made to address a persistent import issue in the CLI.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Architecture Enhancements
New pull requests introduce significant changes to the core architecture, including a refactor of the ElizaOS/Server to incorporate new config and plugin modules, and a migration to UUID-only agent identification for streamlined management.
- feat(core): add config and plugin modules - phase 4 - refactor ElizaOS/Server ([#6037](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6037))
- feat: migrate to UUID-only agent identification ([#6036](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6036))

### Bug Fixes and Runtime Stability
Several fixes were proposed to enhance runtime stability and correct API usage, specifically ensuring the runtime database is initialized before task access and rectifying ZodError API calls.
- fix(task): ensure runtime database is initialized before task access ([#6039](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6039))
- fix(plugins): use correct ZodError.issues API instead of .errors ([#6035](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6035))
- fix(service-interfaces): skip test execution for types-only package ([#6034](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6034))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **fix(task): ensure runtime database is initialized before task access** ([#6039](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6039)): This PR aims to resolve an issue where the runtime database might not be initialized before a task attempts to access it, potentially leading to errors.
- **feat(core): add config and plugin modules - phase 4 - refactor ElizaOS/Server** ([#6037](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6037)): This feature PR continues the modularization effort by integrating new configuration and plugin modules into the ElizaOS/Server, representing a significant refactoring phase.
- **feat: migrate to UUID-only agent identification** ([#6036](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6036)): This PR proposes a migration to use only UUIDs for agent identification, standardizing and simplifying agent management.
- **fix(plugins): use correct ZodError.issues API instead of .errors** ([#6035](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6035)): This bug fix addresses an incorrect API call within the plugins, switching from `.errors` to `.issues` for ZodError handling.
- **fix(service-interfaces): skip test execution for types-only package** ([#6034](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6034)): This PR introduces a fix to skip test execution for packages that only contain type definitions, optimizing the build process.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031))
The discussion on this issue continues to revolve around a persistent problem where imports in `index.ts` fail when using `elizaos create` with Eliza CLI 1.6.1.

- **Initial Diagnosis and User Feedback:** @matteo-brandolino provided detailed `tsc --noEmit` output, confirming numerous `TS2305` errors for missing exports like `logger`, `IAgentRuntime`, `Project`, and `ProjectAgent` from `@elizaos/core`. They noted that versions before 1.6.1 and later versions do not exhibit this problem, suggesting a version-specific bug.
- **Team Investigation:** @0xbbjoker initially could not reproduce the issue and suggested checking Node/Bun versions and reinstalling dependencies. They also asked for the user's environment details.
- **Root Cause Identified by Claude:** An AI assistant, Claude, was tasked to diagnose the issue. Claude concluded that the root cause is **missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files** in `@elizaos/core@1.6.1`. It explained that while the exports are present in the source code, they were not properly exposed in the published package's `.d.ts` files due to an incomplete build or failed declaration generation during the 1.6.1 release.
- **Recommendations:** Claude recommended that users upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later as an immediate solution and suggested the ElizaOS team consider deprecating v1.6.1 from npm. It also advised adding publish-time validation to prevent similar issues in the future.
- **Further User Interaction:** @wtfsayo followed up with @matteo-brandolino, asking if the OS was Windows, indicating continued investigation into environmental factors despite Claude's diagnosis. @matteo-brandolino provided their Node, Bun, and OS details (x86_64).

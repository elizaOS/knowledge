# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant performance enhancements and API improvements, including asynchronous embedding generation, enhanced session management with advanced timeout configurations, and a new service load promise interface.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Performance and Runtime Enhancements
Key improvements were made to optimize performance, particularly in message processing. Asynchronous embedding generation was introduced to prevent runtime blocking, significantly reducing latency. A new `getServiceLoadPromise` interface was added to the runtime for better service management.
- Asynchronous embedding generation via queue service to improve message processing latency ([#5793](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5793)).
- Added `getServiceLoadPromise` interface to runtime and fixed component queries in `plugin-sql` ([#5801](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5801)).

### Enhanced Session Management
The sessions API received a major upgrade, introducing comprehensive timeout management, auto-renewal capabilities, and robust error handling for improved session control.
- Significant enhancements to the sessions API with advanced timeout configuration and lifecycle control ([#5799](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5799)).

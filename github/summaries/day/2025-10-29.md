# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing ElizaOS's multi-tenancy capabilities with PostgreSQL RLS, improving server health checks, and fixing a critical bug in DM channel creation, alongside minor updates to action options.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Multi-Tenancy and Server Stability
Significant progress was made in bolstering ElizaOS's multi-tenancy architecture by implementing PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) for tenant isolation, allowing multiple independent ElizaOS servers to securely share a single database ([#6101](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6101)). Additionally, public health check endpoints were added to the server, resolving issues with load balancer health checks in production deployments ([#6103](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6103)).

### Client-Side Bug Fixes and Feature Improvements
A critical bug preventing the creation of DM channels in the GUI client was resolved by correctly using the actual server ID ([#6105](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6105)). Furthermore, custom options can now be added to `Action` via an index signature, providing more flexibility ([#6104](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6104)).

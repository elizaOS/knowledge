# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing ElizaOS's multi-tenancy capabilities with PostgreSQL RLS, improving server health checks, and fixing a critical bug in DM channel creation, alongside minor updates to action options.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Multi-Tenancy and Server Stability
Significant progress was made in bolstering the ElizaOS server's multi-tenancy and stability. A major feature introduced PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenant isolation, allowing multiple independent ElizaOS servers to securely share a single PostgreSQL database [#6101](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6101). Additionally, public health check endpoints were added to the server, resolving issues where load balancers failed due to authentication requirements [#6103](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6103).

### Client-Side Bug Fixes and Core Improvements
A critical bug preventing the creation of DM channels in the GUI client was resolved by ensuring the actual server ID is used [#6105](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6105). Furthermore, the core `Action` component now supports arbitrary custom options via an index signature, increasing flexibility [#6104](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6104).

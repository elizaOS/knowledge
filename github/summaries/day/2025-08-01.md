# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 1, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing developer experience with automatic CLI dependency installation and build optimizations, alongside significant cleanup of obsolete files and documentation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Developer Experience & Build Optimizations
Improvements were made to streamline the development process. The `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency when using `start` or `dev` commands in non-monorepo environments, simplifying setup for new projects. Build processes were optimized by removing the docs filter, leading to more efficient builds. ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702), [#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701))

### Repository Cleanup & Obsolete File Removal
Significant effort was put into cleaning up the repository. Obsolete GitHub workflow files, including those for CLI deployment, documentation publishing, and LLM text generation, were removed. Outdated documentation, such as LangChain integration references and extensive Tauri CI/CD details, was also purged from the `README.md`.

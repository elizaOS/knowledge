## CLOSED ISSUES

### UI/UX Enhancements and Simplification
*   Several issues related to user interface clutter and navigation were resolved, including cleaning up redundant user information in the sidebar, moving billing/credits to a more accessible location, and removing "Quick Presets" from the Generation Studio to simplify the UI. Visual consistency was also improved by adding "$" symbols to credit balances and implementing a distinct theme for "Build Mode." ([#6174](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6174), [#6175](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6175), [#6176](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6176), [#6177](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6177), [#6179](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6179))

### Deployment and Server Stability
*   A bug causing certain container types to fail deployment on specific architectures was fixed. Additionally, server-side improvements were made to address concurrent connection timeouts and enhance reliability patterns, including proper Socket.IO configuration and HTTP server timeouts. ([#6187](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6187), [#6198](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6198))

### Minor UI Fixes and Content Management
*   A pointer event issue with the "Dashboard" button was resolved. The "Community Agents" section was addressed, either by populating it or removing it to avoid empty sections. ([#6188](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6188), [#6182](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6182))

On December 2, 2025, ElizaOS focused heavily on refining the user experience and bolstering system stability, with significant progress made in decluttering the UI, improving visual consistency, and resolving critical deployment and server reliability issues.

## ✅ Completed Work
### UI/UX Enhancements and Simplification
*   User interface clutter was reduced by cleaning up redundant user information, relocating billing/credits, and removing "Quick Presets" from the Generation Studio, alongside improving visual consistency with "$" symbols for credit balances and a distinct "Build Mode" theme ([elizaos/eliza#6174](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6174), [elizaos/eliza#6175](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6175), [elizaos/eliza#6176](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6176), [elizaos/eliza#6177](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6177), [elizaos/eliza#6179](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6179)).
*   A pointer event issue with the "Dashboard" button was resolved, and the "Community Agents" section was addressed to prevent empty displays ([elizaos/eliza#6188](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6188), [elizaos/eliza#6182](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6182)).

### Deployment and Server Stability
*   A bug preventing certain container types from deploying on specific architectures was fixed, and server-side reliability was enhanced through improvements to concurrent connection timeouts, proper Socket.IO configuration, and HTTP server timeouts ([elizaos/eliza#6187](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6187), [elizaos/eliza#6198](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6198)).

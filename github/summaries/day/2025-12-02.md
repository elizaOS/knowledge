### UI/UX Enhancements and Simplification
Several issues were closed related to improving the user interface and experience. This included cleaning up redundant user information in the sidebar, moving billing and credits to a more accessible location, and removing "Quick Presets" from the Generation Studio to simplify the UI. Additionally, a distinct visual theme for "Build Mode" was implemented, and the "$" symbol was added to credit balances for clarity. ([#6174](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6174), [#6175](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6175), [#6176](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6176), [#6177](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6177), [#6179](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6179))

### Bug Fixes and System Stability
A critical bug causing container deployment failures on specific architectures was resolved. Furthermore, a "Dashboard" button pointer event issue was fixed, and efforts were made to populate the "Community Agents" section or remove it if not feasible. ([#6187](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6187), [#6188](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6188), [#6182](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6182))

### Server Reliability Improvements
Work was completed to address concurrent connection timeouts and enhance server reliability. This involved configuring Socket.IO properly with ping/pong intervals and timeouts, as well as adding explicit HTTP server timeouts and socket disconnection handling. ([#6198](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6198))

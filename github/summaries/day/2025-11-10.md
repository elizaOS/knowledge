ElizaOS Daily Project Summary - Nov 10, 2025

Today, the project saw significant progress in enhancing PDF text extraction capabilities by migrating to `unpdf` for broader environment support and reduced dependency size. Several critical bug fixes were addressed in the `eliza` core, including improvements to environment variable loading and Row-Level Security validation, while a new `onStepFinish` callback was introduced for text generation functions in `plugin-openrouter`.

## 🚨 Needs Attention 
- **Urgent Discussions**: The "Web UI Endpoint Blocking Bug Investigation" ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter#6138](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/issues/6138), [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#6138](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6138), [elizaos/eliza#6138](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6138)) is still under investigation despite being prematurely closed, and needs further attention if it resurfaces.
- **Urgent Discussions**: The "Agent Response Error" ([elizaos/eliza#6140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6140)) reports a critical error where the agent does not respond, requiring immediate investigation.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core System Stability & Security
- **Environment Variable Handling**: Fixed how environment variables are loaded by switching from `.env` files to `process.env` to ensure proper configuration ([elizaos/eliza#6141](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6141)).
- **Row-Level Security (RLS) Enhancements**: Proposed a fix for an issue where RLS `server_id` validation checks were blocking all users when RLS isolation was disabled ([elizaos/eliza#6139](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6139)).
- **API Stability Improvements**: Removed a message emit in the `src` API to prevent race conditions ([elizaos/eliza#6137](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6137)).

### Plugin Enhancements
- **Enhanced PDF Text Extraction**: Migrated from `pdfjs-dist` to `unpdf` for universal PDF text extraction, enabling support across browser, serverless, and Node.js environments, and significantly reducing dependency size ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#46](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/46)).

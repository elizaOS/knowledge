## ✅ Completed Work
### Core AI Agent Enhancements
- **Enhanced Streaming for Text Generation**: A major feature was introduced to enhance streaming support for text generation models across core, server, client, and API client packages, providing an opt-in streaming API via a `stream: true` parameter while maintaining backward compatibility. ([elizaos/eliza#6212](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6212))
- **Anthropic Plugin Configuration**: The Anthropic plugin now supports configurable CoT (Chain of Thought) budgets and the `topP` option for text generation models, offering more granular control. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic#11](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-anthropic/pull/11))

### Discord Plugin & Memory Management
- **Discord Channel History and Memory Management**: Implemented a Discord channel history spider with persisted state, centralized the process of building memories from messages, and upgraded utilities for attachments and voice transcription with better logging and chunking capabilities. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord#30](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/30))

### Website & Configuration Improvements
- **User Profile Functionality**: Added a new feature to allow users to copy their profile data to LLMs and updated the site name from "Contributor Analytics" to "HiScores." ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#183](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/183))
- **Streamlined Configuration Management**: The site's `SITE_NAME` can now be configured directly from the pipeline config file, removing the dependency on GitHub secrets and simplifying setup for forks. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#182](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/182))
- **Repository Cleanup**: Various development-related files and directories were cleaned up, contributing to a more organized and efficient codebase. ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#181](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/181))

### Testing Infrastructure
- **CLI Test Runner Improvements**: Improvements were made to the CLI test runner, specifically within the e2e-tests actions and general test runner utilities, contributing to a more robust testing environment. ([elizaos/eliza#6212](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6212))

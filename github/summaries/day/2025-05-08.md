# ElizaOS Daily Update (May 8, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development efforts focused on enhancing documentation, fixing bugs, and refining CLI functionalities. Notable improvements include the addition of docstrings for better code clarity and the resolution of type errors in the CLI. The team also made significant strides in removing deprecated features and streamlining the publishing process.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Enhancements
- Added docstrings to functions in the CLI and migration scripts to improve code readability ([#4498](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4498), [#4494](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4494)).
- Updated CLI usage examples to prefer direct command usage instead of `npx` ([#4493](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4493)).

### Bug Fixes

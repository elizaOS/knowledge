Today, ElizaOS saw significant internal improvements with a major refactor to standardize logging across core components and the CLI, alongside a critical rollback in `plugin-sql` build configurations. Discussions also emerged regarding future platform expansion into mobile and voice support, indicating a forward-looking approach to the framework's capabilities.

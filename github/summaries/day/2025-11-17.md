# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day's development focused on a critical dependency migration, updating LangChain from v0.3 to `@langchain/textsplitters v1.0` to ensure compatibility and leverage newer functionalities. This update addressed a long-standing deprecation issue, enhancing the stability of the `@elizaos/core` package.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dependency Migration and Core Updates
The core package underwent a significant update, migrating from the deprecated LangChain v0.3 to `@langchain/textsplitters v1.0`. This involved replacing the `langchain` dependency with `@langchain/textsplitters` in `@elizaos/core`, updating import paths, and removing outdated LangChain resolutions from plugin starter packages. This change ensures the project utilizes current and supported libraries. ([#6152](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6152))

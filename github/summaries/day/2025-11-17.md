# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical dependency updates, specifically migrating from an outdated LangChain version to a more modular text splitting library, ensuring the core functionality remains robust and current.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### LangChain Dependency Migration
The core package has been updated to migrate from the deprecated `langchain` v0.3 to `@langchain/textsplitters` v1.0. This involved replacing the `langchain` dependency, updating import paths, and removing outdated `langchain` resolutions from plugin starter packages. This change ensures compatibility with newer LangChain versions and improves modularity. ([#6152](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6152))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#6157](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6157), was opened to bump the `glob` dependency from 11.0.3 to 11.1.0 within the `/packages/core` directory.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### LangChain Version Deprecation Addressed
The issue concerning the deprecation of LangChain v0.3 and the need to migrate to a newer version or `langchain-classic` has been closed. This was resolved by the migration to `@langchain/textsplitters` v1.0. ([#6145](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6145))

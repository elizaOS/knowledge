On November 17, 2025, ElizaOS saw significant progress in core dependency management with the migration from an outdated LangChain version to a more modular text splitting library, alongside a new feature in `plugin-knowledge` to expose available documents as a state value for easier prompt binding. An emerging theme is the community's interest in Deepseek API integration across different plugins.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#6156](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/6156): An inquiry about Deepseek API integration suggests using `plugin-openrouter` or providing the API endpoint if Deepseek is OpenAI compatible.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core Dependency Updates
- The core `eliza` package migrated from the deprecated `langchain` v0.3 to `@langchain/textsplitters` v1.0, enhancing modularity and compatibility with newer LangChain versions. ([elizaos/eliza#6152](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6152))
- The issue concerning the deprecation of LangChain v0.3 was closed following the successful migration to `@langchain/textsplitters` v1.0. ([elizaos/eliza#6145](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6145))

### Plugin Enhancements
- The `plugin-knowledge` now exposes available documents as a state value, making prompt binding easier by returning formatted documents with a count via new `values` fields and updated error handling.

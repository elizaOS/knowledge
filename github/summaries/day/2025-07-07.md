# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 7, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the CLI user experience with improved feedback and preventing unintended file creation. Critical bug fixes addressed client build issues and server-side logic. Two new features were introduced, alongside routine maintenance and release preparations.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CLI Experience and Stability Improvements
The CLI received significant updates to enhance user experience and prevent unintended side effects. A new feature ([#5431](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5431)) replaced verbose console logs with clean spinners and restructured command flows for better task sequencing. A critical bug fix ([#5427](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5427)) was implemented to prevent the `elizaos update` command from creating project files in non-project directories.

### Client-Side Compatibility and Dependency Management
Efforts were made to improve the client's browser compatibility and resolve build issues. A bug fix ([#5424](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5424)) downgraded `vite-plugin-node-polyfills` to address compatibility problems with the current Vite version. Further improvements ([#5428](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5428)) included adding CommonJS shims injection and updating several dependencies for better browser compatibility.

### Core System Enhancements and Bug Fixes
A new feature ([#5430](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5430)) introduced a `LOG_TIMESTAMPS` environment variable, allowing users to control the display of timestamps in logs for cleaner output. A bug fix ([#5426](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5426)) addressed an issue where the server incorrectly processed messages if a sender's name included "DM".

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#5435](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5435) Feat/migrate docs to fumadocs: This PR proposes migrating the project documentation to Fumadocs.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### CLI Update Command Resolution
The issue where the `update` command was not working ([#5434](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5434)) was reported and subsequently closed on the same day, indicating a quick resolution.

### Server-Side Message Processing Fix
A bug where agents would not ignore messages if the sender's name included "DM" ([#5425](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5425)) was identified and closed, resolving an issue with server-side message interpretation.

## NEW ISSUES

### Server Startup and Plugin Issues
A new issue ([#5432](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5432)) was opened regarding the server crashing if a Telegram token is not found, specifically related to the `plugin-telegram`.

### CLI Update Command Failure
An issue was reported ([#5434](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5434)) where the `update` command was not functioning as expected. This issue was quickly closed on the same day it was opened.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Windows Plugin Loading Failures ([#5407](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5407))
Discussions continued regarding the failure to load `@elizaos/plugin-openai` and `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` on Windows. A user confirmed the issue persists even after the v1.0.19 release, providing screenshots to illustrate the problem. The team is actively researching a fix.

### Twitter Client Initialization Errors ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/31))
Users are still experiencing errors with the Twitter plugin, specifically "Failed to create Twitter client." A user reported that the latest 1.0.14 plugin-twitter fixed the initial issue but introduced a new error related to database insertion during memory creation. There's a general sentiment that the free subscription might limit features like fetching the Home Timeline.

### Failed to create Twitter Client (1.0.14) ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/36))
This issue, similar to [#31](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/31), also reports problems with Twitter client creation after updating to version 1.0.14 of the plugin. Multiple users confirmed experiencing the same error.

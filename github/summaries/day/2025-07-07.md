# ElizaOS Daily Update (Jul 7, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Significant progress was made in enhancing the CLI user experience and improving overall stability. Several bug fixes were implemented, and dependencies were updated.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CLI User Experience Improvements
*   Enhanced the CLI user experience with clean clack spinners and proper task sequencing ([#5431](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5431)).
*   Prevented the CLI update command from creating files in non-project directories when run outside of an ElizaOS project ([#5427](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5427)).

### Stability and Compatibility Fixes
*   Improved browser compatibility for the client package by adding CommonJS shims injection plugin and configuring the `define` option in the Vite config ([#5428](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5428)).
*   Downgraded `vite-plugin-node-polyfills` to resolve client build issues ([#5424](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5424)).

### Logging and Configuration
*   Added `LOG_TIMESTAMPS` environment variable to control whether timestamps are displayed in logs ([#5430](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5430)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### AgentServer Communication
*   Addressed an issue where including "DM" in a user's name caused agents to always interpret the conversation as a direct message ([#5425](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5425)).

### CLI Update
*   Addressed an issue where the update command was not working ([#5434](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5434)).

## NEW ISSUES

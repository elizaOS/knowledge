On Jan 22, 2026, the ElizaOS project focused heavily on critical API stability and data consistency across both the `eliza` and `elizaos.github.io` repositories. Key achievements include resolving 404 errors for API endpoints, ensuring consistent overall summary generation even for days with no activity, and fixing issues with Python examples and plugin integration. The primary goal was to enhance the reliability and robustness of our data pipelines and API services.

## ✅ Completed Work
### API Data Consistency and Availability
- Fixed 404 errors for `/api/index.json` and `/api/contributors/{username}/profile.json` by dynamically detecting `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines.yml` workflow, ensuring proper generation of the API index and all contributor profiles ([elizaos/eliza#225](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/225), [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#225](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/225)).
- Ensured overall summary API endpoints no longer return 404 for days with no repository activity, instead providing a "No activity recorded" message for consistent API behavior ([elizaos/eliza#226](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/226), [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#226](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/226)).
- Resolved a pipeline ordering issue that caused contributor summaries to be `null` in exported stats files, ensuring they are now correctly re-exported after generation ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#228](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/228)).
- Addressed a significant bug preventing proper export of API index and contributor profiles due to a missing `SITE_URL` in the `run-pipelines` workflow, ensuring all 1,433 contributor profiles and the main API index are correctly generated ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#229](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/229)).

### Python Example and Plugin Enhancements
- Improved Python examples and plugins by adding quickstart documentation, fixing the chat example to use the `inmemorydb` plugin correctly, and enabling `.env` file support via dotenv loading. The `inmemorydb` plugin was also updated to use the correct `Plugin` interface ([elizaos/eliza#6358](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358)).

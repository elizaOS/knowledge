On Jan 22, 2026, the ElizaOS project made significant strides in API reliability and data consistency across all repositories, primarily by resolving issues with API index and overall summary generation. Key efforts focused on ensuring consistent data access, particularly for days with no repository activity, and enhancing Python example testing. New pull requests were opened to address fixes for upcoming v2.0.0 releases and introduce a new Cerebras plugin.

## ✅ Completed Work

### API Data Export and Consistency Fixes
*   Resolved issues where API index and contributor profiles were not exported due to missing `SITE_URL` in `run-pipelines` workflow, ensuring correct generation and accessibility of all 1,433 contributor profiles and the main API index. [elizaos/eliza#225](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/225), [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#225](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/225), [elizaos-plugins/registry#225](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/225)
*   Fixed the problem of overall summaries not being generated for days with no repository activity, ensuring consistent API responses and preventing 404 errors. [elizaos/eliza#226](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/226), [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#226](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/226), [elizaos-plugins/registry#226](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/226)
*   Corrected pipeline ordering to ensure contributor summaries are properly included in exported stats files. [elizaos/elizaos.github.io#228](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/228)

### Python Example and Plugin Enhancements
*   Added Python quickstart documentation and fixed the chat example to include `inmemorydb` plugin and `dotenv` loading. [elizaos/eliza#6358](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358)
*   Corrected the `inmemorydb` plugin to use proper `Plugin` functionality. [elizaos/eliza#6358](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6358)

### Agent Message Processing Optimization
*   Closed issues related to provider batching for `composeState` and the parallelization of message processing, including `saveMessage`, `getUserState`, and `processAttachments`. [elizaos/eliza#6336](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6336), [elizaos/eliza#6337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6337)

### Migration Eligibility Discrepancy
*   Closed an issue concerning a migration eligibility mismatch and snapshot bug reported by a user with a Tangem hardware wallet. [elizaos/eliza#6369](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6369)

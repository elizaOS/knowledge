# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The primary focus today was on enhancing testing infrastructure with the addition of a new `@elizaos/test-utils` package, centralizing mock runtime utilities. This significantly improves testability across core and plugin modules.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Centralized Test Utilities
A new `@elizaos/test-utils` package was introduced to consolidate pre-existing `bun:test` friendly `MockRuntime` and other testing utilities. This aims to reduce redundancy and improve consistency in testing across various ElizaOS components, particularly in `core` and `plugin-sql` modules.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Twitter Client Authentication Fix
The issue regarding the failure to create a Twitter Client, particularly after migrating to V2 and updating the Twitter plugin, has been resolved. The fix is confirmed with the 1.2.0 update. ([#36](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/36))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Twitter Timeline Fetching and Rate Limits
Discussions continue around the "Failed to fetch Home timeline" issue, which often leads to 429 API limit errors. Users are still experiencing "Too Many Requests" even with the latest version (1.2.16) which introduced a new system for timeline fetching. The conversation is currently focused on whether a paid Twitter subscription (Basic/Pro tier) is required to avoid these rate limits, with one user confirming that the $200/month tier works.

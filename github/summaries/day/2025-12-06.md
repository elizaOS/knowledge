On December 6, 2025, ElizaOS significantly enhanced its CLI by integrating ElizaOS Cloud as the default AI provider, streamlining the setup process with a new browser-based login flow and improving configuration reliability. Additionally, a draft PR was opened to implement parallel action execution, indicating a focus on core framework performance improvements.

## ✅ Completed Work

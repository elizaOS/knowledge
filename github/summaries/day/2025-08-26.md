# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 26, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a significant build system overhaul, migrating ElizaOS packages to a Bun-based build. Key improvements were also made to plugin action handling and template management, enhancing modularity and character customization.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Build System Modernization with Bun:** A major initiative replaced the existing `tsup` build system with a new, standardized Bun-based approach across ElizaOS packages. This streamlines the build process and introduces reusable utilities for `@elizaos/api-client` and `@elizaos/cli`. ([#5807](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5807))

*   **Enhanced Plugin Action Handling:** The `GENERATE_IMAGE` handler within `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` was updated to consistently return an `ActionResult`, aligning it with the core `Action` contract and improving reliability. ([#5823](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5823))

*   **Improved Template Modularity and Character Customization:** Core multi-step templates (`multiStepDecisionTemplate` and `multiStepSummaryTemplate`) were moved to the core layer for better modularity. This change also enables characters to define their own template overrides, offering greater flexibility. ([#5822](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5822))

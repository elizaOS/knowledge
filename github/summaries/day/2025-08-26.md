# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 26, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a significant build system overhaul, transitioning to Bun, alongside critical bug fixes and enhancements to template management for character configurations.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Build System Modernization with Bun
A major initiative was completed to standardize the build process across ElizaOS packages by migrating from `tsup` to a Bun-based build system. This introduces reusable build utilities and custom scripts, streamlining development and improving consistency. ([#5807](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5807))

### Plugin Action Reliability Improvements
The `GENERATE_IMAGE` handler within the `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` was updated to correctly return an `ActionResult`, ensuring adherence to the core `Action` contract and improving the reliability of image generation actions. ([#5823](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5823))

### Enhanced Template Management and Character Configuration
Core multi-step templates (`multiStepDecisionTemplate` and `multiStepSummaryTemplate`) were moved to the core layer for better modularity. This change also enables character-level overrides for these templates and introduces an environment-based strategy toggle, offering greater flexibility in character behavior. ([#5822](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5822))

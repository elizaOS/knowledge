On November 25, 2025, the ElizaOS project focused on internal improvements, including standardizing logging across core components and enhancing the reliability of Discord command registration. A recurring theme emerged with multiple requests for OpenAI-compatible API integration, indicating a potential area for future development.

## 🚨 Needs Attention

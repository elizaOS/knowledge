# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing core services with a new MessageService interface and optional embedding service, alongside critical bug fixes for session API responses and significant code formatting improvements.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Service Enhancements
The core framework saw significant updates with the addition of a `MessageService` interface and its default implementation, improving message handling capabilities. Support for the `PATCH` method was also added to the `Route` type, expanding API flexibility. Furthermore, the embedding service was made optional, functioning as a no-op when no `TEXT_EMBEDDING` model is registered, optimizing resource usage.

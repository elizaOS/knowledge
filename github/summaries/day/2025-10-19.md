# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing core services with a new MessageService interface, adding PATCH method support, and making the embedding service optional. Significant effort was also put into code formatting and merging the `develop` branch into `main`.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Service Enhancements
The `core` module saw significant updates, including the addition of a `MessageService` interface and its default implementation, improving message handling capabilities. Support for the `PATCH` method was also added to the `Route` type, expanding API flexibility.
- Added `MessageService` interface and default implementation ([#6048](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6048))
- Added `PATCH` method support to `Route` type ([#6076](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6076))

### Embedding Service Optimization
The embedding service was made optional, now functioning as a no-op when no `TEXT_EMBEDDING` model is registered. This change optimizes resource usage and improves flexibility for deployments without text embedding capabilities.
- Embedding service made optional when no `TEXT_EMBEDDING` model is present ([#6075](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6075))

### API Response Consistency and Codebase Maintenance
A bug fix was implemented to ensure `channelId` is consistently included in session API responses, improving data consistency. Additionally, a major effort was undertaken to standardize code formatting across the entire codebase, and the `develop` branch was merged into `main`.
- Added missing `channelId` to session API responses ([#6079](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6079))
- Merged `develop` into `main` ([#6078](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6078))
- Applied consistent code formatting and style across the codebase ([#6077](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6077))

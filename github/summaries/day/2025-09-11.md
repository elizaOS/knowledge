# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 11, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, specifically addressing test flakiness and cache-aware environment variable reads. Several new issues were opened, outlining future architectural refactoring for database adapters, core entities, and SDK integration, alongside a minor documentation fix.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Stability and Test Reliability
A significant bug fix was implemented to enhance the stability of the core system and improve test reliability. This involved making `SECRET_SALT` reads cache-aware to accurately reflect environment changes during tests, which also resolved flakiness in `plugin-bootstrap` tests. This change impacts `packages/core/src/settings.ts` and several test files within `packages/plugin-bootstrap`. ([#5968](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5968))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Documentation Improvements
A broken link related to LLM documentation was fixed, improving the accessibility of information for users. Additionally, miscellaneous documentation nitpicks were addressed and closed. ([#5954](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5954), [#5967](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5967))

## NEW ISSUES

### Architectural Refinements and SDK Integration
Several new issues were opened to outline future architectural improvements. These include the implementation of a WASM PGLite adapter for browser database functionality, ensuring single-connection handling and compatibility with migrations and embeddings. Another key area is the refactoring of duplicated database entities (rooms, worlds, channels, servers) into more consolidated abstractions to simplify bus logic. Furthermore, support for an SDK-first hooks mode is planned, allowing direct instantiation of Eliza in the browser without relying on REST, alongside separate server hooks for REST/SSE integration. ([#5964](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5964), [#5965](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5965), [#5966](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5966))

### Plugin and Data Management
A new issue was created to track the task of sending a list of partners to the backend for plugins, indicating upcoming work on data exchange and integration with external components. ([#5969](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5969))

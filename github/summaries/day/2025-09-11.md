# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 11, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, specifically addressing test flakiness and cache-aware environment variable reads. Several new issues were opened, outlining future development directions including a browser database adapter, a refactor of core entities, and an SDK-first hooks mode.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Stability and Test Reliability
A significant bug fix was implemented to improve the stability of core tests. This involved making `SECRET_SALT` reads cache-aware to accurately reflect environment changes during testing and resolving flakiness in `plugin-bootstrap` tests ([#5968](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5968)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Documentation Improvements
A broken link in the documentation related to LLMs was fixed ([#5954](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5954)). Additionally, miscellaneous documentation nitpicks were addressed ([#5967](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5967)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Database and Core Architecture Enhancements
New issues were opened to explore significant architectural improvements, including:
*   Implementing a WASM PGLite adapter for browser runtime and ensuring single-connection handling ([#5964](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5964)).
*   Consolidating duplicated database entities (rooms, worlds, channels, servers) into two core abstractions ([#5965](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5965)).

### SDK and Plugin Development
Future development will also focus on:
*   Supporting direct Eliza instantiation in the browser via hooks (SDK-first mode) ([#5966](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5966)).
*   Sending a list of partners to the Business Development team (plugins) ([#5969](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5969)).

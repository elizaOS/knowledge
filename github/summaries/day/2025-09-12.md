## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

[#5972](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5972) introduces an `elizaos` alias package, and [#5970](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5970) adds browser build support with PGlite WASM. Both are currently open and awaiting review.

## CLOSED ISSUES
- **Plugin Integration:** The issue related to the `plugin-rofl` repository was closed [#5949](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5949).

## NEW ISSUES
- **User Experience:** A new issue was opened to address the display of "update available" notifications for alpha versions, specifically when users are not on the alpha distribution [#5971](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5971).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Release Automation:** Discussion continued on [#5937](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5937) regarding release automation. A recent comment from "linear" at 2025-09-12T00:38:12Z provided feedback on proposed improvements:
    - Agreed on the need for an automated changelog CI step for announcements.
    - Questioned whether release notes clarity and consistency are primarily set by Product.
    - Sought clarification on whether "versioned documentation" implies maintaining multiple versions or simply correct labeling.

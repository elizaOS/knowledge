# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, development focused on improving package discoverability with a new npm alias. A new pull request was opened to add browser build support with PGlite WASM, and a discussion continued on release automation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Package Aliasing for Improved Discoverability
A new `elizaos` alias package has been created to delegate to `@elizaos/cli`, simplifying the npm name for better discoverability while maintaining identical CLI functionality. ([#5972](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5972))

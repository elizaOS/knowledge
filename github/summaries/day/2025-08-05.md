# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day focused on addressing critical infrastructure issues, with significant progress made in diagnosing and proposing solutions for agent startup hangs and plugin loading complexities. Two new pull requests were opened to improve E2E testing and MySQL plugin support.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No completed work to report for features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation, or tests.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Two new pull requests were opened today:
*   **E2E Testing Enhancements**: A new PR, [#5720](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5720), aims to enable End-to-End testing for all starter templates, improving the reliability and stability of new projects.
*   **MySQL Plugin Support**: Another PR, [#5718](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5718), introduces support for the `plugin-mysql`, expanding database integration capabilities for ElizaOS agents.

## CLOSED ISSUES
Two issues related to agent development were closed today:
*   **Agent Development Closure**: The issues [#5494](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5494) ("Jimmy Agent") and [#5643](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5643) ("base agent -- clank tank") were closed, indicating the completion or resolution of these specific agent development tasks.

## NEW ISSUES
Two new issues were reported today:
*   **Agent Startup Hanging Issues**: Issue [#5719](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5719) details a critical problem where calling `startAgent` from the CLI command `start` results in the process hanging. This occurs both when `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` is omitted (hanging early) and when it is included (hanging later).
*   **API Client Session Availability**: Issue [#5721](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5721) requests that the sessions API be made available to the `api-client` package, likely to enable better session management and interaction within client applications.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
*   **`startAgent` Hanging Issue Analysis** ([#5719](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5719)): This issue is actively being investigated. Claude provided a detailed root cause analysis, identifying `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` as critical infrastructure and the primary cause of hanging behavior due to its absence or issues during its initialization. The analysis points to complex plugin loading logic, workspace dependency resolution, and file system operations as potential hanging points. Claude proposed immediate fixes including adding bootstrap plugin validation, implementing timeouts for plugin loading, and enhancing debug logging. Medium-term improvements like making the bootstrap plugin mandatory and optimizing plugin loading performance were also suggested. The core recommendation is to either automatically include the bootstrap plugin or fail fast with a clear error if it's missing. Odilitime noted that nothing in bootstrap should unlock other plugins, suggesting a deeper look into the plugin loading mechanism.

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant security and data architecture enhancements with the implementation of Entity-level Row Level Security, alongside a crucial bug fix for dynamic prompt normalization.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Security and Data Architecture
A major feature was introduced to bolster ElizaOS's security and data architecture. This includes Entity-Level Row Level Security (RLS) using PostgreSQL policies for entity-based data isolation, and semantic C. This work involved extensive changes across the `client`, `api-client`, `cli`, and `examples` directories. ([#6167](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6167))

### Dynamic Prompt Normalization Fix
A bug related to dynamic prompt normalization was addressed. This fix ensures that structured responses from `dynamicPromptExecFromState` are correctly normalized for both XML and JSON outputs. It also relaxes required field validation to allow legitimate falsy values and includes new regression tests. ([#6192](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6192))

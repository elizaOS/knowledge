# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today saw significant progress in agent identification with a migration to UUIDs, asynchronous evaluator execution for improved performance, and crucial bug fixes in memory viewing and plugin scaffolding. Several issues were closed, including multi-repo support and plugin documentation, while new issues emerged regarding logging standardization.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Agent Core & Runtime Enhancements
The core agent identification system has been refactored to use UUIDs instead of names, allowing for duplicate agent names and updating loaders, runtime, server, and database components accordingly [#6036](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6036). Additionally, evaluators now run asynchronously in the background with robust error handling, and the bootstrap message flow triggers evaluator execution non-blockingly [#6066](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6066).

### API and Memory Management Improvements
A bug in the memory viewer was fixed, correctly distinguishing user and agent messages by converting `channelId` to an agent-unique `roomId` and utilizing `entityId` in memory types [#6067](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6067).

### CLI and Plugin Development Workflow Fixes
Several issues related to plugin documentation and scaffolding were addressed. This included fixing template lookup paths, correcting CLI command syntax in various README files, and updating agent lifecycle and help messages [#6071](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6071). A misleading comment in the `MessageBusService` callback was also corrected [#6072](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6072).

### Core Logic Refactoring
Character builder logic, previously duplicated, has been moved to the core package, centralizing business logic and removing redundant code from the server, accompanied by 27 new tests [#6069](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6069).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Documentation and Scaffolding Rectified
A critical issue regarding incorrect plugin documentation and scaffolding was swiftly addressed and closed [#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6070). The fix involved correcting template lookup paths and CLI command syntax across multiple documentation files.

### Framework Consistency and Stability
Several issues related to framework consistency and stability were closed, including efforts to ensure CLI and server respect ElizaOS defaults, consolidate duplicated helpers, and enforce consistent logging [#5934](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5934).

### Feature Implementations Completed
Work on enhancing the `plugin-autocoder` for the classified game was completed [#5685](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5685). Additionally, the integration of Eigen TEE as a deployment option was finalized [#5986](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5986), and a unified Cloud API plugin for framework LLMs was implemented [#6049](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6049).

## NEW ISSUES

### Logging Standardization
A new issue has been opened to standardize the logging system across all packages (Core, CLI, and Server) to ensure a consistent developer experience and improved observability [#6073](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6073).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Multi-Repository Support
The issue for multi-repository support [#108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/108) was closed today, with a comment from `madjin` confirming that multi-repo tracking is now working. This marks a significant milestone in expanding the framework's capabilities.

### Awesome Claude Code Feature
The issue [#149](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/149), announcing the project's feature in Awesome Claude Code, was closed today with a positive comment from `madjin`.

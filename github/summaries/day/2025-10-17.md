# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on core agent identification, asynchronous evaluator execution, and significant bug fixes across memory, documentation, and scaffolding. Several long-standing issues were closed, indicating progress on consistency and new feature integration.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Agent Core and Runtime Enhancements
The core agent identification system has been migrated to use UUIDs exclusively, allowing for duplicate agent names and updating loader, runtime, server, and database components accordingly. Evaluators now run asynchronously in the background with improved error handling, and the bootstrap message flow triggers evaluator execution non-blockingly.

### Bug Fixes and Documentation Improvements
Critical bugs in the memory viewer were addressed, specifically regarding chat and user message filtering by converting `channelId` to `agent-unique roomId` and using `entityId`. Significant fixes were also implemented for plugin documentation and scaffolding, including template lookup paths and correcting CLI command syntax in multiple README files.

- [#6071](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6071)

### Code Refactoring for Character Builder Logic
The character builder logic, specifically `buildCharacterPlugins()`, has been moved to the core package, centralizing business logic and removing duplicate code from the server. This refactoring included adding 27 new tests to the core.

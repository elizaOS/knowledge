# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, ElizaOS focused on enhancing core messaging infrastructure with a unified API, introducing a new Jobs API for one-off agent messaging, and implementing a CLI command for cloud authentication.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Unified Messaging and Agent Communication
A unified messaging API (`elizaOS.sendMessage()`) was implemented to streamline communication across all ElizaOS clients, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability. This is complemented by a new Jobs API for one-off agent messaging, allowing external systems to send single messages and poll for responses without persistent sessions, ideal for stateless integrations.

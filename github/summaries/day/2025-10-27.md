# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, ElizaOS focused on enhancing core messaging infrastructure with a unified API, introducing a new Jobs API for one-off agent messaging, and implementing a CLI login command for cloud authentication.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Unified Messaging and Jobs API
A unified messaging API (`elizaOS.sendMessage()`) was implemented to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability across ElizaOS clients. Concurrently, a new Jobs API was introduced for one-off agent messaging, allowing external systems to send single messages and poll for responses without persistent sessions, ideal for stateless integrations.

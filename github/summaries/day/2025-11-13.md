# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 13, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes related to TypeScript declaration generation and package exports, particularly for the `plugin-sql` module, ensuring smoother integration and build processes.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Plugin-SQL Type and Build Fixes
*   Corrected the `types` path in `plugin-sql`'s `package.json` exports from `./types/index.d.ts` to `./dist/index.d.ts`, resolving TypeScript import errors ([#6134](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6134)).
*   Removed a non-existent 'types' directory from the `files` array in `plugin-sql`'s `package.json` ([#6134](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6134)).
*   Addressed TypeScript declaration generation errors for `plugin-sql` by adjusting build configurations ([#6146](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6146)).

### Test Utilities Enhancement
*   Implemented the missing `hasElizaOS()` method in the `test-utils` mock runtime, providing a required type predicate for the `IAgentRuntime` interface and returning `false` by default for test scenarios ([#6146](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6146)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#6147](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6147) proposes adding an `ownerId` field to the Agent with camelCase mapping for the `plugin-sql` module.
*   [#6144](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6144) introduces an authentication token for the Socket.IO server.
*   [#6143](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6143) aims to add `plugin-mysql` support, `initPromise`, and other minor fixes.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed on this day.

## NEW ISSUES
### Plugin Submission and Integration
*   A new plugin submission for Coin Railz x402 Micropayment Services has been opened ([#6148](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6148)). The submitter, tdnupe3, has offered to provide additional support, including an example agent, documentation, and a quick-start agent for micropayment flows.

### Migration and Token Swap Issues
*   An issue regarding difficulties with AI16Z token migration to ELIZAOS tokens via the official website/migration portal was reported ([#6149](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6149)). This issue was subsequently closed with a recommendation to open a ticket in the Discord server.

### Dependency Management
*   A feature request was opened to address the deprecation of Langchain v0.3, suggesting migration to `langchain-classic` or bumping the version to v1 ([#6145](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6145)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Agent Functionality and Stability
*   Issue [#37](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/37), "Anyone able to get this to work right?", received a new comment from rferrari stating that the system is "working, at lease for now... i could setup using the instructions from readme file." This indicates some progress in setting up the agent using the provided documentation, though the initial problem of inconsistent posting behavior remains a potential concern.

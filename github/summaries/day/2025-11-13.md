# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 13, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, particularly addressing TypeScript declaration generation and package export paths within the `plugin-sql` module, ensuring smoother integration and build processes.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Resolving TypeScript Declaration and Package Export Issues
Significant effort was put into fixing TypeScript declaration generation and correcting package export paths. This included updating `package.json` to point to the correct declaration files and resolving build-time errors for `plugin-sql`.
- Corrected `plugin-sql` types path from `./types/index.d.ts` to `./dist/index.d.ts` in `package.json` exports, resolving TypeScript import errors ([#6134](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6134)).
- Implemented the missing `hasElizaOS()` method in the `test-utils` mock runtime to satisfy the `IAgentRuntime` interface, crucial for TypeScript declaration generation ([#6146](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6146)).
- Fixed `plugin-sql` TypeScript declaration generation issues by adjusting build configurations ([#6146](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6146)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **New Feature for `plugin-sql`**: A new pull request introduces an `ownerId` field to Agent with camelCase mapping for the `plugin-sql` module ([#6147](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6147)).
- **Socket.io Authentication**: A pull request proposes adding an authentication token to the Socket.io server ([#6144](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6144)).
- **`plugin-mysql` Improvements**: A pull request addresses `plugin-mysql` support, `initPromise`, and other minor fixes ([#6143](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6143)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

## NEW ISSUES
### Plugin Submission and Migration Concerns
New issues highlight a plugin submission and user migration difficulties.
- A new plugin submission for Coin Railz x402 Micropayment Services has been proposed, described as a production-ready x402 protocol infrastructure plugin ([#6148](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6148)).
- A user reported issues with migrating AI16Z tokens to ELIZAOS tokens via the official website/migration portal, seeking assistance ([#6149](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6149)).

### LangChain Version Deprecation
An issue was opened regarding the deprecation of LangChain v0.3, suggesting migration to `langchain-classic` or updating to LangChain v1 ([#6145](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6145)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### ElizaOS Functionality Issues
The issue [#37](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/37) continues to be active, with users reporting difficulties in getting ElizaOS to work correctly. The latest comment from `rferrari` indicates that the setup is "working, at least for now" after following the instructions from the readme file. This suggests some progress or a temporary resolution for at least one user, but the underlying inconsistency in functionality remains a concern.

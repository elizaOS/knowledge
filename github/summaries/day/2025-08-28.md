# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 28, 2025)

## OVERVIEW

Today's development focused on enhancing browser compatibility for the core library, refining multi-step action handling, and addressing minor CLI test command issues. A significant dependency update for Vite was also completed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Library Enhancements & Browser Compatibility
Efforts were made to improve the core library's browser compatibility, with a draft feature ([#5828](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5828)) introducing browser-specific entry points and configurations. This involved extensive modifications across various core files, including `index.browser.ts`, `tsconfig.browser.json`, and browser-specific instrumentations.

### Action Handling and CLI Fixes
A critical bug fix ([#5841](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5841)) was implemented to correctly pass values between steps in multi-step actions, enhancing the reliability of complex agent behaviors. Additionally, minor fixes ([#5840](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5840)) were applied to the CLI's test command, resolving issues with test naming and default tests in starter projects.

### Documentation and Dependency Updates
Comprehensive documentation was added to the standalone agent runner ([#5843](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5843)) to improve developer understanding. The `vite` dependency in the `/packages/client` directory was also bumped from 6.0.5 to 6.1.6 ([#5838](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5838)).

On Feb 6, 2026, ElizaOS development focused on enhancing multi-tenant safety within the MCP plugin and improving the core `eliza` engine's dynamic execution and null-check robustness. Significant progress was made in integrating and deploying the Discord plugin, while new critical issues emerged concerning whitelisting, security audits, and EVM module enhancements.

## ✅ Completed Work

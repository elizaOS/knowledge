## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant activity in issue creation, focusing on future development, benchmarking, and agent capabilities. One issue related to API availability was closed, while an ongoing critical issue regarding plugin publishing received detailed guidance.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS
No new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, documentation enhancements, or tests were added today.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### API Client Session Availability
The issue to make sessions API available to the `api-client` package was closed today, indicating completion of this integration. ([#5721](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5721))

## NEW ISSUES
### Core System Development & Benchmarking
Several new issues were opened to guide future core system development, including a move towards a "pure core" for low-level development and browser support ([#5766](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5766)). Additionally, a critical focus on benchmarking was established with the creation of issues for a v2 â†” v3 benchmark suite to measure accuracy, latency, and cost ([#5764](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5764)) and the implementation of Tau-Bench in v2 ([#5765](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5765)).

### Agent & Service Integrations
New issues were created to explore specific agent and service integrations. These include a "Bond Desk Agent" potentially leveraging bond protocol infrastructure ([#5767](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5767)), an "Eigencloud POC" for a deterministic OpenAI-compliant LLM inference endpoint ([#5768](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5768)), and a "Streamflow Docs Agent" for documentation interaction ([#5769](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5769)).

### Telemetry and Dashboarding
Two issues were opened related to data and visualization: setting up telemetry to extract training data for RULER ([#5772](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5772)) and creating a dashboard for Nisita ([#5771](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5771)).

### Plugin Development Support
A new issue was opened seeking guidance on persistent errors during plugin testing, indicating a need for debugging and resolution support for plugin developers ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5770)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Critical: Plugin Publishing Fails with False Success Reports
The issue regarding `elizaos publish --npm` reporting false success while failing to publish due to a 404 error ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5754)) received detailed guidance. The latest comment from yungalgo identified two likely causes: using a scoped package name (`@elizaos/plugin-polygon`) without the corresponding npm organization or access, and an outdated plugin template. The suggested fix involves updating the package name to be unscoped (e.g., `plugin-polygon`) and ensuring the `package.json` matches the current plugin template structure. This guidance aims to resolve the deterministic publishing failures.

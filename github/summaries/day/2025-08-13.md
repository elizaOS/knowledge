## NEW ISSUES
- **Benchmarking and Evaluation**: New issues were opened to establish robust evaluation metrics, including [#5764](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5764) for a v2 â†” v3 benchmark suite to measure accuracy, latency, and cost, and [#5765](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5765) to implement Tau-Bench in v2.
- **Agent Development and Infrastructure**: Several issues were created to explore new agent capabilities and infrastructure, such as [#5767](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5767) for a Bond Desk Agent, [#5769](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5769) for a Streamflow Docs Agent, and [#5768](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5768) for an Eigencloud POC for deterministic OpenAI-compliant LLM inference.
- **Core System and Telemetry**: Issues related to core system improvements and data extraction were opened, including [#5766](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5766) to move to core pure for low-level development and browser support, and [#5772](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5772) to set up telemetry for RULER training data extraction.
- **User Support and Dashboard**: User-reported issues and feature requests include [#5770](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5770) regarding plugin testing errors and [#5771](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5771) for a Dashboard for Nisita.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **Plugin Publishing Failures**: In [#5754](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5754), the discussion centered on the `elizaos publish --npm` command reporting false success despite actual publishing failures (404 errors). The latest comment from yungalgo (2025-08-13T07:33:56Z) provided a detailed analysis, attributing the issue to scoped package naming requiring an existing npm organization and outdated plugin templates. Suggested fixes include updating the package name to be unscoped (e.g., `plugin-polygon` instead of `@elizaos/plugin-polygon`) and ensuring `package.json` matches the current template structure.

## ✅ Completed Work
### API Performance & Reliability
- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge**: Configurable rate limits were introduced for high-throughput APIs, including options to disable limits and settings for concurrent requests, requests per minute, tokens per minute, and batch delay. Default limits were also increased fivefold. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#49](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/49))

### Codebase Refinements & Consistency
- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster**: Significant refactoring was completed to improve maintainability and consistency, including DRY improvements with a centralized helper for FID retrieval and consistent logging practices. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/15))
- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster**: Farcaster interaction handling was unified through Message and Cast services, a thread context provider was added, the build system switched to Bun, and logging/error handling were standardized.

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 6, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on enhancing testing infrastructure, improving database support, and expanding API capabilities. Significant progress was made in ensuring E2E test coverage across all starter templates and integrating the new Sessions API.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
Efforts were made to solidify the testing framework. A critical bug fix ([#5720](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5720)) enabled End-to-End (E2E) testing for all starter templates, addressing previous inconsistencies and allowing for more robust integration validation.

### API Client Expansion and Core Cleanup
The API client was updated to include support for the new Sessions API ([#5717](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5717)), providing a simplified interface for managing conversational state. Concurrently, a significant cleanup operation ([#5724](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5724)) removed unused plugin specification systems from the core package, streamlining the codebase.

### Database Support Improvements
A fix was implemented to ensure proper support for `plugin-mysql` ([#5718](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5718)), allowing for its use before `plugin-sql` is enforced, thus improving flexibility in database integration.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **Feature Development**: A new pull request ([#5723](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5723)) was opened to add a comprehensive scenario testing system, indicating future enhancements to testing capabilities.

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
- **Documentation and Communication**: A new issue ([#5722](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5722)) was opened highlighting that the `CHANGELOG.md` has not been updated since January and questioning the whereabouts of the ElizaOS blog.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
- **`pdfjs-dist` Crashing Plugin**: Issue [#37](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/37) reports a `pdfjs-dist` error causing plugin crashes, specifically a `TypeError: process.getBuiltinModule is not a function`. User `0xbbjoker` attempted to reproduce the issue by clearing agent memories, stopping and restarting the agent with debug logging, and confirmed that document loading and panel functionality worked as expected on their setup (ElizaOS v1.3.2 with specific environment variables). They requested more information on the user's setup, loading methods, and any specific PDF files causing the issue.

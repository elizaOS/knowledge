# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 17, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused heavily on bug fixes, particularly enhancing CLI stability across different operating systems and improving the update mechanism. Significant effort was also put into refining the build process for client and server components.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CLI Stability and Windows Compatibility
Comprehensive improvements were made to the CLI's `dev` command tests, specifically addressing flakiness and process management issues on Windows CI environments. This ensures more reliable development and testing workflows across platforms. ([#5982](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5982))

### Refined Update Mechanism and Build Process
The CLI update checker now respects distribution channels (latest/stable, alpha, beta), preventing users from being prompted for updates outside their current channel. Additionally, critical fixes were implemented for client bundling, dev-loop restarts, and database runtime modes, alongside enforcing TypeScript type-check failures to halt builds and improving build ordering to ensure the web UI is always shipped with the server. ([#5980](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5980), [#5985](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5985))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Web UI Dashboard Documentation
Discussion continues on the lack of documentation for the Web UI dashboard ([#5857](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5857)). A recent comment from @borisudovicic asserts that the documentation is available in the quickstart guide, contradicting the initial report. @thedotmack questioned why UX is not a priority.

### Twitter Service SQL Database Error
Users are still encountering errors with the Twitter service when using a SQL database ([#39](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/39)). @rogi-sh reported the error "insert or update on table "memories" violates foreign key constraint "memories_entityId_fkey"" with plugin version 1.2.21 and ElizaOS CLI version 1.5.10. @0xbbjoker requested specific versions to reproduce the issue. @rogi-sh is seeking workarounds for PostgreSQL.

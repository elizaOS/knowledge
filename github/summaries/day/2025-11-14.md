# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in core infrastructure with the completion of billing, authentication, and chat performance enhancements, alongside new feature requests and ongoing plugin discussions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Billing and Payment Infrastructure
A comprehensive Stripe-backed billing system has been implemented, including four new database tables for customers, payment methods, invoices, and transactions. This update also introduces six new backend routers for managing customer, payment, top-up, invoice, and transaction operations, along with a TypeScript API client and seven new frontend components for a complete billing page experience. Documentation for this new system has also been added. This work addresses issues [#6118](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6118), [#6123](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6123).

### Robust Authentication and Login System
A production-ready OAuth and JWT authentication system has been integrated, replacing the previous API-key flow. This includes new TypeScript types, OAuth configuration, JWT utilities, an authentication service, and a database migration for users, OAuth accounts, and sessions. Comprehensive documentation and a new frontend login page supporting Google, Twitter, GitHub, Apple, and wallet-based authentication have also been added. This addresses issue [#6126](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6126).

### Optimized Chat Performance and Model Monitoring
Significant improvements have been made to Eliza's chat responsiveness. This includes a new `ModelPerformanceMonitor` for real-time tracking, per-model timeouts, and exponential-retry wrappers. Integration with fast model providers like Groq and Kimi is now supported, along with setup scripts and enhanced logging for better inference reliability and monitoring. This work addresses issue [#6127](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6127).

### Comprehensive Cloud CLI Testing
A new suite of four test files has been added to provide extensive coverage and verification for ElizaOS cloud CLI commands, including `deploy`, `containers`, and `login`. These tests validate command options, data structures, error handling, authentication flows, and ensure documentation accuracy and consistency. This addresses issue [#6129](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6129).

### Advanced Voice Infrastructure
A complete voice infrastructure has been delivered, featuring client-side browser TTS for free, instant voice generation, and server-side premium voice endpoints for paid users with high-quality voices from OpenAI and ElevenLabs. Additionally, support for Compute embeddings integration allows for generating embeddings from voice transcriptions and searching voice memories by semantic similarity. This addresses issue [#6130](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6130).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **[#6152](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6152) fix: migrate from LangChain v0.3 to @langchain/textsplitters v1.0**: This pull request aims to update the LangChain dependency from version 0.3 to the newer `@langchain/textsplitters` v1.0.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Core Infrastructure Enhancements
Several foundational improvements were completed, including the implementation of a new billing page with Stripe integration, enabling auto top-ups and invoice management [#6118](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6118), [#6123](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6123). The authentication and login system was also overhauled to support OAuth and wallet-based authentication, replacing the Privy popup with a custom UI [#6126](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6126).

### Agent and Chat System Refinements
Key updates to the agent and chat systems were finalized, including debugging and optimizing chat responsiveness, integrating faster models like Groq and Kimi, and ensuring inference reliability with enhanced logging [#6127](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6127). The dashboard received a redesign and the agent browser flow was reorganized for a simplified user experience [#6119](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6119), [#6120](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6120).

### Cloud and Voice Service Development
Significant progress was made on cloud-related features, with comprehensive testing for the plugin-cloud within the Eliza Framework to verify tool registration and documentation accuracy [#6129](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6129). Voice infrastructure was also enhanced, including browser-based voice generation and a server voice endpoint for paid users, alongside Compute embeddings integration [#6130](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6130).

### Miscellaneous Improvements and Migrations
Other completed tasks include the development of an anonymous chat component for non-logged-in users with rate-limited inference endpoints [#6115](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6115), and the integration of Compute for discounted models and embeddings for free users [#6116](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6116). Architectural oversight and review of major pull requests were also completed [#6117](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6117). A user's token migration issue was closed with a recommendation to open a ticket in the Discord server [#6149](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6149).

## NEW ISSUES

### Wallet and UI Integration
New issues have been opened concerning direct funding of server wallets via external services like Privy [#6151](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6151). Additionally, there's a request for Figma UI implementation on the cloud [#6153](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6153).

### Agent Prompting and Debugging
A new issue highlights the need to improve sample prompts to be more specific to the last user prompt or action [#6150](https://github.elizaos/eliza/issues/6150). Debugging support is also a concern, with a request to improve Bun Inspector and breakpoint functionality [#6154](https://github.elizaos/eliza/issues/6154).

### Blockchain Integration
A new feature request has been submitted to add Solana blockchain support to the platform [#6155](https://github.elizaos/eliza/issues/6155).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Plugin Submission: Coin Railz x402 Micropayment Services
Issue [#6148](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6148) discusses the submission of a new plugin for x402 micropayment protocol support. The plugin is described as fully functional, production-ready, and tested against 18 live x402 services on Base mainnet. The submitter, tdnupe3, has offered to provide additional resources such as an "Official Eliza Payments Example Agent," documentation PRs, and a quick-start agent for micropayment flows to assist with the evaluation process.

### MessageBusService Error: No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_LARGE
Issue [#6140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6140) reports an agent not responding to questions, with an error indicating "No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_LARGE." User 0xbbjoker has requested more context, specifically asking about the LLM plugins being used, suggesting the problem might be related to an unregistered model.

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
The day saw significant progress in core infrastructure with the implementation of a comprehensive billing system, enhanced chat performance, and robust voice capabilities. Cloud CLI tools also received extensive testing.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Billing and Payments Infrastructure
A complete Stripe-backed billing subsystem has been implemented, including four new database tables (`customers`, `payment_methods`, `invoices`, `transactions`), six new backend routers for customer, payment, top-up, invoice, and transaction operations, and a TypeScript API client with CRUD types. Seven new frontend components for the billing page, overview, one-time top-up, auto top-up, payment methods, invoices, and transaction history were also added. This work addresses the requirements outlined in [#6118](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6118), [#6123](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6123).

### Enhanced Chat Performance and Monitoring
Significant improvements were made to Eliza's chat responsiveness and reliability. This includes the addition of a `ModelPerformanceMonitor` for real-time tracking, per-model timeouts, and exponential-retry wrappers. Integration with fast model providers like Groq and Kimi was enabled, along with setup scripts and comprehensive documentation. This work directly addresses [#6127](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6127).

### Comprehensive Voice Infrastructure
A full voice infrastructure has been delivered, featuring client-side browser-based TTS, server-side premium voice endpoints for paid users, and robust embeddings integration for voice-to-vector search. This includes new client-side libraries and React hooks, new server-side API endpoints for premium synthesis and embeddings, and extensive documentation. This work addresses [#6130](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6130).

### Cloud CLI Tooling and Documentation Verification
Extensive testing and verification were performed for the ElizaOS cloud CLI commands, including `deploy`, `containers`, and `login`. Four new test files were added to ensure comprehensive coverage of CLI command option types, data structures, error handling, authentication flows, and documentation consistency. This work addresses [#6129](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6129).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#6152](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6152) fix: migrate from LangChain v0.3 to @langchain/textsplitters v1.0: This pull request aims to update the text splitting functionality by migrating from an older LangChain version to the newer `@langchain/textsplitters` v1.0.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Plugin Submission: Coin Railz x402 Micropayment Services
Issue [#6148](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6148) discusses the submission of a "Coin Railz x402 Micropayment Services" plugin. The submitter, tdnupe3, has confirmed the plugin is fully functional, production-ready, and tested against 18 live x402 services on Base mainnet. They have also offered to provide additional resources such as an "Official Eliza Payments Example Agent," documentation PR for the Eliza website, and a minimal quick-start agent for micropayment flows to support the Eliza dev community.

### MessageBusService Error

User 0xbbjoker has requested more context, specifically asking about the LLM plugins being used, as the problem appears to be related to an unregistered model.

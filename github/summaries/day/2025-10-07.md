# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 7, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes across agent plugin management, server port validation, and bootstrap types, alongside a significant feature addition to character schema validation. Several long-standing issues related to core cleanup and browser support were also closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Agent Stability and Configuration
Significant improvements were made to agent stability and configuration handling. A critical bug preventing agent plugins from reloading correctly after PATCH updates and addressing a race condition during service initialization was fixed [#6040](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6040). Additionally, the system now robustly validates CLI `--port` and `SERVER_PORT` configurations, falling back to a default with warnings if invalid [#6046](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6046), [#6038](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6038).

### Core Runtime and Bootstrap Refinements
The core runtime received updates to expose the `stateCache` for better state management and refactored bootstrap types to consume it, along with minor fixes to prompt and provider access [#6045](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6045). The `parseBooleanFromText` utility was improved to directly handle boolean inputs [#6042](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6042), and a fix ensured `BOOTSTRAP_KEEP_RESP` functions correctly even when not explicitly ignored [#6041](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6041).

### Improved Character Schema Validation
The character schema validation system was significantly enhanced with comprehensive Zod schema definitions, including detailed descriptions and improved type safety [#6044](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6044). This change improves the robustness and clarity of character data structures.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#6047](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6047) docs: fixed old and broken link
- [#6043](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6043) feat(core): Add comprehensive Zod descriptions to character schema

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Core System Refinements and Cleanup
Several issues related to the core system's architecture and cleanliness were resolved. This includes a comprehensive "Core Cleanup" initiative [#5911](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5911) and ensuring a "Clean Core Build Proof" [#5976](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5976), which involved auditing type definitions, removing legacy code, and unifying plugin loading.

### Browser Support and Database Integration
Significant progress was made in enhancing browser support. This involved fully wrapping up browser support [#5958](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5958) and implementing a "Browser Database Adapter" [#5964](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5964) to integrate WASM PGLite for browser runtime, ensuring single-connection handling and compatibility with migrations.

### MCP Gateway and Partner Integration
Work on the MCP Gateway and partner integration was completed, addressing issues related to analyzing options for the MCP Gateway, adding MCP servers, and incorporating the x402 layer [#5814](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5814), [#5830](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5830). Additionally, the process for sending a list of partners to BD (plugins) was finalized [#5969](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5969).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031) Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61
The discussion on this issue has been highly active, with `claude` providing a detailed root cause analysis. It was determined that version 1.6.1 of `@elizaos/core` was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files, causing imports like `logger` and `IAgentRuntime` to fail. The exports are present in the source code but were not properly exposed in the published package's `.d.ts` files. This issue is specific to version 1.6.1 and is environment-independent. `claude` recommended users upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later and suggested the ElizaOS team consider yanking/deprecating v1.6.1 from npm. `0xbbjoker` initially attempted to reproduce the issue without success and suggested `matteo-brandolino` try running `bun x tsc --noEmit` and verify their Node and Bun versions. `matteo-brandolino` confirmed the issue persists with `bun x tsc --noEmit` and noted that versions before 1.6.1 and later versions work correctly, reinforcing the idea of a version-specific bug. `wtfsayo` followed up to confirm the user's OS.

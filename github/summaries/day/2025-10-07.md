# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 7, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing agent stability and reliability through critical bug fixes, improving character schema validation, and refining server port configuration. Several long-standing issues were also closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Agent Stability and Configuration Management
Significant progress was made in ensuring agent stability and proper configuration updates. A critical bug preventing agent plugins from reloading after PATCH updates was resolved, along with a race condition causing service initialization errors during agent restarts. This ensures that agent configurations are applied reliably and services start correctly.

### Core Schema and Runtime Enhancements
The core framework saw improvements in character schema validation with the addition of comprehensive Zod schemas, enhancing type safety and data integrity. Furthermore, the runtime state cache was exposed, and bootstrap types were refactored to consume it, improving state management and prompt/provider access.

- [#6045](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6045)

### CLI and Server Port Configuration
The CLI and server port handling received attention, with improved port resolution in the `start` command. This includes validating CLI `--port` arguments, parsing `SERVER_PORT` environment variables, and providing a fallback to port `3000` with a warning if invalid.

- [#6038](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6038)

### Bootstrap Plugin and Utility Fixes
The bootstrap plugin was updated to ensure `BOOTSTRAP_KEEP_RESP` functions correctly, even when not explicitly ignored, preventing unintended discarding of responses. A utility function for boolean parsing was also fixed to directly return boolean inputs, improving its robustness.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Core Framework Refinements
Several issues related to the core framework's cleanup and browser support were closed. This includes an audit and refactor of type definitions, removal of legacy code paths, and unification of plugin loading across different runtimes. Efforts were also made to ensure a clean build of the core, validating compatibility across Node, Bun, and browser environments.

### Browser Database and Plugin Integration
Work on browser support included the implementation of a WASM PGLite adapter for the browser runtime, ensuring single-connection handling and compatibility with migrations and embeddings. Additionally, an issue concerning sending a list of partners to BD (plugins) was resolved.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.61 [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)
The discussion around this issue intensified, with `claude` providing a detailed diagnosis. The root cause was identified as missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files in `@elizaos/core` version 1.6.1, specifically during its publication. This explains why exports like `logger`, `IAgentRuntime`, and `ProjectAgent` were not found, despite being present in the source code. The issue is version-specific to 1.6.1 and environment-independent. Recommendations include upgrading to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later, considering yanking v1.6.1 from npm, and adding publish-time validation to prevent future occurrences. `matteo-brandolino` confirmed the issue persists with `bun x tsc --noEmit` and provided system details (Node v24.9.0, Bun v1.2.22, Arch Linux), while `wtfsayo` requested clarification on the OS. `0xbbjoker` previously suggested trying `bun x tsc --noEmit` and confirmed it worked on their side with 1.6.1, indicating a potential environment-specific problem before `claude`'s diagnosis.

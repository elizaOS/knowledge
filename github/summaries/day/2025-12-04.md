### Example Modernization and SQL Plugin Improvements
Efforts were made to update standalone examples and improve the SQL plugin's directory handling.

### SQL Plugin Directory Management
A new issue highlights a problem where the `plugin-sql` crashes if the `.eliza` directory is not present, suggesting the need for automatic directory creation.
- The `plugin-sql` requires the `.eliza` directory to function and currently crashes if it's missing, indicating a need for an auto-creation mechanism ([#6204](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6204)).

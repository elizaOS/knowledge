# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Dec 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on unifying the API for serverless Node.js environments, alongside critical bug fixes for examples and the SQL plugin, enhancing stability and user experience.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Unified API for Serverless Node.js
A significant feature was added to unify the API for serverless Node.js environments, streamlining core functionalities. This involved updates to `bun.lock`, `elizaos-sendmessage.test.ts`, `elizaos.test.ts`, `elizaos.ts`, and `elizaos.ts` within the `packages/core` directory. ([#6201](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6201))

### Enhanced Example Stability and SQL Plugin Improvements
Bug fixes were implemented to ensure examples respect user-defined `LOG_LEVEL` settings in `standalone-cli-chat.ts`. Additionally, the SQL plugin was modernized by migrating to the `messageService` API and introducing automatic PGLite directory creation, improving its robustness and ease of use. ([#6203](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6203), [#6202](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6202))

On Dec 4, 2025, ElizaOS significantly advanced its core framework by unifying the API for serverless Node.js environments, enhancing stability across examples, and modernizing the SQL plugin. These efforts streamline development and improve the robustness of the agent framework.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core Framework Enhancements
- Unified the API for serverless Node.js environments, streamlining core functionalities within `elizaos/eliza`. ([elizaos/eliza#6201](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6201))
- Improved example stability by ensuring user-defined `LOG_LEVEL` settings are respected in `standalone-cli-chat.ts` within `elizaos/eliza`. ([elizaos/eliza#6203](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6203))
- Modernized the SQL plugin by migrating to the `messageService` API and introducing automatic PGLite directory creation in `elizaos/eliza`. ([elizaos/eliza#6202](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6202))

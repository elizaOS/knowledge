Overall Project Summary for Dec 26, 2025:

Today, the ElizaOS project saw significant foundational improvements across its core framework and plugins, focusing on enhancing agent capabilities and system efficiency. Key developments included advancements in multi-step workflow retry logic and server route standardization in `eliza`, alongside crucial updates in `plugin-farcaster` for processing rich media, `plugin-knowledge` for optimizing batch embeddings, and `plugin-openai` for improved streaming support.

## ✅ Completed Work

### Agent Capability Enhancements
- **Farcaster Cast Processing**: Enhanced the `plugin-farcaster` to process embeds and media within Farcaster casts, improving agent comprehension of rich content ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/16)).
- **Batch Embedding Pipeline**: Implemented a batch embedding pipeline in `plugin-knowledge` to optimize performance when generating embeddings ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge#50](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/pull/50)).

### Core Framework & Plugin Updates
- **Dependency Updates for Streaming Support**: Updated the `@elizaos/core` dependency in `plugin-openai` to version `1.7.0` to enable and improve streaming capabilities ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai#22](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos-plugins/pull/22)).

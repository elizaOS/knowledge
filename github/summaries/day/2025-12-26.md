On December 26, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant foundational improvements, including enhancements to multi-step workflows in the core `eliza` repository and critical updates to plugin capabilities, such as Farcaster cast processing with embeds and media, and batch embedding for knowledge management. Additionally, the OpenAI plugin received a dependency update to enable streaming support, ensuring better compatibility across the ecosystem.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core Framework Enhancements
- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai**: Updated the `@elizaos/core` dependency to version `1.7.0` to enable streaming support, improving interaction and data handling within the plugin. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/22))

### Plugin Feature Development
- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster**: Implemented support for processing embeds and media within Farcaster casts, allowing agents to interpret image and link content more effectively through the introduction of an `EmbedManager`. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster#16](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-farcaster/pull/16))
- **elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge**: Added a batch embedding pipeline, including `EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE=100` and `generateEmbeddingsBatch`, to optimize performance when generating document embeddings.

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 10, 2025)

## OVERVIEW

Today's development focused on enhancing observability with Sentry integrations, improving client-side debugging, and implementing backend infrastructure for runs tracking. Several bug fixes addressed compatibility and build errors, alongside a Vite dependency update.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Monitoring and Debugging
Significant improvements were made to the project's monitoring and debugging capabilities. Sentry's Vercel AI integration was added to the server for better error tracking ([#5963](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5963)), and the Sentry browser SDK was removed from the core package to optimize size and prevent conflicts ([#5961](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5961)). Client-side debugging was also enhanced with sourcemaps and improved React version handling ([#5962](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5962)).

### Backend Runs Tracking Implementation
The foundational backend components for runs tracking were implemented across the server, core, bootstrap, and API client packages. This includes structured logging and new API client services for managing runs ([#5953](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5953)).

### Critical Bug Fixes and Dependency Updates
Several critical bugs were resolved, including a `Buffer` to `Blob` type compatibility error in the API client ([#5960](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5960)) and TypeScript build errors in `plugin-bootstrap` ([#5959](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5959)). A fix was also implemented to ensure action notifications are only sent for `client_chat` messages ([#5957](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5957)). Additionally, the `vite` dependency in the client package was updated from 6.1.6 to 6.3.6 ([#5946](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5946)).

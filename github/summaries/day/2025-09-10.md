# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 10, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant improvements in monitoring, debugging, and backend infrastructure for agent runs tracking. Several critical bug fixes were also implemented, enhancing overall stability and compatibility.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Monitoring and Debugging Capabilities
Efforts were made to improve the observability and debuggability of the ElizaOS framework. This includes integrating Sentry's Vercel AI for better error tracking on deployments and refining client-side debugging with sourcemaps and preserved function names. The Sentry browser SDK was also removed from the core package to optimize size and prevent conflicts.

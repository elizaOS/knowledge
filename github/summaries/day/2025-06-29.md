## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Server Stability and File Size Handling
A critical bug preventing the saving of large character files was fixed by increasing the Express JSON payload limit from 100KB to 2MB. This update also includes a comprehensive regression test to prevent future occurrences of this issue. ([#5308](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5308))

### Documentation Clarity
Documentation was enhanced to clearly communicate that `plugin-bootstrap` is mandatory for communication and basic agent functionality, unless heavy customizations are being performed. This update improves clarity for new users and developers. ([#5309](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5309))

# ElizaOS Daily Update (Jun 15, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today, significant progress was made in enhancing the ElizaOS framework, particularly with the separation of server functionality from the CLI. This modular approach allows for improved scalability and independent usage of server components. Additionally, critical bug fixes were implemented to resolve test failures and improve user input handling, ensuring a smoother development workflow.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

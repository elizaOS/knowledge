On Dec 23, 2025, ElizaOS saw significant progress in core runtime enhancements, including generic type support for event handlers, alongside major UI/UX improvements and performance optimizations across the dashboard and agent builder. Key plugin updates included streaming support for OpenAI text generation and critical bug fixes and architectural improvements for the Discord plugin.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Blocked Issues/PRs**:
    - [elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai/pull/21): Streaming support for text generation is awaiting a merge in the main ElizaOS repository before full integration.

## ✅ Completed Work

### Core Runtime & Platform Enhancements
- Added generic type support for custom event handlers in the core runtime, allowing plugins to define typed event payloads, improving type safety and developer experience ([elizaos/eliza#6277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6277), [elizaos/eliza#6276](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6276)).
- Replaced polling with true SSE streaming for real-time updates, ensuring offline fallback and React error boundary support, and adding typed events ([elizaos/eliza#5930](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5930)).
- Resolved an error where the MessageBusService reported "No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_LARGE," which prevented agents from responding ([elizaos/eliza#6140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6140)).
- Updated the Brandkit on GitHub to sync with the most recent version ([elizaos/eliza#6091](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6091)).
- Addressed documentation updates ([elizaos/eliza#6264](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6264)).

### Dashboard & Performance Optimizations
- Reduced dashboard loading time, addressing concerns about 10-15 second load times ([elizaos/eliza#6248](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6248)).
- Tested Railway database for performance improvements, switching from Neon ([elizaos/eliza#6250](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6250)).
- Redesigned the dashboard as the primary landing experience to clarify agent and app creation, and monetization ([elizaos/eliza#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)).
- Prioritized apps on the dashboard to highlight their deployment value ([elizaos/eliza#6225](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6225)).
- Elevated "Apps" to a first-class product section with its own dedicated area ([elizaos/eliza#6224](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6224)).

### Agent Builder & UI/UX Improvements
- Fixed stale room state after character edits, which previously caused 403 errors and required page refreshes ([elizaos/eliza#6260](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6260)).
- Added post-agent-creation next steps to guide users on deploying agents in apps ([elizaos/eliza#6226](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6226)).
- Moved the avatar button to position #4 in the agent builder for better flow ([elizaos/eliza#6273](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6273)).
- Ensured consistency of the "Create Agent Button" across "My Agents" and "Dashboard" ([elizaos/eliza#6274](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6274)).
- Implemented a warning for unsaved changes when users attempt to leave agent edit mode ([elizaos/eliza#6275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6275)).
- Refined the agent builder interface ([elizaos/eliza#6268](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6268)).
- Added a tooltip for the system prompt ([elizaos/eliza#6270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6270)).
- Implemented an inline "send message" button ([elizaos/eliza#6271](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6271)).
- Added Topics/Adjectives to a form ([elizaos/eliza#6272](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6272)).
- Implemented inline image/video generation within chat bubbles ([elizaos/eliza#6189](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6189)).
- Added a chat interface to the landing page to route users based on their goals ([elizaos/eliza#6223](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6223)).
- Changed UI terminology from "MCP" to "Services" to encompass broader integrations ([elizaos/eliza#6241](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6241)).

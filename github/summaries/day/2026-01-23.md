On January 23, 2026, the ElizaOS project saw progress in expanding its plugin ecosystem with a new sports-related integration, critical bug fixes for the Discord plugin's runtime compatibility, and improvements to the project's documentation website. The core `eliza` repository had no development activity.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Plugin Runtime Stability
- Fixed an issue in `plugin-discord` where proxy methods were not correctly binding, resolving problems with accessing private fields like `#conversationLength` and ensuring proper functionality. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord#45](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/45))

## CLOSED ISSUES
### CLI Pipeline Enhancements Deemed Redundant
Two enhancement issues related to the CLI pipeline were closed after further analysis revealed that existing functionalities already address the concerns. The proposed API cost estimation was found to be redundant with the sophisticated rate limiting already in place for the GitHub client, which actively prevents rate limit exhaustion rather than just estimating it ([#156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/156)). Similarly, the proposed graceful shutdown for the CLI pipeline was deemed unnecessary as the pipeline already handles interruptions gracefully by continuously saving progress and allowing for seamless resumption ([#155](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/155)).

## NEW ISSUES
### Missing .gitignore in New Projects
A new issue was opened concerning the absence of a `.gitignore` file when scaffolding a new agent project using `eliza create`. This oversight can lead to unintended files being committed to version control ([#6074](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6074)).

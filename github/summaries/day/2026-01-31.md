Today, ElizaOS development focused on enhancing agent discovery and communication with the introduction of an Agent Index plugin in the `registry`, alongside significant performance and functionality improvements in `plugin-mcp` through dynamic tool actions and enhanced HTTP transport. These updates aim to streamline agent interactions and optimize resource utilization within the ecosystem.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Pull Requests to Review**:
    - [elizaos-plugins/registry#252](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/252): This new pull request introduces an Agent Index plugin for x402 endpoint discovery and requires review.

## ✅ Completed Work
### MCP Tooling Enhancements & Performance Optimization
- Dynamic registration of MCP tools now reduces LLM calls from three to one per invocation, significantly improving efficiency, with optional Redis caching for schemas introduced in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/22).

### HTTP Transport Improvements
- `plugin-mcp` now supports `StreamableHTTPClientTransport` for non-SSE HTTP connections, removing Redis requirements for certain transport types, as detailed in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp#20](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/20).
- Custom header support has been added for HTTP transports, enabling features like authentication header injection, and error handling has been simplified, as implemented in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/21).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Core Runtime and Project Management Enhancements
Several issues aimed at improving the core runtime and project management capabilities were closed. This includes simplifying runtime internals and making state programmatically accessible [#5910](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5910), implementing programmatic project loading via `ElizaOS.loadProject(data)` [#5912](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5912), and enhancing runtime access and introspection with features like hot-reloading and introspection tools [#5913](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5913).

### Observability and Testing Improvements
Efforts to bolster the framework's observability and testing infrastructure were completed. This involved adding metrics hooks and standardizing error surfaces for runtime crashes [#5914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5914), and implementing integration tests for initialization, reloads, and configuration propagation [#5915](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5915).

### Cloud and Configuration Updates
Key issues related to cloud development and configuration were resolved. This includes the finalization and agreement on cloud wireframes [#6019](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6019) and addressing the default port configuration to avoid conflicts [#6051](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6051).

## NEW ISSUES

### Cloud and Mobile Development
New issues were opened to explore expanding ElizaOS to mobile platforms, specifically for cloud mobile applications on iOS/Android [#6053](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6053).

### Agent Frontend Development
A new issue was created to develop the frontend for the Otaku agent [#6054](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6054).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Direct API Calls for Agent Interaction
Discussion on issue [#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5923) regarding direct API calls for agents is ongoing. The conversation clarified that the `generate()` function is primarily intended for text generation, with a suggestion to rename it to `generateText` for clarity. There's a proposal for a `generateText(input: string, options?: GenerateTextOptions)` API that would return a Promise, with options to include character personality and specify model type.

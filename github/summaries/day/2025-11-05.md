# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing runtime flexibility with a new migration skipping option and critical bug fixes for PostgreSQL entity serialization, ensuring robust data handling.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Runtime Control
*   Added an optional `skipMigrations` parameter to the `initialize()` method in the `IAgentRuntime` interface, allowing conditional skipping of plugin migrations during runtime initialization. This provides greater control over the startup process. ([#6132](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6132))

### PostgreSQL Entity Serialization Fixes
*   Resolved entity creation failures in PostgreSQL by normalizing the `names` field to ensure it is always a proper array before database operations. This includes converting `Set` objects to arrays. ([#6133](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6133))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#6134](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6134) fix(plugin-sql): correct types path in package.json exports - This pull request aims to correct the types path within the `package.json` exports for the `plugin-sql` package.

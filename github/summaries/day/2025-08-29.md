# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, addressing issues with TypeScript declarations in the npm package and resolving build failures for new projects created with `elizaos create`. A significant issue regarding image generation in Discord was also actively discussed and troubleshooting steps provided.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Build System and Package Fixes:**
    *   Fixed TypeScript declarations in the npm package by pointing `package.json` to existing generated types, resolving broken re-exports ([#5846](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5846)).
    *   Resolved `elizaos create` command build failures for new projects by moving starter build scripts locally, preventing "Cannot find module" errors ([#5845](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5845)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Benchmark Suite Closure:**
    *   The issue tracking the creation of a repeatable benchmark suite for Eliza v2 vs. v3, aimed at measuring accuracy, latency, and cost, has been closed ([#5764](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5764)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Discord Image Generation Troubleshooting:**
    *   Discussion continued on the issue of generated images not appearing in Discord, despite showing in the web UI ([#5809](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5809)).
    *   Detailed troubleshooting steps were provided, covering Discord bot permissions (EMBED\_LINKS, ATTACH\_FILES, SEND\_MESSAGES), bot setup in server roles, environment variable configuration (`DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID`, `DISCORD_API_TOKEN`), plugin loading in `character.ts`, log checking, and correct bot invitation URL with necessary permissions.
    *   The user confirmed they would try the suggested solutions.

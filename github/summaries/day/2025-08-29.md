# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, addressing TypeScript declaration issues and resolving build failures for new projects. A significant benchmark suite issue was closed, and active discussions continued on Discord image generation problems.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Build System and Package Fixes
*   Resolved an issue where TypeScript declarations in the npm package were broken by pointing `package.json` to existing generated types instead of faulty re-exports ([#5846](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5846)).
*   Fixed the `elizaos create` command's build failure for new projects by moving starter build scripts locally, resolving "Cannot find module" errors ([#5845](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5845)).

### Discord Image Generation Troubleshooting
*   Discussions continued on the "Image Generation not working in Discord" issue ([#5809](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5809)).
*   A comprehensive reply from 1BDO provided detailed steps to troubleshoot the problem, suggesting checks for Discord bot permissions (EMBED_LINKS, ATTACH_FILES, SEND_MESSAGES), proper bot setup in server roles, correct environment variable configuration (DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID, DISCORD_API_TOKEN), and verification of plugin loading in `character.ts`.
*   The reply also advised checking logs for "Executed action: GENERATE_IMAGE" and "Discord: Sending message with attachment" to pinpoint the issue, and provided the correct bot invitation URL with necessary permissions.

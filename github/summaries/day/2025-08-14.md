# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes for the CLI's publish command and project build process, alongside essential CI workflow adjustments. Several long-standing issues were resolved, improving overall stability and developer experience.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CLI Stability and Publishing Improvements
Significant progress was made in stabilizing the ElizaOS CLI. A critical bug affecting the `elizaos publish` command, specifically when using `--test` and `--npm` flags, was resolved, ensuring smoother package publishing workflows. This fix addresses issues where the command would fail out-of-the-box. Additionally, a fix was implemented to correct comma placement when adding entries to the registry `index.json`, preventing potential data corruption.
- Bug Fixes: [#5763](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5763)
- Newly Opened PRs: [#5774](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5774)

### CI/CD Workflow Refinements
The continuous integration and deployment pipeline saw important adjustments. The release workflow was refined by removing the 'merge main to develop' step, preventing unintended automatic branch merges during releases. Minor metadata synchronizations were also performed across various package files.
- Other Work: [#5775](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5775)

### Project Build and Agent Initialization Fixes
Key issues hindering project builds and agent initialization were addressed. A problem where the Eliza CLI failed to build projects due to incorrect logger placeholder usage in templates was fixed. Furthermore, a long-standing issue causing `startAgent` to hang, both with and without the `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` plugin, was closed, indicating a resolution to a critical agent startup problem.
- Closed Issues: [#5734](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5734), [#5719](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5719)
- Newly Opened PRs: [#5773](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5773)

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#5774](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5774): This PR aims to correct comma placement when adding new entries to the registry's `index.json` file, ensuring proper JSON formatting and preventing potential registry issues.
- [#5773](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5773): This PR addresses fixes related to Phala CLI argument handling and the Docker build process for the TEE starter, improving the reliability of Phala-related functionalities.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Critical Agent Startup and CLI Build Issues Resolved
Two significant issues impacting the core functionality of Eliza agents and the CLI build process have been closed. [#5719](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5719), which described the `startAgent` command hanging, has been resolved. This issue was thoroughly investigated, identifying the `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` as critical infrastructure and proposing solutions like automatic inclusion or clear error messages. Similarly, [#5734](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5734), where the Eliza CLI failed to build projects due to a logger placeholder error, has also been fixed.

### Scenario Evaluator Added
The feature request [#5757](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5757) to add an Execution Time Evaluator for scenarios has been closed. This enhancement allows for measuring and asserting per-step execution durations within scenarios, improving testing and performance analysis capabilities.

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Agent Deployment Strategies
Discussion continues on [#5244](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5244) regarding the best ways to deploy custom Eliza agents. The latest comment from @Bleyle823 suggests exploring AWS as a deployment option, building on previous discussions that included detailed proposals for Railway and Render deployment configurations, complete with `railway.json`, `render.yaml`, and a `DEPLOYMENT.md` guide. The issue highlights the need for production-ready, secure, and reproducible deployment environments.

### Plugin Testing and WebSocket Mocking
The issue [#5770](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5770), concerning persistent test failures in a newly built plugin, received further guidance. @0xbbjoker provided detailed troubleshooting steps, including checking mock setup files, using consistent mocking libraries (Bun's built-in), adding debugging, and running tests individually. The latest comment from @1BDO confirms that a WebSocket mock fix, involving setting up the mock before imports, resolved the issue, allowing the service to use the mock instead of attempting real connections.

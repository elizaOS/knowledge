# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 14, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's focus was on refining the CLI's publishing capabilities and streamlining release workflows, alongside addressing critical issues related to agent startup and project building.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CLI Publishing Command Enhancements
The `elizaos publish` command received a crucial bug fix, resolving issues encountered when using the `--test` and `--npm` flags. This ensures a smoother and more reliable publishing process for ElizaOS packages. ([#5763](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5763))

### Release Workflow and Metadata Adjustments
Minor but important adjustments were made to the continuous integration (CI) release workflow. This included removing an automatic 'merge main to develop' step to prevent unintended branch merges during releases and synchronizing metadata across various package files. ([#5775](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5775))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

*   [#5774](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5774) fix: correct comma placement when adding entries to registry index.json
*   [#5773](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5773) fix: fix: phala CLI argument handling and tee starter docker build

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Agent Startup and Plugin Handling Fixes
A significant issue where `startAgent` would hang, particularly when the `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` was omitted or included, has been closed. This involved a detailed investigation into plugin loading logic and dependencies. ([#5719](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5719))

### CLI Project Build Resolution
The problem of the Eliza CLI failing to build projects upon creation, specifically due to a `TS2345` error related to `logger.info` arguments, has been resolved. ([#5734](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5734))

### Scenario Execution Time Evaluator
A feature request to add an evaluator for measuring per-step execution duration and asserting against bounds (max/min/target) in scenarios has been closed, indicating its completion. ([#5757](https://github.elizaos/eliza/issues/5757))

## NEW ISSUES

### Plugin Testing Guidance
A new issue has been opened seeking guidance on persistent testing errors encountered during plugin development, specifically related to `bun test` failures. ([#5770](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5770))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Eliza Agent Deployment Strategies
Discussions continue on the best ways to deploy custom Eliza agents ([#5244](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5244)). The latest comment suggests exploring AWS as a deployment option. Previous discussions included detailed analyses and proposed solutions for Railway and Render platforms, with comprehensive deployment guides and configurations. The community is actively seeking robust, secure, and reproducible deployment methods.

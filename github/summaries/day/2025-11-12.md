On November 12, 2025, ElizaOS saw significant progress across documentation, core framework enhancements, and plugin development. Key achievements include the addition of comprehensive tokenomics documentation, a critical fix for environment variable loading in the `eliza` runtime, and substantial improvements to the `plugin-solana`'s testing infrastructure and type-checking. These updates collectively strengthen the project's foundational elements, improve developer experience, and enhance transparency.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core Framework Stability & Enhancements
*   An ElizaOS reference was added to the core runtime, improving foundational elements related to a unified messaging API. ([elizaos/eliza#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111))
*   A bug preventing correct loading of environment variables from `process.env` was resolved, ensuring `runtime.getSetting()` functions as expected. ([elizaos/eliza#6141](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6141))

### Documentation & Transparency
*   A new tokenomics page was added to the documentation, detailing token information, contract addresses, and vesting, integrated into the sidebar navigation. ([elizaos/docs#80](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/80))

### Plugin Development & Quality
*   The `plugin-solana` saw enhanced testing and type-checking, including enabling typechecks in the build, stricter TypeScript configurations, migration from Vitest to Bun test, and improved SOL swap handling.

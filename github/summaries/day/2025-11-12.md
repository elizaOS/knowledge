# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 12, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on integrating ElizaOS references into the runtime and fixing a critical bug related to environment variable loading, ensuring agents correctly access settings.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Runtime Enhancements
An ElizaOS reference was added to the runtime, improving the core framework's foundational elements. This change is non-breaking and relates to a unified messaging API. ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111))

### Environment Variable Handling Fix
A significant bug was addressed where environment variables were not correctly loaded from `process.env` when not defined in a `.env` file. This fix ensures that `runtime.getSetting()` functions as expected, preventing agents from using undefined variables. ([#6141](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6141))

# ElizaOS Daily Update (Jun 27, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Progress focused on enhancing CLI tools, improving character configurations, and fixing deployment issues. Key updates include refining agent log viewing, removing legacy code, and ensuring proper build dependencies.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

**CLI Tooling and Build Process Improvements**
*   Removed the orphaned `packages/cli/src/server/` directory, which contained legacy code now migrated to `@elizaos/server`  [#5305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5305).
*   Ensured the CLI build process depends on the client build to prevent "Client UI not available" errors during deployment [#5307](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5307).

**Character Configuration and Plugin Enhancements**
*   Improved character templates with enhanced plugin ordering and updated character configurations [#5302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5302).
*   Fixed build issues and added deployment configuration files for the `rofl` plugin, including a new character file to enable all polygon plugins and an `openai` plugin [#5277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5277).

**Agent Log Viewer and Static Serving Fixes**
*   Improved the agent-log-viewer component with an increased polling interval (5 seconds) and defaulted to live mode for better performance and user experience [#5306](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5306).
*   Dynamically resolves client path for static serving [#5298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5298).

## CLOSED ISSUES

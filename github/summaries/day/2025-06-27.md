# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jun 27, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant improvements to the ElizaOS framework, including enhanced character configurations, CLI optimizations, and critical bug fixes for client UI availability and static serving. A major feature addition involved new deployment configurations and plugin support for the `rofl` agent.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Agent and Plugin Enhancements
*   Improved character configurations with enhanced plugin ordering and updated documentation, ensuring better agent behavior and easier setup ([#5302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5302)).
*   Added new deployment configuration files for the `rofl` agent, fixed build issues, and integrated the `openai` plugin to enable all Polygon plugins ([#5277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5277)).

### CLI and Client Infrastructure Improvements
*   Removed orphaned legacy server directories from the CLI, streamlining the codebase as functionality has migrated to `@elizaos/server` ([#5305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5305)).
*   Ensured the CLI build properly depends on the client build to prevent "Client UI not available" errors, resolving critical deployment issues ([#5307](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5307)).
*   Improved the agent-log-viewer component by increasing the polling interval from 2 to 5 seconds for better performance and user experience, defaulting to live mode ([#5306](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5306)).

### Bug Fixes and Rollbacks
*   Dynamically resolved client paths for static serving to fix `NotFoundError` issues, ensuring proper access to client assets ([#5298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5298)).
*   Rolled back a previous PR ([#5270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5270)) that had introduced new plugins as dependencies to the CLI and project starter packages ([#5297](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5297)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#5303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5303) `revert: Dynamic client path resolution`: This PR aims to revert changes related to dynamic client path resolution.
*   [#5301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5301) `Feat/gork character`: This PR introduces a new character named "Gork".
*   [#5300](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5300) `feat: Add Gork character persona`: This PR adds the persona definition for the new "Gork" character.

## CLOSED ISSUES
### API Client Migration
*   The `packages/client` has been successfully migrated to leverage the new `@elizaos/api-client` package, providing a type-safe, service-oriented API client for ElizaOS ([#5259](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5259)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were opened today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Webhook Integration for Message Initiation
*   Issue [#6](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6) discusses providing an option for webhooks to initiate new messages, as the current polling interval can be expensive or lead to poor UX. The latest comment from `wtfsayo` suggests that plugins can mount routes to the ElizaOS server, making webhook implementation feasible without excessive complexity. This indicates a potential path forward for implementing webhook functionality.

# ElizaOS Daily Update (Jun 27, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Significant progress was made in enhancing CLI functionality, improving character configurations, and resolving critical build and deployment issues. Focus was given to improving the agent log viewer and addressing client UI availability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

**CLI Enhancements and Fixes**
*   Removed the orphaned `packages/cli/src/server/` directory, streamlining the codebase and eliminating legacy code ([#5305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5305)).
*   Ensured the CLI build depends on the client build to prevent "Client UI not available" errors during deployment ([#5307](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5307)).

**Character Configuration Improvements**
*   Improved character templates with enhanced plugin ordering for better agent behavior ([#5302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5302)).
*   Added new plugins as dependencies to the CLI and project starter packages ([#5297](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5297)).
*   Fixed build issues and added deployment configuration files for the `rofl` plugin, including a new character file to enable all polygon plugins ([#5277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5277)).

**Agent Log Viewer Optimization**
*   Improved the agent-log-viewer component by increasing the polling interval from 2 to 5 seconds for better performance and reduced load ([#5306](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5306)).

**Bug Fixes**
*   Dynamically resolves client path for static serving ([#5298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5298)).
*   Rollback for PR 5270 ([#5297](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5297)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

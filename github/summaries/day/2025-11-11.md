On November 11, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw significant progress in plugin development with new Farcaster integrations and configuration updates, alongside a critical bug fix in the core `eliza` repository addressing Row-Level Security validation. Documentation efforts continued with the addition of comprehensive tokenomics information, enhancing transparency for the community.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core System Stability
*   A critical bug fix was implemented in `elizaos/eliza` to correct Row-Level Security (RLS) server_id validation, which was incorrectly blocking users when RLS isolation was disabled, ensuring proper user access ([elizaos/eliza#6139](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6139)).

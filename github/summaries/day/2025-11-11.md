# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 11, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a critical bug fix related to Row-Level Security (RLS) validation, ensuring proper user access when RLS isolation is disabled.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### RLS Validation Fix
A significant bug was addressed where Row-Level Security (RLS) server_id validation checks were incorrectly blocking all users when RLS isolation was disabled. This fix ensures that user access is no longer inadvertently restricted under these conditions. ([#6139](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6139))

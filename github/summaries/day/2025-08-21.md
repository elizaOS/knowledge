# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 21, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant infrastructure changes, including migrating documentation to a Git submodule, alongside crucial bug fixes for session metadata propagation and plugin-sql tests.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Infrastructure Overhaul
The project's documentation structure underwent a major change with the `packages/docs` directory being converted into a Git submodule. This points to an external documentation repository, streamlining documentation management and reducing the main repository's size. ([#5803](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5803))

### Core System Stability and Data Handling Improvements
Critical bug fixes were implemented to enhance the stability and data handling within the ElizaOS framework. This includes ensuring proper session metadata propagation for plugin actions, which is vital for custom data access, and resolving issues with `plugin-sql` tests related to timestamp handling. ([#5805](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5805), [#5802](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5802))

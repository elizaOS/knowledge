# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 21, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant infrastructure changes, including converting documentation to a Git submodule, alongside crucial bug fixes for session metadata propagation and plugin-sql tests.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Documentation Infrastructure Overhaul
The project's documentation structure has been significantly refactored by converting the `packages/docs` directory into a Git submodule pointing to an external documentation repository. This change streamlines documentation management and reduces the main repository's size. ([#5803](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5803))

### Enhanced Session Metadata Propagation
A critical bug fix was implemented to ensure session metadata, such as `ethAd`, is correctly propagated throughout the ElizaOS message processing pipeline. This enables plugins and actions to access custom session metadata, improving data consistency and functionality. ([#5805](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5805))

### Plugin Stability Improvements
Efforts were made to stabilize the `plugin-sql` module, specifically addressing issues with test failures related to `createdAt` fields requiring `Date` objects for `pglite`. This fix ensures the reliability of SQL-related functionalities. ([#5802](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5802))

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant feature additions, including a new forms plugin and client-side UX improvements. Critical bug fixes addressed installation issues, action chaining, and form plugin stability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Plugin Development & Enhancements
A new forms plugin was introduced, providing a foundational service for other plugins to build interactive forms. This includes comprehensive test coverage for database persistence, Zod validation, transaction safety, and error handling. Critical issues within the forms plugin were also addressed, fixing value extraction and improving robustness.

### Client-Side User Experience & Architecture

Additionally, the handling of client distribution files was refactored, moving responsibility from the CLI to the server package for better organization.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Dependency Installation Failed with Exit Code 1
- [#5482](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5482): The user reported a dependency installation failure. Claude provided a comprehensive troubleshooting guide, emphasizing the requirement for `bun` (not `npm` or `pnpm`), Node.js 23.3.0, and proper `bun` installation. It also covered Git submodule issues, platform-specific considerations (WSL 2 for Windows), and a clean installation process. The user was asked to provide their OS, Node/Bun versions, and exact error messages for further assistance.

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the client-side visualization of agent runs with a new timeline component, addressing critical package publishing issues, and improving security by restricting local environment access in production.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Agent Run Visualization
A significant feature was added to the client, introducing a comprehensive agent runs visualization timeline. This interactive component provides detailed insights into agent execution flow and performance metrics, greatly improving the ability to understand and debug agent behavior. ([#6016](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6016))

### Package Management and Security Improvements
Critical fixes were implemented for new package publishing on NPM, ensuring that `@elizaos/service-interfaces` is publicly accessible and extending the release workflow to handle individual package publishing if bulk Lerna publishing fails. Additionally, a security measure was added to disable local environment endpoint access in production, preventing exposure or mutation of local `.env` via API. The `zod` package was also updated across the monorepo to version `4.1.11`. ([#6012](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6012), [#6015](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6015), [#6014](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6014))

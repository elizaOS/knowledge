# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 29, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing agent run visualization, improving package publishing reliability, and strengthening security by restricting local environment access in production.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Agent Run Visualization
A new interactive timeline component has been added to provide detailed insights into agent execution flow and performance metrics, significantly improving the visualization of agent runs. ([#6016](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6016))

### Improved Package Publishing and Security
The package publishing process on NPM was made more robust by adding public access configuration and extending the release workflow to handle individual package publishing. Additionally, a production guard was implemented to prevent exposing or mutating local `.env` via API in production environments. ([#6012](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6012), [#6014](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6014))

### Dependency Updates
The `zod` package was upgraded to version `4.1.11` across the monorepo to align package resolutions and ensure consistency. ([#6015](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6015))

A new configuration option is requested for the Discord plugin to allow the agent to respond only when explicitly mentioned or called by its configured name. ([#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013))

### Plugin Directory Command Issues
There is a reported issue where `elizaos dev` and `elizaos start` commands are not working as expected within plugin directories, preventing the loading of plugins with test characters. ([#6017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6017))

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 13, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today, ElizaOS focused on enhancing core stability and developer experience. Key achievements include significant bug fixes across build processes, CLI commands, and database operations, alongside a new feature for Claude workflow access. Efforts also concentrated on improving testing infrastructure and laying the groundwork for future scenario execution capabilities.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Stability and Build Process Enhancements
Multiple critical bug fixes were implemented to improve the stability and reliability of the ElizaOS build and runtime environment. This includes resolving an issue where the `tsup` build process incorrectly wiped `vite` builds, ensuring proper build order and integrity ([#5555](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5555)). Additionally, a bug affecting advisory lock acquisition in the SQL plugin was fixed, enhancing database operation reliability ([#5572](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5572)). Core tests were also updated to streamline workflows, improve configuration management, and enhance local AI support, including replacing `execa` and `local-ai` with `bun` runtime and Ollama ([#5556](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5556)).

### CLI Improvements and User Experience
The CLI received several important updates to refine user interaction and command execution. A fix was deployed to suppress redundant "update available" messages during the `update` command execution, providing a cleaner user experience ([#5567](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5567)). CLI test expectations were updated for version 1.2.1, specifically addressing monorepo detection in update command tests ([#5561](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5561)).

### Claude Workflow and Automation Enhancements
Claude's integration and automation capabilities were significantly enhanced. A new feature was added to allow Claude code review workflows to run on every commit to PRs, not just on open/ready states. Furthermore, both Claude workflows were granted full bash and GitHub CLI command access, expanding automation possibilities ([#5570](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5570)). Related refactoring was performed to clarify and robustify plugin ordering tests ([#5557](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5557)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Resolved Build and Startup Issues
Several issues related to the build process and application startup were closed. This includes a fix for `tsup` wiping `vite` builds ([#5555](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5555)), and addressing the `elizaos start` command not always building the project ([#5497](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5497)). The problem of `elizaos start` crashing after accessing localhost:3000 on Windows was also resolved ([#5161](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5161)).

### CLI and Plugin Functionality Fixes
Multiple issues impacting CLI and plugin functionality were addressed. This includes fixing the CLI's incorrect requirement for a monorepo root for standalone projects ([#5142](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5142)), and resolving the "unable to register again" error when testing default plugins ([#4996](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4996)). The issue of the CLI not loading/registering dependencies from plugins was also closed ([#4997](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4997)).

### Versioning and API Endpoint Corrections
Issues related to versioning discrepancies and API endpoint availability were resolved. This includes fixing the web client showing an incorrect version ([#4924](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4924), [#4023](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4023)), and verifying that server API endpoints are fully functional, with previous 404 errors likely due to configuration issues ([#5230](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5230)).

### Miscellaneous Bug Fixes and Deprecations
Various other bugs and issues were closed, including the suppression of update notifications during the update command ([#5447](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5447)), and type errors in the Knowledge Plugin after updating to eliza-1.2.0 ([#5518](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5518)). The `plugin-local-ai` failing to load on Windows was addressed, with a note on deprecating the plugin in favor of Ollama ([#5499](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5499), [#5530](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5530)). Issues with specific plugins like GOAT were also closed, noting their migration ([#4298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4298)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Scenario Runner Development
Several new issues were opened to outline the development of a new scenario runner feature. This includes adding an `elizaos scenario run` command ([#5573](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5573)), implementing YAML parsing and validation for scenarios ([#5574](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5574)), and integrating with `@elizaos/plugin-e2b` for sandboxed execution ([#5576](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5576)). Further issues cover implementing a local environment provider ([#5575](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5575)), a mock engine for service calls ([#5577](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5577)), an evaluation engine with basic evaluators ([#5578](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5578)), and final judgment and user-facing reports ([#5579](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5579)).

### CLI and Workflow Permissions
A new issue was created to address a bug where Cmd + C on `elizaos dev` server doesn't kill the server process ([#5559](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5559)). Another issue was opened and quickly closed regarding giving bash permissions to the Claude code workflow ([#5564](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5564)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### V3 Goals and Backward Compatibility ([#4720](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4720))
Discussion continues on the V3 goals, with Claude providing a detailed analysis of each goal's feasibility and backward compatibility. The analysis confirms that most V3 goals, such as replacing `IDatabaseAdapter` with `IDatabaseService`, adding MongoDB/in-memory adapters, enhanced testing, and self-learning agents, are backward compatible. Streaming support and

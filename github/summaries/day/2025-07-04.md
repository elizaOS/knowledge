# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused heavily on UI/UX enhancements, bug fixes across various components, and foundational improvements for testing and CLI consistency. Key achievements include significant client-side refinements and critical bug resolutions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced User Interface and Experience
Multiple features were added to improve the client-side user experience. This includes a new header dropdown for agent actions, improved cursor pointer interactions across interactive elements, and a redesigned DM chat header. Avatar handling and styling consistency were also refined, along with updating the 'Actions' tab to 'Model Calls' for clarity.

### Critical Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements
Several significant bugs were addressed, including a group chat crash, issues with new chat creation, and avatar preservation during secret updates. Agent card behavior for new chat initiation was refactored, and backward compatibility for agent bios was ensured.

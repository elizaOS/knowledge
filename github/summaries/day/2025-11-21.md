# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Nov 21, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing plugin dependency management with name normalization and improved resolution, alongside critical updates to server-side integration tests.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Plugin Dependency Management
Significant improvements were made to how plugin names are accepted and resolved within dependencies. This includes name normalization, handling of both scoped package names and short names, and deduped queuing for more robust dependency resolution. ([#6164](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6164))

### Server Integration Test Updates
Integration tests for the `MessageBusService` were updated to align with recent architectural changes. These changes are test-only, ensuring stability without modifying production code. ([#6165](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6165))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#6166](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6166), was opened to add `topP` support for Anthropic.

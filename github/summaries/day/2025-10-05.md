# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing agent responsiveness with improved mention detection and adding pagination capabilities to memory retrieval. A minor documentation typo was also fixed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Agent Responsiveness and Contextual Awareness
Significant updates were made to the core message flow logic, introducing a `mentionContext` interface and refining the `shouldRespond` logic. These changes aim to improve how the AI agent detects and responds to mentions, making it more platform-agnostic and intelligent in its decision-making. This is a medium-risk change affecting LLM decision-making. ([#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030))

### Database Memory Pagination
The `getMemories` function now supports an optional `offset` parameter, enabling pagination for database-backed memory retrieval. This enhancement includes applying `limit`/`offset` in SQL queries and validating non-negative values, along with new integration tests to cover paging and edge cases. ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032))

### Documentation Refinement
A minor typo ("Occassionally" to "Occasionally") was corrected in the CLI scenario documentation. ([#6000](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6000))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033), was opened to modernize the Renovate configuration and add a preset specifically for plugins.

### Module Import Errors in Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031))
Discussion continues regarding import errors when creating new projects with Eliza CLI 1.61. The user `matteo-brandolino` initially suspected the issue was related to type definition files in `@Elizaos/core`, referencing non-existent source files in the published package. They noted that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolved the problem. `0xbbjoker` suggested running `bun x tsc --noEmit` to diagnose the issue, believing it might be an IDE-specific TypeScript compiler problem. `matteo-brandolino` later provided the output of `bun x tsc --noEmit`, which confirmed 28 errors across 4 files, indicating that various core types and members like `logger`, `IAgentRuntime`, `Project`, and `Character` are not being exported or found. This suggests a deeper issue with the `@elizaos/core` package's exports in version 1.61.

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing core agent logic with improved mention detection and database pagination, alongside a minor documentation fix. These updates contribute to more robust and scalable AI agent functionalities.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Enhanced Agent Response Logic:**
    *   Introduced a `mentionContext` interface to improve platform-agnostic mention detection.
    *   Refined the `shouldRespond` logic within the bootstrap plugin, impacting LLM decision-making.
    *   These changes are considered medium risk due to modifications in core message flow.
    *   Relevant PR: [#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030)

*   **Database Pagination for Memory Retrieval:**
    *   Added an optional `offset` parameter to `getMemories` for database-level pagination.
    *   Implemented `limit`/`offset` application in SQL queries.
    *   Included validation for non-negative offset values.
    *   Integration tests were added to cover paging and edge cases.
    *   Relevant PR: [#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032)

## ACTIVE ISSUES
*   **Module Import Errors in Eliza CLI 1.6.1 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)):**
    *   The issue describes `Module '"@Elizaos/core"' has no exported member 'logger'` and similar errors when creating a new project with `elizaos create` using Eliza CLI 1.6.1.
    *   **Latest Discussion:** matteo-brandolino suggests the problem might stem from type definition files in `@Elizaos/core` referencing source files not included in the published package. Specifically, `dist/index.d.ts` and `dist/types/index.d.ts` appear to export from a `src` directory that is missing in the installed package. Downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 seems to resolve the issue, indicating a potential bug specific to version 1.6.1.

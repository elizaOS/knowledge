# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 3, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant infrastructure improvements, including unifying NPM release workflows, updating Bun across the monorepo, and enhancing CLI testing. Several critical bug fixes were also implemented, improving logging, port detection, and dependency handling.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Streamlined Release Workflows and Infrastructure Updates
Efforts were made to unify NPM release workflows, aligning them with established alpha patterns for a more consistent and maintainable pipeline ([#5877](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5877)). Additionally, Bun was updated to its latest version (1.2.21) across the entire monorepo, ensuring consistency and leveraging the newest features ([#5874](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5874)). A new workflow was introduced to test published alpha versions of the CLI package, enhancing reliability ([#5873](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5873)).

### Critical Bug Fixes and Stability Improvements
Several bugs were addressed to improve the stability and functionality of the ElizaOS framework. This included fixing the logger's debug level and improving its style for better readability ([#5849](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5849)). The CLI's port detection mechanism was fixed to ensure automatic fallback when the default port is occupied, preventing crashes ([#5876](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5876)). The alpha CLI tests were simplified to focus on basic smoke tests, making them less fragile ([#5875](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5875)). Dependency issues related to `crypto-browserify` in the `@elizaos/core` package were resolved ([#5872](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5872)), and an unhandled promise error in Action Update was fixed ([#5870](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5870)).

### Monorepo Version Bump
The entire monorepo was bumped to version `1.5.5-alpha.1` from `1.4.3-alpha.6`, reflecting the ongoing development and upcoming releases ([#5871](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5871)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Core Functionality and Scenario Enhancements
Two significant issues related to core functionality and scenario testing were closed. This includes the successful implementation of Dynamic Prompting for multi-turn conversations in ElizaOS Scenarios, enabling more sophisticated agent behavior testing ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819)). Additionally, progress was made on moving to a pure core, focusing on low-level development, browser support, and streaming capabilities ([#5766](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5766)).

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Plugin Publishing Visibility
Issue [#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813) discusses a problem where a plugin successfully published to NPM is not visible in the ElizaOS registry PR. The latest comments indicate that while the plugin is on GitHub and NPM, there's no corresponding PR to the ElizaOS registry. The user was asked to provide the steps taken to publish the plugin, and it was clarified that using the `--npm` flag only publishes to NPM and bypasses the registry and GitHub steps. The user confirmed they used `elizaos publish --npm` and provided detailed logs of the successful NPM publication. It was suggested that the user remove the registry clone from their organization and re-run `elizaos publish` without the `--npm` flag, noting potential issues if the package name already exists on NPM.

### Clarifying Rate Limiting Documentation
Issue [#40](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/40) addresses the need to clarify documentation regarding rate limiting, specifically that the Basic Tier is required to avoid rate limiting errors, as the Free Tier has strict limitations (1 endpoint interaction / 15 mins). The latest comment indicates that a rate limiter has been implemented to only request posts if the monthly read limit (100) has not been reached.

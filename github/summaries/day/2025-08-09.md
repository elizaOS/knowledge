# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 9, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a critical security enhancement, enabling iframes for the web UI in production to support plugin panels. A new pull request was opened to improve logger testing consistency, and documentation for the MCP plugin was closed. An active issue regarding model download failures received a new comment.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Production Web UI Security Enhancement:** A significant change was implemented to allow iframes when the web UI is enabled in production, specifically to address the blocking of plugin panels. This change, while low risk, ensures that plugin-exposed panels function correctly in a production environment. ([#5735](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5735))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

*   A new pull request, [#5748](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5748), was opened to fix an issue in the project-starter. It proposes replacing `mock.module` with `spyOn` for more consistent logger testing.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Documentation Completion:** The issue concerning the addition of MCP plugin documentation, [#5654](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5654), was closed today, indicating that the documentation has been added.

## NEW ISSUES

No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Model Download Failure Investigation:** Issue [#2623](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/2623), "Cannot start, stuck downloading fast-bge-small-en-v1.5 model," received a new comment today. The latest comment from `fortran01` at 2025-08-09T19:13:39Z indicates a potential access issue, stating, "Is it just me? https://storage.googleapis.com/qdrant-fastembed/fast-bge-small-v1.5.tar.gz is 403." This suggests that the model download failure might be due to a permission error or an inaccessible resource. Previous comments from `akure` and `AIFlowML` also reported similar issues or successful downloads under different conditions, respectively.

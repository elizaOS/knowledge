# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 9, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a critical security enhancement, enabling iframes for the web UI in production to support plugin panels. A new pull request was opened to improve logger testing consistency. One issue related to plugin documentation was closed, while an ongoing issue regarding model download failures received a new comment.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **Production Web UI Security Enhancement:** A significant change was implemented to allow iframes when the web UI is enabled in production, specifically to address the blocking of plugin panels. This change is considered low risk. ([#5735](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5735))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   A new pull request, [#5748](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5748), was opened to fix an issue in the project-starter by replacing `mock.module` with `spyOn` for more consistent logger testing.

## CLOSED ISSUES

*   **Documentation for MCP Plugin:** The issue concerning the addition of documentation for the MCP plugin was closed today. ([#5654](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5654))

## NEW ISSUES
No new issues were reported today.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Model Download Failure:** Issue [#2623](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/2623), "Cannot start, stuck downloading fast-bge-small-en-v1.5 model," received a new comment today. The latest comment from `fortran01` indicates a potential access issue with the model's Google Cloud storage link, reporting a 403 error. This suggests the problem might be with the hosted file's accessibility rather than a local download issue. Previous comments from `akure` reported a similar issue on Ubuntu, while `AIFlowML` successfully ran it on an M2, questioning firewall/proxy interference.

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the ElizaOS team focused on enhancing the core API with a new `generateText()` function for simplified text generation. Additionally, efforts were made to address documentation issues and integrate new model providers.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core API Enhancements for Text Generation
A new `generateText()` Promise-based API was implemented to streamline simple text generation, addressing previous discussions and clarifying its purpose. This feature aims to provide a more direct and intuitive way to interact with text generation capabilities.
- Implemented `generateText()` API for simplified text generation ([#6062](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6062)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#6063](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6063), titled "Refactor/icon button prop" has been opened. No further details on its status or progress are available yet.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Streamlining Text Generation API
The discussion around direct API calls for text generation has been resolved with the implementation of the `generateText()` API. This issue led to a clear definition and implementation of a Promise-based API specifically for text generation.
- The discussion on implementing a direct `generate()` API for text generation was closed, leading to the `generateText()` API implementation ([#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5923)).

### Documentation Link Fixes
An issue regarding broken links to plugins within the documentation has been identified and addressed. A fix has been proposed in the documentation repository to update all relevant plugin links.
- An issue where all plugin links in the documentation led to 404 errors was closed, with a fix proposed in the docs repository ([#6061](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6061)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Integration of New Model Providers
A new issue has been opened to explore the integration of n1n.ai API as a model provider, which offers access to a wide range of large language models and multimodal generation capabilities.
- Request to add n1n.ai API as a model provider to expand access to LLMs and multimodal generation ([#6064](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6064)).

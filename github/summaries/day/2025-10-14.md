# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 14, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, the ElizaOS team focused on enhancing core functionalities by implementing a new `generateText()` API for simplified text generation. Additionally, documentation links were fixed, and a new model provider was proposed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core API Enhancements
A new `generateText()` Promise-based API was implemented to streamline text generation, addressing previous discussions around direct API calls. This feature clarifies the text generation process within the core runtime. [#6062](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6062)

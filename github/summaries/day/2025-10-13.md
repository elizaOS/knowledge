A new issue, [#6061](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6061), was reported concerning broken plugin links in the documentation, with all links in the `overview.mdx` file leading to 404 pages. A fix for this issue is already in a pull request in the `elizaOS/docs` repository.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Direct API Calls Discussion
The discussion on [#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5923) regarding "Direct API Calls" continued, with `tylermcwilliams` confirming the proposed `generateText(input: string, options?: GenerateTextOptions)` API is "Ready for review." The options would include `includeCharacter` (default true), `modelType` (default TEXT_LARGE), and standard `GenerateTextParams` (omitting prompt), returning a `Promise<{ text: string }>`. This follows earlier clarification from `0xbbjoker` that `generate` would specifically refer to text generation, suggesting `generateText` as a more appropriate name.

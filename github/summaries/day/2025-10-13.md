## NEW ISSUES
### Documentation Link Errors
A new issue was reported concerning broken links within the documentation, specifically that every plugin link in the docs leads to a 404 error [#6061](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6061). The issue highlights that links like `https://docs.elizaos.ai/plugin-registry/overview#core-plugins` incorrectly redirect to `https://docs.elizaos.ai/plugins/bootstrap`. A comment noted that a PR in the docs repository aims to fix this by updating all plugin links from `/plugins/*` to `/plugin-registry/*`.

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Direct API Calls Discussion
Discussion continued on the "Direct API Calls" issue [#5923](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5923). The latest comment from tylermcwilliams indicates that the proposed solution is "Ready for review." Previously, 0xbbjoker confirmed the approach, clarifying that `generate` would specifically refer to text generation, suggesting `generateText` for clarity, and `generateImage` for image generation. tylermcwilliams had proposed a `generateText(input: string, options?: GenerateTextOptions)` method, with options for `includeCharacter` and `modelType`, returning a `Promise<{ text: string }>`.

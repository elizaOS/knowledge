ElizaOS's development today focused on enhancing core agent stability by resolving a critical bug in `elizaos/eliza` that prevented settings from persisting across restarts, alongside expanding plugin capabilities with new model support in `plugin-openrouter` and the introduction of a Solana trading insights plugin in the `registry`. Additionally, `plugin-mcp` saw refinements in action naming and dependency updates for better integration.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Agent Core Stability & Persistence
*   Resolved an issue in `elizaos/eliza` where agent settings were not persisting across restarts, ensuring configurations are retained through changes to the core runtime initialization logic. ([elizaos/eliza#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106))

### Plugin Refinements & Updates
*   Refined action names in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp` by renaming `CALL_TOOL` to `CALL_MCP_TOOL` and `READ_RESOURCE` to `READ_MCP_RESOURCE`, while maintaining backward compatibility. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/18))
*   Updated the `@elizaos/core` dependency to version ^1.5.4 in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp`, ensuring utilization of the latest core functionalities. ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp#18](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp/pull/18))

### Zod v4 Migration Progress
Discussion on [#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999) highlights significant progress in migrating dependencies and plugins to Zod v4. @standujar has initiated numerous pull requests across various ElizaOS plugins to update their Zod dependencies, indicating a broad effort to standardize on the new version.

### Eliza CLI Import Issues
On [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031), users are reporting import errors (`Module '"@Elizaos/core"' has no exported member 'logger'.ts(2305)`) when creating new projects with Eliza CLI 1.6.1. While @0xbbjoker confirmed it works on their setup and provided troubleshooting steps (clearing `node_modules`, `dist`, `bun.lock`, then reinstalling and rebuilding), @matteo-brandolino confirmed the issue persists on their end for a newly created project, suggesting it might be an environment-specific problem related to `@elizaos/core` types.

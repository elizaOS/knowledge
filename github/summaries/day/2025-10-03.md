### Zod v4 Migration Progress
Discussion on migrating all dependencies and plugins to Zod v4 ([#5999](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5999)) continued, with `standujar` providing an update on initiating approximately 20-25 pull requests across various plugins to bump dependencies to the latest compatible Zod version.

### Eliza CLI 1.61 Import Issues
Troubleshooting for import errors in `index.ts` when using Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031)) is ongoing. `0xbbjoker` confirmed the issue was not reproducible on their end with version 1.6.1 and provided steps for a clean rebuild. `matteo-brandolino` clarified that the issue occurs in a newly created project and persists despite the project running as expected with `elizaos start`, suggesting a potential type-related problem with the `@elizaos/core` package specific to their setup.

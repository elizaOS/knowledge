## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Model Configuration and Runtime

## NEW ISSUES
### CLI Tooling and Dependency Issues
Two new issues were reported concerning the command-line interface (CLI) and dependencies. Issue [#5695](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5695) highlights that `start` and `dev` commands should automatically add `@elizaos/cli` as a dev dependency if it's not already present. Additionally, issue [#5696](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5696) reports a `zod` module not found error when running the `dev` command, indicating a potential dependency resolution problem.

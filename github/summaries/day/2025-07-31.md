# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 31, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant documentation restructuring, fixing the TEE Starter Project, and adding character-based model configuration settings.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Model Configuration and Runtime
A new feature was added to allow model parameters to be configured at the character level, providing more flexibility than hardcoded plugin settings. This enhancement improves the adaptability of AI agents. ([#5686](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5686))

### TEE Starter Project Revitalization
The TEE Starter Project received a crucial update, fixing its broken development experience. This ensures that developers can now use the starter project effectively. ([#5683](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5683))

### Comprehensive Documentation Overhaul
A major restructuring and cleanup of the ElizaOS documentation were completed. This involved removing the old Docusaurus-based structure and implementing a new, more organized layout, significantly improving documentation quality and accessibility. ([#5694](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5694))

## NEW ISSUES
### CLI Tooling and Dependency Management
Two new issues were opened concerning the command-line interface (CLI) and dependency management. Issue [#5695](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5695) suggests that `elizaos start` and `dev` commands should automatically add `@elizaos/cli` as a dev dependency if it's not already present. Additionally, issue [#5696](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5696) reports a Zod-related error encountered when running the `dev` command, indicating a potential problem with module resolution within `node_modules`.

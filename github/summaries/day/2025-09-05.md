# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 5, 2025)

## OVERVIEW

Today, ElizaOS saw significant progress with the implementation of dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations in scenarios, enhancing testing capabilities. Several critical bug fixes were deployed, addressing logging issues and improving the developer experience.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Scenario Testing with Dynamic Prompting
A major feature was added to ElizaOS scenarios, enabling dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations. This significantly improves the sophistication of testing by allowing for more complex and realistic conversational flows. This enhancement includes new examples and updated documentation for scenario creation and evaluation. ([#5824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5824))

### Developer Experience and Build Process Improvements
Improvements were made to the development workflow, including fixes for the CLI, logging cleanup, and file watching optimizations. These changes aim to enhance the developer experience, particularly for monorepo setups with client UIs. ([#5881](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5881))

### Critical Bug Fixes for Logging and Configuration
Several bugs related to logging and environment configuration were resolved. This includes fixing issues where `LOG_JSON_FORMAT` was not working, preventing excessive error logging for `SECRET_SALT`, and adding `SERVER_HOST` support to the `dev` command. These fixes reduce log noise and improve the reliability of development environments. ([#5885](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5885), [#5884](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5884), [#5883](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5883))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

- **Fix: Scope npmPackage field for registry entries** ([#5882](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5882)): This pull request aims to correct the scoping of the `npmPackage` field for registry entries, likely addressing an issue with how packages are identified and managed within the ElizaOS ecosystem.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Resolved Image Generation and Project Creation Issues
The issue where generated images were not appearing in Discord has been resolved, with the fix implemented in a previous PR. Additionally, a "path not found" error encountered when creating new projects has been addressed and is no longer reproducible with the latest CLI version. ([#5809](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5809), [#5856](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5856))

## NEW ISSUES

### Logger Functionality Breakdown
A new issue has been reported indicating that the logger is broken, with an accompanying image suggesting a visual bug or malfunction. ([#5886](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5886))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Agent Response to Twitter Mentions
The issue regarding the agent not responding to Twitter mentions ([#4921](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4921)) remains active. The latest comment from `standujar` asks if the issue persists, following a previous suggestion by `0xbbjoker` to update the CLI and `plugin-twitter` to the latest versions.

### Build Failure in @elizaos/core
The `bun run clean` command continues to fail due to TypeScript errors in the `@elizaos/core` package during the DTS build phase ([#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738)). `standujar` commented that they cannot reproduce the issue and suspects it might be fixed, following `jkbrooks`'s inquiry about its resolution. This issue is noted as blocking testing of complex scenarios.

### Plugin Visibility in PR After Publishing
An ongoing issue concerns a plugin successfully published to NPM but not being visible in the PR ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)). `1BDO` provided a link to a pull request in the `elizaos-plugins/registry` repository. `yungalgo` suggested a fix: changing the `npmPackage` field from `"plugin-delta"` to `"@1BDO/plugin-delta"` in the PR, indicating a bug in the code that wasn't correctly scoping the npm package. Previous discussions involved `yungalgo` explaining that publishing with the `--npm` flag bypasses registry and GitHub steps, and advising on the correct publishing workflow.

On December 22, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw a significant focus on refining the agent builder's UI/UX and addressing user experience concerns, with numerous new issues opened across repositories. While no new code contributions were made to the core `eliza` repository, the `plugin-discord` repository received documentation enhancements. The primary theme of the day revolved around identifying areas for improvement in user interaction and agent performance.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Documentation Enhancements
- Docstrings were added to the `odi-spider` component in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord`, specifically impacting `src/actions/reactToMessage.ts` and `src/banner.ts`, to improve code clarity and understanding for future development and collaboration ([elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord#35](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/35)).

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jun 26, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing model selection flexibility, improving the CLI's user experience for environment variable prompts, and addressing numerous bug fixes across various components, including plugin functionality, client-side UI, and core infrastructure.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Model and Embedding Selection
Significant progress was made in expanding model provider support. Users can now select OpenRouter for both language and embedding models, improving flexibility and addressing community requests. Additionally, Ollama embedding selection was refined, preventing unnecessary plugin loading.

- [#5292](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5292)

## NEW ISSUES

### CLI Input Consistency
A new issue was opened to standardize CLI input methods by migrating all remaining prompts to use `@clack/prompts` for consistency across the command-line interface.
- [#5295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5295)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Character Save Size Limit
The issue [#5268](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5268) reports an "Error 500: request entity too large" when attempting to save a large character file (~150kb). The latest comment from @lalalune requests an increase in the file size limit to 100MB for characters and a regression test to prevent future occurrences.

### Split Personality Due to Username Change
Issue [#105](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/105) describes a "split personality" problem where a GitHub username change results in two profiles and split contributions. @0xCardiE suggests using GitHub's internal user ID as the base instead of the username to ensure consistent tracking regardless of username changes. @META-DREAMER notes that this would require updating the database to link multiple identities to a single user and handling complex edge cases like multiple username changes, as the GitHub username is currently the primary key.

# ElizaOS Daily Update (Jun 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Significant progress was made today with enhancements to model selection, CLI user experience, and bug fixes across core components and plugins, improving stability and usability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

**Enhanced Model Integration and Selection**
*   Added OpenRouter support to model selection for both language models and embedding models, increasing flexibility ([#5264](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5264)).
*   Fixed issues preventing `plugin-local-ai` from loading when Ollama was selected as the AI provider and improved Ollama embedding model selection ([#5285](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5285)).

**Improved User Experience and Plugin Management**
*   Enhanced the CLI plugin installation process, focusing on a better user experience during environment variable configuration ([#5291](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5291)).
*   Addressed an issue where the group creation page remained stuck after group creation, providing clearer feedback to the user ([#5293](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5293)).
*   Restricted plugin removal to only the "X" icon for better UI consistency ([#5290](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5290)).

**Core Component and Plugin Fixes**
*   Fixed a bug in the `helloWorldAction` of the project starter plugin, ensuring it returns the correct response ([#5296](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5296)).
*   Resolved a foreign key type mismatch in the `plugin-sql`, preventing table creation in fresh production deployments ([#5287](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5287)).
*   Addressed a Bun import error in the `@elizaos/core` npm package by correctly pointing to dist files ([#5284](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5284)).
*   Improved AI provider tests to avoid brittle patterns that required updates with each new provider ([#5283](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5283)).
*   Fixed loading issues with agent panels in the ElizaOS interface ([#5282](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5282)).

## NEW ISSUES

**CLI Input Standardization**
*   A new issue ([#5295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5295)) was created to migrate remaining CLI input methods to use `@clack/prompts` for consistency.

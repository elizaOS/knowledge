## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Native Venice AI Provider Integration
The discussion on [#5820](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5820) regarding the integration of a native Venice AI Provider is ongoing. The latest comment from @wtfsayo suggests that users can achieve this with the existing OpenAI plugin by modifying the base URL environment variable, and also points to a dedicated Venice plugin (`elizaos-plugins/plugin-venice`) for direct integration. This indicates that solutions for privacy-focused AI providers are already available or in development through existing mechanisms.

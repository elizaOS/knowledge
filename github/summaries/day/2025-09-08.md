# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 8, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes across the core and server components, enhancing logging capabilities, and strengthening security with dependency overrides. Significant progress was also made in documentation, particularly for agent development.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Logging and Error Handling
Improvements were made to the logging API to capture all logs, including namespaced agent logs, providing a more comprehensive view of system activity. The log level for `SECRET_SALT` validation was adjusted from error to warning to reduce confusion, and browser-specific Sentry integration was separated to resolve module resolution issues.

- [#5893](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5893)

### Core System Stability and Security
Key fixes addressed server-side TypeScript logger parameter errors and ensured safer dependency management by adding NPM safe overrides for the `error-ex` package, mitigating potential supply chain risks.

### Agent and Plugin Route Refinements
Updates were implemented to namespace plugin routes, making the server more permissive in development mode for easier integration with front-end frameworks. Agent panel loading was also fixed, exposing public agent plugin panels under agent-scoped paths.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Native Venice AI Provider Integration
Issue [#5820](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5820) discusses the need for native integration of privacy-focused AI providers like Venice. The latest comment from `wtfsayo` clarifies that this can be achieved by modifying the base URL environment variable for the OpenAI plugin or by using the dedicated `plugin-venice`. This suggests that while a native integration might not be immediately planned, existing solutions offer a workaround for users seeking privacy-focused AI.

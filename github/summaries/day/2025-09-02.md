# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 2, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Today's development focused on enhancing the ElizaOS CLI with version embedding and improved release workflows, alongside significant UI/UX improvements for real-time action visualization in the chat. Dockerization efforts continued for project starters, and several build and CSS issues were resolved.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

*   **CLI Enhancements and Release Workflow:** The CLI now embeds its version into the build output, improving debugging and version tracking. A new alpha NPM release workflow has been implemented to streamline deployments and ensure consistent tooling. ([#5869](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5869), [#5863](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5863))

*   **Real-time Chat UI Improvements:** The chat user interface has been significantly enhanced to display real-time action calls and their results, providing a more interactive and transparent user experience. ([#5865](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5865))

*   **Dockerization and Project Starter Improvements:** Docker files have been added to `project-starter`, enabling local development, image creation, and cloud deployment. Minor improvements were also made to `project-tee-starter`'s Docker configuration. ([#5859](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5859), [#5858](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5858))

*   **Build System and Plugin Fixes:** Several build warnings and CSS syntax errors were resolved, and image generation functionality was re-enabled for Discord channels within the bootstrap plugin. A broken path in the `project-tee-starter` README was also fixed. ([#5851](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5851), [#5861](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5861), [#5866](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5866))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

*   [#5867](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5867) feat: Add Sentry Node telemetry support
*   [#5864](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5864) refactor: centralize business logic in server package

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES

*   **New Platform Integrations:** A feature request was opened for integrating ElizaOS with the Matrix platform, similar to existing Discord/Telegram plugins. ([#5862](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5862))
*   **Enhanced Observability:** A new issue was created to request a GUI for event run observability, aiming for a level of visibility similar to existing agent parallelization tools. ([#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Refactor Eliza CLI** ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)): Discussions continued on refactoring the Eliza CLI to reduce complexity and delegate logic to project directories. A proposition was made to centralize agent lifecycle, plugin loading, database management, and character loading within a new `@eliza/server` package. The CLI would then act as a remote control, handling configuration and delegating commands. There's a consensus that moving logic out of the CLI is good, but concerns were raised about duplicating logic across projects if it's moved into starter projects. The current progress includes making starter projects autonomous, delegating `elizaos start` to `bun run start` within the project, and ensuring argument passthrough and stdio inheritance. The next steps involve auditing and migrating tests, focusing on delegation, template structure, mode switching, and cleanup.

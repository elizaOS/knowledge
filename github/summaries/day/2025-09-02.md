# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 2, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the ElizaOS CLI, improving the chat UI with real-time action feedback, and refining Docker integration for project starters. Significant progress was also made on fixing build warnings and enabling image generation in Discord.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CLI and Build System Enhancements
Improvements were made to the CLI, including embedding the CLI version into build output to resolve runtime path issues ([#5869](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5869)). Build warnings and CSS syntax errors were resolved, and bundle size warnings were addressed ([#5851](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5851)). A new workflow for alpha NPM releases was also added to improve deployment reliability and quality control ([#5863](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5863)).

### Chat UI and Plugin Functionality
The chat UI now displays the action called and its result in real-time, providing enhanced tool visualization ([#5865](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5865)). Additionally, a bug preventing image generation in Discord channels was fixed, enabling this feature for users ([#5861](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5861)).

### Docker Integration for Project Starters
Minor improvements were made to Docker-related files in `project-tee-starter`, including adding `DOCKER_IMAGE` to `.env.example` ([#5859](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5859)). Dockerization was also added to `project-starter`, allowing users to develop locally, create Docker images, and deploy to cloud providers ([#5858](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5858)). A broken path in the `project-tee-starter` README was also fixed ([#5866](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5866)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#5867](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5867) feat: Add Sentry Node telemetry support
- [#5864](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5864) refactor: centralize business logic in server package

## CLOSED ISSUES
No issues were closed today.

## NEW ISSUES
### Platform Integrations
A new feature request was opened for integrating with the Matrix platform, similar to existing Discord/Telegram plugins ([#5862](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5862)).

### Observability and UI
A new issue was created to request an Observability GUI for event runs, aiming for a high level of visibility for agent parallelization ([#5868](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5868)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Refactor Eliza CLI ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860))
Discussions continue on refactoring the Eliza CLI to reduce complexity and delegate logic to project directories. The latest comments propose a clear distinction of responsibilities:
- **Server package (`@eliza/server`)**: Responsible for agent lifecycle, plugin loading, database management, character loading, and central configuration.
- **CLI (`@eliza/cli`)**: Acts as a remote control, delegating to the server for commands like `start` and `dev`, with no business logic.
- **Starter projects**: Handle composition root (plugins, characters, config) and minimal bootstrapping code.

There's a consensus that moving logic out of the CLI is beneficial, but concerns were raised about replicating functions across projects if too much logic is moved into the starters. A progress update outlined the current state: projects now own their runtime, the CLI delegates startup, arguments are passed through, and project logs stream directly. The next steps involve auditing and migrating tests to align with the new architecture.

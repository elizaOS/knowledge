# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 18, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing module resolution for consistent local-first loading, fixing critical CLI bugs related to project creation and inheritance, and general maintenance.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Module Resolution and CLI Stability
Significant improvements were made to the `ModuleLoader` system, ensuring consistent local-first module resolution, mirroring the guarantees of `server-manager.ts`. This enhancement improves the reliability and predictability of module loading across the ElizaOS framework. Additionally, a critical bug preventing correct inheritance of `.elizadb` in nested project creation was resolved, improving the CLI's robustness.

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#5634](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5634): This PR aims to make API keys optional when using `npx elizaos create`, simplifying the initial setup process for new users.
- [#5633](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5633): This PR addresses issue 5616 by targeting the project directory for `.elizadb`, likely to prevent unintended hoisting or inheritance issues.
- [#5628](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5628): This PR proposes a fix for JSON strings within the SQL base, suggesting an improvement in data handling or serialization.

## CLOSED ISSUES

## NEW ISSUES

### Agent Creation Alignment
A new issue highlights a discrepancy in the `elizaos create --type agent` command, which currently copies a JSON character file instead of aligning with the standardized TypeScript character files (`character.ts`). This creates confusion and inconsistency.

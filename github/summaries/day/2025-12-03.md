On December 3, 2025, the ElizaOS project saw foundational development with new pull requests opened for a unified serverless API and robust JWT authentication in the `eliza` repository, alongside significant enhancements to the MCP provider and tool response handling in `plugin-mcp`. These efforts collectively advance the framework's core capabilities and plugin flexibility.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Plugin Enhancements
- The `plugin-mcp` repository enhanced its MCP provider with an optional `mcpText` field for formatted configuration and improved tool response handling by changing `handleToolResponse` to return a `Memory` object and enhancing `callTool`.

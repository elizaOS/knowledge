Today, the ElizaOS project saw significant dependency updates across core and development libraries, enhancing stability and leveraging new features. Concurrently, the core `eliza` repository focused on critical bug fixes for authentication, event emission, and plugin stability, alongside introducing a new `unregisterAction` method to the core runtime. A key issue regarding "Entity not found" in the reflection evaluator was clarified as intended behavior, while new issues emerged concerning embedding inconsistencies and prompt character limits.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**:
    - [elizaos/eliza#6380](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6380): This new issue highlights a problem where `USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING` is not respected, leading to a mismatch between the 384-dim zero vector fallback and the database adapter expecting a `dim_1536` column, requiring immediate investigation.
    - [elizaos/eliza#6381](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6381): A new issue has been opened to address the 500-character limit in the first application prompt, which may impact agent functionality.

### Core Runtime and Stability Improvements
- **Core Runtime Enhancements**:
    - An `unregisterAction` method was added to the core runtime, enhancing flexibility in managing agent actions ([elizaos/eliza#6375](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6375), [elizaos/eliza#6372](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6372)).

    - Proper loading of `.env` files in agent commands for authentication was implemented ([elizaos/eliza#6376](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6376), [elizaos/eliza#6374](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6374)).
    - Directory path validation was added to `ensureDir` in CLI operations to prevent `ENOENT` errors ([elizaos/eliza#6379](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6379)).
- **Plugin and Server Stability Improvements**:
    - Entity connections are now ensured before saving facts in the reflection evaluator within `plugin-bootstrap` ([elizaos/eliza#6371](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6371), [elizaos/eliza#6370](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6370)).
    - The `MESSAGE_SENT` event is now correctly emitted after sending to the central server ([elizaos/eliza#6378](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6378)).
    - Action callbacks are now sent to the user in multi-step mode ([elizaos/eliza#6373](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6373)).

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Dec 8, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on a significant dependency update across the monorepo, resolving compatibility issues and preparing for enhanced streaming support in text generation.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Dependency Management & Ecosystem Stability
A major effort was undertaken to update all dependencies to their latest versions, specifically addressing conflicting `drizzle-orm` versions across the monorepo. This ensures compatibility and stability within the ElizaOS ecosystem. ([#6210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6210))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new pull request, [#6212](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6212), was opened to enhance streaming support in text generation.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Plugin Functionality and Configuration
An issue regarding the necessity of `.eliza` files for `plugin-sql` to function correctly, and the need for its auto-creation, was closed. This problem was previously fixed in an alpha version. ([#6204](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6204))

### Deepseek API Integration
An inquiry about using the Deepseek API was closed. While direct integration might be possible via OpenAI compatible endpoints, it was confirmed that Deepseek can be used with `plugin-openrouter` by configuring custom models. ([#6156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6156))

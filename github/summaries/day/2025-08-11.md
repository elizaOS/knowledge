# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 11, 2025)

## OVERVIEW

Today's development focused on significant feature additions, including a new character type system, enhanced OpenAI API compliance for tool calls, and a new EVM plugin. Core infrastructure improvements were also made with the introduction of a Hono server and agent registry refactoring.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Agent Capabilities and API Compliance
Significant progress was made in expanding agent functionality and ensuring robust API interactions. A new character type system was introduced, including the "JesseXBT" character, improving API consistency ([#5756](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5756)). The chat completions API now supports visibility of intermediate tool calls and results while maintaining full OpenAI API compliance ([#5755](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5755)).

### Core Infrastructure and EVM Integration
The agent management system received a major overhaul with the addition of a Hono server and refactoring of the ElizaOS agent registry, enabling interaction with agents via an OpenAI-compatible API ([#5753](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5753)). A new EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) plugin was integrated, providing wallet and blockchain tooling, including services for managing EVM chains and clients, and tools for token and wallet balance retrieval ([#5752](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5752)).

### Build System and Testing Improvements
A critical bug fix addressed failing component tests in the project-starter template by replacing `mock.module` with `spyOn` for consistent logger testing ([#5748](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5748)). Additionally, import paths were standardized, with a temporary revert to relative paths ([#5750](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5750)) followed by a conversion to `@/` aliases and barrel imports, along with a new Cursor rule for import consistency ([#5751](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5751)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Agent Testing and Plugin Publishing Challenges
Two new issues were opened today highlighting critical development challenges. One issue addresses the need for implementing runtime method mocking for deterministic agent testing, specifically for LLM interactions, to enable more reliable scenario testing ([#5749](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5749)). The other critical issue reports that plugin publishing fails with false success reports, where the `elizaos publish --npm` command indicates success despite a 404 error during the actual npm publish process ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5754)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Build Failure in `@elizaos/core`
Issue [#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738) reports a build failure in `@elizaos/core` preventing `bun run clean` from completing due to TypeScript errors during the DTS build phase. The latest comment from jkbrooks at 2025-08-11T14:56:01Z asks for an update on whether the issue has been resolved, suggesting it could be closed if fixed. This build issue is blocking testing of complex scenarios, including advanced mocking, natural language agent interaction, and dynamic plugin loading.

### `startAgent` Hanging Issue
Issue [#5719](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5719) details a problem where calling `startAgent` from the CLI command `start` results in the process hanging, both when `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` is omitted (hanging early) and when it's included (hanging later). The latest comment from jkbrooks at 2025-08-11T14:54:57Z asks for an update on whether the issue has been resolved, suggesting it could be closed if fixed. Previous analysis by "claude" identified the `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` as critical infrastructure, and its absence or improper loading as the primary cause of the hanging. Actionable items proposed include automatically adding the bootstrap plugin, adding timeouts to plugin loading, improving debug logging, and simplifying the import strategy chain. The root fix suggests either always including the bootstrap plugin automatically or failing fast with a clear error message if it's missing.

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 11, 2025)

## OVERVIEW

Today's development focused on significant feature additions, including a new character type system, enhanced OpenAI API compliance for tool calls, and a new EVM plugin. Core infrastructure improvements were also made with the introduction of a Hono server and agent registry refactoring.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Agent Capabilities and API Compliance
Significant progress was made in expanding agent functionality and ensuring robust API compliance. A new character type system was introduced, including the "JesseXBT" character, improving API consistency ([#5756](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5756)). The chat completions API now supports visibility of intermediate tool calls and results while maintaining full OpenAI API compliance ([#5755](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5755)).

### Core Infrastructure and EVM Integration
The agent management system received a major overhaul with the addition of a Hono server and refactoring of the ElizaOS agent registry, enabling interaction with agents via an OpenAI-compatible API ([#5753](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5753)). A new EVM plugin was integrated, providing wallet and blockchain tooling, including services for managing EVM chains and clients, and tools for interacting with wallets ([#5752](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5752)).

### Development Workflow Improvements
A bug fix was implemented in the project-starter template, resolving failing component tests by replacing `mock.module` with `spyOn` for consistent logger testing ([#5748](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5748)). Additionally, efforts were made to standardize import paths, with a temporary revert to relative paths ([#5750](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5750)) followed by a move towards using `@/` aliases and barrels for improved import consistency and a new Cursor rule ([#5751](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5751)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Agent Testing and Plugin Reliability
Two new critical issues were opened today. One addresses the need for runtime method mocking to enable deterministic agent testing, particularly for LLM interactions, which is currently lacking in ElizaOS scenario testing ([#5749](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5749)). The other highlights a critical bug where the `elizaos publish --npm` command falsely reports successful plugin publishing despite actual failures (404 errors) to npm ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5754)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Build Failure in `@elizaos/core`
Issue [#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738) regarding a build failure in `@elizaos/core` preventing `bun run clean` from succeeding due to TypeScript errors remains active. The latest comment from jkbrooks at 2025-08-11T14:56:01Z asks for an update on whether the issue has been resolved, suggesting it should be closed if fixed. This issue was previously identified as blocking testing of complex scenarios, including advanced mocking, natural language agent interaction, and dynamic plugin loading.

### `startAgent` CLI Command Hanging
Issue [#5719](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5719) concerning the `startAgent` CLI command hanging, both when `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` is omitted and when it's included, is still active. The latest comment from jkbrooks at 2025-08-11T14:54:57Z also asks for an update on its resolution. Previous analysis by Claude identified the `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` as critical infrastructure, and its absence or improper loading as the primary cause of the hanging. Actionable items proposed include automatically adding the bootstrap plugin, adding timeouts to plugin loading, improving debug logging, simplifying import strategy chains, and making the bootstrap plugin mandatory with clear validation and error messages. The core issue is that `startAgent` needs to either always include the bootstrap plugin or fail fast with a clear error if it's missing.

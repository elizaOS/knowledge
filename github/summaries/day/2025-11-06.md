Today, the project saw significant refactoring in the `plugin-birdeye` repository, moving towards a more robust, config-driven architecture with improved task management, while the core `eliza` repository initiated work on aligning server tests with recent API changes and opened a new feature request for a Polymarket Plugin.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Plugin Architecture and Task Management Improvements
*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-birdeye**: Major refactoring introduced a `BirdeyeService` with config-driven initialization, adding new providers for wallet portfolio, market overview, and multi-chain trending data with caching mechanisms. ([#6](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-birdeye/pull/6))
*   **elizaos-plugins/plugin-birdeye**: Implemented a bug fix to defer Birdeye task cleanup and `BIRDEYE_SYNC_WALLET` registration until `runtime.initPromise` resolves, ensuring safe task removal and correct scheduling. ([#7](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-birdeye/pull/7))

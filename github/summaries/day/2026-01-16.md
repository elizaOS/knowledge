Today, the ElizaOS project saw a significant refactoring of the `plugin-sql` package in `elizaos/eliza` to enhance modularity and maintainability, alongside the closure of two user experience issues. New issues were opened concerning future capabilities like smart contract deployment and AI model integration, as well as a migration bug.

## ✅ Completed Work
### SQL Plugin Refactoring
- The `BaseDrizzleAdapter` in the `plugin-sql` package was refactored into composable domain stores, improving maintainability and separation of concerns without altering the public API. [elizaos/eliza#6366](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6366)

### User Experience Improvements
- The '+' symbol was removed from personality traits and topics of interest fields, enhancing the user interface. [elizaos/eliza#6350](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6350)
- Users are now correctly redirected to their last agent chat session after logging in or signing up, instead of the dashboard. [elizaos/eliza#6354](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6354)

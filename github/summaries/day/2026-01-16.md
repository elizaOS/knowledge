Today, the ElizaOS project focused on significant internal refactoring within the `elizaos/eliza` repository, specifically enhancing the modularity and testability of the SQL plugin. Concurrently, two user experience issues were resolved, while new discussions emerged regarding future capabilities like smart contract deployment and AI model integration, alongside a critical bug report concerning migration eligibility and a hardware wallet discrepancy.

- The redirection issue in `elizaos/eliza` where users were sent to the dashboard instead of their previous agent chat session after login/signup was resolved. ([elizaos/eliza#6354](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6354))

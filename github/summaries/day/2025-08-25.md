# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, particularly addressing issues within the core runtime and prompt handling. Significant progress was also made in refining prompt logic and improving action summaries. A major new issue was opened to implement dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Runtime Stability and Prompt Logic Refinements
Several crucial bug fixes were implemented to enhance the stability and correctness of the core runtime. This included reverting a `processActions` change to correctly retrieve action results via `cacheState` and fixing a typo in a comment. Additionally, prompt logic was refined to enforce user ID requirements for authenticated actions, and a duplicate block was removed from the message handler template to streamline prompt generation.

## NEW ISSUES

### Dynamic Prompting for Multi-Turn Conversations
A new issue was opened to implement dynamic prompting, enabling multi-turn conversations within ElizaOS scenarios. This aims to allow for more sophisticated testing of agent behavior through extended conversational flows.

### Plugin Visibility and Gateway Analysis
Two new issues were created concerning plugin visibility after publishing and an analysis of options for the MCP Gateway, including adding MCP servers and an x402 layer.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Dynamic Prompting Implementation for ElizaOS Scenarios
Discussion on [#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819) has begun with a detailed proposal for the implementation code. The proposal outlines schema extensions for conversation configuration, including `max_turns`, `timeout_per_turn_ms`, `total_timeout_ms`, and `user_simulator` settings (persona, objective, style, constraints, emotional state, knowledge level). It also defines `termination_conditions` (e.g., `user_expresses_satisfaction`, `agent_provides_solution`, `conversation_stuck`) and various evaluation schemas for conversation length, flow, user satisfaction, and context retention. Type definitions for conversation-related interfaces (`UserSimulatorConfig`, `TerminationCondition`, `ConversationConfig`, `ConversationTurn`, `ConversationResult`, `SimulationContext`) have been provided. Furthermore, the comment includes detailed implementations for `UserSimulator` (generating user responses based on persona and conversation history) and `ConversationManager` (orchestrating turns, handling termination, and running evaluations). Example YAML configurations for basic and advanced persona-driven multi-turn conversations are also included, demonstrating how these new features would be used in scenarios.

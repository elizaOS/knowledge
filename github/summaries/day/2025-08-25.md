# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 25, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, particularly addressing issues within the core runtime and prompt handling. Significant progress was also made on improving action summaries and refining prompt logic for authentication. A major new initiative was launched to implement dynamic prompting for multi-turn conversations in ElizaOS scenarios.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Runtime Stability and Prompt Refinements
Several crucial bug fixes were implemented to enhance the stability and correctness of the core runtime. This included reverting a change in `processActions` to correctly retrieve action results using `cacheState` and a minor fix to an authentication prompt ([#5815](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5815)). Additionally, a duplicate `actionNames` block was removed from the message handler template to streamline prompt generation ([#5817](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5817)), and a typo in a `runtime.ts` comment was corrected ([#5812](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5812)).

### Enhanced Action Summaries and Authentication Logic
Improvements were made to the summary generation for specific actions, such as `exchangeDeliveredOrderItems` ([#5818](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5818)). Prompt logic was also refined to enforce user ID requirements for actions necessitating authentication, ensuring more secure and robust agent interactions ([#5816](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5816)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Dynamic Prompting for Multi-Turn Conversations
A new issue was opened to implement Dynamic Prompting (multi-turn conversations) within ElizaOS scenarios. This aims to enable sophisticated testing of agent behavior through extended conversations, allowing for more realistic and complex interaction simulations ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819)).

### Plugin Visibility and Gateway Analysis
Two new issues were reported concerning plugin management and infrastructure. One issue highlights a problem where a successfully published plugin is not visible in the PR list ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)). The other focuses on analyzing options for the MCP Gateway, including adding MCP servers and an x402 layer ([#5814](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5814)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Dynamic Prompting Implementation for ElizaOS Scenarios ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819))
Discussion on this issue is highly active, with a detailed implementation plan already proposed. Key points include:
- **Schema Extensions:** New Zod schemas are proposed for `ConversationConfig`, `ConversationLengthEvaluationSchema`, `ConversationFlowEvaluationSchema`, `UserSatisfactionEvaluationSchema`, and `ContextRetentionEvaluationSchema`. These extend existing schemas to support multi-turn conversation parameters and evaluation metrics.
- **Type Definitions:** New TypeScript interfaces are defined for `UserSimulatorConfig`, `TerminationCondition`, `ConversationConfig`, `ConversationTurn`, `ConversationResult`, and `SimulationContext` to structure the data models for dynamic prompting.
- **User Simulator Implementation:** A `UserSimulator` class is outlined, responsible for generating user responses based on a defined persona, objective, and conversation history. It leverages `AgentRuntime` to interact with language models.
- **Conversation Manager Implementation:** A `ConversationManager` class is detailed, orchestrating the multi-turn conversation flow. It manages turns, integrates the `UserSimulator`, handles termination conditions, and runs turn-level and final evaluations.
- **Configuration Examples:** Examples of basic and advanced multi-turn conversation configurations in YAML are provided, demonstrating how to define user personas, objectives, termination conditions, and various evaluation types.

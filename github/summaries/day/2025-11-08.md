### Anonymous ID and Free Inference Architecture Defined
Issue [#6131](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6131), "Support Tasks," was closed after a comprehensive architecture document was generated. This document details the implementation plan for anonymous user identities and a free-inference tier. Key aspects include:
- **Identity System**: Fingerprint-based tracking with a 4-tier user system (Anonymous, Free, Authenticated, Premium).
- **Quota Management**: Per-tier token limits, request rate limiting, and model access restrictions.
- **Database Schema**: Introduction of `anonymous_users`, `inference_quotas`, and `inference_usage` tables.
- **Service and Middleware**: Implementation of a `QuotaService` and integration of user identification and quota enforcement middleware.
- **Frontend Integration**: Plans for browser fingerprinting and API client updates.
- **Implementation Roadmap**: A phased approach covering foundation, integration, polish, and monitoring.

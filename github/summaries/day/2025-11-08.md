Overall Project Summary:
Today, the ElizaOS project made significant strides in defining the core architecture for anonymous user support and free inference tiers, a crucial step towards broader accessibility and scalability. This involved detailed planning for identity management, quota systems, and integration points across the ElizaOS stack, laying the groundwork for future development.

## ✅ Completed Work
- **Core Architecture Definition**:
    - The architecture for anonymous user IDs and a free inference tier was comprehensively defined, detailing identity systems, quota management, database schema, service implementation, middleware integration, API/frontend updates, configuration, metrics, and a phased roadmap, closing issue [#6131](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6131).

## 🐞 Issue Triage
- **Closed Issues**:
    - **elizaos/eliza**:
        - Anonymous ID and Free Inference Architecture Defined: Issue [#6131](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6131) was closed after the architecture for anonymous user support and free inference tiers was fully defined.

### Anonymous ID and Free Inference Architecture Defined
Issue [#6131](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6131), "Support Tasks," was closed after a comprehensive architecture document was generated. This document details the implementation plan for anonymous user identities and a free-inference tier. Key aspects include:
- **Identity System**: Fingerprint-based user tracking with a 4-tier system (Anonymous, Free, Authenticated, Premium).
- **Quota Management**: Per-tier token limits, request rate limiting, and model access restrictions.
- **Database Schema**: Introduction of `anonymous_users`, `inference_quotas`, and `inference_usage` tables.
- **Service Implementation**: A `QuotaService` for CRUD operations and automatic quota resets.
- **Middleware Integration**: User identification and quota enforcement middleware.
- **API and Frontend Updates**: Changes to support anonymous sessions, token tracking, and browser fingerprinting.
- **Configuration**: New environment variables for quota settings.
- **Metrics**: Admin dashboard endpoints for quota analytics.
- **Roadmap**: A phased implementation plan covering foundation, integration, polish, and monitoring.
- **Security and Testing**: Considerations for fingerprint privacy, abuse prevention, and various testing strategies.

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jun 18, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on expanding AI provider options, streamlining CLI commands, enhancing character validation, and improving database management. Several key bug fixes were also implemented, alongside ongoing documentation updates.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced AI Provider Integration & CLI Streamlining
The `create` command now supports Ollama as an AI provider option, expanding choices for users. CLI commands were consolidated, merging the standalone `stop` command into `agent stop --all` for a more consistent user experience.

### Robust Character Validation and Data Management
Significant improvements were made to character validation with the implementation of Zod-based validation and safe JSON parsing, enhancing data integrity. Database relationship management was improved with cascade delete functionality for agents, ensuring proper cleanup.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Character Validation and Project Loading Improvements
Issues related to character loading and validation, specifically the lack of robust validation and safe JSON parsing, were addressed and closed. Additionally, the problem of technical debt and complexity in the project loading and detection system was tackled.
- [#5166](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5166)
- [#5168](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5168)

### AI Provider and LLM Integration
The feature request to add Ollama as an AI provider option in the `create` command was implemented and closed. An issue regarding the integration of Bedrock as an LLM was also closed, with a plugin released to address it.
- [#5159](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5159)
- [#5117](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5117)

### API and Agent Behavior Fixes
Problems with successive replies on target users were resolved. An issue where creating a room via the REST API initially worked but then returned an empty rooms array was also closed, with confirmation that it was fixed in version 1.0.9.
- [#4940](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4940)
- [#4955](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4955)

## NEW ISSUES

### Logging and Database Scalability
A new issue was opened to allow downstream projects to customize the root logger configuration, addressing the current limitation where projects cannot modify transports or other logger behaviors. Another issue proposes implementing advisory locking for the DatabaseMigrationService to prevent race conditions during horizontal scaling.
- [#5183](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5183)
- [#5181](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5181)

### Testing Framework Standardization
A new issue highlights the problem of using a mixed testing setup with both `vitest` and `bun:test` across the monorepo, proposing a migration to `bun:test` for standardization.
- [#5185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5185)

### Plugin and Client Interaction
An issue was reported where the Twitter plugin is not running correctly when both the plugin and client are used together in a character, leading to consent violation warnings.
- [#5172](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5172)

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Callback from Plugin Action to User Response ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5017))
The discussion revolves around a bug where callbacks from plugin actions are not reaching the end-user response in chat, specifically observed with `plugin-evm` and `plugin-mcp`. The latest comments indicate that after a fresh start with an updated CLI (version 1.0.9), responses are now being received for `plugin-evm` testing. There are still some potential issues with `plugin-mcp` responses, which might be unrelated. The issue is being considered for closure, with a suggestion to open a new issue for `plugin-mcp` if problems persist. Previously, a hotfix for `plugin-bootstrap` was shared as a workaround, suggesting a placeholder function was being passed instead of the proper callback.

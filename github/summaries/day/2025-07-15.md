# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, ElizaOS focused on significant core improvements, including implementing standardized service types and interfaces, enhancing CLI testing and template creation, and resolving several critical bugs related to environment handling, model resolution, and workflow security.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Service Standardization and Extensibility
A major feature was introduced to implement service types and standardized interfaces, including a `getServicesByType()` method. This enhancement allows for better organization and retrieval of services, supporting multiple services per type and improving the modularity of the framework. This directly addresses the need for abstract plugins that depend on other services, such as a trading plugin needing wallet services. ([#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565))

### CLI Enhancements and Stability
The CLI received significant attention with improvements to CI tests and migration to Bun's native process spawning for better performance. A new `plugin-quick-starter` template was added for streamlined backend-only plugin creation, reducing frontend overhead. Several fixes were implemented to improve `bunx` detection, remove `npm` references, and ensure correct local model resolution, enhancing the overall CLI experience and reliability. ([#5586](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5586), [#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589), [#5599](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5599), [#5598](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5598))

### Bug Fixes and Security Hardening
Multiple critical bug fixes were deployed, including resolving `CodeFactor` TypeScript `any` type violations to improve type safety, handling port conflicts in the `dev` command, and removing duplicate interface definitions. Security was also enhanced by updating GitHub workflows and removing plaintext passwords from test constants. The Ollama plugin's integration was refined to be conditional and only act as a fallback if no other LLM exists, preventing unnecessary dependencies. ([#5596](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5596), [#5597](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5597), [#5592](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5592), [#5593](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5593), [#5594](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5594), [#5587](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5587))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
No new pull requests were opened today.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Service Type System Implemented
The long-standing issue of implementing service types and test services has been successfully closed. This involved adding a `getServicesByType()` method, supporting multiple services per type, and creating standardized interfaces and dummy services for various types like PDF, video, browser, and email. ([#4914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914))

## NEW ISSUES

### Plugin Schema Migration Challenges
A new issue was opened regarding custom plugin schema migration problems. The core problem identified is that `DatabaseMigrationService` is not registered as a runtime service, leading to skipped agent-level migrations. Solutions proposed include proper plugin schema export patterns, declaring plugin dependencies, and ensuring server-level plugin registration for migrations. ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588))

### Environment Variable Parsing Issue
An issue was reported concerning environment variable reading when values are enclosed in quotes. This suggests a potential parsing problem within the CLI's environment handling. ([#5590](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5590))

### Zapper Plugin Development
A new issue was created to track the development of a Zapper plugin. This indicates an initiative to integrate Zapper's functionalities within the ElizaOS ecosystem. ([#5600](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5600))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Failed to Fetch Home Timeline
Users continue to experience "Failed to fetch Home timeline" errors, often resulting in "Too Many Requests" (429 API limit) even with search enabled set to false. Recent comments indicate that the issue persists even with the latest version (1.2.16), which includes a new system for timeline fetching. Discussions revolve around the Twitter API rate limits, with users confirming the problem on the free tier and suggesting that the "Basic" ($200/month) tier might work. The exact rate limit for the paid tier is being questioned. ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/38))

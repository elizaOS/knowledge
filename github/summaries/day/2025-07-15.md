# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jul 15, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today, ElizaOS significantly enhanced its core framework by implementing standardized service types and interfaces, alongside introducing a new quick-starter template for backend-only plugins. Critical bug fixes addressed CLI stability, model resolution, and security vulnerabilities, while internal processes were streamlined with Bun-native execution and updated workflows.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Service Architecture Enhancements
The core runtime now supports standardized service types and interfaces, enabling the retrieval of multiple services by type using `getServicesByType()`. This foundational improvement allows for more modular and extensible AI agent capabilities.
- Implemented service types and standardized interfaces with `getServicesByType()` method ([#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565)).
- Removed duplicate `ActionResult` interface definition to resolve build errors ([#5593](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5593)).

### CLI Tooling and Plugin Development Improvements
The CLI received significant updates, including a new template for rapid backend-only plugin development and migration to Bun-native process spawning for improved performance and reliability in CI tests.
- Added `plugin-quick-starter` template for backend-only plugins, streamlining development without frontend overhead ([#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589)).
- Improved CLI CI tests and migrated to Bun native process spawning, integrating the Ollama plugin as a dependency ([#5586](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5586)).

### CLI Stability and Bug Fixes
Several critical fixes were deployed to enhance the stability and security of the CLI, addressing issues related to `bunx` detection, model plugin installation, and port conflicts.
- Improved `bunx` detection and removed `npm` references from the CLI for a Bun-only approach ([#5599](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5599)).
- Corrected `installModelPlugin` calls for local model resolution, ensuring proper mapping of 'local' to 'ollama' plugin ([#5598](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5598)).
- Updated GitHub workflows and removed plaintext passwords from test constants to improve security ([#5597](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5597)).
- Resolved TypeScript `any` type violations in test files to improve type safety ([#5596](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5596)).
- Made the Ollama plugin conditional based on `OLLAMA_API_ENDPOINT` configuration, preventing its universal inclusion ([#5594](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5594)).
- Handled port conflicts in the `dev` command, allowing it to automatically find the next available port ([#5592](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5592)).
- Ensured Ollama fallback only occurs if no other LLM exists in the `getElizaCharacter` function ([#5587](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5587)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Service Type Implementation Completed
The long-standing issue of implementing service types and test services has been successfully closed. This involved setting up a robust system for categorizing and retrieving services, crucial for building abstract plugins.
- Service Types and Test Services ([#4914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914))

## NEW ISSUES

### Plugin and Environment Configuration Challenges
New issues highlight difficulties with custom plugin schema migrations and environment variable parsing, indicating potential areas for improvement in configuration handling.
- Custom Plugin Schema migration issues ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588))
- Env read issue with quotes "" ([#5590](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5590))

### New Plugin Development Request
A request has been made to develop a Zapper plugin, suggesting a need for new integrations within the ecosystem.
- Build Zapper plugin ([#5600](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5600))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Failed to fetch Home timeline ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/38))
Discussions continue regarding the "Failed to fetch Home timeline" issue, primarily revolving around Twitter API rate limits and subscription tiers. Users are experiencing "Too Many Requests" errors even with the latest version (1.2.16) and when search is disabled. The conversation indicates that free-tier users are consistently hitting rate limits, while a $200/month "Basic" tier subscription is reported to work. The current challenge is to understand the rate limits for different subscription levels and find a solution that accommodates various user tiers.

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 4, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing CLI functionality with new debugging tools and API client integration, alongside critical bug fixes for testing. Significant progress was also made on the Sessions API and addressing various environment and deployment issues.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced CLI Functionality and Debugging
The CLI received significant upgrades, including a new debug tool for diagnosing local CLI delegation issues, providing automatic fixes for common problems ([#5682](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5682)). Comprehensive authentication support was added to CLI agent commands, integrating the `@elizaos/api-client` package to reduce code duplication and standardize workspace dependencies ([#5709](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5709)).

### Bootstrap and Logging Improvements
Improvements were made to the Bootstrap event and logging mechanisms, ensuring proper runtime logger usage and introducing a new setting (`BOOTSTRAP_DEFLLMOFF`) to automatically turn off LLM responses ([#5684](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5684)).

### Testing Infrastructure Fixes
A critical fix was implemented to enable `elizaos test --type component` to pass for all project and plugin types generated by the CLI, resolving previous failures ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)).

### Sessions API Development
Work continued on the Sessions API, providing a simplified interface for messaging between users and agents by abstracting server, channel, and participant complexities ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### CLI and Plugin Development Environment Issues
Several issues related to the CLI and plugin development environment were resolved, including problems with `elizaos dev` command not working in plugin folders without explicit `@elizaos/cli` dependency, and issues with `start` and `dev` commands not adding `@elizaos/cli` as a dev dependency ([#5687](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5687), [#5695](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5695)). A Zod issue affecting the `dev` command was also fixed ([#5696](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5696)).

### Documentation and Project Setup
Issues concerning the migration of documentation to the monorepo setup ([#5638](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5638)) and the `morpho` plugin ([#5644](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5644)) were closed.

### Agent and Deployment Enhancements
An issue related to the Eliza Cloud Railway deployment was closed ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)). The long-standing issue of setting up a rate-limited Eliza hosted LLM and embedding endpoint was also closed, with previous discussions on implementing a fallback mechanism to a LiteLLM instance ([#5438](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5438)).

### Scenario Command and Environment Variables
The feature to add an `elizaos scenario run` command was completed ([#5573](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5573)). An issue regarding the automatic insertion of all environment variables into `.env` was opened and subsequently closed today ([#5713](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5713)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Agent Stability and Authentication
New issues highlight problems with Eliza crashing randomly when responding to messages ([#5706](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5706)) and the `elizaos agent` command failing for remote servers when `ELIZA_SERVER_AUTH_TOKEN` is set ([#5707](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5707)).

### CLI Command Behavior
An issue was reported regarding the `elizaos dev` command and `elizaos agent list` not working as expected when run concurrently ([#5708](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5708)).

### CI Test Failures and Documentation
Issues were opened to address failures in CLI CI tests ([#5714](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5714)) and core CI tests, specifically with the tee starter breaking ([#5715](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5715)). A new issue also requests documentation for the `eliza_auth_header` environment variable and disabling UI if not already ([#5716](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5716)).

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining the CLI's stability by fixing a critical bug related to dev server restarts and a significant refactor to centralize business logic within the server package, enhancing modularity and maintainability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CLI Stability and Development Workflow Improvements
A bug causing an infinite loop during dev mode server restarts was resolved by ensuring the previous server port is released before a new one starts. This improves the development experience by preventing port conflicts and ensuring smooth restarts. ([#5988](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5988))

### Core Business Logic Centralization
A major refactoring effort was completed to centralize business logic within the `server` package. This involved moving various functionalities from the `cli` and `core` packages into the `server`, significantly improving modularity, maintainability, and the overall architecture of the ElizaOS framework. This change impacts a wide range of files across `cli`, `server`, and `core` packages. ([#5864](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5864))

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 19, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining the CLI's stability and centralizing core business logic. A critical bug fix addressed the dev mode port increment loop, ensuring smoother development restarts. Significant refactoring efforts moved business logic to the server package, improving modularity and maintainability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CLI Stability and Development Workflow Improvements
A crucial bug fix was implemented to prevent the `dev` mode from entering a port increment loop. This ensures that the CLI waits for the previous server port to be released before attempting a restart, leading to a more stable and predictable development experience. ([#5988](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5988))

### Centralization of Business Logic
Extensive refactoring was performed to centralize business logic within the `server` package. This change significantly improves the modularity and maintainability of the codebase by consolidating core functionalities, which were previously distributed across various CLI components. This effort touched numerous files across `cli`, `server`, and `core` packages. ([#5864](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5864))

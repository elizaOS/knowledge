# ElizaOS Daily Update (Jun 16, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today, significant progress was made in enhancing the robustness of the autodoc workflow and improving the user interface functionality. A comprehensive set of tests was added to ensure better coverage, while several critical bug fixes were implemented to address issues in the CI/CD pipeline and user interactions.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Autodoc Workflow Improvements
- Enhanced TypeScript parser robustness and excluded the client package to reduce documentation noise ([#5147](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5147)).
- Resolved multiple CI issues related to dependency installation and git authentication, ensuring smoother workflow execution ([#5146](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5146), [#5145](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5145), [#5144](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5144), [#5143](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5143)).

### User Interface Enhancements

- Added support for all media types, enhancing the versatility of the application ([#5137](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5137)).

### Testing and Coverage

- Moved `getContentTypeFromMimeType` to core utils for better reusability in the codebase ([#5138](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5138)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Bug Fixes

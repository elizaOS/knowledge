# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jun 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant test coverage expansion, critical CI/autodoc workflow fixes, and minor bug resolutions in the GUI and API.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Test Coverage and CLI Improvements
A major feature addition involved expanding test coverage across the CLI, server, and `plugin-sql` components. This comprehensive update aims to improve the robustness and reliability of the ElizaOS framework.
- Added extensive CLI, server, and `plugin-sql` tests, significantly increasing code coverage. ([#5136](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5136))
- Moved `getContentTypeFromMimeType` to core utils for better reusability. ([#5138](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5138))

### Critical CI/Autodoc Workflow Stability Fixes
Several crucial bug fixes were implemented to address persistent issues within the CI/autodoc workflows, ensuring smoother documentation generation and build processes.
- Improved TypeScript parser robustness for autodoc and excluded the client package to prevent parsing errors. ([#5147](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5147))
- Removed the `--frozen-lockfile` flag from the autodoc workflow's bun install to resolve dependency installation failures. ([#5146](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5146))
- Removed npm cache from the autodoc workflow's Node.js setup to fix dependency lock file errors. ([#5145](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5145))
- Resolved git authentication issues in the autodoc workflow's "Checkout repository" step. ([#5144](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5144))
- Fixed autodoc workflow dependency installation failures by addressing root causes. ([#5143](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5143))

### GUI and API Bug Resolutions
Minor but impactful bug fixes were deployed to enhance the user experience in the GUI and ensure broader media type support in the API.
- Fixed the GUI's resend (retry) button functionality for newly sent messages. ([#5141](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5141))
- Ensured the server API supports all media types. ([#5137](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5137))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- A new feature PR, [#5139](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5139), was opened to add a chat title evaluator and fix UI component props.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### API Endpoint and Postman Collection Updates
Issues related to outdated API documentation and Postman collections were addressed, ensuring developers have access to the latest API specifications.
- The `eliza.postman.json` file was updated to reflect the latest server API implementations. ([#5124](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5124))
- Clarification was provided regarding the `/api/agents/{agentId}/rooms` endpoint, confirming the switch to channel-based architecture for messaging. ([#5121](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5121))

### Agent Messaging and External Integrations
Problems concerning agent message handling and the availability of external integrations were resolved.
- An issue where agents were not recognized as participants in a channel, leading to ignored messages, was closed. ([#5084](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5084))
- The query regarding the `agent-twitter-client` repository was closed, with an explanation that it was taken down due to a cease and desist request from X. ([#5074](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5074))

## NEW ISSUES

### CLI Test Command Limitations
A new issue highlights a problem with the CLI's test command, specifically its incorrect assumption about monorepo structure for standalone projects.
- The `@elizaos/cli` test command incorrectly requires a monorepo root for standalone projects, preventing E2E tests from running outside the ElizaOS monorepo. ([#5142](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5142))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Service Types and Test Services Implementation
Discussion on [#4914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914) indicates significant progress on implementing a service type system. The latest comment from `claude` (Jul 13, 2025) confirms the completion of the task, including the implementation of `getServicesByType()` in the runtime, standardized interfaces for various service types (PDF, Video, Browser, Transcription, WebSearch, Email, Message, Post), and comprehensive dummy services for testing. A PR has been created to merge these changes. `elisafalk` (Jun 16, 2025) had inquired about being assigned, but the task appears to be completed.

### Callback from Plugin Action to User Response
Issue [#5017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5017) concerns the callback from plugin actions not reaching the end-user response in chat. `0xbbjoker` (Jun 16, 2025) suggested cleaning `node_modules`, `dist`, and `bun.lock` and updating `package.json` to ensure fresh dependencies. `jonathanprozzi` (Jun 16, 2025) confirmed trying the updated version (1.0.9) but still experiencing issues, planning a fresh project test. `alex-nax` (Jun 16, 2025) noted that it's working on their side but observed an unwanted reply before the desired action.

### Bedrock LLM Integration
Issue [#5117](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5117) discusses integrating Bedrock as an LLM. `wtfsayo` (Jun 16, 2025) stated that a plugin for Bedrock would be added soon. `furkannabisumji` (Jun 15, 2025) clarified that AWS Bedrock is not OpenAI compatible, in response to a suggestion to use OpenAI plugin environments. The issue was later closed on Jun 18, 2025, with a plugin released.

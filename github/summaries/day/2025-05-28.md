# ElizaOS Daily Update (May 28, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today, significant progress was made in enhancing the .env file management for server environments, ensuring that secrets are properly merged from `process.env`. Additionally, support for parameterized routes in plugins was added, improving flexibility. Minor bug fixes and adjustments were also implemented, contributing to overall stability.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

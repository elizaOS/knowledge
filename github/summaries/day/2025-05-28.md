# ElizaOS Daily Update (May 28, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today, significant progress was made in enhancing the .env file handling for server environments, addressing bugs, and refining the agent sidebar. The team focused on improving the integration of environment variables and resolving issues related to end-to-end tests. Overall, the day was productive with multiple feature additions and bug fixes contributing to the project's stability and functionality.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Environment Variable Management
- Added functionality to manually write the `.env` file to fly.io to address bugs with `process.env` and the merge loader ([#4808](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4808)).
- Implemented merging of `process.env` variables into the `.env` file to ensure secrets are not ignored in server hosting environments ([#4806](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4806)).

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed typos across the codebase ([#4816](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4816)).
- Removed tests that required TEE Native hardware or simulator to eliminate dependencies on end-to-end tests ([#4807](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4807)).

### UI Enhancements
- Updated the agent sidebar to utilize consistent height properties, improving the user interface ([#4811](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4811)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Plugin Integration
- Resolved the issue regarding the integration of the `@elizaos/plugin-evm` plugin, which previously caused difficulties in enabling interactions with EVM-compatible chains ([#4803](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4803)).

## NEW ISSUES

### End-to-End Test Failures
- Reported failures in end-to-end tests for the new sample project, indicating a need for further investigation ([#4814](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4814)).

### CLI and Docker Concerns
- Raised questions about starting agent files without the CLI in Docker Compose, highlighting the removal of the `the-org` package from resources ([#4810](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4810)).

### Type Definition Issues
- Encountered problems with missing type definition files for Node and Jest, affecting development setup ([#4805](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4805)).

On Feb 4, 2026, ElizaOS saw significant advancements in security and core functionality with the introduction of a new plugin for transaction validation guardrails and enhancements to per-user settings and multi-tenancy. Documentation was also substantially improved, alongside critical bug fixes for event emission.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core System & Security Enhancements

- Fixed ElevenLabs API integration issues in `elizaos/eliza`'s avatar example and plugin, consolidating project structure ([elizaos/eliza#6387](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6387)).

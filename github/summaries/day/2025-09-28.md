# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 28, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant code refactoring to improve type definitions and runtime initialization, alongside a crucial bug fix for plugin import logging. Linter-driven code formatting was also applied across the repository.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Runtime Refinements
The core runtime underwent substantial refactoring to enhance type definitions and streamline service registration. This included making runtime initialization idempotent and improving coordination for service registration, addressing legacy code paths and redundant type guards. ([#5998](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5998), [#6004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6004))

### Plugin Import Error Handling
A bug related to dynamic plugin import failures was addressed by downgrading the log level from an error to a warning. This change acknowledges that initial import failures are often recoverable, such as through auto-installation or optional dependencies. ([#6010](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6010))

### Repository-Wide Code Formatting
A comprehensive linter pass was executed across the entire repository to standardize code formatting. This effort focused on improving readability and consistency for function arguments, array/object literals, and callback formatting, without introducing any logic changes. ([#6011](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6011))

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 28, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant code refactoring to improve type definitions and runtime initialization, alongside a crucial bug fix for plugin import logging. Linter-driven code formatting was also applied across the repository.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Runtime Refinements
The core runtime underwent substantial refactoring to make initialization idempotent and enhance service registration coordination, removing legacy code paths and redundant type guards ([#6004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6004)). This work is part of a broader core cleanup effort.

### Type Definition Standardization
A comprehensive refactoring effort was completed to standardize and improve type definitions across the entire runtime, affecting numerous files in `packages/cli`, `packages/core`, `packages/plugin-bootstrap`, `packages/server`, and `packages/service-interfaces` ([#5998](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5998)).

### Plugin Import Error Handling
A bug fix was implemented to downgrade the log level for dynamic plugin import failures from an error to a warning in `packages/server/src/managers/PluginLoader.ts` ([#6010](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6010)). This change acknowledges that initial import failures are often recoverable, such as through auto-installation or optional dependencies.

### Repository-Wide Code Formatting
A chore task was completed to run the linter across the entire repository, primarily refactoring code formatting for improved readability and consistency without introducing any logic changes ([#6011](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6011)).

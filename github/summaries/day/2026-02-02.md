ElizaOS had a productive day focusing on infrastructure, billing, and agent character improvements. Key achievements include integrating Telegram and SMS/iMessage plugins, acquiring the eliza.app domain, and opening new issues for critical infrastructure needs and payment systems. Discussions are active around optimizing Eliza's character file and prompt engineering, with a new plugin for L2 smart money signals also introduced.

## 🚨 Needs Attention
- **Urgent Discussions**: The discussion on improving Eliza's character file and prompts ([elizaos/elizaos.github.io#6447](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6447), [elizaos-plugins/registry#6447](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/6447), [elizaos/eliza#6447](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6447)) highlights a fundamental debate on agent synchronization (logic vs. prose) and requires input to guide future development.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Messaging Plugin Integrations
- The Telegram plugin was successfully integrated into the Cloud infrastructure, enabling user interaction via Telegram, and SMS/iMessage capabilities were set up for a native iOS messaging experience, fulfilling the goal of Eliza having a phone number. ([elizaos/eliza#6397](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6397), [elizaos/eliza#6399](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6399))

### Domain Acquisition
- The eliza.app domain was successfully purchased and configured, with DNS pointing to the deployment and an active SSL certificate. ([elizaos/eliza#6419](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6419))

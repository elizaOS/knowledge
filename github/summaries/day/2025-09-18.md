## CLOSED ISSUES

**Plugin Development and Integration**
Several issues related to specific plugins and their integration were closed, including updates for the Neynar SDK for Farcaster ([#5943](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5943)), providing webhook options for Farcaster ([#5944](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5944)), and issues concerning `plugin-quickswap` ([#5947](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5947)), `plugin-rofl` ([#5949](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5949)), and `plugin-polymarket` ([#5950](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5950)).

**Update Notification Logic**
An issue regarding update notifications for alpha versions was closed ([#5971](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5971)). This issue aimed to prevent "update available" messages for alpha versions if the user is not on an alpha distribution.

## NEW ISSUES

**Enhanced TEE Deployment Options**
A new issue was created to extend Eliza's TEE deployment support by integrating Eigen TEE alongside the existing Phala TEE option ([#5986](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5986)). This will provide users with more choices for secure agent deployment.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

**Twitter Error with SQL Database**
Issue [#39](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/39) continues to be active, with recent comments focusing on reproducing and resolving a Twitter error related to SQL database foreign key constraints. User `rogi-sh` confirmed the error with `plugin-twitter` version 1.2.21 and ElizaOS CLI version 1.5.10, specifically "insert or update on table "memories" violates foreign key constraint "memories_entityId_fkey"". User `0xbbjoker` requested version details to reproduce the issue.

**ElizaOS Class and Core API Refinements**
Discussions on issues [#5907](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5907) (Defaults & Validation), [#5905](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5905) (ElizaOS Class & Core API), and [#5906](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5906) (ElizaOS Lifecycle & Bulk Ops) indicate ongoing work on the core architecture. User `standujar` linked these issues to pull request [#5864](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/5864), suggesting that an implementation related to these topics is underway.

## NEW ISSUES
### TEE Deployment Expansion
A new issue was created to add Eigen TEE deployment options, aiming to extend Eliza's TEE support by integrating Eigen TEE alongside the existing Phala TEE option, offering users more choices for secure agent deployment ([#5986](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5986)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Twitter Plugin SQL Database Error
Issue [#39](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/39) continues to be active, with recent comments focusing on reproducing a Twitter error related to the SQL database. A user reported an `insert or update on table "memories" violates foreign key constraint "memories_entityId_fkey"` error with `plugin-twitter` version 1.2.21 and ElizaOS CLI version 1.5.10. Previous comments suggested a temporary workaround of deleting `.elizadb` before startup. The discussion is ongoing to identify the root cause and a permanent fix.

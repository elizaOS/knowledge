# ElizaOS Daily Update (Jun 24, 2025)

## OVERVIEW 
Today, significant progress was made in enhancing the ElizaOS framework, particularly with the migration of the admin API and improvements to file handling in the GUI. Bug fixes addressed critical issues in the character form and upload functionalities, while code refactoring efforts improved modularity and clarity across the codebase.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Feature Enhancements
- Introduced support for user-uploaded plain text (.txt) files in the GUI, enhancing user interaction ([#5262](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5262)).
- Migrated the admin API to a new phase, improving overall system architecture ([#5266](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5266)).

### Bug Fixes

- Completed the migration from `express-fileupload` to `multer`, fixing upload functionality and resolving API endpoint mismatches ([#5252](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5252)).
- Enhanced the `processAttachments` logic to support local image URLs and include attachment descriptions in prompts ([#5257](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5257)).

### Code Refactoring
- Centralized directory detection logic in the CLI, reducing code duplication and ensuring consistent behavior across commands ([#5246](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5246)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Plugin Development Challenges
- Created a new issue to develop a custom plugin for managing the Biconomy wallet with Chainlink automation, highlighting difficulties in using Eliza as the agent ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5260)).

### Migration to New API Client
- Initiated a migration of the `packages/client` to leverage the new `@elizaos/api-client`, aiming for a more type-safe and service-oriented approach ([#5259](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5259)).

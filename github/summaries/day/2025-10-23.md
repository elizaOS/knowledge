## ACTIVE ISSUES

### CLI Module Resolution Error
- Issue [#6088](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6088) was actively discussed and subsequently closed. Users reported encountering a `Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'` error after installing the ElizaOS CLI. Initial comments confirmed the widespread nature of the issue. A workaround was suggested by `schmidsi` involving building from source and aliasing the local CLI. `ChristopherTrimboli` confirmed the fix with the release of version 1.6.3, and `schmidsi` later confirmed that running `bun install -g @elizaos/cli` again with the new version resolved the problem.

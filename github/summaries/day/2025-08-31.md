- path not found: [#5856](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5856)

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### V3 Goals Discussion
Discussions continued on the V3 Goals, with a focus on streaming functionality. A user inquired about the status of streaming and its importance for reducing response latency. A detailed analysis by "claude" outlined the feasibility and backward compatibility of each V3 goal, providing implementation recommendations and a migration strategy. The analysis categorized goals by risk and suggested an incremental migration approach.
- V3 Goals: [#4720](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4720)

### Streaming Response Implementation
Updates were provided on the optional stream responses feature. A user confirmed implementing streaming support by modifying core files, noting that it's not yet an official solution but demonstrates feasibility.
- Add optional Stream responses to handle streaming: [#5060](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5060)

### Discord Image Generation Issue
The issue of generated images not appearing in Discord was further investigated. A user confirmed that permissions were correct and that image generation works in the web UI but not in Discord, despite the bot describing the image. Debugging steps and potential causes related to Discord bot permissions and configuration were previously provided.
- Image Generation not working in Discord: [#5809](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5809)

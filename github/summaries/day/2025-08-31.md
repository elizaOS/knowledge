# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 31, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, particularly addressing TypeScript declaration issues in the core package and resolving CLI deployment path problems. Several new pull requests were opened to tackle module resolution and build warnings, indicating ongoing efforts to improve stability and compatibility.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Core Package TypeScript Declaration Fixes
Resolved an issue with TypeScript declarations in the `core` npm package, optimizing the build configuration. This fix ensures proper type definitions are available for consumers of the `core` package, improving developer experience and preventing potential type-related errors. ([#5848](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5848))

### CLI Deployment Path Resolution
Addressed a critical bug where the CLI failed to find modules when installed globally via NPM. This fix involved adjusting build configurations and utility functions within the `cli` package to correctly resolve deployment paths, making the global CLI installation functional. ([#5852](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5852))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- **CLI Plugin Import and Module Resolution Fixes:** Several PRs were opened to address issues related to CLI functionality, including making plugin import verification non-fatal and resolving module resolution errors in the `copyTemplate` function. ([#5855](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5855), [#5853](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5853))
- **Core Node Crypto and Build Warning Resolution:** A PR was opened to ensure the `core` package uses Node.js crypto in the Node build, which is crucial for unblocking CLI tests on Ubuntu/macOS. Another PR aims to resolve general build warnings and CSS syntax errors. ([#5854](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5854), [#5851](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5851))

## CLOSED ISSUES

## NEW ISSUES
### CLI Project Creation Failure
A new issue was reported regarding the failure to create a new project using the CLI, specifically encountering a "path not found" error related to module resolution. This indicates a persistent problem with the CLI's ability to locate necessary files during project initialization. ([#5856](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5856))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### V3 Goals and Streaming Functionality
Discussions continue on the V3 Goals issue, with a focus on streaming functionality. A detailed analysis by `claude` outlined the feasibility and backward compatibility of various V3 goals, including database service migration, streaming support, and multi-modality. `SyedMuqeetAqib` confirmed having implemented streaming support by modifying core files, indicating a potential unofficial solution. `LinuxIsCool` emphasized the importance of streaming for reducing response latency. The latest comments from `SyedMuqeetAqib` and `LinuxIsCool` highlight ongoing community interest and efforts in integrating streaming capabilities. ([#4720](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4720))

### Optional Stream Responses
Related to the V3 goals, the issue for adding optional stream responses is active. `SyedMuqeetAqib` provided an update, stating that they have implemented streaming support by changing core files, leveraging existing streaming support in the Eliza AI package. `LinuxIsCool` inquired about the status of this implementation. ([#5060](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5060))

### Discord Image Generation Failure
The issue concerning image generation not working in Discord remains active. `harperaa` confirmed that image generation works in the web UI but not in Discord, despite verifying permissions and configuration. They noted the absence of specific generation logs when requested via Discord, unlike the web UI. Previous comments from `1BDO` provided comprehensive troubleshooting steps, including checking Discord bot permissions, environment configuration, and plugin loading.

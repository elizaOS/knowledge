On Feb 5, 2026, ElizaOS saw significant progress in core infrastructure with numerous closed issues related to messaging, OAuth, and database migrations in `elizaos/eliza`, alongside new feature development for workflow management in `elizaos-plugins/plugin-n8n-workflow` and the expansion of the plugin registry with an AI agent job marketplace in `elizaos-plugins/registry`. The day also brought new issues focusing on user experience, AI model optimization, and further integration capabilities.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Infrastructure and Integration Enhancements
- **elizaos/eliza**: Integrated a Twilio plugin for SMS fallback ([#6400](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6400)), implemented a "poke-style" onboarding flow ([#6413](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6413)), created a dedicated Eliza App landing page ([#6412](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6412)), and set up Telegram webhook registration ([#6425](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6425)). The messaging connection UI and routing service were also addressed ([#6431](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6431)).
- **elizaos/eliza**: Verified serverless multi-tenant support ([#6415](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6415)), fixed a 3-second MCP plugin initialization delay ([#6432](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6432)), and provisioned a second Blue.io number for the dev environment ([#6446](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6446)). OAuth provider rollout for various services was completed ([#6437](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6437)), and a demo video for Google OAuth verification was recorded ([#6452](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6452)). Research into SMTP alternatives for Gmail OAuth was also concluded ([#6460](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6460)).

### Database and Authentication Fixes
- **elizaos/eliza**: Fixed a critical bug where user settings did not override agent settings, causing API key issues ([#6451](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6451)).
- **elizaos/eliza**: Completed Drizzle migration cleanup, addressing issues with manual migration scripts ([#6444](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6444)), and reverted authentication implementation while restoring the auth page ([#6455](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6455)).

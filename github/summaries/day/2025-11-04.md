## NEW ISSUES

*   **Billing and Payments**: Several new issues were opened concerning billing and payment systems. These include integrating Stripe for one-time and auto top-ups, managing invoices, and credit card management ([#6118](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6118), [#6123](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6123)). Additionally, container billing logic, including monthly cron deductions, pausing containers for non-payment, and email notifications, was raised ([#6124](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6124)).
*   **User Interface and Experience**: New issues were created to address UI/UX improvements, such as a "Dashboard Redesign" ([#6119](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6119)) and refining the "Agents Browser Flow" ([#6120](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6120)).
*   **Core System Enhancements**: Issues related to core system improvements include debugging and finalizing chat responsiveness, fixing async model issues, and ensuring inference reliability ([#6127](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6127)). There's also a new issue for building a public `/docs` UI with an OpenAI-style API explorer and character setup examples ([#6128](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6128)).
*   **Authentication and Infrastructure**: A comprehensive "Authentication & Login System" is planned, including a full login page, OAuth integration for various providers, and wallet-based authentication ([#6126](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6126)). Voice infrastructure, including browser-based voice generation and a server voice endpoint for paid users, is also a new focus ([#6130](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6130)).
*   **Documentation and Testing**: An issue highlights that "The Changelog hasn't been updated since January" ([#6121](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6121)), and another asks "Where did packages/docs/ go?" ([#6122](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6122)). Testing for "Plugin-Cloud" within the Eliza Framework is also a new task ([#6129](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6129)).
*   **Free Tier and Architecture Oversight**: New issues address building an "anonymous chat component" and implementing "rate-limited, uncredited inference endpoints" for non-logged-in users ([#6115](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6115), [#6116](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6116)). Additionally, there's a task to "Oversee middleware refactors, credit logic, and group routing" and review major PRs ([#6117](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6117), [#6131](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6131)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

*   **Billing Page & Stripe Integration** ([#6123](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6123)): CodeRabbit provided a detailed plan for implementing a complete Stripe-backed billing subsystem. This includes creating four new database tables (`customers`, `payment_methods`, `invoices`, `transactions`), adding six backend routers for various billing operations, developing a TypeScript API client with CRUD types, and creating seven frontend components for the billing page. The plan also covers integrating Stripe environment keys and adding documentation.
*   **Container Billing Logic** ([#6124](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6124)): CodeRabbit outlined a plan for a full automated monthly container billing system. This involves adding a new database schema for billing, a `BillingService` with cron job functionality, billing types and cost calculation, REST API endpoints for billing management, and comprehensive documentation. The plan details hourly cron billing, configurable monthly charges, payment failure handling (pausing containers and a 7-day grace period), email notifications, and automatic container deletion.
*   **Analytics** ([#6125](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6125)): CodeRabbit proposed implementing a new analytics API with three endpoints: `GET /api/agents/:agentId/analytics`, `/models`, and `/services`. These endpoints will provide usage metrics for models and services, with filtering options for time-range, limit, and type. The plan also includes creating documentation for the analytics feature and modifying the agents index to mount the new analytics router.
*   **Authentication & Login System** ([#6126](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6126)): CodeRabbit presented a plan to implement a production-ready OAuth and JWT authentication system. This involves adding TypeScript types, OAuth configuration, JWT utilities, an authentication service, and a database migration for authentication tables. The plan also details wiring routes, middleware, and a new frontend login UI, along with comprehensive documentation.
*   **Eliza Chat** ([#6127](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6127)): CodeRabbit provided a plan to overhaul Eliza chat performance. This includes debugging and optimizing responsiveness by adding a `ModelPerformanceMonitor` with per-model timeouts and exponential-retry wrappers. The plan also covers integrating fast providers like Groq and Kimi, enabling real-time logging and metrics, and updating documentation related to model configuration and troubleshooting.
*   **Docs** ([#6128](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6128)): CodeRabbit outlined a plan to build a new public `/docs` UI. This involves creating and wiring a new React component to the main application, implementing a three-tab documentation page (Architecture Overview, API Explorer, Character Setup) using UI components and Tailwind CSS, and ensuring responsiveness and accessibility. The plan also includes creating accompanying markdown documentation.
*   **Plugin-Cloud Testing** ([#6129](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6129)): CodeRabbit proposed adding four new test files to provide comprehensive coverage and verification of ElizaOS cloud CLI commands (`deploy`, `containers`, `login`). These tests will validate documentation accuracy, TypeScript option/type consistency, and error-handling scenarios, and will be runnable via the existing Bun test runner.
*   **Voice Infrastructure** ([#6130](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6130)): CodeRabbit detailed a plan to deliver a complete voice infrastructure. This includes adding client-side browser TTS, server-side premium and embeddings endpoints, and comprehensive documentation. The plan also involves modifying existing files to integrate premium routing and types, with a note on required environment variables for authentication and provider API keys.
*   **Support Tasks** ([#6131](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6131)): CodeRabbit provided a plan to add documentation describing the Anonymous ID + Free Inference feature. The implementation plan includes adding database tables for anonymous users, inference quotas, and usage, introducing a `QuotaService` with CRUD operations and scheduled resets, integrating user-identification and quota-enforcement middleware, and updating APIs and the frontend for fingerprinting and client changes. The plan also covers enforcing tiered limits, model access, monitoring, and analytics.

On Jan 20, 2026, the ElizaOS project saw the opening of a new pull request in `elizaos/eliza` to introduce a dynamic execution engine for V2.0.0, alongside the successful resolution of a critical SQL error related to embedding dimensions. This progress indicates continued development on core functionalities and important bug fixes.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Core Functionality & Bug Fixes
- **SQL Embedding Dimension Fix**: An issue where the database adapter was hardcoded to use a `dim_1536` column, leading to errors when creating entities, has been resolved. This fix addresses a critical SQL error related to a 384-dim zero vector fallback when `USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING` was not respected. [elizaos/eliza#6380](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6380)

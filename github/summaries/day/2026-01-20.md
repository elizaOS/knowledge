On Jan 20, 2026, the ElizaOS project saw the opening of a new pull request in `elizaos/eliza` to introduce a dynamic execution engine for V2.0.0, alongside the successful resolution of a critical SQL error related to embedding dimensions in the same repository.

## ✅ Completed Work
### Bug Fixes
- **elizaos/eliza**: Fixed a SQL error where the database adapter was hardcoded to use a `dim_1536` column, leading to errors when creating entities and not respecting `USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING`. This was resolved in [elizaos/eliza#6380](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6380).

This system supports YAML-based test definitions, both local and E2B sandboxed testing environments, and includes a robust evaluation engine with action tracking and LLM judges. Mock service support is also integrated, significantly improving the ability to test and validate agent behavior across diverse tasks. ([#5723](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5723))

## NEW ISSUES
### Plugin Validation and Functionality
A new issue was opened to validate the functionality of Polygon-related plugins, specifically checking if they work correctly by cloning the plugin repo and running `elizaos dev`. The issue highlights a need to test plugins like `plugin-quickswap`. ([#5808](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5808))

### Discord Integration Issues
An issue was reported regarding image generation not working in Discord, despite images appearing in the web UI. The problem describes that the agent states an image has been created and describes it, but it does not show up in Discord. ([#5809](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5809))

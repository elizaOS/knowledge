## NEW ISSUES
### Plugin Validation and Functionality
A new issue was opened to validate the functionality of Polygon-related plugins, specifically mentioning `plugin-quickswap`, by cloning the plugin repo and running `elizaos dev` to ensure they start correctly with test characters when environment variables are provided. ([#5808](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5808))

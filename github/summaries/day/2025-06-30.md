# ElizaOS Daily Update (Jun 30, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Significant progress was made on CLI enhancements, bug fixes related to avatar handling and environment settings, and improvements to plugin functionality. Documentation for the `elizaos test` command was also added.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

**CLI Enhancements**
*   The CLI now displays "monorepo" version when running from within the ElizaOS monorepo, skipping npm version update checks in this context [#5320](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5320).
*   The CLI shows 'monorepo' when running from local dist builds and the actual version when globally installed [#5322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5322).
*   The `elizaos test` command now functions correctly outside the monorepo context [#5318](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5318).

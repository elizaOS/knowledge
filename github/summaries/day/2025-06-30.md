# ElizaOS Daily Update (Jun 30, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
Significant progress was made on CLI enhancements, bug fixes related to avatars and environment settings, and improvements to plugin functionality. Documentation for the test command was also added.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

**CLI Enhancements**
*   The CLI now displays "monorepo" version when running from within the ElizaOS monorepo, skipping npm version update checks in this context [#5320](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5320).
*   The CLI shows 'monorepo' when running from local dist builds and the actual version only when globally installed [#5322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5322).
*   Fixed `elizaos test` command failing when run outside the monorepo, ensuring it works in both monorepo and standalone project contexts [#5318](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5318).

**Bug Fixes and UI/UX Improvements**
*   Fixed an issue with loading from dirname [#5328](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5328).
*   Increased avatar upload threshold to 1024 and fixed avatar image issues [#5323](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5323).
*   Clarified UX by removing misleading avatar upload text after uploading an avatar [#5314](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5314).
*   Resolved an issue where the environment settings page would get stuck and prevent scrolling [#5312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5312).

**Plugin and Core Functionality**
*   Marked `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` as an essential plugin within the PluginsPanel [#5313](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5313).
*   Fixed integration test infinite loops in `plugin-sql` by using isolated databases [#5327](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5327).
*   Set the default avatar for the Eliza character [#5324](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5324).

## CLOSED ISSUES

**Project Setup and Plugin Development**
*   Addressed issues related to setting up a project from scratch and overall project impressions [#5249](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5249).
*   Closed an issue regarding the creation of a custom plugin for an onchain AI agent, specifically related to managing the Biconomy wallet with Chainlink automation & functions [#5260](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5260).

**Testing**

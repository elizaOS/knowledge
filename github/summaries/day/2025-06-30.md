# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Jun 30, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing the CLI experience with improved version display and test command reliability, alongside critical bug fixes for the client and plugin-sql. Several UI/UX improvements were also implemented, including avatar management and essential plugin visibility.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CLI Enhancements and Reliability
Significant work was done on the CLI, including features to display "monorepo" version for local builds and skip npm update checks in a monorepo context, improving developer experience ([#5322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5322), [#5320](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5320)). Critical fixes were also implemented to ensure the `elizaos test` command functions correctly outside the monorepo and to resolve issues with loading from `dirname` ([#5318](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5318), [#5328](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5328)).

### UI/UX Improvements and Bug Fixes
Several user interface and experience improvements were rolled out. This includes setting a default avatar for Eliza ([#5324](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5324)), increasing the avatar upload threshold, and fixing avatar display issues ([#5323](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5323)). The misleading avatar upload text was removed to clarify the UX ([#5314](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5314)), and the bootstrap plugin was marked as essential in the PluginsPanel ([#5313](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5313)). A critical bug preventing scrolling on the environment settings page was also resolved ([#5312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5312)).

### Plugin Stability and Testing
The `plugin-sql` integration tests were fixed to prevent infinite loops and timeouts by using isolated databases, significantly improving CI stability ([#5327](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5327)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
Five new pull requests were opened, primarily addressing CI/CD and testing stability issues, particularly on Windows and Ubuntu environments:
- [#5334](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5334) Fix cli tests failing in Ubuntu
- [#5333](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5333) Fix Windows CI issues
- [#5332](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5332) ðŸ”§ Fix Windows CI Issues - Comprehensive Solution
- [#5331](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5331) fix: Ubuntu CLI test parallelization issues
- [#5330](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5330) fix: install AI model plugins on create

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Plugin Development and Agent Interaction
Two issues related to plugin development and agent interaction were closed. [#5260](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5260) highlighted difficulties in creating custom plugins for on-chain AI agents, with a comment suggesting that responses should be sent via callback or return, but not both.

### Project Setup and User Experience
An issue regarding difficulties in setting up a project from scratch ([#5249](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5249)) was closed.

### Testing and Internal Issues
Two internal testing issues ([#5315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5315), [#5316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5316)) were opened and quickly closed, indicating successful internal verification or resolution.

## NEW ISSUES

### CLI Testing and Documentation
A new issue was opened to test all CLI commands against the CLI documentation ([#5325](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5325)), indicating a focus on ensuring consistency and accuracy in CLI usage and documentation.

### Internal Testing
Two brief internal testing issues were created and closed on the same day ([#5315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5315), [#5316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5316)).

### Community Engagement and Gamification
A new issue proposes implementing a badge system for gamified contributor recognition and achievement ([#140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/140)), with initial work on art designs already underway.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Windows Compatibility and CLI Startup
The issue [#5161](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5161), concerning `elizaos start` crashes on Windows after accessing localhost:3000, remains active. The latest comment from `paulmerz` on June 30, 2025, asks for an ETA on when the fix will be available via ElizaCLI and if there's a workaround for WSL2 on Windows, despite a previous comment from `wtfsayo` on July 13, 2025, stating the fix should be available and closing the issue. This suggests a potential discrepancy or ongoing challenge with Windows compatibility.

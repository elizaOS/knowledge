### UI/UX Enhancements and Agent Builder Improvements
A substantial number of issues related to user interface and experience were closed. This includes implementing guided onboarding overlays, adding placeholder text to input fields, and improving tooltips for clarity ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221), [#6228](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6228), [#6227](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6227)). Agent creation and management also saw improvements, such as enabling avatar creation and save/deploy via chat, renaming buttons for better clarity, and adding a three-dot menu to agent cards ([#6230](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6230), [#6231](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6231), [#6232](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6232), [#6233](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6233), [#6234](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6234)).

### Knowledge Management and File Upload Streamlining
Improvements were made to the knowledge management section, including increasing the visibility of the "Choose Files" button, renaming "Knowledge" to "Files," and removing the two-step upload process for immediate file uploads ([#6238](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6238), [#6237](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6237), [#6239](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6239)).

Furthermore, 10 unused dependencies were removed to reduce bundle size and maintenance burden ([#173](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/173)).

### Infrastructure and Performance Optimizations
The project made strides in infrastructure and performance. Adaptive rate limiting was implemented for faster multi-repo ingestion ([#159](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/159)). A Next.js upgrade blocking issue related to RSC serialization was fixed ([#176](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/176)).

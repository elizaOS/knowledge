    - Implemented adaptive rate limiting for 60% faster multi-repo ingestion, integrating a feature from M3-org/op-hiscores and fixing pipeline workflow step ordering. ([#159](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/159))
    - Resolved a Next.js upgrade blocking RSC serialization error by adding 'use client' to `StatCardsDisplay.tsx`. ([#176](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/176))

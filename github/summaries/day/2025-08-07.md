# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 7, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on refining monorepo dependency management, streamlining release workflows, and fixing CLI build issues. Significant progress was also made on advanced scenario features, including natural language agent interaction, dynamic plugin loading, and enhanced mocking capabilities, though some are currently blocked by a plugin loading bug.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Monorepo Dependency and Release Workflow Enhancements
The monorepo's dependency management was significantly improved by migrating to `workspace:*` versioning, ensuring better synchronization and consistency across packages ([#5731](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5731)). Additionally, the release workflow was refined by removing the automatic merge from `main` to `develop`, providing more control over the release process ([#5732](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5732)).

### CLI Stability and Version Handling Fixes
A critical bug in the CLI's `update` command was addressed, specifically fixing its handling of monorepo versions to ensure tests pass consistently in CI environments ([#5733](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5733)).

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#5736](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5736) Fix action chaining
- [#5735](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5735) allow iframes when web ui is enabled in production
- [#5729](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5729) Update README.md to fix error
- [#5728](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5728) feat: ability to cancel current run before any calls to LLM are made

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Scenario Runtime Dependency and Environment Fixes
Two critical issues related to scenario runtime were closed. This includes a fix for runtime dependency auditing and evaluators ([#5640](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5640)) and an integration fix for environment providers that was bypassing sophisticated logic ([#5639](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5639)).

### Environment Variable Parsing Issue
An issue where environment variables with quotes were not being read correctly was resolved ([#5590](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5590)).

## NEW ISSUES

### Advanced Scenario Feature Development
New issues were opened to track the implementation of advanced scenario capabilities:
- Natural language agent interaction and response validation ([#5727](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5727)).
- Plugin specification and dynamic loading within scenarios ([#5725](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5725)).
- Conditional mocking and complex response structures for testing ([#5726](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5726)).

### CLI Build and Monorepo Versioning Problems
Two new issues highlight problems with the CLI:
- The Eliza CLI failing to build projects due to a `logger.info` formatting error ([#5734](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5734)).
- The release workflow incorrectly replacing `@elizaos` packages with version numbers in the monorepo ([#5730](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5730)).

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Natural Language Agent Interaction ([#5727](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5727))
Monilpat reported that the implementation for natural language agent interaction is complete, including schema changes, API client integration, and a comprehensive test suite. However, this feature is currently blocked by a persistent plugin loading hang issue (#5719), preventing full testing and validation. The core `handleNaturalLanguageInteraction()` function is ready, and the scenario usage is defined. Next steps are to fix the blocking plugin loading issue, then test and validate the agent responses.

### Dynamic Plugin Loading ([#5725](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5725))
Monilpat provided an update stating that dynamic plugin parsing and validation are complete. This includes enhanced schema support, a dynamic plugin parser with validation, and integration with the scenario command. Similar to the natural language interaction, this feature is also blocked by the plugin loading hang issue (#5719), which prevents actual dynamic plugin installation and real-world testing. The next critical step is to resolve the plugin loading issue to enable full functionality and integration with the agent runtime.

### Conditional Mocking and Complex Response Structures ([#5726](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5726))
Monilpat confirmed a fix for a JSON parsing error in the E2B provider, which was caused by attempting to parse plain string mock responses as JSON. The solution involved enhanced JSON validation, proper response structuring in mock definitions, and graceful fallback for non-JSON responses. The core advanced mocking features are 85% complete, including enhanced schema, advanced matching strategies, dynamic response generation, error simulation, and metadata support. Remaining tasks include real-world service integration testing, edge case validation, and integration with agent interaction.

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Aug 7, 2025)

## OVERVIEW

Today's development focused on refining monorepo dependency management, fixing CLI build issues, and advancing scenario testing capabilities with new mocking and natural language interaction features.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Monorepo Dependency and Release Workflow Enhancements
Significant progress was made in streamlining the monorepo's dependency management by migrating to `workspace:*` versioning, ensuring better synchronization and consistency across packages. Additionally, the release workflow was refined by removing an unnecessary automatic merge step.
- feat: replace numbered versions to workspace:* ([#5731](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5731))
- feat: remove automatic merge to develop from release workflow ([#5732](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5732))

### CLI Stability and Build Fixes
A critical fix was implemented for the CLI's update command to correctly handle monorepo versions, resolving a CI test failure. This improves the reliability of the CLI for project management.
- fix(cli): handle monorepo version in update command ([#5733](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5733))

### Advanced Scenario Testing Capabilities
New features are being developed to enhance scenario testing, including conditional mocking with complex response structures and the ability to interact with agents using natural language. These improvements aim to make scenario testing more robust and realistic.
- feat(scenarios): Implement conditional mocking and complex response structures ([#5726](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5726))
- feat(scenarios): Implement natural language agent interaction and response validation ([#5727](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5727))
- feat(scenarios): Implement plugin specification and dynamic loading ([#5725](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5725))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS

- [#5736](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5736) Fix action chaining
- [#5735](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5735) allow iframes when web ui is enabled in production
- [#5729](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5729) Update README.md to fix error
- [#5728](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5728) feat: ability to cancel current run before any calls to LLM are made

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Scenario Runtime and Environment Fixes
Two issues related to scenario runtime dependencies and environment provider integration were closed, indicating successful resolution of bugs that were bypassing sophisticated logic and causing dependency issues.
- env read issue with quotes "" ([#5590](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5590))
- Ticket Spec: `fix(scenarios): Runtime dependency audit and fix for evaluators` ([#5640](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5640))
- Ticket Spec: `fix(scenarios): Fix environment provider integration - bypass issue` ([#5639](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5639))

### Monorepo Versioning and CLI Build Issues
An issue concerning the release workflow incorrectly replacing `@elizaos` packages with version numbers in the monorepo was closed. Additionally, a critical issue preventing the Eliza CLI from building projects was identified and closed, with a fix confirmed in a later version.
- release workflow should not replace @elizaos packages with version number in monorep ([#5730](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5730))
- Eliza CLI failed to build project ([#5734](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5734))

## NEW ISSUES

### Enhanced Scenario Testing Features
New issues were opened to track the implementation of advanced scenario testing capabilities, including natural language agent interaction, dynamic plugin loading, and sophisticated conditional mocking. These features aim to improve the realism and flexibility of scenario-based testing.
- feat(scenarios): Implement natural language agent interaction and response validation ([#5727](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5727))
- feat(scenarios): Implement plugin specification and dynamic loading ([#5725](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5725))
- feat(scenarios): Implement conditional mocking and complex response structures ([#5726](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5726))

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Advanced Scenario Mocking and Natural Language Interaction ([#5726], [#5727], [#5725])
Development is underway for advanced mocking, natural language agent interaction, and dynamic plugin loading within scenarios. The core features for advanced mocking are 85% complete, with an immediate fix for a JSON parsing error in the E2B provider. However, both natural language interaction and dynamic plugin loading are currently blocked by a persistent plugin loading hang issue ([#5719]). The team has implemented parsing and validation for dynamic plugins and integrated API client communication for natural language, but cannot fully test these features until the blocking issue is resolved. Next steps involve fixing the plugin loading issue, followed by comprehensive testing and integration with real services.

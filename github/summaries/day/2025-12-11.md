On December 11, 2025, ElizaOS significantly enhanced its core stability by resolving widespread TypeScript build errors across multiple packages in the `elizaos/eliza` repository, ensuring improved code maintainability. Concurrently, the project expanded its Web3 and communication capabilities with the addition of new Moralis DeFi and OpenChat integration plugins to the `elizaos-plugins/registry`.

# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on significant CLI simplification by integrating server/core functionalities and crucial bug fixes in plugin error handling, alongside ongoing architectural refinements.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CLI Simplification and Core Alignment
The CLI has undergone a major refactor to remove duplication by leveraging existing server and core functionalities. This involved deleting custom module loaders and streamlining various CLI commands, leading to a more cohesive and maintainable architecture. This change impacts numerous files across the `cli`, `core`, and `server` packages. ([#6060](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6060))

### Plugin Error Handling Enhancement
A critical bug fix was implemented to correctly handle ZodError issues in plugins. The change ensures that `error.issues` is used instead of `error.errors` for ZodError API compatibility, improving error handling consistency across `plugin-quick-starter`, `plugin-starter`, and `project-starter`. ([#6035](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6035))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
A new pull request, [#6068](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6068), was opened to introduce a feature for auto-injecting bootstrap and SQL plugins into the server.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Core Refactoring and Alignment

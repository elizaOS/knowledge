# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 16, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on streamlining the CLI by integrating server/core functionalities and refining error handling for plugins. A significant refactor of the CLI's architecture was initiated, aiming for reduced duplication and improved consistency.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CLI Simplification and Architectural Alignment
The CLI has undergone a major simplification, removing redundant module loaders and aligning its operations with the server and core components. This change aims to reduce duplication and improve the overall architecture of the CLI.
- Removed custom module-loader and related files from the CLI.
- Integrated server/core functionalities directly into the CLI commands.
- Affected files span across `packages/cli`, `packages/core`, and `packages/server`.
- This work is part of a larger CLI cleanup effort.

### Plugin Error Handling Improvements
Error handling for plugins has been enhanced to correctly use the `ZodError.issues` API, ensuring consistency and proper error reporting across different plugin starters.
- Changed `error.errors` to `error.issues` to match the ZodError API.
- Fixed error handling in `plugin-starter` and `project-starter`.
- Added proper error handling for non-ZodError cases.
- Ensures consistency with `plugin-quick-starter` implementation.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Core Refactoring and CLI Decoupling
A significant refactoring effort has been completed, focusing on aligning server code with ElizaOS global functions and decoupling bootstrap logic from the CLI. This initiative aimed to remove custom logic, modular loaders, and resolution hacks, leading to a cleaner and more consistent architecture.
- Refactored server code to utilize ElizaOS global functions.
- Decoupled bootstrap logic from the CLI, centralizing it within the core.
- Eliminated CLI "server-start" embedding.
- Cleaned up modular loaders and resolution hacks.

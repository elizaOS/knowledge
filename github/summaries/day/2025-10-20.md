# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Oct 20, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on critical bug fixes, particularly addressing missing dotfiles in new projects and resolving build failures. Several long-standing issues related to logging and build processes were also closed.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### CLI Scaffolding Fixes
A significant bug was resolved that prevented critical dotfiles like `.gitignore` and `.env.example` from being included when scaffolding new projects using `eliza create`. This fix ensures that newly generated projects are complete and ready for version control and configuration. ([#6080](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6080))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#6082](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6082) feat: Streamdown integration, cross-platform crypto, and server port autodiscovery: This PR introduces Streamdown integration, enhances cross-platform cryptographic capabilities, and adds server port autodiscovery.
- [#6081](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6081) feat: add get action results: This PR adds functionality to retrieve action results.

## CLOSED ISSUES

### CLI Project Scaffolding Improvements
The issue where `eliza create` was not including `.gitignore` in new projects has been resolved, ensuring proper version control setup for scaffolded agents. ([#6074](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6074))

### Build and Logging System Stability
Several issues impacting the build process and logging system have been addressed. The problem with `pino-pretty` errors in Bun export builds, leading to a migration to `adze` for logging, has been completed. Additionally, a build failure in `@elizaos/core` that caused `bun run clean` to fail has been fixed. ([#5673](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5673), [#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738))

### Optional API Key Setup
The request to make API key setup optional in `npx elizaos create` has been closed, with confirmation that this functionality is already available via the `-y` flag. ([#5604](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5604))

## NEW ISSUES
### Eliza CLI Refactoring Initiative
A new issue was opened to discuss and plan the refactoring of the Eliza CLI. The core idea is to simplify the CLI by delegating more logic to project directories and streamlining its responsibilities to configuration and execution delegation.
- [#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)

### Undocumented Web UI Dashboard
A new issue highlighted that the existing web UI dashboard is completely undocumented, leading to users being unaware of its existence and how to interact with their agents through it.
- [#5857](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5857)

### Project Creation Path Error
A user reported an error related to "path not found" when attempting to create a new project, indicating a potential issue with module resolution during project scaffolding.
- [#5856](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5856)

## ACTIVE ISSUES
### Image Generation Not Working in Discord
The discussion on [#5809](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5809) continued with a confirmation that the issue has been fixed by PR [#5861](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5861). Earlier discussions involved troubleshooting steps such as checking Discord bot permissions, verifying bot setup, environment configuration, plugin loading, and log analysis. The problem was identified as images appearing in the web UI but not in Discord, despite the bot confirming generation.

### Refactor Eliza CLI
The newly opened issue [#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860) quickly became active with a detailed discussion on the proposed refactoring of the Eliza CLI. Key points include:
- **Delegation of Logic**: The consensus is to move complex logic out of the CLI and into project directories or a dedicated server package.
- **CLI Responsibilities**: The CLI should primarily handle configuration and delegate execution, acting as a "remote control" with minimal business logic.
- **Server Package**: A `server` package (`@eliza/server`) is proposed to handle agent lifecycle, plugin loading, DI, migrations, database bootstrap, character loading, and central configuration.
- **Project Starters**: Starter projects would become the "composition root," managing plugins, characters, and configuration with minimal bootstrapping code.
- **Concerns**: Some concerns were raised about replicating logic across projects if too much is moved out of the CLI, with a preference for minimal changes within projects.
- **Progress Update**: A detailed progress update was provided, outlining the architecture and delegation phases, restructured project starters, and a smooth end-to-end workflow. The next steps involve comprehensive testing of delegation, template structure, mode switching, and migration of project-specific tests.

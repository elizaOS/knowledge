# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing plugin management with auto-installation capabilities and critical bug fixes related to runtime initialization and environment variable loading, improving the stability and adaptability of the ElizaOS framework.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Plugin Management and Auto-Installation
A new feature was introduced to the `PluginLoader` that enables safe, on-demand auto-installation of missing server plugins. This addresses runtime failures caused by external plugins not being pre-installed, making the system more robust and autonomous. ([#6006](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6006))

### Critical Bug Fixes for Runtime and Environment Loading
Two significant bugs were resolved:
*   Runtimes now initialize with settings at creation, preventing a race condition where adapters failed to receive correct environment variables (e.g., Postgres URL), which previously led to database operation failures. ([#6008](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6008))
*   The logic for loading `.env` files was refined to be monorepo-aware, and the Ollama fallback LLM provider is now only included when no other LLM providers are configured, improving environment variable handling and LLM provider selection. ([#6005](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6005))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
*   [#6009](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6009) chore: fix typo in comment: This PR aims to correct a typo within a comment in the codebase.
*   [#6007](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6007) Fix(runtime): Ensure agent creation handles missing agent gracefully: This PR addresses an issue where agent creation might fail if an agent is missing, ensuring more robust handling.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Unhandled Exception in Agent Runtime
Issue [#6003](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6003) reports an unhandled exception during `AgentRuntime` initialization when `getAgents()` fails, specifically if the agents table does not exist. A comment from borisudovicic links to PR [#6008](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6008), suggesting a potential fix or related work.

### Eliza Agent Not Aware of EVM Plugin
Issue [#15](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/15) describes a problem where the Eliza agent, despite having `plugin-evm` installed and configured, does not seem to be aware of EVM functionalities like fetching balances or making transfers. Recent comments indicate ongoing troubleshooting:
*   `0xted97` (Sep 27, 2025) confirmed adding the plugin name and chain name (`{ evm: ["mainnet", "base", "arbitrumSepolia"] }`) but noted that while the agent can retrieve EVM addresses, it fails to perform main EVM actions and often responds in a circular, confirmatory manner instead of executing actions.
*   `wtfsayo` (Sep 26, 2025) advised adding the plugin name in the character definition.
*   `0xted97` (Sep 26, 2025) asked if the issue had been resolved by `omariosman`.
Previous discussions (June 2025) involved checking plugin versions, ensuring `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` was defined, and correctly referencing the plugin as a string. The latest comments suggest that even with correct configuration, the agent's ability to execute EVM actions remains a challenge.

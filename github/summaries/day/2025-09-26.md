# elizaos/eliza Daily Update (Sep 26, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
Today's development focused on enhancing plugin management with auto-installation and refining runtime initialization for improved stability and environment variable handling.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Enhanced Plugin Management and Auto-Installation
The server's PluginLoader now features automatic installation of missing plugins, addressing runtime failures when external plugins are referenced but not pre-installed. This streamlines the development process by ensuring dependencies are met on demand. ([#6006](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6006))

### Improved Runtime Initialization and Configuration Loading
Critical fixes were implemented to ensure runtimes are initialized with correct settings at creation, resolving a race condition where adapters failed to receive environment variables like the Postgres URL. Additionally, environment variable loading was refined for monorepo awareness, and Ollama fallback logic was improved to activate only when no other LLM providers are configured. ([#6008](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6008), [#6005](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6005))

## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS
- [#6009](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6009) chore: fix typo in comment: This PR aims to correct a typographical error within a comment in the codebase.
- [#6007](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6007) Fix(runtime): Ensure agent creation handles missing agent gracefully: This PR addresses an issue where agent creation might fail if an agent is missing, aiming to improve the robustness of the runtime.

## ACTIVE ISSUES

### Eliza agent is not aware by plugin evm ([#15](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/15))
Discussions continue regarding the Eliza agent's inability to recognize the `plugin-evm`. The latest comments suggest ensuring the plugin name is correctly added to the character definition and using version `1.0.6` or later for the EVM plugin. Users are advised to check logs for initialization failures and test the agent's awareness by prompting about available EVM tools. Previous suggestions included using a string reference for the plugin and ensuring the `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` is defined. The issue persists for some users despite these recommendations.

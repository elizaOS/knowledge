# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (August 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
Early August was a period of foundational refinement and preparation for future growth. Development focused heavily on improving the developer experience and overall repository hygiene by streamlining the build process, simplifying setup with automatic CLI dependency installation, and removing obsolete code and documentation. While no major features were merged, significant groundwork was laid with new feature requests for the core package and a proposal for a new sessions API, signaling a move towards enhanced modularity and capability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work completed in this period centered on optimizing the development environment and cleaning up the codebase.

*   **Developer Experience and Build Optimization**: To streamline setup for new and existing contributors, the `@elizaos/cli` is now automatically installed as a dev dependency in non-monorepo environments ([#5702](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5702)). The main build process was also made more efficient by removing the docs filter and cleaning up dependencies ([#5701](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5701)).
*   **Repository and CI/CD Cleanup**: A significant effort was made to simplify the repository. This included removing outdated LangChain and Tauri details from the `README.md` ([#5700](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5700)) and deleting three obsolete GitHub workflow files (`deploy-cli.yml`, `docs-publish.yml`, `llmstxt-generator.yml`), which cleans up the CI/CD pipeline ([#5699](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5699)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
No issues were closed during this period, but several key issues and pull requests were opened, outlining the project's near-term trajectory.

*   **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this reporting period.
*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Core Package Enhancements**: Two feature requests were opened for the core package: one to add an `unregisterAction` method for better runtime action management ([#5697](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5697)) and another to define an `IStorageService` type to support new storage plugins ([#5698](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5698)).
    *   **Deployment**: A new issue was created to track the deployment of Eliza Cloud on Railway ([#5703](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5703)).
    *   **Work in Progress**: New pull requests were opened to introduce a "sessions API" ([#5704](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5704)) and to fix a test component ([#5705](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5705)), indicating ongoing feature development and maintenance.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Development activity was steady, with a clear focus on foundational improvements. The work reflects a proactive approach to maintenance and developer ergonomics, which is crucial for a healthy open-source project. While the provided reports do not indicate high-volume discussions on any single item, the nature of the issues and pull requests suggests a coordinated effort to prepare the codebase for upcoming features and improved stability.

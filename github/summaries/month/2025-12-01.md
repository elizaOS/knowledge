# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (December 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
December was a month of foundational improvements and strategic planning. Development focused on enhancing core stability through significant server refactoring, dependency updates, and widespread TypeScript error resolution. This backend work was complemented by a major push to refine the user experience, with numerous UI/UX issues closed and a comprehensive set of new issues opened to guide a future overhaul of the agent creation workflow and dashboard. Key new capabilities were introduced, including a unified serverless API and streamlined ElizaOS Cloud integration in the CLI, setting the stage for greater scalability and ease of use.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
This month's efforts were balanced between strengthening the existing codebase and introducing new, strategic features.

-   **Core Stability and Modernization:**
    -   A major server refactoring optimized the codebase and reorganized API endpoints and services ([#6199](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6199)).
    -   Server reliability was enhanced by properly configuring Socket.IO timeouts and implementing explicit HTTP server timeouts ([#6198](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6198)).
    -   A comprehensive effort resolved TypeScript build errors across numerous packages, including `core`, `server`, `client`, and `cli`, ensuring type safety and code stability ([#6218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6218)).
    -   All monorepo dependencies were updated to their latest versions, resolving compatibility conflicts, particularly with `drizzle-orm` ([#6210](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6210)).

-   **New Features & Integrations:**
    -   A unified API for serverless Node.js environments was implemented, streamlining core functionalities for broader deployment options ([#6201](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6201)).
    -   The CLI was enhanced to make ElizaOS Cloud the default AI provider, featuring a new browser-based login flow to simplify API key setup ([#6208](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6208)).
    -   Work began on JWT authentication and user management ([#6200](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6200)) and parallel action execution ([#6209](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6209)).

-   **Plugin and CLI Enhancements:**
    -   The SQL plugin was significantly improved with smooth schema migration for backward compatibility, optimized Row-Level Security (RLS) handling, and auto-creation of PGLite directories ([#6215](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6215), [#6202](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6202)).
    -   Standalone examples were modernized to use the new `messageService.handleMessage()` API, deprecating the old event system ([#6202](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6202)).
    -   An API signature mismatch in the CLI's end-to-end tests was corrected, restoring test reliability ([#6207](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6207)).

-   **Bug Fixes and Code Quality:**
    -   A critical security bug in character secret encryption was fixed to ensure the correct order of operations ([#6217](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/6217)).
    -   Markdown rendering issues causing inconsistent spacing in the client UI were resolved ([#6159](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6159), [#6197](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6197)).
    -   A substantial code cleanup removed technical debt by fixing `any`/`unknown` types, eliminating dead code, and removing unnecessary `try-catch` blocks ([#6213](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6213)).

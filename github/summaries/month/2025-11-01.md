# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
November kicked off with a dual focus on enhancing system stability and laying the groundwork for significant new capabilities. A critical bug affecting agent settings persistence was resolved, directly improving the framework's reliability. Concurrently, new development was initiated to introduce entity-level security and enhance the core runtime. The opening of several strategic issues signals a forward-looking push towards improved performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as new user engagement features.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this month balanced immediate fixes with the introduction of new features.

- **Agent Stability Improvement**
  A significant bug was fixed that prevented agent settings from persisting across restarts, ensuring that runtime-generated configurations are now correctly retained. This change, made to the core runtime initialization logic, enhances the overall reliability of agent operations ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)).

- **New Feature Initiatives**
  Development began on several new fronts with the opening of new pull requests:
  - **Security:** A proposal was made to implement entity-level row-level security, aiming to add more granular data access controls ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)).
  - **Runtime Enhancements:** Work started on adding an ElizaOS reference directly to the runtime, likely to streamline framework interactions ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue tracking this month was focused on defining the next wave of development priorities.

- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.

- **New & Active Issues:** Several key issues were opened, outlining major areas for future work:
  - **Core Functionality & Performance:** Discussions were initiated around implementing "Parallel actions" ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)) and "Background tasks" ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), indicating a focus on scaling the system's operational capacity.
  - **Security & User Engagement:** New issues were created for "Entity-level RLS" ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)), which complements the ongoing PR, and a "Points / Leaderboard" system ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)) to enhance user interaction.
  - According to the reports, none of the active issues have generated more than three comments, suggesting discussions are still in their early stages.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The provided reports indicate a period of focused, heads-down development. While new pull requests and issues were opened, the data does not show any high-volume discussions or specific collaborative events. The alignment between the new pull request for RLS ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)) and the corresponding new issue ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)) suggests coordinated planning around new features.

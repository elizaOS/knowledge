# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (November 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
November began with a dual focus on enhancing core stability and initiating new feature development. A critical bug impacting agent reliability was resolved, ensuring that agent settings now persist correctly across restarts. Concurrently, work commenced on a significant security enhancement with a proposal to implement entity-level row-level security, signaling a move towards more granular data control within the framework.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
This period saw important work on the core runtime to improve agent stability and persistence.

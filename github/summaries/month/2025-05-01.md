# ElizaOS Monthly Update (May 2025)

## OVERVIEW
May was a highly productive month for ElizaOS, with significant advancements in the framework's modularity and extensibility. The team focused on enhancing plugin management, improving CLI functionality, and strengthening core infrastructure. Major achievements include the preparation for plugin compatibility between versions 0.x and 1.x, implementation of API key authentication, and the addition of comprehensive integration tests.

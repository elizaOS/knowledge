# ElizaOS Monthly Update (May 2025)

## OVERVIEW
May was a transformative month for ElizaOS, with significant progress toward the 1.x release. The team focused on enhancing plugin architecture, improving CLI functionality, and strengthening core components. Major achievements include preparing the 0.x plugin system for compatibility with 1.x, implementing API key authentication, and adding comprehensive integration tests. The codebase was also streamlined by removing several plugins from the monorepo to support a more modular ecosystem.

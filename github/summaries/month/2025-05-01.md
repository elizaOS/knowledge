# ElizaOS Monthly Update (May 2025)

## OVERVIEW
May was a transformative month for ElizaOS with significant enhancements to the framework's core architecture and plugin ecosystem. The team delivered comprehensive improvements to the CLI experience, expanded knowledge management capabilities with new RAG features, and streamlined the plugin system with better third-party integration support. Major strides were made in API functionality, environment configuration, and UI components, while simultaneously moving several plugins to dedicated repositories to support a more modular ecosystem.

# ElizaOS Monthly Update (June 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
June was a month of foundational enhancements and significant expansion for ElizaOS. Development focused on overhauling the CLI for a superior developer experience, introducing major architectural refactors like a standalone messaging server and agent-scoped plugins, and expanding support for new AI providers including Ollama, Google, and OpenRouter. The team also dedicated substantial effort to improving UI/UX, bolstering test coverage, and refining documentation to support our growing community.

# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (June 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
June was a month of foundational transformation and feature expansion for ElizaOS. The project underwent significant architectural refactoring, most notably by separating the server into a standalone `@elizaos/server` package and transitioning plugins to an agent-scoped model for greater flexibility. This focus on modularity was matched by a push for broader AI provider support, with integrations for Google Generative AI, Ollama, and OpenRouter. Concurrently, the team invested heavily in improving developer experience and stability by overhauling the testing framework, enhancing the CLI, and resolving numerous bugs, particularly around CI/CD and cross-platform compatibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
This month's work focused on maturing the core architecture, expanding capabilities, and improving stability across the framework.

**Core Architecture & API Refinement**
- **Server Separation:** The most significant architectural change was the extraction of server functionality into a new, independent `@elizaos/server` package. This modularization enables independent server usage and streamlines future development ([#5122](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5122)).
- **API Restructuring:** API routes were reorganized into a logical, domain-based structure for better clarity ([#5010](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5010]). A new type-safe `@elizaos/api-client` package was also introduced and integrated into the client, improving developer experience and reducing errors ([#5240](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5240), [#5263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5263)).
- **Messaging System Refactor:** The message server was refactored to operate independently from agents, introducing a centralized system with support for servers and channels ([#4864](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4864)).

**Agent & Plugin System Enhancements**
- **Agent-Scoped Plugins:** The plugin architecture was refactored from project-scoped to agent-scoped, allowing individual agents to have unique, customizable plugin sets ([#5270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5270)).
- **Expanded AI Provider Support:** The framework's flexibility was enhanced by adding support for Google Generative AI (Gemini) ([#5217](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5217]), Ollama ([#5160](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5160]), and OpenRouter ([#5264](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5264]) as language and embedding model providers.
- **Plugin Management:** Numerous fixes were implemented to improve plugin loading ([#4949](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4949)), dependency resolution ([#4888](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4888)), and installation processes ([#4945](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4945)).

**CLI & Developer Experience**
- **Modernized CLI:** The CLI experience was significantly upgraded by migrating all prompts to `@clack/prompts` for a better user interface and type safety ([#5016](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5016]).
- **Performance Optimization:** The `elizaos create` command was sped up by lazy-loading dependencies in starter templates ([#5214](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5214]).
- **New Tooling:** A new CLI starter project was introduced ([#4830](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4830]), and comprehensive setup guides were added, including one for macOS development ([#4903](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4903)).

**Testing and CI/CD Overhaul**
- **Framework Migration:** A major effort was undertaken to standardize the testing framework, migrating CLI tests from Bats to Bun TypeScript ([#4978](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4978]) and moving the entire monorepo from a mixed `vitest`/`bun:test` setup to a unified `bun:test` framework ([#5185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5185)).
- **Stability Fixes:** Significant effort was dedicated to stabilizing CI/CD pipelines, addressing numerous issues related to caching ([#5225](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5225]), dependency installation ([#5143](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5143)), and cross-platform compatibility, especially for Windows ([#5156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5156), [#5332](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5332)).

**UI/UX Improvements**
- **Chat Interface:** The chat UI received numerous enhancements, including a retry button for messages ([#4973](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4973]), an animated markdown component ([#5111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5111]), and improved responsive design ([#4974](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4974)).
- **Agent Management:** The UI for managing agents was improved with fixes to the character form secrets panel ([#5186](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5186]), avatar uploads ([#5323](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5323]), and environment settings ([#5312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5312)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The project saw a high volume of issue creation and resolution, reflecting an active development cycle and engaged user base.

- **Closed Issues:** Key problems resolved this month include persistent agent interaction bugs like infinite response loops ([#4934](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4934)) and cross-chat interference ([#4935](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4935]). Critical plugin issues, such as action callbacks not reaching the user ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5017)) and broken EVM plugin functionality ([#4357](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4357)]), were addressed. Several setup and configuration blockers were also fixed, including character files failing to load ([#5039](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5039)) and a bug preventing large character files from being saved ([#5268](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5268)).

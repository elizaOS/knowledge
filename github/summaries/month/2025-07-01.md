# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of significant refinement and foundational enhancement for ElizaOS. A major effort was dedicated to overhauling the user interface to align with Figma designs, resulting in a more polished and consistent user experience. The Command Line Interface (CLI) saw extensive stabilization, with numerous bug fixes, improved cross-platform compatibility (especially for Windows), and a standardized user interaction model. Architecturally, the introduction of action chaining and standardized service types has paved the way for more complex and modular agent behaviors. The month concluded with the strategic planning and kickoff of a new "Scenario Runner" feature, signaling a move towards more robust agent evaluation and testing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on improving user experience, stabilizing core tools, and laying the groundwork for future capabilities.

#### **UI/UX Overhaul & Alignment**
A concerted effort was made to align the Web UI with official Figma designs, enhancing visual consistency and usability across the application.
- **Component Redesigns:** Key components were refactored to match design specifications, including the Agent Card ([#5344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5344), [#5351](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5351)), Chat component ([#5349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5349)), Sidebar ([#5373](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5373)), and DM chat headers ([#5392](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5392)).
- **Usability Improvements:** User experience was enhanced with features like an auto-resizing chat input ([#5546](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5546]), a unified confirmation modal hook ([#5444](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5444)), and improved avatar handling ([#5390](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5390)).
- **Performance:** The default Eliza avatar was optimized to improve application load times ([#5350](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5350)).

#### **CLI Stabilization and Enhancements**
The CLI received significant attention to improve its reliability, consistency, and developer experience.
- **Consistent UX:** The CLI was migrated to use `@clack/prompts` for a consistent and modern user interaction experience across all commands ([#5359](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5359)).
- **Bug Fixes:** Numerous bugs were addressed, including issues with the `create` command ([#5321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5321), [#5337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5337]), SPA routing for globally installed instances ([#5479](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5479]), and preventing the `update` command from creating files in non-project directories ([#5427](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5427)).
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Critical fixes were implemented to resolve plugin loading failures on Windows ([#5416](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5416), [#5437](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5437]), a long-standing pain point.

#### **Core Architectural Improvements**
The underlying agent framework was extended with new features to support more advanced capabilities.
- **Action Chaining:** A system for sequential action execution with state management was implemented, enabling more complex, multi-step agent tasks ([#5436](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5436)).
- **Service Types:** The core runtime now supports standardized service types, allowing plugins to discover and interact with services based on their capabilities via `getServicesByType()` ([#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565)). This is a key step towards a more modular and composable architecture.
- **New Capabilities:** A `generateImageAction` was added to the agent pipeline, allowing agents to generate images based on conversational context ([#5446](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5446)).

#### **Developer Experience & Tooling**
Several improvements were made to streamline the development and testing workflow.
- **Automated Workflows:** The Claude-powered code review and quality analysis workflows were enhanced, providing automated security checks, verbose logging, and the ability to run on every commit to a PR ([#5519](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5519), [#5570](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5570)).
- **Plugin Development:** An AI-powered migration tool was introduced to help upgrade plugins to v1.x ([#5311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5311]), and a new `plugin-quick-starter` template was added for backend-only plugins ([#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589)).
- **Testing:** A new `@elizaos/test-utils` package was created to provide a `MockRuntime` for easier testing ([#5507](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5507]), and test execution was standardized across the monorepo ([#5218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5218)).
- **Dev Server:** The development server was updated to shut down gracefully on `Cmd+C` ([#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562]) and to auto-build on `elizaos start` ([#5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
- **Closed Issues:** A significant number of issues were resolved, reflecting the month's focus on stabilization. Key resolutions included fixing numerous plugin loading and CLI command failures on Windows ([#5407](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5407), [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5499]), correcting REST API documentation ([#5370](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5370]), and resolving inconsistencies in the testing framework ([#5367](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5367)). The closure of the long-standing issue to implement Service Types ([#4914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914)) marks a major architectural milestone.
- **New & Active Issues:** The most notable new issues are a series of planned tasks ([#5573](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5573) - [#5579](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5579)) that outline the implementation of a new **Scenario Runner** for agent evaluation. This represents a significant new direction for the project. Other new issues highlight ongoing challenges with plugin installation on Windows ([#5500](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5500)) and requests for new integrations, such as a Zapper plugin ([#5600](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5600)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The development velocity in July was exceptionally high, with daily progress across the UI, CLI, and core architecture. The structured creation of multiple issues to plan the Scenario Runner feature demonstrates a methodical and collaborative approach to tackling large-scale development efforts. The rapid iteration on the automated Claude workflows shows a commitment to leveraging AI to improve the project's own development lifecycle. While individual contributors are not named, the breadth and volume of work suggest a highly engaged and coordinated team focused on both immediate stability and long-term architectural vision.

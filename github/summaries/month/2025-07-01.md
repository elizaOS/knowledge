# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of significant refinement and foundational enhancement for ElizaOS. A major push was made to overhaul the Web UI, bringing components like the chat interface, agent cards, and sidebars into alignment with new Figma designs for a more polished user experience. Concurrently, the CLI received substantial stability improvements, particularly for Windows users, and a more consistent user experience through the adoption of `@clack/prompts`. Architecturally, the introduction of action chaining and standardized service types has paved the way for more complex, modular agent behaviors. The month concluded with the planning and initiation of a major new feature: the Scenario Runner for agent evaluation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month focused on maturing the user interface, stabilizing the core developer experience, and introducing powerful new architectural patterns.

-   **UI/UX Overhaul & Figma Alignment:** A significant effort was dedicated to refining the client-side user experience. This included redesigning the Agent Card to a horizontal layout ([#5344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5344), [#5351](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5351)), refactoring the Chat component and bubbles ([#5349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5349)), and updating the Sidebar ([#5373](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5373]) and DM chat headers ([#5392](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5392]) to match design specifications. Smaller but impactful UX improvements were also made, such as adding an auto-resizing chat input ([#5546](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5546]) and standardizing confirmation dialogs ([#5444](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5444)).

-   **CLI Enhancements and Stabilization:** The command-line interface saw major improvements in usability and reliability. All CLI input methods were migrated to `@clack/prompts` for a consistent look and feel ([#5359](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5359]). The environment variable system was improved for better maintainability ([#5326](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/pull/5326)), and numerous bugs were fixed, including issues with the `create` command ([#5321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5321)), plugin loading on Windows ([#5416](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5416]), and SPA routing for globally installed instances ([#5479](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5479)). The developer workflow was also improved by ensuring `elizaos start` automatically builds the project ([#5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504]) and that the dev server shuts down gracefully ([#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562)).

-   **Core Framework and Agent Capabilities:** Foundational work was completed to enhance agent modularity and power. Action chaining was implemented, enabling sequential execution of actions with state management ([#5436](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5436)). A major architectural step was taken with the introduction of standardized service types and a `getServicesByType()` method, allowing for more abstract and extensible plugins ([#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565)). A new `generateImageAction` was also added to the agent pipeline ([#5446](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5446)).

-   **Developer Experience and Automation:** To streamline contributions, a new `plugin-quick-starter` template was created for backend-only plugins ([#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589]), and a shared `@elizaos/test-utils` package was introduced to standardize mocking ([#5507](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5507]). The Claude-powered code review and quality analysis workflows were significantly enhanced, granting them greater permissions and improving their reporting capabilities ([#5519](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5519], [#5570](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5570]). Documentation was also overhauled with a new two-track system for different user levels ([#5401](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5401]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The project saw a high volume of issue creation and resolution, reflecting a rapid development pace and a focus on stabilization.

-   **Closed Issues:** A large number of bugs were resolved, with a strong focus on improving the developer and user experience. Key resolutions include fixing numerous plugin loading failures on Windows ([#5407](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5407), [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5499]), ensuring consistent testing across all packages ([#5218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5218]), correcting REST API documentation ([#5370](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5370]), and resolving build process conflicts ([#5555](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5555)). The closure of the long-standing issue to implement service types ([#4914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914)) marks a significant architectural milestone.

-   **New & Active Issues:** The most significant new issues represent the kickoff of a major new feature, the **Scenario Runner**. A series of tickets ([#5573](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5573)-[#5579](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5579)) were created to track the implementation of this agent evaluation framework, from YAML parsing to sandboxed execution and reporting. Other new issues highlighted challenges with plugin schema migrations ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588)) and environment variable parsing ([#5590](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5590)). An older issue regarding "Failed to fetch Home timeline" ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/38)) remains active, with ongoing discussion around Twitter API rate limits.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
July's activity demonstrates a highly collaborative and fast-moving development environment. The concerted effort to align the UI with Figma designs and stabilize the CLI across platforms indicates strong coordination. The introduction and rapid iteration on automated code quality workflows powered by Claude ([#5532](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5532), [#5543](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5543)) show a commitment to improving internal processes for all contributors. The creation of shared packages like `@elizaos/test-utils` ([#5507](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5507]) and a unified configs package ([#5508](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5508]) further points to a focus on building a robust and consistent development ecosystem. The detailed planning for the new Scenario Runner feature suggests a well-organized approach to tackling large-scale future work.

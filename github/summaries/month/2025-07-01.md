# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights

July was a month of significant maturation for ElizaOS, marked by a major push to enhance the framework's core architecture, developer experience, and user interface. Development focused on improving modularity and extensibility with the introduction of standardized service types and action chaining. The team invested heavily in stability, squashing numerous bugs related to the CLI, cross-platform compatibility (especially on Windows), and plugin management. A comprehensive UI overhaul early in the month brought the application in line with new design specifications, while the introduction of automated code quality analysis and new testing utilities signals a strong commitment to long-term project health and maintainability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments

Work this month spanned foundational refactoring, feature development, and extensive polishing of the user and developer experience.

-   **UI/UX Overhaul:** A concerted effort at the beginning of the month focused on aligning the Web UI with new Figma designs. This included redesigns of the Agent Card ([#5344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5344), [#5351](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5351)), Chat component ([#5349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5349)), Sidebar ([#5373](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5373)), and Agent settings ([#5345](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5345)). User experience was further improved with an auto-resizing chat input ([#5546](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5546)) and more consistent modal confirmations ([#5444](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5444)).

-   **Core Framework Evolution:** The project's foundations were significantly strengthened.
    -   **Service Standardization:** A major architectural improvement introduced standardized service types and a `getServicesByType()` method, allowing for more modular and extensible plugins that can depend on abstract services ([#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565)).
    -   **Action Chaining:** A new action chaining capability was implemented, enabling the sequential execution of actions with managed state ([#5436](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5436)).
    -   **API Modernization:** The core codebase was migrated from Node.js's EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget API to improve performance and runtime compatibility ([#5609](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5609)).

-   **CLI Modernization and Stability:** The command-line interface received numerous upgrades for a better user experience and improved reliability.
    -   The CLI was migrated to use `@clack/prompts` for a more consistent and polished interactive experience ([#5359](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5359)).
    -   Numerous bugs in the `elizaos create` and `elizaos update` commands were fixed, addressing issues with project creation ([#5321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5321]), directory handling ([#5618](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5618]), and plugin installation ([#5335](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5335)).
    -   Significant effort was made to resolve Windows-specific issues, including plugin loading failures ([#5416](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5416], [#5437](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5437)).

-   **Developer Experience and Automation:** Tooling was a key focus to improve contributor productivity and code quality.
    -   A new `@elizaos/test-utils` package was introduced to provide a `MockRuntime` and other utilities for streamlined testing ([#5507](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5507)).
    -   An automated code quality analysis workflow using Claude was implemented to run daily, identifying dead code, security concerns, and missing test coverage ([#5532](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5532), [#5543](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5543)).
    -   A unified `@elizaos/config` package was created to centralize configurations for `eslint`, `tsconfig`, and `prettier` across all packages ([#5508](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5508)).

-   **New Features and Plugins:**
    -   An AI-powered migration tool was introduced to help users upgrade plugins from v0.x to v1.x ([#5311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5311]).
    -   A new `generateImageAction` was added to the agent pipeline ([#5446](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5446)).
    -   A new `forms` plugin was added to serve as a dependent service for building forms ([#5487](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5487)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

-   **Closed Issues:** A large number of issues were resolved, reflecting the month's development focus. Key resolutions include fixing numerous CLI bugs related to command consistency ([#5295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5295]) and the update process ([#5447](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5447]). Critical cross-platform bugs, such as plugin loading failures on Windows ([#5407](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5407), [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5499]), were addressed. The long-standing architectural issue to implement service types was finally closed ([#4914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914)), as was the task to create a v1 to v2 character migrator ([#5452](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5452)).

-   **New & Active Issues:** Several important new issues point to future work and ongoing challenges.
    -   **Scenario Runner:** A major new feature initiative was kicked off with a series of tickets to build a Scenario Runner for agent evaluation, including a new CLI command, YAML parsing, and an evaluation engine ([#5573](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5573)-[#5579](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5579)).
    -   **Plugin & Agent Challenges:** New issues highlight persistent difficulties with custom plugin schema migrations ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588]) and agent creation on Windows ([#5603](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5603]).
    -   **Inter-Agent Communication:** A detailed discussion and proposed solution emerged for enabling direct, synchronous communication between agents to eliminate polling ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584)).
    -   **Twitter Integration:** Long-standing issues related to Twitter API rate limits ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/38)) and database errors ([#39](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/39)) continue to be active, indicating an ongoing external dependency challenge.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration

The high volume and broad scope of contributions throughout July indicate a highly active and collaborative development team. While individual contributors are not named, the coordinated effort on the UI overhaul and the systematic tackling of CLI and Windows-related bugs suggest strong communication.

A noteworthy development is the integration of an AI collaborator, Claude, into the development workflow for automated code reviews and daily quality analysis ([#5519](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5519), [#5570](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5570]). This represents a novel approach to maintaining code health. Furthermore, the detailed technical discussions and solution proposals within issues like [#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues

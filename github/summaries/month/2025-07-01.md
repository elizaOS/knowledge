# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of significant refinement and foundational progress for ElizaOS. Development focused heavily on enhancing the user and developer experience, with a major push to align the Web UI with new Figma designs and dramatically improve the stability and consistency of the CLI across all platforms. Foundational work included a major migration from Node.js's EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget API for better performance, the implementation of a standardized service-typing system to improve modularity, and the introduction of action chaining for more complex agent behaviors. The month concluded with strategic planning for a new "Scenario Runner" feature, setting the stage for advanced agent evaluation capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month spanned the entire stack, from core architecture to the end-user interface.

*   **Comprehensive UI/UX Overhaul:** The beginning of the month saw a concerted effort to align the client with new Figma designs. This involved redesigning the Agent Card ([#5344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5344), [#5351](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5351)), refactoring the chat component ([#5349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5349)), and updating the sidebar, agent settings, and various other components for visual consistency and improved usability ([#5373](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5373), [#5345](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5345)). UX was further improved with features like an auto-resizing chat input ([#5546](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5546]) and more consistent modal confirmations ([#5444](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5444)).

*   **CLI Stability and Enhancements:** The command-line interface received substantial upgrades to improve reliability and user experience. The entire CLI was migrated to use `@clack/prompts` for a consistent and modern interface ([#5359](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5359]). Numerous bugs in the `create` and `update` commands were fixed, addressing issues with project directory handling ([#5321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5321), [#5618](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5618]), plugin installation ([#5335](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5335]), and SPA routing for globally installed instances ([#5479](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5479)). Significant effort was also dedicated to resolving Windows-specific plugin loading failures ([#5416](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5416), [#5437](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5437)).

*   **Core Framework Modernization:** Several key architectural improvements were made. A major refactor saw the migration from Node.js's `EventEmitter` to Bun's native `EventTarget` API, enhancing performance and modernizing the codebase ([#5609](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5609)). A new system for service types and standardized interfaces was introduced, allowing for better modularity and dependency management between plugins via `getServicesByType()` ([#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565]). Agent capabilities were extended with the implementation of action chaining ([#5436](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5436]) and a new `generateImageAction` ([#5446](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5446)).

*   **Plugin Ecosystem and Tooling:** The plugin ecosystem was bolstered with an AI-powered migration tool to help upgrade plugins from v0.x to v1.x ([#5311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5311]). A new `plugin-quick-starter` template was added to streamline backend-only plugin creation ([#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589]), and a new forms plugin was developed ([#5487](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5487)).

*   **Testing and Workflow Automation:** Testing infrastructure was improved with the introduction of a dedicated `@elizaos/test-utils` package containing a `MockRuntime` to simplify test creation ([#5507](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5507]). The Claude-powered code review and quality analysis workflows were enhanced with greater permissions and more robust error handling, automating the detection of dead code, security concerns, and missing test coverage ([#5570](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5570), [#5543](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5543)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
*   **Closed Issues:** A significant number of bugs were resolved, reflecting the month's focus on stability. Key fixes included resolving numerous CLI command failures ([#5336](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5336), [#5434](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5434)), addressing persistent plugin loading issues on Windows ([#5407](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5407), [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5499)), and correcting REST API documentation inaccuracies ([#5370](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5370)). The v1 to v2 character migrator was also completed and closed ([#5452](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5452)).

*   **New & Active Issues:** A major new initiative was outlined with a series of issues for a "Scenario Runner" ([#5573](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5573)-[#5579](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5579)), which will provide a framework for sandboxed agent evaluation. Important new technical challenges emerged, including a detailed analysis of custom plugin schema migration problems ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588]) and a proposal for direct agent-to-agent communication to eliminate polling ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584)). Persistent issues with the Twitter plugin's database and API limits continue to be a pain point for users ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/31), [#38](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/38), [#39](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/39)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The month was characterized by intense, focused development and deep technical collaboration. The large volume of interconnected pull requests, particularly around the UI overhaul and CLI stabilization, points to a well-coordinated effort. The detailed technical discussions within new issues, such as the analysis of plugin schema migrations ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588]) and the design of agent-to-agent communication ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584]), highlight a collaborative approach to solving complex architectural problems. Furthermore, the implementation and refinement of the automated Claude code quality workflow ([#5532](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5532), [#5570](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5570)) represents a novel form of human-AI collaboration, systematically improving codebase health by automatically identifying and creating issues for the team to address.

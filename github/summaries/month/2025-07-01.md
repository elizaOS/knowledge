# elizaos/eliza Monthly Report (July 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
July was a month of significant refinement and foundational enhancement for ElizaOS. A major push was made to overhaul the Web UI, bringing components like the chat interface, agent cards, and sidebars into alignment with new Figma designs for a more polished user experience. The Command Line Interface (CLI) saw extensive stabilization, with a focus on cross-platform consistency, particularly on Windows, and a standardized user interaction model using `@clack/prompts`. Architecturally, the introduction of action chaining and standardized service types has paved the way for more complex, modular agent behaviors. Finally, the team kicked off a major new initiative: the Scenario Runner, a framework for evaluating agent performance in sandboxed environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this month spanned the entire stack, from core architecture and developer tooling to end-user interfaces.

#### **UI/UX Overhaul and Modernization**
A concerted effort was made to align the client application with official Figma designs, resulting in a more professional and cohesive user experience.
- **Component Redesigns:** Key components were refactored to match design specifications, including the Agent Card ([#5344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5344), [#5351](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5351)), Chat component ([#5349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5349)), Sidebar ([#5373](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5373)), and DM chat headers ([#5392](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5392)).
- **UX Improvements:** Functionality was enhanced with an auto-resizing chat input ([#5546](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5546]), a unified confirmation modal hook to replace native browser dialogs ([#5444](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5444]), and improved navigation logic for creating new chats ([#5398](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5398)).
- **Performance & Stability:** The default avatar was optimized for faster loading ([#5350](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5350]), and numerous UI glitches, hydration errors, and styling inconsistencies were resolved ([#5379](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5379), [#5475](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5475)).

#### **CLI Enhancements and Stabilization**
The CLI received significant attention to improve usability, reliability, and consistency across platforms.
- **Standardized Prompts:** The CLI was migrated to use `@clack/prompts` for a consistent and modern user interaction experience ([#5359](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5359)).
- **Command Reliability:** The `create` and `update` commands were made more robust, fixing issues with directory handling, type display, and preventing file creation outside project directories ([#5321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5321), [#5427](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5427)).
- **Cross-Platform Fixes:** Numerous bugs affecting Windows users were addressed, including plugin loading failures ([#5416](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5416), [#5437](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5437]) and test failures ([#5405](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5405)).
- **SPA Routing:** Issues with SPA routing for globally installed CLI instances were resolved, ensuring that refreshing on non-home routes works correctly ([#5479](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5479)).

#### **Core Framework and Agent Capabilities**
Foundational work was completed to expand the core capabilities of the agent framework.
- **Action Chaining:** A major new feature was implemented to allow sequential execution of agent actions with state management, enabling more complex, multi-step tasks ([#5436](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5436)).
- **Service Architecture:** The runtime was enhanced with standardized service types and a `getServicesByType()` method, providing a more modular way to build and retrieve agent capabilities ([#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565)).
- **New Features:** A `generateImageAction` was added to the agent pipeline ([#5446](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5446]), and a new `forms` plugin was introduced to serve as a dependency for building forms ([#5487](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5487)).

#### **Developer Experience and Tooling**
Several initiatives were completed to streamline the development and testing workflow for contributors.
- **Automated Workflows:** The Claude-powered code review workflow was enhanced with more permissions and security checks ([#5519](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5519), [#5570](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5570]), and a new automated daily code quality analysis workflow was implemented ([#5532](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5532]).
- **Improved Tooling:** A new `@elizaos/test-utils` package was created to provide a `MockRuntime` for easier testing ([#5507](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5507]). A unified `configs` package was added for shared linting and TypeScript configurations ([#5508](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5508]).
- **Plugin Development:** An AI-powered migration tool was introduced to help upgrade v0.x plugins ([#5311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5311]), and a new `plugin-quick-starter` template was added for backend-only plugins ([#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589)).
- **Dev Server:** The development server was improved to auto-build on `elizaos start` ([#5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504]) and to shut down gracefully on `Cmd+C` ([#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
- **Closed Issues:** A significant number of issues were resolved, reflecting the month's focus on stabilization and refinement. Key resolutions include numerous fixes for plugin loading and CLI command failures on Windows ([#5407](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5407), [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5499]), correction of REST API documentation inaccuracies ([#5370](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5370]), and the resolution of inconsistent testing behavior across the monorepo ([#5218](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5218]). The closure of the long-standing issue to implement service types ([#4914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914)) marked a major architectural milestone.

- **New & Active Issues:** The most notable new work is the comprehensive plan for the **Scenario Runner**, broken down into a series of well-defined issues ([#5573](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5573) - [#5579](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5579]). This represents the next major feature for the project. The new automated code quality workflow began to proactively file issues related to dead code and potential security concerns ([#5542](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5542), [#5545](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5545)), streamlining maintenance.

# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Aug 17 - 23, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week marked a major milestone with the completion and closure of the entire Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System epic. This powerful new CLI tool enables comprehensive, automated testing of agent behaviors across various configurations and generates detailed performance reports in both HTML and PDF formats. Alongside this significant feature delivery, the team focused on enhancing core framework stability through critical bug fixes, improving CLI reliability, and initiating development on key new features, including a Sessions API and asynchronous embedding generation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments

### New Feature: Scenario Matrix Runner & Reporting System
A massive effort culminated in the delivery of a robust system for agent evaluation. This work, tracked under the now-closed epic [#5781](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5781), provides a comprehensive suite of tools for testing and reporting:
- **Matrix Execution:** A new `elizaos scenario matrix` command was implemented to run scenarios with parameter overrides, supported by a new configuration schema ([#5778](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5778), [#5779](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5779), [#5780](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5780)).
- **Run Orchestration & Isolation:** A robust system for managing test runs was completed, ensuring each run is isolated in its own environment with detailed progress tracking and error handling ([#5782](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5782)).
- **Advanced Data Collection:** The framework now supports structured JSON output from evaluators, agent trajectory logging, and centralized serialization of run data ([#5783](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5783), [#5784](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5784), [#5785](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5785), [#5786](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5786)).
- **Dynamic Reporting:** A new `elizaos report generate` command uses a dynamic HTML template and Puppeteer integration to create detailed reports, which can also be exported as PDFs ([#5787](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5787), [#5788](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5788), [#5789](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5789), [#5790](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5790)).

### CLI Enhancements & Fixes
Several improvements were made to the command-line interface to increase reliability and functionality:
- **Publisher Module:** Fixed a bug related to comma placement in `index.json` and improved TypeScript safety for more reliable publishing ([#5796](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5796)).
- **TEE Integration:** Resolved argument handling issues in the Phala CLI wrapper and fixed the `tee` starter Docker build, restoring functionality to the `tee` command ([#5773](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5773)).
- **Test Reliability:** Work has begun to resolve Windows command quoting issues in CLI tests to improve cross-platform compatibility ([#5798](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5798)).

### Core Framework & Stability Improvements
The core framework saw important updates focused on stability and versatility:
- **Critical Bug Fixes:** Resolved a critical database error during entity creation ([#5791](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5791]) and fixed multiple GitHub Actions test failures, enhancing CI reliability ([#5792](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5792)).
- **Cross-Environment Logger:** The logger module was refactored to function seamlessly across both browser and Node.js environments ([#5797](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5797)).
- **Runtime Enhancements:** A `getServiceLoadPromise` interface was added to the runtime, and component queries in `plugin-sql` were made more flexible ([#5801](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5801)).

### New Feature Development
Work has commenced on several new features:
- **Sessions API:** A new PR introduces a Sessions API with timeout management and auto-renewal capabilities to improve control over user sessions ([#5799](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5799)).
- **Asynchronous Embeddings:** A feature to generate embeddings asynchronously via a queue service was proposed to improve performance in the bootstrap plugin ([#5793](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5793)).
- **Benchmarking:** A PR was opened to add a local bench plugin ([#5800](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5800)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
- **Closed Issues:** The week was dominated by the closure of a large, interconnected set of issues related to the **Scenario Matrix Runner and Reporting System** epic ([#5781](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5781]). This includes all foundational work for the matrix runner ([#5778](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5778)-[#5780](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5780]), run orchestration ([#5782](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5782]), advanced data collection ([#5783](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5783)-[#5786](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5786]), and the reporting dashboard with PDF export ([#5787](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5787)-[#5790](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5790)).
- **New & Active Issues:** No new issues were opened this week, reflecting a strong focus on completing the in-progress epic. There are no major active issues with significant ongoing discussion, indicating that the team has successfully cleared a major work package.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week's activity demonstrates a highly coordinated and focused development effort. The simultaneous closure of over a dozen related issues to complete the Scenario Matrix Runner epic points to excellent planning and execution. While the reports do not highlight broad community discussion, the focused push to deliver a major feature set suggests a "heads-down" period of intense, collaborative work among the core development team.

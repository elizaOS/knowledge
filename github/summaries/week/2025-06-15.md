# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a dual focus on expanding AI capabilities and hardening the core framework. We significantly broadened our AI provider support by integrating both Ollama and Google Generative AI (Gemini), and released a dedicated plugin for AWS Bedrock. Concurrently, a major push was made to improve stability and developer experience through extensive bug fixes, a comprehensive testing overhaul including a migration to `bun:test`, and critical architectural refinements like the separation of the server into its own package. While this progress enhances the platform's modularity and power, recurring CI instability and Windows compatibility issues have emerged as key challenges to address.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week spanned architectural changes, new features, and a significant number of stability improvements.

*   **AI Provider Expansion:** The framework's versatility was enhanced by adding support for new AI providers.
    *   **Ollama & Google Gemini:** The `create` command was updated to include Ollama ([#5160]) and Google Generative AI (Gemini) ([#5217]) as provider options, giving users more flexibility in their setups.
    *   **AWS Bedrock:** The active discussion around Bedrock integration concluded with the release of a dedicated plugin, closing issue [#5117].

*   **Architectural & Core System Refinements:** Foundational improvements were made to increase modularity and robustness.
    *   **Server Package Separation:** The server functionality was extracted into a new, independent `@elizaos/server` package to enable standalone use and streamline development ([#5122]).
    *   **Data Integrity & Management:** Zod-based validation and safe JSON parsing were implemented for character files to improve data integrity ([#5167]). Cascade delete functionality was added for agents to ensure proper database cleanup ([#5171]).
    *   **Agent Memory Control:** A new feature allows for clearing agent memories, providing developers with better control over agent state during testing and operation ([#5187]).

*   **Testing Infrastructure Overhaul:** A major effort was undertaken to improve the reliability and consistency of our testing suite.
    *   **Migration to `bun:test`:** A strategic migration from `vitest` to `bun:test` is underway to standardize and speed up testing, with CLI tests already moved over ([#5199], [#5185]).
    *   **Increased Coverage:** Test coverage was significantly expanded across core, server, CLI, and plugin packages ([#5125], [#5136], [#5188]).
    *   **CI Stability:** Numerous fixes were applied to the CI/autodoc workflows to resolve dependency, authentication, and caching issues ([#5143]- [#5147], [#5225]).

*   **CLI & Developer Experience:** The command-line interface and overall developer workflow received several quality-of-life updates.
    *   **Performance:** Starter templates now lazy load test dependencies, significantly speeding up the `elizaos create` command ([#5214]).
    *   **Command Consolidation:** The `stop` command was merged into `agent stop --all` for a more consistent command structure ([#5175]).
    *   **Windows Compatibility:** Critical bugs preventing project loading ([#5156]) and affecting plugin imports on Windows were addressed ([#5163]).

*   **Bug Fixes & UI Enhancements:**
    *   A critical bug causing infinite recursion in the JSON sanitizer was fixed by adding circular reference detection ([#5152]).
    *   Message filtering was corrected to prevent messages from appearing in the wrong chat channels ([#5149]).
    *   The client UI was improved with new agent settings panels ([#5202]), fixes for scroll behavior ([#5193]), and the ability to edit secrets ([#5210]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
This week saw the resolution of several long-standing bugs and the emergence of new infrastructure-level challenges.

*   **Closed Issues:**
    *   A significant bug where callbacks from plugin actions failed to reach the end-user in chat was resolved, improving the reliability of plugins like `plugin-evm` ([#5017]).
    *   The `elizaos update` command malfunction was addressed with clearer instructions for global package updates ([#5198]).
    *   Issues with Knowledge Management (RAG) in older versions were confirmed fixed ([#5004]).
    *   An issue preventing character file imports due to format changes was identified and resolved ([#5228]).

*   **New & Active Issues:**
    *   **Potential Blockers:** CI instability remains a major hurdle, blocking the full migration to `bun:test` ([#5197]). A newly reported issue where most server API endpoints return "not found" errors could indicate a critical configuration problem ([#5230]).
    *   **Future Work:** A proposal was made to overhaul the documentation with separate tracks for users and developers ([#5234]). The need for a customizable root logger for downstream projects is being actively worked on ([#5183]).
    *   **Persistent Problems:** The web client continues to display an incorrect version number, causing confusion ([#4924]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The development pace was high this week, with strong evidence of both internal and community collaboration. The resolution of the plugin callback issue ([#5017]) was a great example of community-driven debugging, with multiple users providing feedback and testing fixes. The introduction of a `CLAUDE.md` guide ([#5158]) and Claude-generated PRs (e.g., for issue [#5183]) highlights the project's innovative use of AI assistants in its own development workflow, embodying the "dogfooding" principle. The active discussions around new features like Bedrock support and persistent bugs demonstrate a healthy and engaged user base.

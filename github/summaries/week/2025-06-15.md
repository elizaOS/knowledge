# ElizaOS Weekly Update (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
This week saw significant architectural improvements with the server functionality being split into a separate `@elizaos/server` package, enhancing modularity and reusability. Extensive test coverage was added across multiple packages including core, server, CLI, and plugins. The team also addressed numerous UI/UX issues in the chat interface and fixed critical CI/CD pipeline failures that were blocking development workflows.

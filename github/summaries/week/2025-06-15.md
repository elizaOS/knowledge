# ElizaOS Weekly Update (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
This week saw significant architectural improvements with the separation of server functionality into a dedicated package, enhancing modularity and enabling independent usage of server components. The team also focused on resolving critical test failures in the CI/CD pipeline and fixing various bugs across the codebase. Comprehensive testing was added to core components, server, and starter projects, including new frontend testing capabilities.

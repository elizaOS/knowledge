# ElizaOS Weekly Update (Jun 15 - 21, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
This week saw significant architectural improvements with the separation of server functionality into a dedicated package, enhancing modularity and reusability.

Several critical bug fixes addressed CI/CD pipeline issues, documentation accuracy, and user experience improvements in the chat interface.

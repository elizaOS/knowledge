# ElizaOS Weekly Update (May 25 - 31, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
This week saw significant advancements in ElizaOS's framework capabilities with major improvements to the CLI publishing workflow, enhanced plugin architecture, and new integrations. The team added TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) support, implemented Polygon zkEVM plugin, improved knowledge management with graph visualization, and enhanced the user experience with animated "thinking" indicators. Infrastructure improvements focused on environment variable handling and logging systems.

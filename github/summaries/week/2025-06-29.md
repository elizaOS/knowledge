# ElizaOS Weekly Update (Jun 29 - 5, 2025)

## OVERVIEW

This week saw a major push to enhance the developer experience, with significant refactoring and new features for the CLI to improve usability and project setup. The team also focused on UI/UX refinements, including layout improvements and bug fixes, alongside introducing an AI-powered tool for upgrading plugins.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### Command-Line Interface (CLI) Overhaul

The CLI received substantial upgrades to improve user-friendliness and functionality. This includes a major refactor of the environment variable system, prompts for easier configuration, and smarter project creation that now auto-installs required AI model plugins ([#5326](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5326), [#5335](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5335)). The CLI now also displays more accurate version information and provides clearer messaging during project setup ([#5322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5322), [#5337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5337)).

### UI/UX and Character Management Refinements

Several updates were made to improve the web interface and character handling. The character form buttons were redesigned for a better layout, and a default avatar was set for Eliza ([#5342](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5342), [#5324](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5324)). Key bug fixes addressed the character file size limit, increasing it to 2MB, and removed misleading UI text to clarify the save process ([#5308](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5308), [#5314](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5314)).

### Plugin System Enhancements

The plugin ecosystem was improved with the introduction of an AI-powered migration tool to help developers upgrade plugins from v0.x to v1.x ([#5311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5311)). The essential `plugin-bootstrap` is now clearly marked in the UI, and its documentation was enhanced to clarify its importance for agent functionality ([#5313](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5313), [#5309](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5309)). Additionally, a critical bug causing infinite loops in `plugin-sql` integration tests was resolved ([#5327](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5327)).

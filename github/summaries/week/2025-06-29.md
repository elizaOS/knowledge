# ElizaOS Weekly Update (Jun 29 - 5, 2025)

## OVERVIEW

This week's development focused on improving system stability and user guidance. Key efforts included fixing a critical bug that prevented saving large character files and enhancing our documentation to clarify essential plugin requirements for new developers.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

**Enhanced Character File Support**

*   Addressed a "request entity too large" error by increasing the server's JSON payload limit from 100KB to 2MB, allowing for more complex character files ([#5308](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5308)).
*   A comprehensive regression test was added to prevent this issue from recurring ([#5308](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5308)).

**Improved Onboarding Documentation**

*   Updated the documentation to explicitly state that the `plugin-bootstrap` module is mandatory for core agent communication and functionality, helping guide users doing custom setups ([#5309](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5309)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

**Resolved Character Save Failures**

*   Resolved an issue where users could not save character files larger than 100KB due to server limitations. This fix enables the use of more detailed character definitions ([#5268](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5268)).

## NEW ISSUES

No new issues were opened this week.

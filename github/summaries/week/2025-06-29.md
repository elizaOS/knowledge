# ElizaOS Weekly Update (Jun 29 - 5, 2025)
## OVERVIEW 
This week saw a massive UI overhaul to align the client with new Figma designs, enhancing user experience across the application. The Command Line Interface (CLI) also received significant upgrades for improved usability and consistency. Development was further supported by numerous bug fixes, stability improvements, and two new version releases (v1.0.16 and v1.0.17).

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

**Extensive UI/UX Overhaul**
A major effort was dedicated to redesigning the client application to match new Figma specifications, resulting in a more modern and intuitive user interface.
*   The main sidebar, agent/group cards, and homepage layout were completely redesigned ([#5373](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5373), [#5344](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5344), [#5361](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5361)).
*   The chat interface, including chat bubbles and the DM header, was refactored for a cleaner look ([#5349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5349), [#5392](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5392)).
*   Agent settings, forms, and action buttons were updated for better consistency and layout ([#5345](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5345), [#5342](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5342)).
*   UI interactions were improved with better cursor pointers and consistent avatar handling ([#5397](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5397), [#5390](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5390)).

**CLI Enhancements and Refactoring**
The command-line interface was significantly improved to provide a more consistent and user-friendly experience for developers.
*   The CLI was migrated to use `@clack/prompts` for all user inputs, standardizing the UX ([#5359](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5359)).
*   A major refactor of the environment variable system makes it more maintainable and feature-rich ([#5326](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5326)).
*   The CLI now displays 'monorepo' as the version when run locally, avoiding confusion with installed package versions ([#5322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5322), [#5320](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5320)).
*   The `elizaos create` command now correctly displays the project type and cleans up directories on interruption ([#5337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5337), [#5321](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5321)).

**New Features and Core Improvements**

*   An AI-powered migration tool was introduced to help upgrade ElizaOS plugins from v0.x to v1.x ([#5311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5311)).

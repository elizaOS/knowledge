# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Oct 5 - 11, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by a significant push to finalize a major core architecture refactor, resulting in the closure of numerous long-standing issues related to the message bus, API lifecycle, and browser support. Key new features were introduced to enhance agent intelligence, including improved mention detection and paginated memory retrieval. Concurrently, the team engaged in a deep, collaborative investigation into a critical CLI bug, successfully identifying the root cause with the help of detailed user feedback and AI-assisted diagnostics. The overall theme was one of foundational stabilization and refinement, clearing technical debt while continuing to build more capable agent systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on solidifying the core framework, enhancing agent capabilities, and improving overall system stability.

-   **Core Architecture & Modularity:**
    A multi-phase effort to refactor the core architecture saw significant progress. The ElizaOS/Server was updated to incorporate new config and plugin modules ([#6037](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6037)), and agent identification was standardized to use UUIDs only, simplifying management ([#6036](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6036)). A new `MessageService` interface was also introduced to enhance inter-agent communication ([#6048](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6048)).

-   **Agent Capabilities & Intelligence:**
    Agent responsiveness was improved with a new `mentionContext` interface and refined `shouldRespond` logic, making mention detection more platform-agnostic ([#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030)). For long-term memory, the `getMemories` function now supports pagination via an `offset` parameter, allowing for more efficient data retrieval ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032)). Additionally, character schema validation was made more robust with comprehensive Zod schema definitions and detailed descriptions ([#6044](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6044), [#6043](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6043)).

-   **Runtime Stability & Bug Fixes:**
    Several critical bugs were addressed to improve stability. A fix was implemented to ensure the runtime database is initialized before tasks attempt to access it, preventing a race condition ([#6039](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6039)). Another fix corrected an issue preventing agent plugins from reloading properly after updates ([#6040](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6040)). The system now also performs robust validation of server port configurations ([#6046](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6046), [#6038](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6038)) and uses the correct ZodError API for issue handling in plugins ([#6035](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6035)).

-   **Infrastructure & Developer Experience:**
    The project's dependency management was streamlined by modernizing the Renovate configuration and adding a preset for plugins ([#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033)). The build process was optimized by skipping test execution for types-only packages like `@elizaos/service-interfaces` ([#6034](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6034)). Documentation was also improved by fixing broken links ([#6047](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6047), [#6050](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6050)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

-   **Closed Issues:**
    A massive number of foundational issues were closed this week, signaling the completion of a major architectural overhaul. Key themes among the closed issues include:
    -   **Core API & Message Bus Modernization:** A complete refactor of the message bus to a class-based API and the finalization of the `ElizaOS` programmatic entry point and lifecycle methods ([#5905](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5905), [#5916](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5916)-[#5921](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5921)).
    -   **Browser Support:** The implementation of a browser database adapter using WASM PGLite and the wrap-up of full browser support was completed ([#5958](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5958), [#5964](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5964)).
    -   **Core Cleanup & State Management:** A comprehensive core cleanup initiative was finished, along with work on state persistence, safe start mechanisms, and project serialization ([#5911](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5911), [#5908](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5908)).
    -   **MCP Gateway & Partner Integration:** Work related to the MCP Gateway and partner plugin integration was finalized ([#5814](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5814), [#5969](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5969)).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   The most significant active issue was **[#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031) (Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.6.1)**. A detailed investigation, driven by user `matteo-brandolino` and analyzed by the AI assistant `claude`, concluded that `@elizaos/core@1.6.1` was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files. The team has acknowledged the diagnosis, and the recommended user action is to upgrade to a newer version of the CLI.
    -   Two notable new issues were opened proposing future work: **[#6049](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6049)** suggests creating a unified Cloud API plugin to centralize API key management, and **[#6051](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6051)** requests changing the default server port from 3000 to avoid common conflicts.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week highlighted strong collaboration between the community and the development team. The discussion around issue [#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031) was a prime example, with user `matteo-brandolino` providing excellent, detailed bug reports and diagnostic output. Team members `0xbbjoker` and `wtfsayo` engaged directly to troubleshoot. A unique aspect of the project's workflow was demonstrated by the use of an AI assistant, `claude`, to perform a root cause analysis, which successfully pinpointed the version-specific build issue. This collaborative and tool-assisted approach led to a swift and precise diagnosis of a critical problem.

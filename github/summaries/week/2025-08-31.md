# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Aug 31 - 6, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a major push to enhance developer experience and stabilize the framework's core tooling. A significant architectural discussion began around a comprehensive refactor of the Eliza CLI ([#5860](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5860)), proposing to centralize business logic into a new `@eliza/server` package. This strategic effort was complemented by immediate, tangible improvements to infrastructure, including unified NPM release workflows, enhanced alpha testing for the CLI, and a monorepo-wide update to Bun. On the user-facing side, the chat UI received a significant upgrade to display real-time action calls ([#5865](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5865)), and numerous critical bug fixes were merged, resolving issues with CLI deployment, port conflicts, and dependency management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused heavily on improving the reliability and usability of the CLI, streamlining release processes, and fixing critical bugs.

-   **CLI & Release Infrastructure Overhaul:** A concerted effort was made to mature the CLI and its deployment pipeline.
    -   Release workflows were unified and improved with a new alpha NPM release pattern ([#5877](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5877), [#5863](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5863)).
    -   A new workflow was added to automatically test published alpha versions of the CLI, increasing confidence in new releases ([#5873](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5873)).
    -   The CLI now embeds its version into the build output for easier debugging ([#5869](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5869)).
    -   Critical fixes were merged for a CLI NPM deployment path resolution bug ([#5852](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5852)) and to ensure the CLI automatically finds a new port if the default is occupied ([#5876](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5876)).

-   **Core Stability and Bug Fixes:** Several important fixes were implemented to enhance the framework's stability.
    -   TypeScript declarations were optimized in the core package to improve build efficiency ([#5848](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5848)).
    -   The logger's debug level and styling were corrected for better readability ([#5849](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5849

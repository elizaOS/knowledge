# ElizaOS Weekly Update (May 4 - 10, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
This week saw significant improvements to the ElizaOS framework with a focus on CLI enhancements, plugin system refinements, and documentation expansion. The team addressed numerous bugs affecting agent functionality, improved type declarations, and streamlined the monorepo structure by removing several plugins that are now maintained externally. Notable progress was made in enhancing the developer experience through better error handling and comprehensive docstrings.

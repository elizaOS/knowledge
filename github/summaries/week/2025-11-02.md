# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Nov 2 - 8, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, ElizaOS focused on expanding the capabilities of our AI agents and laying the groundwork for future growth. We introduced significant new functionality for semantic understanding through text embeddings and began expanding our plugin ecosystem, while also initiating key projects in core security, performance, and infrastructure to support our scaling project.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Expanding the Capabilities of AI Agents**
This initiative focuses on giving agents new tools and abilities, allowing them to perform a wider and more complex range of tasks, which is central to our mission of creating adaptable, modular AI.
-   Support for text embedding models was added to the **[elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter)**, enabling agents to perform tasks that require semantic understanding of text.
-   The plugin ecosystem is growing, with proposals to add two new plugins to the **[elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry)**, including a community-submitted tool for AI-driven trading insights.
-   Work was proposed in **[elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord)** to create a unified messaging API, a step toward more versatile and standardized communication functions.

**Strengthening the Core Platform and Ecosystem**
This work is crucial for ensuring the long-term security, performance, and scalability of the ElizaOS framework as our community and codebase grow.
-   Foundational work began in the **[elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)** core to implement a more robust security model and enhance the agent runtime environment.
-   Strategic planning for future performance improvements was initiated in **[elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)**, with new proposals for enabling parallel actions and background tasks.
-   Our project infrastructure was updated in **[elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)** to monitor and integrate 12 new repositories, ensuring our development pipeline can manage our expanding ecosystem.

### Cross-Repository Coordination
-   **Ecosystem Integration**: To better manage the project's modular growth, the development pipeline in **[elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io)** was updated to track 12 new core and plugin repositories. This ensures that as new components are developed across the ecosystem, they are properly integrated and monitored within our central processes.

## Repository Spotlights

### elizaos/eliza
The core repository focused on initiating foundational work for security and performance, and planning for future features.
-   Work began on implementing entity-level row-level security (RLS) to enhance data protection ([#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107)), with a corresponding issue opened for discussion ([#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112)).
-   A foundational change was proposed to add an ElizaOS reference to the runtime ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).
-   Future development was outlined through new issues proposing parallel actions ([#6108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6108)), background tasks ([#6109](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6109)), and a user engagement system with points and a leaderboard ([#6110](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6110)).

### elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter
This plugin saw a significant functional expansion, broadening the types of AI models agents can use.
-   A major feature was merged to add support for text embedding models ([#17](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openrouter/pull/17)), enabling agents to perform tasks requiring semantic understanding and vector-based operations.

### elizaos-plugins/registry
The plugin registry grew with proposals for new tools, including a contribution from the community.
-   Work was initiated to add two new plugins: `plugin-ai16x402` ([#239](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/239)) and the `AI16z Trading Insights` plugin ([#238](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/238)), submitted by community member `@laurabee19802025`.

### elizaos/elizaos.github.io
The project's documentation and infrastructure repository was updated to reflect the growth of the ecosystem.
-   The development pipeline was updated to track 12 new active repositories ([#169](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/169)), ensuring new components are included in project-wide monitoring and integration.

### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord
Development began on a proposal to improve the plugin's messaging architecture.
-   A pull request was opened to begin integrating a unified messaging API ([#24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/24)), aiming to standardize how the plugin handles communication.

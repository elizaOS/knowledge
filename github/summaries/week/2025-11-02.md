# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Nov 2 - 8, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week's activity focused on initiating new features and planning for future enhancements. Development began on core security and runtime improvements, with new pull requests opened to implement entity-level row-level security and to add an ElizaOS reference to the runtime. Concurrently, several new issues were created to guide future work, focusing on core performance through parallel actions and background tasks, as well as user engagement with a points and leaderboard system. The period was characterized by laying the groundwork for upcoming features rather than completing existing ones.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
While no major features were completed this period, work was initiated on two key fronts through new pull requests:

-   **Security Framework:** A new pull request, [#6107](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6107), was opened to begin the implementation of entity-level row-level security (RLS). This work is complemented by a new issue, [#6112](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6112), opened for discussion on the same topic.
-   **Runtime Enhancements:** To improve the runtime environment, work was started in [#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111) to add an ElizaOS reference, a foundational step for future runtime capabilities.

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
No issues were closed this week. The focus was on opening new discussions to shape the project's direction.

-   **New & Active Issues:** Four significant new issues were opened, outlining key areas for future development:

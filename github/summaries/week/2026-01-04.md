# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Jan 4 - 10, 2026)

## Executive Summary
This week was focused on strengthening the foundations of the ElizaOS platform by improving stability, developer experience, and long-term project health. We made significant strides in resolving critical bugs in core services and plugins while simultaneously executing a massive documentation overhaul and UI cleanup. This work clears the path for a new phase of development focused on deeper performance and concurrency optimizations.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Improving the Developer and User Experience**
This initiative focuses on making the platform easier to learn, use, and build upon for our entire community.
-   The project's documentation was dramatically expanded in [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs), increasing content coverage from 60% to nearly 95% and adding crucial guides for streaming, the REST API, and the CLI.
-   A major cleanup in the core [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) repository resolved a large backlog of user interface and agent management issues, resulting in a more intuitive and polished user experience.
-   A new unified `useElizaChat` hook was introduced in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), simplifying how developers build client applications by providing a single, consistent interface for all communication protocols.
-   A community discussion on Discord directly led to a new documentation task in [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs) to improve guides for agent memory, demonstrating a healthy and responsive feedback loop.

**Enhancing Platform Stability and Reliability**
This work is essential for ensuring our platform is robust, dependable, and ready for production use.
-   Critical stability issues in the SQL plugin were resolved in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), fixing runtime crashes and connection problems that affected backend reliability.
-   A high-priority investigation was launched in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord) to diagnose a critical failure in the package publishing pipeline that is preventing new releases.
-   A significant new bug causing the Telegram plugin to crash when processing certain images was identified in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram), allowing the team to prioritize a fix.

**Automating for Long-Term Health and Security**
This initiative focuses on implementing automated systems to reduce manual effort and proactively maintain the project's quality and security.
-   Automated dependency management was configured for the project website in [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io), ensuring our tools and libraries stay up-to-date automatically.
-   The core CI/CD pipelines in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) were upgraded to use more powerful models and new automated workflows for security and maintenance.

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Driving Toward a Unified API**
A coordinated effort is underway to create a consistent API across the entire ElizaOS ecosystem, making it easier for developers to create and integrate components. This week, the core [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) repository introduced the `useElizaChat` hook to unify client-side development. In parallel, the [elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord) began work to adopt the standardized `handleMessage` function, aligning the plugin with this broader architectural vision.

## Repository Spotlights

### elizaos/eliza
The core repository saw major advancements in client architecture, backend stability, and user experience.
-   Introduced the unified `useElizaChat` hook to provide a consistent interface for client interactions across HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket transports ([#6300](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6300)).
-   Shipped a series of critical fixes to the SQL plugin, resolving runtime crashes, connection pool issues, and other bugs to improve backend stability ([#6323](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6323), [#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316), [#6333](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6333)]).
-   Completed a massive cleanup of user-facing issues, improving agent creation ([#6306](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6306)), chat behavior ([#6308](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6308)), and conversation management ([#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311)]).
-   Resolved foundational architectural issues related to the core SDK hooks and Messaging API ([#5928](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5928), [#6298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6298)]).
-   Identified a new wave of performance-related challenges, including memory consumption ([#6332](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6332)]) and opportunities for parallel processing ([#6334](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6334), [#6337](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6337)]).

### elizaos/docs
The documentation repository achieved a major milestone in content coverage, making the platform significantly more accessible to users and developers.
-   Merged a monumental documentation expansion that increased coverage to ~95%, adding new guides for streaming responses and greatly expanding the REST API and CLI references ([#81](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/81)).
-   Opened a new issue to create a guide for agent memory configuration, directly responding to user feedback from a community discussion on Discord ([#82](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/82)).

### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord
Work on the Discord plugin focused on maintenance, API alignment, and triaging a critical release blocker.
-   Resolved a long-standing issue by making the slash command system extensible, restoring `join` and `leave` command functionality ([#15](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/issues/15)).
-   Initiated work to transition from `sendMessage` to the standardized `handleMessage` function, aligning the plugin with the unified ElizaOS API ([#41](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/41)).

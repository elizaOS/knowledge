# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Oct 19 - 25, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by significant integration and refinement across the ElizaOS framework. The `develop` branch was merged into `main`, rolling out a new pluggable message service and a unified server configuration. Development focused on enhancing core agent capabilities, streamlining the CLI by removing Anthropic Claude dependencies, and modernizing the client with Streamdown for streaming AI responses. A major documentation overhaul was completed, addressing long-standing gaps. However, the dependency cleanup introduced a critical CLI installation bug, and important community feedback highlighted significant friction in the plugin developer experience, which is now under active review.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on maturing the core services, improving the developer experience, and enhancing client-side functionality.

-   **Core Framework & Agent Runtime:**
    -   Modularity was improved with the introduction of a new `MessageService` interface ([#6048]) and by making the embedding service optional to optimize resource usage ([#6075]).
    -   Agent intelligence was enhanced by allowing plugins to access action results ([#6081]) and by ensuring the agent's `thought` is consistently included in action completion events for better observability ([#6083], [#6084]).
    -   The `develop` branch merge ([#6078]) formally integrated these changes alongside a new `generateText` API and a unified server startup process.

-   **CLI and Developer Experience:**
    -   To simplify the toolchain, Anthropic Claude dependencies and related AI-powered code generation features were removed from the CLI ([#6087]).
    -   A key bug was fixed in the project scaffolding tool, which now correctly includes dotfiles like `.gitignore` in new projects ([#6080]).
    -   Server setup was made more flexible with the addition of port autodiscovery ([#6082]).

-   **Client-Side & API Enhancements:**
    -   A major feature was added with the integration of Streamdown, enabling modern, streaming AI response rendering on the client ([#6082]).
    -   A bug in the session API was fixed to correctly include the `channelId` in responses, ensuring reliable WebSocket connections ([#6079]).
    -   API types were refined for clarity, replacing `Agent.description` with `bio` ([#6085]).

-   **Code Quality & Maintenance:**
    -   A comprehensive code formatting pass using Prettier/ESLint was completed across the entire codebase to enforce style consistency and improve maintainability ([#6077]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   **Documentation Overhaul:** A significant effort to improve project documentation concluded, with the closure of numerous issues related to core docs expansion ([#5938]), developer guides ([#5939]), release processes ([#5936]), and learning aids ([#5940]).
    -   **Build & Scaffolding Fixes:** Several long-standing problems were resolved, including a critical build failure in `@elizaos/core` ([#5738]), a logger compatibility issue during builds ([#5673]), and the bug preventing dotfile creation in new projects ([#6074]).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Critical Bug:** The removal of Claude dependencies introduced a breaking change, causing CLI installation to fail with a `Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'` error ([#6088]). This is the highest priority issue to address.
    -   **Developer Experience Feedback:** A crucial discussion is ongoing in [#6070], where a user detailed significant frustration with the plugin documentation and scaffolding process. The feedback highlights "endless issues" and "bad documentation" as major barriers to entry, prompting direct engagement from the maintenance team to diagnose and fix the root causes.
    -   **Future Work:** New issues were opened to plan for a dedicated API/SDK documentation section ([#6090]), propose a new DevTools server ([#6092]), and address various UI/UX improvements ([#6086], [#6089]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The most significant community interaction this week occurred in issue [#6070], where user @ryanmstokes provided candid, critical feedback on the developer onboarding experience. The constructive response from maintainer @yungalgo, who requested specific details to help resolve the problems, exemplifies the project's commitment to addressing community pain points. The rapid reporting of the CLI installation bug ([#6088]) immediately following the dependency refactor ([#6087]) also demonstrates an engaged user base actively testing the latest changes.

# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Jan 18 - 24, 2026)

This week, ElizaOS made significant strides toward the next generation of our framework, Eliza V2.0.0, while simultaneously hardening our existing infrastructure. We focused on making our AI agents more visible to the world and ensuring our core systems are stable, secure, and ready for scale.

## Executive Summary
The project successfully kicked off the architectural foundation for Eliza V2.0.0 and launched new standards for how AI agents are discovered and shared publicly. By synchronizing updates across our plugin ecosystem and modernizing our web infrastructure, we have created a more reliable and professional environment for both developers and users.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Laying the Foundation for Eliza V2.0.0**
*Goal: We are evolving our core technology to be more flexible and support more programming languages.*
*   A new "dynamic execution engine" prototype was introduced in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), which will allow agents to handle complex tasks more effectively ([#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384)).
*   We began building a Python-based bridge in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza), expanding our framework's reach to the massive community of Python AI developers ([#6383](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6383)).

**Improving Agent Identity and Discovery**
*Goal: We want to make it easier for people to find, identify, and interact with AI agents.*
*   We established a new standard for public agent links (e.g., `elizacloud.ai/chat/username`) and integrated an agent discovery module into our main dashboard in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302), [#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304)).
*   The project website [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io) was upgraded to support rich text and formatting for agent profiles, moving away from plain text to a more expressive display ([#202](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/202)).

**Strengthening System Reliability and Security**
*Goal: We are proactively fixing bugs and updating our "under-the-hood" tools to prevent crashes and errors.*
*   A critical fix in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) resolved a "race condition" that could cause errors in how credits were deducted during high-traffic AI streaming ([#6338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6338)).
*   We performed a massive wave of security and performance updates to our web infrastructure in [elizaos/elizaos.github.io](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io), updating nearly a dozen core libraries to their latest versions.
*   The database system was corrected in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to ensure it works perfectly even when users choose not to use expensive third-party services ([#6380](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6380)).

### Cross-Repository Coordination
**Ecosystem-Wide Synchronization**
*Goal: To ensure that when the "brain" of ElizaOS improves, the "arms" (plugins like Discord and Telegram) continue to work perfectly.*
*   **Core Alignment**: Both the Discord and Telegram plugins were updated to match the latest version of the ElizaOS core framework. This ensures that improvements in the core system are immediately available to users on these social platforms ([plugin-discord #44](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/44), [plugin-telegram #24](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/24)).
*   **Standardized Quality**: We implemented new, shared logging and code-checking rules in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram) to match the high standards of the main project, making it easier for community members to contribute across different parts of the ecosystem ([#21](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/21)).

## Repository Spotlights

### elizaos/eliza
*   Introduced a prototype for a dynamic execution engine to power the upcoming V2.0.0 release ([#6384](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6384)).
*   Resolved a critical TOCTOU race condition in streaming endpoint credit management to ensure financial integrity ([#6338](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6338)).

*   Optimized build configurations in `turbo.json` to speed up development and testing for contributors ([#6349](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6349)).

### elizaos/elizaos.github.io
*   Upgraded the profile summary card to support Markdown, enabling rich text formatting for agent descriptions ([#202](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/202)).
*   Executed a comprehensive dependency overhaul, including major updates to `next` ([#223](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/223)), `tailwindcss` ([#216](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/216)), and `better-sqlite3` ([#222](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/222)).

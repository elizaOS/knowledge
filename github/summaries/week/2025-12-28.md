# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Dec 28 - 3, 2025)

This week, development focused on strengthening the core platform's stability and user experience, with critical fixes to data logging and the agent chat interface. Simultaneously, we laid the groundwork for future growth by initiating major security and performance upgrades for plugins and opening discussions on next-generation agent architecture, all while seeing strong community collaboration on key user issues.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Strengthening the Core Platform for Stability and Performance**
A reliable and modern platform is the foundation for all agent activity. This week, we made significant strides in improving the backend and developer toolchain.
-   Ensured all agent interactions with streaming language models are reliably logged to the database, improving our ability to monitor and debug agent behavior in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
-   Modernized the command-line tools by replacing older libraries with faster, native alternatives, improving performance and developer experience in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
-   Standardized internal server communication routes to improve system reliability and prevent errors in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).

**Improving the Agent Chat Experience**
A smooth and intuitive chat interface is crucial for effective human-agent interaction. We closed out several bugs to make the chat experience more reliable.
-   Resolved bugs that caused conversations to duplicate when switching between agents and ensured that clicking an agent always opens the most recent chat in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
-   Implemented the ability for users to rename their chat sessions, a key usability feature, in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).

**Enhancing Plugin Security and Capabilities**
Expanding what agents can do securely and efficiently is key to their utility. Work began on significant upgrades to our Twitter and OpenAI plugins.
-   Began implementing a more secure authentication method (OAuth2 PKCE) for the Twitter plugin, preparing for more robust and secure agent interactions in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter).
-   Started work to improve media processing in the OpenAI plugin with better image description handling and performance-boosting caching for audio and images in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-openai).

**Fostering Community Growth and Support**
Our ecosystem thrives on community contributions and collaboration. This week highlighted active engagement in both expanding the platform and supporting users.
-   A new community-developed plugin, `plugin-coinrailz`, was submitted to expand our ecosystem and is now under review in [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry).
-   Improved the developer onboarding experience with significant documentation updates, including new READMEs and clearer build instructions in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
-   Community members demonstrated strong peer-to-peer support by providing detailed workarounds for a complex user migration issue across [elizaos/docs](https://github.com/elizaos/docs) and [elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry).

**Planning for Next-Generation Agent Architecture**
We are actively designing the future of ElizaOS to support more advanced AI capabilities, opening several forward-looking discussions this week.
-   Opened discussions in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) to add core support for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, a technique that allows agents to perform more complex, multi-step tasks.
-   Proposed a major redesign of the internal messaging system to improve reliability and prevent errors like double-processing of messages in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Addressing User Migration Challenges**
A user reported difficulty migrating to ElizaOS due to an unsupported wallet. This issue ([#6211](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6211)) sparked discussion across the `docs`, `registry`, and `eliza` repositories, where community members collaborated to provide detailed troubleshooting steps and potential workarounds. This highlights our community's commitment to helping users navigate complex technical hurdles and the interconnected nature of our documentation, plugin ecosystem, and core platform.

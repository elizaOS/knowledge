# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Sep 28 - Oct 1, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a strong focus on enhancing the framework's stability, developer experience, and observability. Significant progress was made in improving agent run visualization with the introduction of a new interactive timeline component. The team also addressed critical technical debt by refactoring the core runtime and SQL plugin migrations, while simultaneously resolving key bugs in the CLI and plugin loading system. A comprehensive dependency update and repository-wide code formatting pass have modernized the codebase, ensuring a more stable and consistent development environment for future contributions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week balanced foundational improvements with user-facing features and critical bug fixes.

- **Enhanced Agent Run Visualization:** A major effort was dedicated to improving agent observability. A new interactive timeline component was introduced to provide detailed insights into agent execution flow ([#6016](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6016)). This was followed by further enhancements to the Agent Runs sidebar and Timeline UI, optimizing space and data extraction for a better user experience ([#6023](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6023)).

- **Core Refactoring and Stability:** The core framework received substantial refactoring to improve robustness. The agent runtime initialization was made idempotent, and service registration was streamlined ([#5998](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5998), [#6004](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6004)). In the SQL plugin, a significant refactoring of the dynamic migration system was completed to improve maintainability ([#5990](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5990)).

- **Critical Bug Fixes:** Several crucial bugs were resolved, restoring key functionality.
    - A fix was implemented for `elizaos start` and `elizaos dev` commands to ensure plugins are correctly detected and passed to the server, resolving a major development workflow issue ([#6021](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6021)).
    - The `shouldRespondProvider` registration was restored in the bootstrap plugin, fixing accidentally removed functionality ([#6024](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6024)).
    - The log level for dynamic plugin import failures was downgraded from an error to a warning, preventing unnecessary alerts for recoverable failures ([#6010](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6010)).

- **Maintenance and Developer Experience:**
    - A major dependency update was performed across the monorepo, bumping versions for TypeScript, ESLint, Vite, Sentry, and other key libraries ([#6025](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6025)).
    - Repository-wide code formatting was applied to standardize style and improve readability ([#6011](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6011), [#6027](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6027)).
    - The NPM publishing process was made more robust, and a security guard was added to prevent exposing local `.env` files in production ([#6012](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6012), [#6014](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6014)).
    - Obsolete Docker and devcontainer files were removed to streamline the repository ([#6026](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6026)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:** Key problems related to runtime stability and developer workflow were resolved. This includes a fix for a crash during `AgentRuntime` initialization ([#6003](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6003)) and the resolution of a bug preventing CLI commands from loading plugins correctly ([#6017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6017)). A feature request to configure the Discord plugin's responsiveness was also completed and closed ([#6013](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6013)).

- **New & Active Issues:** The focus of new issues has shifted towards future planning and strategic direction. Issues were opened to finalize cloud infrastructure wireframes ([#6019](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6019)) and conduct a "SWOT Agent Analysis" ([#6018](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6018)). A creative proposal for a "Prank Caller" agent ([#6020](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6020)) was also introduced, sparking discussion on novel agent applications. No active issues have generated significant discussion, indicating a clear path forward on current work.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week demonstrated a period of focused and efficient execution. The rapid turnaround from a reported CLI bug ([#6017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6017)) to its resolution ([#6021](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6021)) highlights the team's responsiveness. Iterative development was also evident in the agent visualization work, where an initial implementation ([#6016](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6016)) was quickly followed by UI enhancements ([#6023](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6023)). The creation of issues for strategic planning suggests a collaborative effort to define the project's future roadmap.

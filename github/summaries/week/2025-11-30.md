# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Nov 30 - 6, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week was marked by a dual focus on strengthening our current platform and laying the groundwork for future expansion. We made a significant push to improve stability and polish the user experience by resolving numerous bugs and refactoring core components. Simultaneously, we initiated development on foundational services for a more scalable and secure server architecture, setting the stage for our next phase of growth.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

**Enhancing Platform Stability and User Experience**
This initiative is crucial for building user trust and providing a reliable foundation for agent development.
-   The core server architecture was significantly reorganized and optimized for better performance and maintainability in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
-   Logging was standardized across the platform, making it easier for developers to diagnose and solve issues in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
-   A large batch of user interface bugs was fixed, resulting in a cleaner, more consistent experience when interacting with AI agents in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).

**Building the Foundation for Next-Generation Features**
To support our vision of more autonomous and capable AI agents, we are evolving our core architecture.
-   Work began on a new unified serverless API and a comprehensive user authentication system, preparing the platform for greater scalability and security in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza).
-   The MCP plugin was enhanced to allow for more flexible and descriptive agent configurations, improving how agents process and respond to tasks in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mcp).

**Improving Developer and User Onboarding**
A smooth onboarding process is essential for growing our community of users and contributors.
-   We clarified the new, centralized location for project documentation, ensuring everyone can find up-to-date information in [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) and [elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql).
-   Helpful setup guidance was provided for the MySQL plugin, resolving a common issue for new users and streamlining their initial experience in [elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql).

### Cross-Repository Coordination

**Centralizing Project Documentation**
To create a single source of truth and reduce confusion, we continued our effort to consolidate all documentation into a dedicated repository. This week, issues were addressed in both the main [elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) repository and the [elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-mysql) plugin to ensure users are correctly directed to the new documentation hub, demonstrating a coordinated effort to improve the user experience across the entire project.

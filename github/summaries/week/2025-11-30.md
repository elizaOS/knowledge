# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Nov 30 - 6, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant push for stabilization and code quality, followed by the introduction of new foundational features. Development focused on major refactoring efforts to standardize logging and optimize the server architecture. A large number of UI/UX issues were resolved, leading to a cleaner and more reliable user experience. The week concluded with proposals for a unified serverless API and robust JWT authentication, signaling a shift towards building out the next layer of core services.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on improving the existing codebase through refactoring, bug fixes, and stabilization.

- **Core Component Refactoring & Stabilization**
  - A major refactor was completed to standardize logging across the Core, CLI, and Server components, improving observability and resolving technical debt ([#6169]).
  - The server underwent a significant optimization and reorganization effort to improve its structure and performance ([#6199]).
  - A necessary rollback was performed on the `plugin-sql` package to revert problematic build configuration changes ([#6194]).

- **Client UI Bug Fixes**
  - The user-facing client was improved with fixes to markdown rendering. These changes addressed excessive vertical spacing in AI-generated responses, particularly around headings and blockquotes, for better visual consistency ([#6159], [#6197]).

- **New Foundational Features (In Progress)**
  - Work began on two significant backend features with new pull requests for a unified serverless API ([#6201]) and a comprehensive JWT authentication and user management system ([#6200]).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
Issue management focused on closing out a wide range of bugs and UI/UX improvements, while new issues point toward future platform expansion.

- **Closed Issues:**
  - **UI/UX & Stability:** A large batch of issues was closed to enhance the user experience and platform stability. This included simplifying the UI by cleaning up the sidebar and removing "Quick Presets" ([#6174], [#6176], [#6179]), improving server reliability by addressing connection timeouts ([#6198]), and fixing a container deployment bug ([#6187]).
  - **Technical Debt & Logging:** The long-standing effort to standardize logging and clean up the CLI/server was officially closed ([#6073], [#5932]).
  - **Community Questions:** Issues regarding OpenAI-compatible API support ([#6168]) and the location of documentation ([#6122]) were closed with clarifications, demonstrating responsiveness to user queries.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Future Platform Expansion:** New discussions were opened around significant future capabilities, including proposals for native Voice Support ([#6196]) and a dedicated Mobile App ([#6195]).
  - **Scope Clarification:** An active discussion on Farcaster + Base app support ([#6161]) was clarified; the feature is intended for the related Otaku agent platform, not the core Eliza framework, and an initial scope for contribution was offered.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
The week's activity shows a pattern of focused, collaborative effort. The large number of UI/UX and stability issues closed in a single day suggests a coordinated push to clear a backlog and polish the platform. The prompt closure of user-submitted questions about API compatibility and documentation location highlights the team's commitment to community support. Finally, the emergence of new pull requests for major architectural features and new issues proposing mobile and voice support indicates that contributors are actively thinking about the project's long-term trajectory.

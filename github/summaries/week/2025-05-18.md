# ElizaOS Weekly Update (May 18 - 24, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
This week saw significant progress in API enhancements, documentation infrastructure, and plugin development. The team implemented world selection in the messaging API, improved agent creation responses, and continued work on the Polygon plugin. CI/CD improvements were made to streamline documentation deployment, and several CLI command enhancements were completed to improve developer experience.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### API Enhancements
- Added world selection capability to the messaging API, allowing specification of `worldId` when sending messages to agents and recording this in created memories ([#4637](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4637))
- Improved agent creation API to return the newly created agent ID in the response, eliminating the need for subsequent API calls to retrieve this critical identifier ([#4634](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4634))

### Documentation and CI/CD Improvements
- Fixed documentation deployment workflow by addressing npm cache issues and optimizing the deployment process ([#4640](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4640))
- Implemented automated documentation deployment via GitHub Actions that triggers whenever changes are made to the `packages/docs` folder ([#4631](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4631))
- Comprehensive documentation updates including blog posts and partner documentation ([#4586](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4586))

### Plugin and CLI Development
- Added test for plugin installation failures, verifying that missing plugins properly fail with registry errors ([#4643](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4643))
- Continued development of the Polygon plugin with implementation of core EVM RPC wrappers and basic read functionality ([#4575](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4575))
- Enhanced the `elizaos dev` CLI command with improved character file handling and consistent behavior with the `start` command ([#4618](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4618))

## CLOSED ISSUES

### Dependency Management

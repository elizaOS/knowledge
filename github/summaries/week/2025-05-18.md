# ElizaOS Weekly Update (May 18 - 24, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
This week saw significant expansion of ElizaOS's capabilities with comprehensive improvements across multiple fronts. The team delivered major enhancements to the knowledge management system through a new RAG plugin, implemented robust WebSocket-based log streaming, added comprehensive image and video chat support, and improved the CLI experience. Infrastructure improvements included better environment configuration handling and enhanced plugin management, while several plugins were moved to dedicated repositories for better maintenance.

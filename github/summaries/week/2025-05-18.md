# ElizaOS Weekly Update (May 18 - 24, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
This week saw significant progress in ElizaOS's development with a focus on API enhancements, plugin infrastructure improvements, and system reliability. Major achievements include the implementation of new API endpoints for world and room management, enhanced CLI testing capabilities, and critical fixes to environment handling and plugin operations. The team also made strides in decentralizing plugins by moving several to dedicated repositories.

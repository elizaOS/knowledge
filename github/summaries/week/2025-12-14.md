# Overall Project Weekly Summary (Dec 14 - 20, 2025)

## Executive Summary
This week, the project advanced on two key fronts: strengthening the platform's core architecture for future growth and laying the groundwork for a major user experience overhaul. Foundational refactoring began in key plugins to improve modularity, while critical bug fixes in the core platform enhanced stability. This work was complemented by a strategic push toward decentralization with the release of a new self-hosted plugin, directly supporting our mission of user autonomy.

### Key Strategic Initiatives & Outcomes

-   **Strengthening the Architectural Foundation**
    This foundational work is crucial for building a more modular, scalable, and maintainable system, enabling faster development of future capabilities.
    -   Work began on a significant refactor in the **[elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram)** to create a standardized way for it to communicate with the core framework.
    -   A similar initiative was started in **[elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord)** to improve its internal message handling logic, enhancing the codebase's structure.

-   **Advancing Decentralization and User Control**
    In line with our core philosophy, this initiative reduces reliance on centralized services and gives users greater control over their data and infrastructure.
    -   A new self-hosted Farcaster plugin was added to the **[elizaos-plugins/registry](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry)**, empowering users to connect to their own Farcaster hub and removing dependency on third-party APIs.

-   **Improving Stability and Planning for a User-Friendly Future**
    We are focused on ensuring the platform is reliable for current users while strategically planning to make it more accessible for broader adoption.
    -   A critical fix was merged in **[elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)** to ensure users on older versions have a smooth, error-free data migration when updating the platform.
    -   A comprehensive plan for a major user experience overhaul was detailed in **[elizaos/eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza)**, with a focus on simplifying onboarding, using more intuitive language, and streamlining agent management.

## Repository Spotlights

### elizaos/eliza
The core repository saw a dual focus on immediate stability improvements and strategic planning for a major user experience enhancement.
-   **Stabilization:**
    -   The SQL plugin was enhanced to ensure smooth data migration for users updating from older versions, preventing breaking changes ([#6215](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6215)).
    -   A test failure in the CLI was resolved to improve the reliability of the development environment ([#6207](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6207)).
-   **User Experience:**
    -   Two UI improvements were rapidly implemented to make the plugin selection process more intuitive ([#6235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6235), [#6236](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6236)).
    -   A detailed roadmap for a UI/UX overhaul was established through numerous new issues, with key themes including a redesigned dashboard ([#6222](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6222)), guided user onboarding ([#6221](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6221)), and simplifying technical jargon like "Knowledge" to "Files" ([#6237](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6237)).
-   **Future Features:**
    -   Planning began for significant new capabilities, including web search functionality ([#6246](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6246)) and a guide for AI agent payments ([#6244](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6244)).

### elizaos-plugins/registry
This repository advanced the project's decentralization goals with a key feature release.
-   A new self-hosted Farcaster plugin was merged ([#243](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/243)), allowing the system to connect to a user-run hub and reducing reliance on centralized third-party services.

### elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram
Work in this repository focused on a strategic architectural improvement to align better with the core framework.
-   A pull request was opened to begin implementing a unified messaging API ([#22](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-telegram/pull/22)), a foundational change to standardize communication and improve modularity.

### elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord
Development activity was centered on improving the plugin's internal code structure for long-term health.
-   Work began on refactoring the core message handling logic ([#32](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-discord/pull/32)) to enhance the codebase's structure and maintainability.

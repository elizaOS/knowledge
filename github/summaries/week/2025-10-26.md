# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Oct 26 - 29, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by significant advancements in the project's core communication infrastructure and multi-tenancy capabilities. A major effort was completed to unify the messaging API, streamlining development and introducing a new "Jobs API" for stateless agent interactions. Concurrently, the platform's scalability and security were bolstered with the implementation of PostgreSQL Row-Level Security for true multi-tenant data isolation. Key improvements to the CLI, including cloud authentication and enhanced testing, rounded out a week focused on building a more robust, scalable, and developer-friendly framework.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on enhancing core APIs, strengthening server infrastructure, and improving the developer experience.

- **Unified Messaging and Agent Communication**
  A new unified messaging API, `elizaOS.sendMessage()`, was implemented to standardize communication across all ElizaOS clients, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability ([#6095](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6095)). This was complemented by the introduction of a new Jobs API, designed for one-off agent messaging, which allows external systems to send single messages and poll for responses without a persistent session ([#6097](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6097), [#6098](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6098)). To support this new API, payment middleware was also added ([#6099](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6099)).

- **Server Infrastructure and Multi-Tenancy**
  A major feature was merged to introduce PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS), enabling secure multi-tenant isolation where multiple ElizaOS servers can share a single database ([#6101](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6101)). To improve stability in production, public health check endpoints were added to the server, resolving issues with load balancer health checks ([#6103](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6103)).

- **CLI and Developer Experience**
  The command-line interface was enhanced with a new `elizaos login` command to facilitate cloud authentication and integration with ElizaOS Cloud services ([#6100](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6100)). Flexibility for developers was also improved by allowing custom options to be added to `Action` via an index signature ([#6104](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6104)).

- **Bug Fixes**
  Two critical bugs were resolved. The first corrected an issue where `.env` variables were ignored when character-specific secrets were present, ensuring configurations are merged correctly ([#6102](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6102)). The second fixed a bug in the GUI client that prevented the creation of DM channels ([#6105](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6105)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:**
  Several key issues were resolved, reflecting the progress made on major initiatives.
  - **API Development:** The issue to implement a unified messaging API ([#6096](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6096)) was closed following the merge of its associated pull request.
  - **Testing & Reliability:** An issue focused on improving CLI reliability ([#5935](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5935)) was closed after adding smoke tests, integration tests, and better error messaging.
  - **Website:** A community-facing issue to update the website navigation with Discord and Farcaster links was completed ([#6089](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6089)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  Only one new issue ([#6096](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6096)) was opened this week and was promptly closed the following day. The daily reports consistently noted no active issues with significant discussion, suggesting a rapid resolution cycle and no major blockers at present.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The development pace this week was high, with a clear focus on executing planned features. The rapid turnaround on the unified messaging API, from issue creation on Oct 26 to closure on Oct 27, demonstrates efficient and tightly coordinated work. Development efforts were well-distributed across core APIs, server infrastructure, the CLI, and bug fixes, indicating parallel progress on multiple fronts. The closure of the website navigation issue ([#6089](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6089)) also shows responsiveness to user-facing requests.

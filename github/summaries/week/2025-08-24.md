# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Aug 24 - 30, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by significant foundational improvements and the launch of a major new feature initiative. The project's build system was modernized with a migration to Bun, streamlining development across all packages. Concurrently, a series of critical bug fixes enhanced the stability of the core runtime, client, and plugins. The most notable new development was the kickoff of work on dynamic prompting, which will enable sophisticated, multi-turn conversation simulations and represents a major step forward in the agent's adaptability and testing capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on modernizing the build system, enhancing agent intelligence through advanced prompting, and improving overall system stability.

- **Build System Modernization with Bun**
  A major effort was completed to replace the `tsup` build system with a standardized Bun-based approach ([#5807](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5807)). This overhaul simplifies the build process and led to the creation of a new `@elizaos/utils` package to house shared build utilities, promoting code reuse and maintainability ([#5821](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5821)).

- **Advancements in Prompting and Agent Logic**
  A new feature to support dynamic, multi-turn conversations in scenarios was initiated, with a PR opened to add the core capability and its specifications ([#5824](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5824)). To improve modularity, core multi-step templates were moved to the core layer, allowing characters to define their own template overrides ([#5822](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5822)). Prompt logic was also refined to enforce user ID requirements for authenticated actions ([#5816](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5816]) and to clean up template definitions ([#5817](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5817)).

- **Widespread Stability and Bug Fixes**
  A number of fixes were deployed across the ecosystem to improve stability and correctness:
    - **Core Runtime:** A regression in `processActions` was fixed to correctly use `cacheState` ([#5815](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5815]), emitted events were updated to always include the runtime ([#5827](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5827]), and browser build exports and type definitions were improved ([#5832](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5832)).
    - **Client & CLI:** The `AgentLog` type was corrected in the client ([#5834](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5834]), and the CLI was updated to lazy-load the environment to prevent confusing startup warnings ([#5829](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5829)).
    - **Plugins:** The `GENERATE_IMAGE` handler was updated to return a proper `ActionResult` ([#5823](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5823]), and a parameter order bug in `logger.error` was fixed ([#5833](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5833)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue tracking this week highlighted a focus on future capabilities, infrastructure improvements, and test reliability.

- **Closed Issues:**
  A long-standing issue causing CI test failures on Windows was resolved. The fix addressed incorrect path handling in CLI agent start command tests, improving test suite reliability ([#5619](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5619)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  The most significant new issue is the proposal for **Dynamic Prompting for Multi-Turn Conversations** ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819)). This issue is highly active and includes a detailed implementation plan for enabling complex, stateful agent interactions in test scenarios.

  Other key proposals include:
    - **Infrastructure:** Integrating a native Venice AI provider for privacy-focused AI ([#5820](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5820]) and analyzing options for the MCP Gateway to improve agent communication ([#5814](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5814), [#5830](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5830)).
    - **User Experience:** A suggestion was made to display the action called and its result directly in the chat UI for better transparency ([#5831](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5831)).
    - **Bugs:** A problem was reported where a successfully published plugin is not visible in the PR list ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The week saw strong, proactive collaboration, particularly around planning for future features. The discussion on the dynamic prompting issue ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819)) was noted as "highly active," with a detailed implementation plan proposed almost immediately. This indicates a high level of engagement and a shared vision for the project's direction. The thoughtful refactoring during the Bun migration, which included creating a shared utilities package, further demonstrates a collaborative and forward-thinking development approach.

# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a strong focus on enhancing the core framework and improving the developer experience. A major architectural milestone was achieved with the implementation of standardized service types, enabling more modular and abstract plugin development. The command-line interface (CLI) received significant stability and usability upgrades, including fixes for the development server lifecycle and build processes. Concurrently, the team laid the groundwork for a major new "Scenario Runner" feature by creating a detailed set of implementation tickets, signaling a push towards more advanced agent evaluation capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week centered on architectural improvements, CLI tooling, and plugin ecosystem enhancements.

- **Core Architecture & Service Standardization**
  - A foundational change was introduced with the implementation of standardized service types and a `getServicesByType()` method, allowing for more flexible and extensible service retrieval within the core runtime ([#5565]). This resolves a long-standing architectural goal ([#4914]).
  - A build error was resolved by removing a duplicate `ActionResult` interface definition ([#5593]).

- **CLI & Developer Experience**
  - The development workflow was streamlined by enabling automatic building for the `elizaos start` command, mirroring the `dev` command's behavior ([#5504]).
  - The `dev` server now shuts down gracefully on `Cmd+C` (SIGINT/SIGTERM), preventing orphaned processes ([#5562]).
  - The CLI was made more robust by handling port conflicts in the `dev` command ([#5592]), suppressing redundant update notifications ([#5567]), and improving `bunx` detection while removing `npm` references ([#5599]).

- **Plugin Ecosystem & Model Integration**
  - A new `plugin-quick-starter` template was added to accelerate the development of backend-only plugins ([#5589]).
  - The integration with Ollama was solidified by mapping the legacy `llama_local` provider to the `@elizaos/plugin-ollama` package ([#5582]), correcting `installModelPlugin` calls ([#5598]), and making the plugin's inclusion conditional on environment configuration ([#5594]).
  - The system was updated to ensure Ollama is only used as a fallback if no other LLM is configured ([#5587]).

- **Testing & CI/CD**
  - CI tests for the CLI were improved by migrating to Bun's native process spawning ([#5586]).
  - Core tests were updated to use the `bun` runtime, replacing `execa` and emphasizing Ollama over `local-ai` ([#5556]).
  - The Claude code review workflow was enhanced to run on every PR commit with full bash and GitHub CLI access ([#5570]).

- **Bug Fixes & Stability**
  - A critical build issue where `tsup` was wiping the `vite` build was resolved ([#5555]).
  - Other fixes included correcting an advisory lock acquisition bug ([#5572]) and addressing various type-safety violations ([#5580], [#5596]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

- **Closed Issues:**
  - A significant number of issues related to CLI stability and developer experience were resolved, including the `dev` server failing to terminate ([#5559]), Windows-specific crashes ([#5161], [#5499]), and incorrect update messages ([#5447]).
  - Several plugin-related problems were fixed, such as installation failures ([#4861]), testing errors ([#4996]), and type errors after updates ([#5518]).
  - The key architectural issue to implement service types ([#4914]) was successfully closed, marking a major step forward for the project's modularity.

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Scenario Runner:** The most significant new work planned is the "Scenario Runner," which was broken down into a comprehensive set of implementation tickets ([#5573] - [#5579]). This represents a major upcoming feature for agent evaluation.
  - **Configuration Challenges:** New issues were opened regarding difficulties with custom plugin schema migrations ([#5588]) and parsing environment variables containing quotes ([#5590]), highlighting areas for improvement in configuration handling.
  - **Agent Communication:** A new issue ([#5584]) describes challenges in forwarding messages between agents without polling, pointing to a potential area for future architectural enhancement.
  - **Active Discussion:** The issue regarding Twitter API rate limits ([#38]) remains a point of active discussion, as users on free and lower-tier plans continue to experience "Too Many Requests" errors.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
- The systematic breakdown of the "Scenario Runner" feature into seven distinct, detailed issues suggests a highly organized and collaborative planning process among the core developers.
- The rapid response to community-reported bugs, such as the fix for the `dev` server shutdown ([#5562]) closing a recently opened issue ([#5559]), demonstrates a healthy and responsive development cycle.
- Community engagement is evident through new feature requests, such as the proposal to build a Zapper plugin ([#5600]), and the ongoing collaborative troubleshooting on persistent problems like the Twitter API issue ([#38]).

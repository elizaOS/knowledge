# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by significant strides in core architecture and developer experience. A major milestone was the implementation of standardized service types, a foundational step towards greater modularity and abstract plugin development. The command-line interface (CLI) received substantial upgrades to improve stability and streamline workflows, including automatic builds and graceful server shutdowns. Concurrently, planning for a new "Scenario Runner" feature kicked off, outlining a comprehensive framework for agent evaluation. The team also focused on enhancing testing infrastructure by fully embracing the Bun runtime and improving CI processes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on strengthening the project's foundations, from core services to developer tooling and testing.

-   **Core Architecture Enhancements:** A pivotal change was the introduction of standardized service types and a `getServicesByType()` method, enabling more flexible and abstract plugin interactions ([#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565)). This was complemented by code cleanup, such as removing a duplicate `ActionResult` interface to resolve build errors ([#5593](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5593)).

-   **CLI & Developer Experience:** The developer workflow saw major improvements. The `elizaos start` command now automatically builds projects, mirroring the `dev` command's behavior ([#5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504]). The dev server now shuts down gracefully with `Cmd+C`, preventing orphaned processes ([#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562]). For plugin developers, a new `plugin-quick-starter` template was added for creating backend-only plugins without frontend boilerplate ([#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589]). The CLI also became more robust by handling port conflicts automatically ([#5592](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5592]) and improving `bunx` detection ([#5599](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5599)).

-   **Testing & CI Infrastructure:** The project continued its migration to Bun-native tooling. CI tests for the CLI were improved by using Bun's native process spawning, and `execa` was replaced in core tests ([#5586](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5586), [#5556](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5556)). Test suites were updated to reflect version 1.2.1 changes and refactored for clarity ([#5561](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5561), [#5557](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5557)).

-   **AI & Plugin Improvements:** The Claude code review workflow was enhanced to run on every PR commit with expanded permissions ([#5570](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5570]). The integration with local models was refined, with a focus on Ollama. The legacy `llama_local` provider was officially mapped to the `@elizaos/plugin-ollama` plugin ([#5582](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5582]), and a bug in the `installModelPlugin` logic was fixed to ensure correct resolution ([#5598](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5598]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

-   **Closed Issues:** A significant number of bugs were resolved, enhancing stability and usability. Key closures include the long-standing task to implement service types ([#4914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914]) and a fix for the dev server not terminating correctly ([#5559](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5559]). Several issues related to plugin installation ([#4861](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4861]), build processes ([#5555](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5555]), and Windows-specific crashes ([#5161](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5161), [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5499]) were also addressed.

-   **New & Active Issues:** The most notable new development is the detailed planning for a **Scenario Runner**. A series of issues ([#5573](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5573) - [#5579](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5579)) were created to track the implementation of this new agent evaluation framework, covering everything from the CLI command to YAML parsing, sandboxed execution, and reporting. Other new issues highlight challenges with agent-to-agent communication ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584]), custom plugin schema migrations ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588]), and a community request for a Zapper plugin ([#5600](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5600)). An ongoing discussion continues around Twitter API rate limits ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/38)), with users on free tiers still facing "Too Many Requests" errors.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The week's activity points to strong, coordinated development efforts. The systematic breakdown of the new Scenario Runner feature into a well-defined epic suggests a high degree of planning and collaboration among the core team. Community engagement is visible in the ongoing discussion around the Twitter API rate limit issue ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/38)), where users are actively providing feedback and sharing their experiences with different subscription tiers. The request for a new Zapper plugin ([#5600](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5600)) also signals active interest from the community in expanding the project's integration capabilities.

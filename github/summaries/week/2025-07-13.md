# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by a significant push to modernize the core framework and enhance developer experience. The most notable achievement was the migration from Node.js's EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget API, improving performance and solidifying our commitment to the Bun runtime. The Command Line Interface (CLI) received substantial attention, with numerous fixes addressing project creation, module loading, and a critical bug in the NPM-deployed version. While development progressed, new challenges emerged around Windows compatibility and plugin schema migrations, and the groundwork was laid for a major new "Scenario Runner" feature for automated agent evaluation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on foundational refactoring, CLI stabilization, and targeted bug fixes.

-   **Core Modernization & Refactoring**
    A primary goal was to align the framework more closely with the Bun runtime and improve its modular architecture. A major effort was completed to migrate core components from Node.js's `EventEmitter` to Bun's native `EventTarget` API, enhancing type safety and performance ([#5609](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5609), [#5614](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5614), [#5612](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5612), [#5611](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5611), [#5613](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5613)). To improve extensibility, a new system for standardized service types was introduced, featuring a `getServicesByType()` method ([#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565)). The transition to Bun was further supported by replacing dependencies like `execa` and `node-fetch` with native alternatives ([#5556](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5556), [#5607](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5607)).

-   **CLI Stability & Developer Experience**
    Significant effort was invested in making the CLI more robust and user-friendly. A critical bug that prevented plugin actions from loading in the published NPM package was resolved ([#5624](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5624]). Several issues with project creation were fixed, including incorrect `.elizadb` directory inheritance in nested projects ([#5618](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5618]) and build process conflicts ([#5555](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5555)). The developer workflow was improved by adding auto-building to the `elizaos start` command ([#5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504]), ensuring graceful server shutdown ([#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562)), and adding a new `plugin-quick-starter` template for backend-only plugins ([#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589)).

-   **Bug Fixes & Workflow Enhancements**
    General stability was improved across the board. The Claude code review workflow was enhanced with full bash and GitHub CLI access ([#5570](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5570)). Other fixes included resolving an advisory lock acquisition bug ([#5572](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5572]) and refining the Ollama plugin's integration to act as a fallback LLM ([#5587](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5587)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

-   **Closed Issues:** Key problems were resolved this week, including the completion of the long-standing effort to implement standardized service types ([#4914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914)). Several CLI bugs were fixed, such as the dev server not shutting down correctly ([#5559](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5559]) and incorrect directory hoisting during project creation ([#5606](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5606)). The v1 to v2 character data migrator was also finalized and closed ([#5452](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5452)).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Major New Initiatives:** A comprehensive set of issues ([#5573](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5573)-[#5579](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5579)) was created to scope out a new **Scenario Runner** feature, designed for automated agent testing and evaluation.
    -   **Key Challenges:**
        -   **Agent Communication:** A detailed proposal for direct, synchronous agent-to-agent communication via a new OpenAI-compatible endpoint was discussed to eliminate polling inefficiencies ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584)).
        -   **Plugin Migrations:** An in-depth analysis of custom plugin schema migration failures identified issues with runtime service registration, sparking a discussion on solutions and best practices ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588)).
        -   **Windows Compatibility:** A recurring theme of new issues highlighted ongoing difficulties on Windows, including agent creation errors ([#5603](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5603)), unresponsive agents on WSL ([#5617](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5617)), and failing CI tests related to path handling ([#5619](https://github.com/

# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was characterized by a significant push to modernize the core framework and enhance the developer experience. Major efforts included migrating core APIs to Bun's native EventTarget for better performance, standardizing service interfaces to improve modularity, and resolving numerous critical bugs in the CLI related to project creation and stability. The team also laid the groundwork for a major new "Scenario Runner" feature for agent evaluation and began tackling complex challenges in inter-agent communication and plugin schema migrations, signaling a focus on both immediate stability and future capabilities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on strengthening the project's foundations, improving the command-line interface, and fixing critical bugs.

-   **Core Framework Modernization & Refactoring:**
    -   A significant migration from Node.js EventEmitter to Bun's native EventTarget API was undertaken to improve performance and runtime compatibility ([#5609]). This was followed by several pull requests to enhance type safety and ensure backward compatibility ([#5614], [#5612], [#5611], [#5613]).
    -   A new system for service types and standardized interfaces was introduced, featuring a `getServicesByType()` method to improve modularity and allow plugins to depend on abstract services ([#5565]).
    -   Core tests were improved by replacing `execa` with `bun`'s native process spawning and emphasizing Ollama over `local-ai` ([#5556]).

-   **CLI Enhancements & Stability:**
    -   The developer experience was improved by implementing automatic building for the `elizaos start` command ([#5504]) and ensuring the dev server shuts down gracefully on `Cmd+C` ([#5562]).
    -   Critical bugs in the `elizaos create` command were addressed, preventing the incorrect inheritance of `.elizadb` directories in nested projects ([#5618]) and fixing the creation path for the database directory ([#5633]).
    -   A new `plugin-quick-starter` template was added for streamlined backend-only plugin development ([#5589]).
    -   A critical bug preventing plugin actions from loading in the NPM-deployed version of the CLI was resolved, restoring core functionality for published packages ([#5624]).

-   **AI Workflow & Integration:**
    -   The Claude code review workflow was enhanced to run on every commit to a pull request and was granted full bash and GitHub CLI access for greater automation capabilities ([#5570]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
The project saw a mix of strategic feature planning, deep technical bug analysis, and resolution of user-facing issues.

-   **Closed Issues:**
    -   **Core Functionality:** The long-standing proposal to implement service types was completed ([#4914]). The v1 to v2 character migrator tool was also finalized and closed ([#5452]).
    -   **CLI & Developer Experience:** Key fixes were deployed for the dev server not terminating correctly ([#5559]), the `.eliza` directory being hoisted incorrectly during project creation ([#5606]), and various plugin installation and versioning problems ([#4861], [#4023], [#5447]).
    -   **Build & Environment:** An issue where the `tsup` build process was wiping the `vite` build was resolved ([#5555]).

-   **New & Active Issues:**
    -   **Feature Planning:** A comprehensive set of issues ([#5573] - [#5579]) was created to scope out the implementation of a new "Scenario Runner" feature, designed for agent evaluation via YAML-defined scenarios.
    -   **Architectural Challenges:** A detailed discussion emerged around enabling direct, synchronous agent-to-agent communication to replace polling-based methods ([#5584]). Another critical issue explores challenges with custom plugin schema migrations, where the `DatabaseMigrationService` is not being correctly registered ([#5588]).
    -   **Persistent Bugs:** Users continue to report issues with the Twitter plugin, including "Failed to fetch Home timeline" errors ([#38]), client initialization errors ([#31]), and SQL database insertion errors ([#39]), indicating a significant pain point for users of that integration.
    -   **Platform-Specific Bugs:** Several new issues highlight problems with agent and project creation on Windows and WSL, including incorrect directory creation and path handling ([#5603], [#5616], [#5617], [#5619]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
This week's activity demonstrated strong, focused collaboration on core architectural improvements. The multi-PR effort to migrate to EventTarget ([#5609], [#5614], etc.) shows a healthy code review and iteration cycle. The detailed technical breakdowns provided in new issues for agent-to-agent communication ([#5584]) and plugin migrations ([#5588]) suggest deep engagement from core contributors in tackling complex, forward-looking problems. The systematic creation of a full suite of tickets for the Scenario Runner feature points to a well-planned, collaborative approach to new development. Finally, the "+1" comments on persistent issues like the Twitter integration errors ([#39]) highlight shared community challenges that are gathering attention.

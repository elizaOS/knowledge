# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Jul 13 - 19, 2025)

## 🚀 Highlights
This week was marked by a significant push to mature the ElizaOS framework, focusing on core architectural enhancements and a sweeping overhaul of the developer experience. We successfully implemented a standardized service architecture, a long-standing goal that unlocks more modular and abstract plugin development. Concurrently, the CLI and local development loop saw major improvements, with fixes for graceful shutdowns, automatic builds, and port conflict handling. This foundational work was complemented by the strategic planning of a major new "Scenario Runner" feature, designed to standardize agent evaluation, and a continued migration towards `bun` and `Ollama` as core dependencies.

## 🛠️ Key Developments
Work this week centered on strengthening the core system, improving tooling, and enhancing AI integrations.

- **Core Architecture & Service Standardization**
  - A foundational improvement was made by implementing standardized service types, allowing plugins to discover capabilities using a new `getServicesByType()` method ([#5565](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5565)). This change resolves a major architectural issue ([#4914](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914)) and paves the way for more powerful, abstract plugins. A related build error was also resolved by removing a duplicate `ActionResult` interface definition ([#5593](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5593)).

- **CLI & Developer Experience Overhaul**
  - To accelerate plugin development, a new `plugin-quick-starter` template was added for creating backend-only plugins without frontend boilerplate ([#5589](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5589)).
  - The local development workflow was significantly streamlined. The `elizaos start` command now automatically builds code changes ([#5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504]), the `dev` server now shuts down gracefully on `Cmd+C` ([#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562]), and it can automatically find the next available port to avoid conflicts ([#5592](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5592)).
  - Several stability fixes were merged, including a fix for the `tsup` build process wiping `vite` builds ([#5555](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5555)) and suppressing redundant update notifications ([#5567](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5567)).

- **Testing & Dependency Modernization**
  - Our testing infrastructure continues to modernize. Core tests were refactored to use the `bun` runtime and replace `execa`, with a stronger emphasis on `Ollama` over `local-ai` ([#5556](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5556)). CLI CI tests were also migrated to use Bun-native process spawning for better performance and reliability ([#5586](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5586)).

- **AI & Plugin Integration**
  - The Claude code review and general workflows were enhanced with full bash and GitHub CLI command access ([#5570](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5570)).
  - To ensure smooth transitions, the legacy `llama_local` provider was officially mapped to the `@elizaos/plugin-ollama` plugin ([#5582](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5582)), and logic was improved to ensure Ollama is only used as a fallback if no other LLM is configured ([#5587](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5587)).

## 🐛 Issues & Triage
- **Closed Issues:** A significant number of bugs and long-standing issues were resolved. Key closures include the fix for the dev server not terminating correctly ([#5559](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5559)) and the completion of the service types implementation ([#4914](https://github.comcom/elizaos/eliza/issues/4914)). We also addressed numerous issues related to Windows compatibility ([#5161](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5161), [#5499](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5499)), plugin installation ([#4861](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4861)), and testing errors ([#4996](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4996)).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  - **Major New Initiative:** The most notable development is the detailed planning for a new **Scenario Runner**. This feature, broken into seven distinct issues ([#5573](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5573) - [#5579](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5579)), will introduce a standardized way to run and evaluate agent performance using YAML-defined scenarios.
  - **Architectural Challenges:** A new issue was opened regarding difficulties in forwarding messages between agents without polling ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584)), highlighting a potential area for future architectural improvement in inter-agent communication.
  - **Community Pain Points:** Discussion continues on the "Failed to fetch Home timeline" issue ([#38](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/38)), with users still facing Twitter API rate limits. New issues around custom plugin schema migrations ([#5588](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5588)) and environment variable parsing ([#5590](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5590)) suggest opportunities to improve configuration handling.

## 💬 Community & Collaboration
This week demonstrated strong, focused collaboration on improving the core developer experience. The quick turnaround on issues like the dev server shutdown bug ([#5559](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5559) -> [#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562)) shows the team's responsiveness to developer friction. The structured, multi-issue breakdown for the upcoming Scenario Runner feature indicates a proactive and well-organized approach to planning major new capabilities. Community engagement is also visible through new feature requests, such as for a Zapper plugin ([#5600](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5600)), and

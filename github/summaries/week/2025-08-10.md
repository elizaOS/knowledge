# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Aug 10 - 16, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by a dual focus on expanding core capabilities and formalizing the project's testing and evaluation framework. Significant infrastructure advancements were made, including the introduction of a Hono server for an OpenAI-compatible API and a new EVM plugin to bridge into the Web3 ecosystem. Concurrently, a major push to enhance testing maturity was evident, with the completion of features for natural language interaction and dynamic plugin loading in scenarios, and the proposal of a comprehensive new suite of evaluators for measuring agent performance, cost, and consistency. A critical bug in the plugin publishing workflow was identified and is actively being addressed, highlighting a commitment to improving the developer experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week focused on foundational infrastructure, API compliance, and developer tooling.

- **Core Infrastructure and API Enhancements**
  A major refactor introduced a Hono server and overhauled the agent registry, enabling agent interaction via an OpenAI-compatible API ([#5753]). In line with this, the chat completions API was updated to expose intermediate tool calls, improving visibility while maintaining full OpenAI API compliance ([#5755]).

- **New Agent Capabilities and Tooling**
  The project expanded its reach with the integration of a new EVM plugin, providing essential wallet and blockchain tooling ([#5752]). A new character type system was also introduced to improve API consistency across different agent personas ([#5756]).

- **Developer Experience and Build System**
  Several improvements were made to the development workflow. Import paths were standardized using `@/` aliases to improve consistency ([#5751]), and a bug in the project-starter template's component tests was resolved ([#5748]). The build system was also updated by moving the `checkout` action to v5 for improved security and stability ([#5762]).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
Issue management this week saw the resolution of key testing features and the introduction of a new wave of strategic initiatives and bug reports.

- **Closed Issues:**
  A significant set of issues related to advanced scenario testing was closed, marking the completion of a major feature set. This includes support for natural language agent interaction ([#5727]), dynamic plugin loading within scenarios ([#5725]), and advanced mocking with conditional responses ([#5726]). Additionally, the sessions API was successfully exposed to the `api-client` package ([#5721]).

- **New & Active Issues:**
  A critical bug was identified where the `elizaos publish --npm` command falsely reports success even when the package fails to publish to the registry ([#5754]). This is a major blocker for plugin developers, and a pull request ([#5763]) has already been opened to address it.

  Looking forward, a series of new issues proposes a sophisticated evaluation framework, including evaluators for token count ([#5758]), execution time ([#5757]), cost ([#5759]), and consistency ([#5760]). This aligns with new proposals for creating a formal benchmark suite ([#5764]). Other strategic issues include a potential move to a "core pure" architecture ([#5766]) and a proof-of-concept for a deterministic LLM inference endpoint ([#5768]).

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
The week's activity indicates a highly engaged and forward-thinking community. The detailed analysis and suggested fixes for the critical publishing bug ([#5754]) demonstrate deep technical involvement from contributors. The large number of new, interconnected issues filed on August 12th and 13th suggests a coordinated planning effort to define the project's next steps in benchmarking and architecture. Furthermore, an issue seeking guidance on plugin testing errors ([#5770]) points to an active and growing ecosystem of plugin developers. The follow-ups on older issues ([#5738], [#5719]) by maintainers show a continued effort to manage the backlog and ensure project health.

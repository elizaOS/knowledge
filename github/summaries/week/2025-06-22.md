# ElizaOS Weekly Update (Jun 22 - 28, 2025)

## OVERVIEW

This week saw significant architectural advancements, including the migration to a new type-safe API client and a shift to agent-scoped plugins for greater flexibility. Development also focused on enhancing the CLI user experience, expanding model provider support with OpenRouter, and resolving a wide range of bugs across the GUI, CLI, and backend to improve overall stability and developer experience.

## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS

### API and Client Architecture Overhaul

A major effort was completed to modernize the project's frontend communication. A new, fully type-safe API client package (`@elizaos/api-client`) was introduced ([#5240](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5240)), and the primary web client was successfully migrated to use it, streamlining development and reducing errors ([#5263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5263)). The Postman collection was also updated to reflect the latest API specifications ([#5239](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5239)).

### Enhanced Plugin and Agent Configuration

The framework's architecture was updated to support agent-scoped plugins instead of project-scoped ones, allowing different agents to have unique plugin sets ([#5270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5270)). This was later rolled back to address immediate issues ([#5297](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5297)). Support for OpenRouter was added, increasing flexibility for both language and embedding models ([#5264](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5264)). Additionally, character plugin configurations and documentation were improved ([#5302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5302)).

### CLI and Developer Experience Improvements

The command-line interface received significant usability upgrades. The environment variable configuration process for plugins was enhanced with a better user prompt experience ([#5291](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5291)). Code was refactored to centralize directory detection logic, reducing duplication ([#5246](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5246)), and orphaned server code was removed from the CLI package ([#5305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5305)).

### Widespread Bug Squashing and Stability Fixes

Numerous bugs were addressed across the platform. Key fixes include resolving file upload failures by completing the migration to `multer` ([#5252](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5252]), fixing a bug that caused the chat UI to get stuck ([#5274](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5274]), correcting macOS-specific CLI test failures ([#5250](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5250)), and ensuring the CLI build properly depends on the client build to prevent UI errors on deployment ([#5307](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5307)).

## CLOSED ISSUES

### API Migration and Functionality Bugs

Issues related to the new API client migration were resolved, including the task to migrate the main client package

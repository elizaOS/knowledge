# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Jun 22 - 28, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week was marked by a significant push to modernize the developer experience and enhance agent modularity. The core achievement was the successful migration of the client to a new type-safe `@elizaos/api-client` package, a multi-day effort that promises greater stability and easier integration. A major architectural shift was introduced by refactoring plugins to be agent-scoped rather than project-scoped, granting developers more granular control over agent capabilities. Alongside these strategic initiatives, the team addressed numerous bugs, improved the CLI, and stabilized file upload functionalities, reflecting a strong focus on both future-proofing the framework and improving current usability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
Work this week spanned foundational API changes, developer tooling enhancements, and critical bug fixes.

**API Modernization & Client Migration**
A major effort was completed to improve the project's API architecture. The `packages/client` was fully migrated to use the new, type-safe `@elizaos/api-client` package ([#5240](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5240), [#5263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5263)), a move tracked in issue [#5259](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5259). This was supported by a large-scale migration of the admin API ([#5266](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5266)) and comprehensive updates to API documentation and Postman collections to ensure alignment with the latest specifications ([#5239](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5239), [#5236](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5236), [#5275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5275)).

**Enhanced Agent Flexibility & Plugin Architecture**
Agent capabilities were significantly enhanced through several key changes:
-   **Agent-Scoped Plugins:** A major refactor transitioned plugins from a project-scoped to an agent-scoped architecture, allowing each agent to have a unique set of plugins ([#5270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5270)). This change was later rolled back ([#5297](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5297)) due to issues with new dependencies, indicating an iterative approach to this complex feature.
-   **Expanded Model Selection:** Users can now select OpenRouter for both language and embedding models, increasing flexibility ([#5264](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5264)).
-   **New Agent Content:** Deployment configurations for the `rofl` agent were added ([#5277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5277)), and work began on a new "Gork" character ([#5301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5301), [#5300](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5300)).

**CLI & Developer Experience Improvements**
The command-line interface received significant attention to improve usability and maintainability:
-   The CLI's environment variable prompting was upgraded with a more user-friendly interface ([#5291](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5291)).
-   Code was streamlined by centralizing directory detection logic ([#5246](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5246)) and removing orphaned legacy server directories ([#5305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5305)).
-   Cross-platform stability was improved by fixing macOS CLI test failures ([#5250](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5250)).

**Robustness and Bug Fixes**
Numerous fixes were implemented across the stack to improve stability:
-   **File Uploads:** A critical bug with the file upload feature was resolved through a complete migration to `multer` ([#5252](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5252)) and added support for `.txt` files ([#5262](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5262)).
-   **Client UI:** Fixes were deployed for a bug that caused the chat to get stuck on "agent is thinking" ([#5274](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5274]) and an issue preventing chat title generation ([#5280](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5280)).
-   **Core & Infrastructure:** The team addressed database connection error reporting ([#5235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5235]), fixed a client build dependency issue causing UI availability errors ([#5307](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5307)), and resolved a static path `NotFoundError` ([#5298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5298)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage
This week saw the resolution of several key issues while also surfacing new challenges related to user experience and advanced development.

-   **Closed Issues:** Key problems resolved include the successful migration of the client to the new `@elizaos/api-client` ([#5259](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5259)), fixing the broken file upload feature ([#5251](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5251)), and a strategic decision to standardize the testing framework by migrating fully to `bun:test` ([#5185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5185)). A question on how to check for loaded plugins was also answered, clarifying that this information is in the agent logs ([#4931](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4931)).

-   **New & Active Issues:** Several important discussions are ongoing. The need for a major documentation overhaul ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5234)) to better serve both non-technical users and developers gained traction. Users reported challenges with custom plugin development for on-chain agents ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5260)) and a "request entity too large" error when saving large character files ([#5268](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5268]), highlighting user-facing pain points. The investigation into "API endpoint not found" errors ([#5230](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5230)) continues, with recent analysis suggesting the root cause is likely environmental or configuration-related rather than a code defect.

## üí¨ Community & Collaboration
Collaboration was active and multifaceted this week. The introduction of a Claude Code AI agent via a new GitHub Actions workflow ([#5269](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5269)) represents an interesting new form of development assistance in the repository.

Discussions on issues like the documentation overhaul ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5234)) and API endpoint errors ([#5230](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5230)) demonstrated healthy engagement, with multiple contributors providing analysis and feedback. The detailed back-and-forth on the "split personality" issue ([#105](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/105)) showcased deep technical collaboration on core architectural decisions, with contributors debating the use of GitHub usernames versus internal IDs as primary keys. This level of engagement indicates a committed community invested in the long-term stability and usability of the project.

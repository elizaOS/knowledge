# ElizaOS Weekly Update (Jun 22 - 28, 2025)

## OVERVIEW
This week saw significant architectural improvements to ElizaOS with a major shift from project-scoped to agent-scoped plugins, enhancing flexibility and customization. The team completed the migration to the new `@elizaos/api-client` package, improved model provider support with OpenRouter integration, and fixed numerous issues related to file uploads, embedding models, and UI functionality. The CLI experience was also enhanced with better environment variable configuration.

# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Jul 27 - 2, 2025)

## üöÄ Highlights
This week's efforts centered on improving project consistency and developer experience. A major initiative to standardize all documentation and testing on `bun:test` was completed, enhancing codebase uniformity. Significant progress was made in clearing backlogs, with the closure of a comprehensive documentation review, several video production tasks, and a batch of plugin-related issues. Looking forward, new work has been proposed to enhance CLI tooling, introduce character-based model configurations, and improve the plugin development lifecycle, signaling a continued focus on both core functionality and usability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Developments
The primary completed work this week focused on improving the quality and consistency of the project's documentation and testing foundation.

- **Documentation and Testing Standardization:** A key pull request was merged to standardize all project documentation and tests to exclusively use `bun:test` ([#5681](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5681)). This effort ensures a consistent testing framework across all packages, from the `cli` and `client` to `core` and `docs`. A minor typo in the documentation was also corrected ([#5679](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5679)).

## üêõ Issues & Triage

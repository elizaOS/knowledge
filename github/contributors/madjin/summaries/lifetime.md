## Competing Hypotheses
- **For large PR sizes (avg >7k lines):** Could indicate bulk documentation consolidation, automated JSDoc generation, or large-scale file migrations between directories.
- **For low issue linkage (5%):** Could indicate proactive documentation maintenance not tied to specific bug reports, or coordination of web features via external communication channels.
- **For high contribution share in elizaos.github.io (54%):** Could indicate a specialized role in web infrastructure or a primary maintainer status for the project's frontend and API components.
- **For review concentration (top 2 >80%):** Could indicate a small pool of active maintainers for the specific repositories or consistent availability of specific reviewers.
- **For file type skew (76% docs):** Could indicate a project phase focused on technical debt reduction through documentation or a specialized role in knowledge management.

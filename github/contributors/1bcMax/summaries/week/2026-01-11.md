1bcMax: Focused on expanding payment capabilities by introducing the blockrun plugin for x402 micropayments, submitting two key pull requests across the elizaos/eliza (#6355) and elizaos-plugins/registry (#248) repositories. This work involved a substantial addition of over 1,000 lines of new code, configuration, and tests to integrate the new functionality into the ecosystem. Their primary focus this week was on feature development and infrastructure setup for decentralized payment processing.

borisudovicic: Today, borisudovicic primarily focused on strategic planning and project definition, evidenced by the creation of 38 issues in elizaos/eliza, covering a broad range of topics from UI/UX enhancements like "[UI] Lander" (#6427) and "[UX] Implement Conversation-Based Onboarding" (#6414), to critical infrastructure development such as "[Infra] Telegram Webhook Registration" (#6425) and "[Infra] Memory Persistence System" (#6411), and extensive plugin integrations. This activity indicates a strong emphasis on outlining future development and architectural considerations for the Eliza project.

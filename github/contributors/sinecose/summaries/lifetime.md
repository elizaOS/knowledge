## Contribution Domains
- **Plugin Maintenance & Standardization:** Focused on code quality improvements within the `elizaos/eliza` repository, specifically targeting blockchain integration plugins. Work involved standardizing logging patterns by migrating from native console methods to the internal `elizaLogger` and removing dead code.
  - PRs: elizaos/eliza#1888 (replaced console with elizaLogger in Solana plugin), elizaos/eliza#1745 (implemented eliza logger in NEAR plugin), elizaos/eliza#1744 (removed unused imports in Cronos zkEVM plugin).

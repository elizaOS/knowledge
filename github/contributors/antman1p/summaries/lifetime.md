antman1p focused exclusively on the `elizaos/eliza` repository, primarily addressing infrastructure configuration and dependency management. Work included resolving version conflicts for `@ai-sdk/provider`, updating Supabase adapter configurations, and refining environment variable examples. Technical contributions involved handling case-sensitive column references in SQL tables and modifying agent directory conditionals. Additionally, antman1p identified local CUDA detection issues and contributed documentation fixes for plugin quickstarts.

Key updates include refining agent log viewing, removing legacy code, and ensuring proper build dependencies.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n**CLI Tooling and Build Process Improvements**\n*   Removed the orphaned `packages/cli/src/server/` directory, which contained legacy code now migrated to `@elizaos/server`  [#5305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5305).\n*   Ensured the CLI build process depends on the client build to prevent \"Client UI not available\" errors during deployment [#5307](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5307).\n\n**Character Configuration and Plugin Enhancements**\n*   Improved character templates with enhanced plugin ordering and updated character configurations [#5302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5302).\n*   Fixed build issues and added deployment configuration files for the `rofl` plugin, including a new character file to enable all polygon plugins and an `openai` plugin [#5277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5277).\n\n**Agent Log Viewer and Static Serving Fixes**\n*   Improved the agent-log-viewer component with an increased polling interval (5 seconds) and defaulted to live mode for better performance and user experience [#5306](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5306).\n*   Dynamically resolves client path for static serving [#5298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5298).\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n**Migration to `@elizaos/api-client`**\n*   Issue [#5259](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5259) was closed, which involved migrating `packages/client` to leverage the new `@elizaos/api-client` package for a type-safe, service-oriented API.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\nN/A", "2025-06-28T23:06:15.309Z"]

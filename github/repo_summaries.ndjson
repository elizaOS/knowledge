The project underwent significant architectural refactoring, most notably by separating the server into a standalone `@elizaos/server` package and transitioning plugins to an agent-scoped model for greater flexibility. This focus on modularity was matched by a push for broader AI provider support, with integrations for Google Generative AI, Ollama, and OpenRouter. Concurrently, the team invested heavily in improving developer experience and stability by overhauling the testing framework, enhancing the CLI, and resolving numerous bugs, particularly around CI/CD and cross-platform compatibility.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nThis month's work focused on maturing the core architecture, expanding capabilities, and improving stability across the framework.\n\n**Core Architecture & API Refinement**\n- **Server Separation:** The most significant architectural change was the extraction of server functionality into a new, independent `@elizaos/server` package. This modularization enables independent server usage and streamlines future development ([#5122](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5122)).\n- **API Restructuring:** API routes were reorganized into a logical, domain-based structure for better clarity ([#5010](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5010]). A new type-safe `@elizaos/api-client` package was also introduced and integrated into the client, improving developer experience and reducing errors ([#5240](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5240), [#5263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5263)).\n- **Messaging System Refactor:** The message server was refactored to operate independently from agents, introducing a centralized system with support for servers and channels ([#4864](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4864)).\n\n**Agent & Plugin System Enhancements**\n- **Agent-Scoped Plugins:** The plugin architecture was refactored from project-scoped to agent-scoped, allowing individual agents to have unique, customizable plugin sets ([#5270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5270)).\n- **Expanded AI Provider Support:** The framework's flexibility was enhanced by adding support for Google Generative AI (Gemini) ([#5217](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5217]), Ollama ([#5160](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5160]), and OpenRouter ([#5264](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5264]) as language and embedding model providers.\n- **Plugin Management:** Numerous fixes were implemented to improve plugin loading ([#4949](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4949)), dependency resolution ([#4888](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4888)), and installation processes ([#4945](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4945)).\n\n**CLI & Developer Experience**\n- **Modernized CLI:** The CLI experience was significantly upgraded by migrating all prompts to `@clack/prompts` for a better user interface and type safety ([#5016](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5016]).\n- **Performance Optimization:** The `elizaos create` command was sped up by lazy-loading dependencies in starter templates ([#5214](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5214]).\n- **New Tooling:** A new CLI starter project was introduced ([#4830](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4830]), and comprehensive setup guides were added, including one for macOS development ([#4903](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4903)).\n\n**Testing and CI/CD Overhaul**\n- **Framework Migration:** A major effort was undertaken to standardize the testing framework, migrating CLI tests from Bats to Bun TypeScript ([#4978](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4978]) and moving the entire monorepo from a mixed `vitest`/`bun:test` setup to a unified `bun:test` framework ([#5185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5185)).\n- **Stability Fixes:** Significant effort was dedicated to stabilizing CI/CD pipelines, addressing numerous issues related to caching ([#5225](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5225]), dependency installation ([#5143](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5143)), and cross-platform compatibility, especially for Windows ([#5156](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5156), [#5332](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5332)).\n\n**UI/UX Improvements**\n- **Chat Interface:** The chat UI received numerous enhancements, including a retry button for messages ([#4973](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4973]), an animated markdown component ([#5111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5111]), and improved responsive design ([#4974](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4974)).\n- **Agent Management:** The UI for managing agents was improved with fixes to the character form secrets panel ([#5186](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5186]), avatar uploads ([#5323](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5323]), and environment settings ([#5312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5312)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nThe project saw a high volume of issue creation and resolution, reflecting an active development cycle and engaged user base.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** Key problems resolved this month include persistent agent interaction bugs like infinite response loops ([#4934](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4934)) and cross-chat interference ([#4935](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/4935]). Critical plugin issues, such as action callbacks not reaching the user ([#5017](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5017)) and broken EVM plugin functionality ([#4357](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4357)]), were addressed. Several setup and configuration blockers were also fixed, including character files failing to load ([#5039](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5039)) and a bug preventing large character files from being saved ([#5268](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5268)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** Several important new issues highlight areas for", "2025-07-23T06:16:16.082Z"]

Recent discussions confirm this is a valid issue in the current codebase (v1.0.19). The root cause is identified in the message handler flow where the `ATTACHMENTS` provider modifies the state before it's passed to action callbacks, leading to interference. A fix is being implemented for version 1.2.4, which involves separating provider state composition from action callback processing. Users are advised to avoid attachment-related keywords in prompts or implement action validation as a workaround.\n\n### Documentation Overhaul ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5234))\nThe proposal for a documentation overhaul to create separate tracks for simple users and developers is an active discussion. Feedback highlights that the current documentation, while comprehensive, doesn't effectively serve both distinct user groups. A user commented on the difficulty for non-coders to navigate the existing documentation and examples, citing inconsistencies in environment variable settings and non-functional example JSON files. The need for documentation tailored to beginners who want to set up and edit characters without deep technical knowledge was emphasized.", "2025-07-23T06:12:13.327Z"]

Several critical bug fixes were implemented, improving chat stability and API documentation accuracy.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Agent Plugin Management\nThe plugin architecture has been refactored from project-scoped to agent-scoped, allowing individual agents to have unique plugin sets. This change provides greater flexibility and customization for character configurations. ([#5270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5270))\n\n### API Client Migration and Refinement\nThe migration of the `packages/client` to the new `@elizaos/api-client` package has been completed, streamlining API interactions. This was accompanied by critical fixes to restore GUI chat title generation and update API documentation for accuracy. ([#5263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5263), [#5280](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5280), [#5275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5275))\n\n### Chat Stability and Message Formatting Improvements\nSeveral fixes were deployed to address chat-related issues, including a bug where the chat would get stuck displaying \"agent is thinking\" after a failure and an update to attachment formatting for improved message display. ([#5274](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5274), [#5273](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5273))\n\n### New Development Workflow Integration\nA new GitHub Actions workflow for Claude Code integration has been added, introducing an AI coding agent to assist with repository development. ([#5269](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5269))\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#5278](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5278): Fixes a database schema type mismatch for server agents within the `plugin-sql` package.\n- [#5276](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5276): Aims to normalize paths for Windows compatibility.\n- [#5272](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5272): Addresses a failing core attachment test.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Configuration and Agent Functionality\nAn issue where the `TEXT_EMBEDDING` delegate type had no handler was resolved by ensuring the agent character file included the necessary OpenAI plugin. This allowed the agent to successfully process messages and reply via the UI. ([#5279](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5279))\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Character File Size Limitations\nA new issue reports that large character files (approx. 150kb) can be imported but cannot be saved due to an \"Error 500: request entity too large\". The expected behavior is to allow saving of such files, with a desired size limit of 100mb. ([#5268](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5268))\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Custom Plugin Development Challenges\nUsers are encountering difficulties when developing custom plugins, specifically with an on-chain AI agent. The agent sometimes only processes one message before stopping plugin usage, and responses may appear in the terminal but not the UI. A recent comment suggests ensuring responses are sent via either callback or return in the action, but not both. ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5260))\n\n### Twitter Plugin Reply Issues\nThe Twitter plugin is failing to post replies to mentions or tags, despite loading successfully and having relevant configuration options enabled. No errors are displayed, and the plugin appears to be running. It has been noted that newlines in timeline replies are replaced with `\\n\\n` instead of actual line breaks, which might be due to the template explicitly instructing the agent to use `\\n`. Additionally, memories are being saved, but the response sometimes drops out before reaching the UI.

["elizaos/eliza_week_2025-06-22", "elizaos/eliza", "week", "2025-06-22", "# elizaos/eliza Weekly Report (Jun 22 - 28, 2025)\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Highlights\nThis week was marked by a significant push to modernize the developer experience and enhance agent modularity. The core achievement was the successful migration of the client to a new type-safe `@elizaos/api-client` package, a multi-day effort that promises greater stability and easier integration. A major architectural shift was introduced by refactoring plugins to be agent-scoped rather than project-scoped, granting developers more granular control over agent capabilities. Alongside these strategic initiatives, the team addressed numerous bugs, improved the CLI, and stabilized file upload functionalities, reflecting a strong focus on both future-proofing the framework and improving current usability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week spanned foundational API changes, developer tooling enhancements, and critical bug fixes.\n\n**API Modernization & Client Migration**\nA major effort was completed to improve the project's API architecture. The `packages/client` was fully migrated to use the new, type-safe `@elizaos/api-client` package ([#5240](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5240), [#5263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5263)), a move tracked in issue [#5259](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5259). This was supported by a large-scale migration of the admin API ([#5266](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5266)) and comprehensive updates to API documentation and Postman collections to ensure alignment with the latest specifications ([#5239](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5239), [#5236](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5236), [#5275](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5275)).\n\n**Enhanced Agent Flexibility & Plugin Architecture**\nAgent capabilities were significantly enhanced through several key changes:\n-   **Agent-Scoped Plugins:** A major refactor transitioned plugins from a project-scoped to an agent-scoped architecture, allowing each agent to have a unique set of plugins ([#5270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5270)). This change was later rolled back ([#5297](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5297)) due to issues with new dependencies, indicating an iterative approach to this complex feature.\n-   **Expanded Model Selection:** Users can now select OpenRouter for both language and embedding models, increasing flexibility ([#5264](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5264)).\n-   **New Agent Content:** Deployment configurations for the `rofl` agent were added ([#5277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5277)), and work began on a new \"Gork\" character ([#5301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5301), [#5300](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5300)).\n\n**CLI & Developer Experience Improvements**\nThe command-line interface received significant attention to improve usability and maintainability:\n-   The CLI's environment variable prompting was upgraded with a more user-friendly interface ([#5291](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5291)).\n-   Code was streamlined by centralizing directory detection logic ([#5246](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5246)) and removing orphaned legacy server directories ([#5305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5305)).\n-   Cross-platform stability was improved by fixing macOS CLI test failures ([#5250](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5250)).\n\n**Robustness and Bug Fixes**\nNumerous fixes were implemented across the stack to improve stability:\n-   **File Uploads:** A critical bug with the file upload feature was resolved through a complete migration to `multer` ([#5252](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5252)) and added support for `.txt` files ([#5262](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5262)).\n-   **Client UI:** Fixes were deployed for a bug that caused the chat to get stuck on \"agent is thinking\" ([#5274](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5274]) and an issue preventing chat title generation ([#5280](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5280)).\n-   **Core & Infrastructure:** The team addressed database connection error reporting ([#5235](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5235]), fixed a client build dependency issue causing UI availability errors ([#5307](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5307)), and resolved a static path `NotFoundError` ([#5298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5298)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nThis week saw the resolution of several key issues while also surfacing new challenges related to user experience and advanced development.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:** Key problems resolved include the successful migration of the client to the new `@elizaos/api-client` ([#5259](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5259)), fixing the broken file upload feature ([#5251](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5251)), and a strategic decision to standardize the testing framework by migrating fully to `bun:test` ([#5185](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5185)). A question on how to check for loaded plugins was also answered, clarifying that this information is in the agent logs ([#4931](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4931)).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** Several important discussions are ongoing. The need for a major documentation overhaul ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5234)) to better serve both non-technical users and developers gained traction. Users reported challenges with custom plugin development for on-chain agents ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5260)) and a \"request entity too large\" error when saving large character files ([#5268](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5268]), highlighting user-facing pain points. The investigation into \"API endpoint not found\" errors ([#5230](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5230)) continues, with recent analysis suggesting the root cause is likely environmental or configuration-related rather than a code defect.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration was active and multifaceted this week. The introduction of a Claude Code AI agent via a new GitHub Actions workflow ([#5269](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5269)) represents an interesting new form of development assistance in the repository.\n\nDiscussions on issues like the documentation overhaul ([#5234](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5234)) and API endpoint errors ([#5230](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5230)) demonstrated healthy engagement, with multiple contributors providing analysis and feedback. The detailed back-and-forth on the \"split personality\" issue ([#105](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/105)) showcased deep technical collaboration on core architectural decisions, with contributors debating the use of GitHub usernames versus internal IDs as primary keys. This level of engagement indicates a committed community invested in the long-term stability and usability of the project.", "2025-07-23T06:14:08.870Z"]

A major feature addition involved new deployment configurations and plugin support for the `rofl` agent.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Agent and Plugin Enhancements\n*   Improved character configurations with enhanced plugin ordering and updated documentation, ensuring better agent behavior and easier setup ([#5302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5302)).\n*   Added new deployment configuration files for the `rofl` agent, fixed build issues, and integrated the `openai` plugin to enable all Polygon plugins ([#5277](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5277)).\n\n### CLI and Client Infrastructure Improvements\n*   Removed orphaned legacy server directories from the CLI, streamlining the codebase as functionality has migrated to `@elizaos/server` ([#5305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5305)).\n*   Ensured the CLI build properly depends on the client build to prevent \"Client UI not available\" errors, resolving critical deployment issues ([#5307](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5307)).\n*   Improved the agent-log-viewer component by increasing the polling interval from 2 to 5 seconds for better performance and user experience, defaulting to live mode ([#5306](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5306)).\n\n### Bug Fixes and Rollbacks\n*   Dynamically resolved client paths for static serving to fix `NotFoundError` issues, ensuring proper access to client assets ([#5298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5298)).\n*   Rolled back a previous PR ([#5270](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5270)) that had introduced new plugins as dependencies to the CLI and project starter packages ([#5297](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5297)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n*   [#5303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5303) `revert: Dynamic client path resolution`: This PR aims to revert changes related to dynamic client path resolution.\n*   [#5301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5301) `Feat/gork character`: This PR introduces a new character named \"Gork\".\n*   [#5300](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5300) `feat: Add Gork character persona`: This PR adds the persona definition for the new \"Gork\" character.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n### API Client Migration\n*   The `packages/client` has been successfully migrated to leverage the new `@elizaos/api-client` package, providing a type-safe, service-oriented API client for ElizaOS ([#5259](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5259)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were opened today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n### Webhook Integration for Message Initiation\n*   Issue [#6](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6) discusses providing an option for webhooks to initiate new messages, as the current polling interval can be expensive or lead to poor UX. The latest comment from `wtfsayo` suggests that plugins can mount routes to the ElizaOS server, making webhook implementation feasible without excessive complexity. This indicates a potential path forward for implementing webhook functionality.", "2025-07-23T06:12:20.551Z"]

Development focused heavily on improving developer experience through better testing infrastructure, a more robust CI/CD pipeline, and a comprehensive documentation update. While core stability and feature enhancements like action chaining saw great progress, the project also grappled with persistent challenges, particularly around Windows compatibility and the functionality of the Twitter plugin, which remains a key area of focus for the community.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this month spanned the entire stack, from foundational architecture to the end-user interface, with a clear theme of improving stability, usability, and developer tooling.\n\n-   **Comprehensive CLI Enhancements:** The CLI was a major focus, receiving a complete migration to `@clack/prompts` for a consistent user experience ([#5359]). The `create` command was improved to handle project types correctly and clean up on interruption ([#5321], [#5337]). User feedback was enhanced with spinners instead of verbose logs ([#5431]), and critical bugs related to the `update` command ([#5427]), global installations ([#5450]), and Windows path handling ([#5437]) were resolved. A new AI-powered migration tool was introduced to help upgrade plugins ([#5311]), and a `plugin-quick-starter` template was added to streamline backend-only plugin development ([#5589]).\n\n-   **Major UI/UX Overhaul:** The web client underwent a significant visual redesign to align with new Figma specifications. This included a complete refactor of Agent Cards ([#5351], [#5344]), Chat components ([#5349]), the main sidebar ([#5373]), and Agent Settings ([#5345]). Numerous bug fixes addressed layout, padding, and theming issues, resulting in a more polished and professional user interface. Functional improvements included an auto-resizing chat input ([#5546]) and automatic V1 to V2 character conversion on import ([#5536]).\n\n-   **Core Architecture & Stability:** The framework's foundation was strengthened with several key changes. A major migration from Node.js's `EventEmitter` to Bun's native `EventTarget` API was completed to improve performance and runtime compatibility ([#5609], [#5614]). A new feature introduced standardized service interfaces and a `getServicesByType()` method, enhancing modularity ([#5565]). A critical new capability for **action chaining** was implemented, allowing for more complex, sequential agent behaviors ([#5436]). Stability was further improved by fixing an advisory lock bug in the SQL plugin ([#5572]) and removing redundant middleware ([#5384]).\n\n-   **Testing, CI/CD, and Code Quality:** Developer infrastructure saw significant investment. A new `@elizaos/test-utils` package was created to centralize mock utilities and streamline testing ([#5507]). The release workflow was stabilized to fix Lerna publishing failures ([#5467]), and automated code quality analysis workflows using Claude were introduced to monitor the codebase for issues like dead code, type safety, and security vulnerabilities ([#5532], [#5543]).\n\n-   **Documentation Improvements:** A major documentation overhaul was completed, establishing separate tracks for \"simple users\" and \"developers\" to improve accessibility ([#5401]). The accuracy of the REST API documentation was improved to match the server implementation ([#5380]), and JSDoc comments were corrected throughout the core package ([#5414]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue tracking this month reflected the intense development pace, with a focus on resolving user-reported bugs while laying the groundwork for future features.\n\n-   **Closed Issues:** A large volume of issues were resolved, demonstrating strong maintainer responsiveness. Key resolutions include:\n    -   **CLI & Setup:** The migration of CLI input methods to `@clack/prompts` was completed ([#5295]). Critical bugs causing `elizaos start` to crash or not build the project were fixed ([#5161], [#5497]). The long-standing issue of plugins failing to load on Windows was addressed ([#5407]).\n    -   **UI/UX:** Numerous UI bugs related to the redesign were fixed, and the review of the \"Actions\" tab (renamed to \"Model Calls\") was completed ([#5377]).\n    -   **Tools:** The v1 to v2 character migrator tool was finalized and closed ([#5452]).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:** Several critical discussions and problem areas emerged:\n    -   **Twitter Plugin Instability:** This is the most significant ongoing challenge. Multiple issues ([#31], [#36], [#38], [#39]) detail persistent problems, including client initialization errors, database insertion failures after authentication, and aggressive API rate-limiting (429 errors). The community is actively discussing whether paid Twitter API tiers are now a requirement for the plugin to function.\n    -   **Windows Compatibility:** Despite some fixes, Windows remains a source of user-reported issues, including failures to load specific plugins like `plugin-local-ai` ([#5499], [#5530]) and errors during agent creation related to directory paths ([#5603], [#5616]).\n    -   **Future Architecture:** New issues were opened to scope out a powerful **Scenario Runner** feature ([#5573]-[#5579]), indicating a future direction towards more robust agent evaluation. Discussions on agent-to-agent communication ([#5584]) and custom plugin schema migrations ([#5588]) also highlight areas of active architectural evolution.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nJuly saw vibrant collaboration between maintainers and the user community. The high volume of daily PRs and issue resolutions points to a very active core team. A notable dynamic is the extensive use of an AI assistant, \"Claude,\" which was instrumental in analyzing complex issues ([#4720]), providing detailed troubleshooting guides for users ([#5482]), and automating code quality checks ([#5438]).\n\nCommunity engagement was particularly high around troubleshooting difficult issues like the Twitter plugin problems ([#31], [#38]) and deployment strategies ([#5244]), where users shared logs, workarounds, and experiences. This collaborative debugging process is crucial for hardening the framework in real-world scenarios. The rapid closure of many user-reported bugs demonstrates a healthy feedback loop and a commitment to supporting the growing user base.", "2025-07-23T06:16:41.688Z"]

A comprehensive analysis by Claude verified that all documented endpoints are properly implemented and the server is production-ready. Recommendations include checking server health, reviewing logs, testing authentication, verifying environment variables, and enabling debug logging.\n\n### Twitter Plugin Client Initialization and Deprecation Warnings ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/31), [#32](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/32))\nUsers are reporting \"Client Initialization Error\" after successful authentication with the Twitter plugin, preventing agents from running autonomously on Twitter. This issue seems to persist even with newer versions of ElizaOS. Additionally, the `fetchSearchTweets` method is deprecated, and users are encountering errors related to this, suggesting the system is calling an old method. The latest `plugin-twitter` version 1.0.14 was expected to fix some issues, but new errors related to database inserts are now appearing.\n\n### CLI Input Method Consistency ([#5295](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5295))\nThe ongoing discussion focuses on standardizing CLI input methods to use `@clack/prompts` for consistency, moving away from a mix of `inquirer` and Bun's global `prompt()`. A pull request ([#5359](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5359)) is under review to address this.", "2025-07-23T06:12:42.234Z"]

The project saw the introduction of major new agent capabilities, including action chaining for complex sequential tasks and a new forms plugin. Concurrently, a massive effort was dedicated to improving the Command Line Interface (CLI), stabilizing the CI/CD pipeline, and implementing automated code quality analysis workflows. Numerous critical bug fixes were deployed, resolving long-standing platform compatibility issues, particularly on Windows, and improving overall application stability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week spanned new features, significant refactoring, and critical bug fixes across the entire stack.\n\n- **New Agent Capabilities:**\n  - A major feature, **action chaining**, was implemented, allowing agents to execute complex, sequential behaviors by storing and passing action states and return values ([#5436]).\n  - A new **forms plugin** was introduced to provide a foundational service for other plugins to build interactive forms, complete with database persistence and validation ([#5487]).\n  - Agents can now generate images based on conversational context with the new `generateImageAction` ([#5446]).\n  - A crucial character management feature was added for **automatic V1 to V2 character conversion** during JSON import, simplifying user migration ([#5536]).\n\n- **CLI Stability and User Experience:**\n  - The CLI underwent a significant overhaul to improve reliability and usability. Fixes were implemented for SPA routing in globally installed instances ([#5479]), path normalization to resolve Windows command failures ([#5437]), and preventing unintended file creation by the `update` command ([#5427]).\n  - The user experience was refined with cleaner console output using spinners ([#5431]) and by replacing `execa` with `bun.Spawn` for better logging and error detection ([#5531]).\n\n- **Automated Code Quality and CI/CD:**\n  - A new unified `configs` package was introduced to centralize ESLint, TSConfig, and Prettier configurations, ensuring consistency across the monorepo ([#5508]).\n  - The release workflow was stabilized by fixing Lerna publish failures ([#5467]) and ensuring the client UI displays the correct version post-release ([#5461]).\n  - Automation was significantly enhanced with a Claude-driven workflow for code review ([#5519]) and the automated creation of detailed code quality issues from daily analysis scans ([#5543], [#5544]).\n\n- **Platform Compatibility and Core Bug Fixes:**\n  - Several critical bugs were resolved, including an issue preventing plugin loading on Windows with Bun ([#5416]), a server error caused by a duplicate body parser ([#5458]), and incorrect message processing when a sender's name included \"DM\" ([#5426]).\n  - Client-side stability was improved by downgrading a Vite plugin to fix build issues ([#5424]) and resolving React hydration errors ([#5475]).\n\n- **Documentation and Testing Infrastructure:**\n  - Documentation was significantly improved with the introduction of a two-track system for users and developers ([#5401]) and enhanced TypeScript safety in the Docusaurus configuration ([#5418]).\n  - To improve testability and reduce redundancy, a new `@elizaos/test-utils` package was created to centralize mock runtime utilities for use across the project ([#5507]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  - Several significant bugs were resolved and closed this week. A persistent issue causing plugins to fail on Windows was fixed ([#5407]), as was a server crash related to missing Telegram tokens ([#5432]). The long-standing Twitter client authentication failure was also confirmed fixed in the 1.2.0 update ([#36]). Additionally, numerous issues generated by the new automated code quality analysis were processed and closed, indicating a rapid response to identified technical debt ([#5542], [#5545], [#5549]).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  - The new automated code quality workflow surfaced several critical new issues, including a potential **SQL Injection Vulnerability** ([#5542]), missing test coverage for core functionality ([#5551]), and significant dead code ([#5554]). These represent a focused effort to systematically address technical debt.\n  - A key new feature proposal was opened to create a **rate-limited Eliza hosted LLM and embedding endpoint** ([#5438]), which saw immediate and active discussion, including the completion of a Proof of Concept.\n  - Active discussions continue around platform-specific problems, such as the `plugin-local-ai` failing to load on Windows ([#5499], [#5530]), and ongoing Twitter API rate limit problems ([#38]), with community members investigating whether paid Twitter API tiers are now a requirement.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThis week highlighted a strong push towards AI-assisted development and maintenance. The frequent mention of \"Claude\" in relation to code reviews, issue triage, and proof-of-concept development ([#5438]) demonstrates a deep integration of AI into the project's workflow. The rapid cycle of automated issue creation and closure on July 11th showcases a highly efficient, automated system for maintaining code health. Community engagement remains strong, with users actively troubleshooting platform-specific issues like the Windows plugin failures ([#5499]) and sharing findings on external service changes, such as the Twitter API rate limits ([#38]).", "2025-07-23T06:15:02.875Z"]

Additionally, a bug affecting advisory lock acquisition in the SQL plugin was fixed, enhancing database operation reliability ([#5572](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5572)). Core tests were also updated to streamline workflows, improve configuration management, and enhance local AI support, including replacing `execa` and `local-ai` with `bun` runtime and Ollama ([#5556](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5556)).\n\n### CLI Improvements and User Experience\nThe CLI received several important updates to refine user interaction and command execution. A fix was deployed to suppress redundant \"update available\" messages during the `update` command execution, providing a cleaner user experience ([#5567](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5567)). CLI test expectations were updated for version 1.2.1, specifically addressing monorepo detection in update command tests ([#5561](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5561)).\n\n### Claude Workflow and Automation Enhancements\nClaude's integration and automation capabilities were significantly enhanced. A new feature was added to allow Claude code review workflows to run on every commit to PRs, not just on open/ready states. Furthermore, both Claude workflows were granted full bash and GitHub CLI command access, expanding automation possibilities ([#5570](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5570)). Related refactoring was performed to clarify and robustify plugin ordering tests ([#5557](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5557)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#5571](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5571) fix(cli): improve plugin dependency loading and deduplication\n- [#5569](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5569) feat: implement advisory locking for DatabaseMigrationService\n- [#5568](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5568) fix(plugin-bootstrap): separate provider state from action callbacks to prevent ATTACHMENTS interference\n- [#5566](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5566) feat: Add ElizaNet LiteLLM fallback mechanism POC\n- [#5563](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5563) feat: implement customizable logger configuration for downstream projects\n- [#5560](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5560) fix: core test failures\n- [#5558](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5558) \ud83d\udcdd CodeRabbit Chat: Add verification script and refactor character-plugin-ordering tests with constants\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Resolved Build and Startup Issues\nSeveral issues related to the build process and application startup were closed. This includes a fix for `tsup` wiping `vite` builds ([#5555](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5555)), and addressing the `elizaos start` command not always building the project ([#5497](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5497)). The problem of `elizaos start` crashing after accessing localhost:3000 on Windows was also resolved ([#5161](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5161)).\n\n### CLI and Plugin Functionality Fixes\nMultiple issues impacting CLI and plugin functionality were addressed. This includes fixing the CLI's incorrect requirement for a monorepo root for standalone projects ([#5142](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5142)), and resolving the \"unable to register again\" error when testing default plugins ([#4996](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4996)). The issue of the CLI not loading/registering dependencies from plugins was also closed ([#4997](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4997)).\n\n### Versioning and API Endpoint Corrections\nIssues related to versioning discrepancies and API endpoint availability were resolved. This includes fixing the web client showing an incorrect version ([#4924](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4924), [#4023](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4023)), and verifying that server API endpoints are fully functional, with previous 404 errors likely due to configuration issues ([#5230](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5230)).\n\n### Miscellaneous Bug Fixes and Deprecations\nVarious other bugs and issues were closed, including the suppression of update notifications during the update command ([#5447](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5447)), and type errors in the Knowledge Plugin after updating to eliza-1.2.0 ([#5518](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5518)). The `plugin-local-ai` failing to load on Windows was addressed, with a note on deprecating the plugin in favor of Ollama ([#5499](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5499), [#5530](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5530)). Issues with specific plugins like GOAT were also closed, noting their migration ([#4298](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4298)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Scenario Runner Development\nSeveral new issues were opened to outline the development of a new scenario runner feature. This includes adding an `elizaos scenario run` command ([#5573](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5573)), implementing YAML parsing and validation for scenarios ([#5574](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5574)), and integrating with `@elizaos/plugin-e2b` for sandboxed execution ([#5576](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5576)). Further issues cover implementing a local environment provider ([#5575](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5575)), a mock engine for service calls ([#5577](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5577)), an evaluation engine with basic evaluators ([#5578](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5578)), and final judgment and user-facing reports ([#5579](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5579)).\n\n### CLI and Workflow Permissions\nA new issue was created to address a bug where Cmd + C on `elizaos dev` server doesn't kill the server process ([#5559](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5559)). Another issue was opened and quickly closed regarding giving bash permissions to the Claude code workflow ([#5564](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5564)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### V3 Goals and Backward Compatibility ([#4720](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4720))\nDiscussion continues on the V3 goals, with Claude providing a detailed analysis of each goal's feasibility and backward compatibility. The analysis confirms that most V3 goals, such as replacing `IDatabaseAdapter` with `IDatabaseService`, adding MongoDB/in-memory adapters, enhanced testing, and self-learning agents, are backward compatible.

The `elizaos start` command now automatically builds the project before starting the server, mirroring the `dev` command's behavior ([#5504](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5504)). Additionally, graceful shutdown for the `elizaos dev` server on `Cmd+C` (SIGINT/SIGTERM) was implemented, preventing orphaned processes ([#5562](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5562)). A related fix addressed the usage of the auto-build test flag ([#5581](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5581)).\n\n### Core Type Safety and Testing Enhancements\nSignificant work was done to improve the robustness of the core library. This included addressing type safety and testing issues that arose from a previous PR, specifically adding comprehensive tests for the `asUUID()` function and planning types, and refining error handling ([#5580](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5580)).\n\n### Provider Mapping Updates\nA chore task was completed to map the `llama_local` provider in v1 to `@elizaos/plugin-ollama`, streamlining provider integration ([#5582](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5582)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#5585](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5585) Sync develop into develop devel\n- [#5583](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5583) [DRAFT] Docker Infrastructure Enhancement Proposal\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### CLI Server Shutdown Fix\nThe issue where `Cmd + C` on the `elizaos dev` server did not kill the server process has been resolved ([#5559](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5559)). The fix involved implementing proper signal handling to stop the dev server before process exit, importing `stopServer` for cleanup, and replacing immediate `process.exit` with a graceful shutdown function.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Agent-to-Agent Communication Challenges\nA new issue was opened regarding forwarding messages between agents without polling, specifically for a Blockchain Agent and a Support Agent ([#5584](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5584)). The user seeks help with direct agent-to-agent communication.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Custom Plugin Callback Interference\nDiscussion continues on the issue where a custom plugin's callback is getting replaced by the `ATTACHMENTS` provider ([#4947](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/4947)). The latest comment from tcm390 suggests checking if the agent is calling back the action's `responseContent` and if a `GENERATE_IMAGE` action is already defined in the bootstrap, potentially causing the agent to use a default action instead of the custom one. Previous analysis by Claude confirmed this as a valid issue, identifying the root cause in the message handler flow where the `ATTACHMENTS` provider modifies the state before it's passed to action callbacks. Claude also proposed an immediate fix to separate provider state composition from action callback processing.\n\n### Twitter Client Initialization Errors\nUsers are still reporting issues with Twitter Client Initialization Errors when creating or starting agents using the Twitter plugin ([#31](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/31)). Multiple users, including joaoCarvalho1000 and yasir23, confirmed experiencing the same problem. RolandOne noted that the latest `plugin-twitter` (1.0.14) should fix it but reported a new error related to database insertion. Ovodo questioned if this means autonomous Twitter agents are currently unfeasible, while nccuong-vikki suggested it might be due to limited features of free subscriptions preventing access to the Home Timeline.", "2025-07-23T06:13:02.702Z"]

The contributor data pipeline was enhanced to support multi-repository aggregation, enabling a more holistic view of user contributions across the ElizaOS ecosystem. Development also focused on improving data ingestion efficiency, notably by implementing batched GraphQL requests for wallet addresses to mitigate rate limiting. Alongside these foundational improvements, the team addressed critical bugs in deployment workflows and agent plugin functionality, ensuring greater system stability and reliability.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on scaling and hardening the core data pipelines and deployment processes.\n\n- **Contributor Data Pipeline Overhaul:** A major effort was made to enhance the contributor data system. The pipelines were upgraded to aggregate user scores and summaries across multiple repositories, moving beyond a single-repo view ([#137](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/137)). This was supported by several optimizations, including a new pipeline for ingesting wallet addresses ([#132](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/132)), significantly faster ingestion speeds via batched requests ([#134](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/134)), and the removal of redundant wallet caching logic ([#135](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/135)). The `githubService` was also refactored into the main `github.ts` class to centralize data fetching logic ([#132](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/132)).\n\n- **Deployment and Workflow Reliability:** A critical bug in the deployment workflow triggers was fixed, ensuring deployments initiate correctly ([#136](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/136)). To bolster the recent pipeline enhancements, a new pull request was opened to add comprehensive unit tests for key modules, aiming to improve long-term code reliability ([#138](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/pull/138)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nThe team resolved critical bugs while also engaging in discussions on future architectural improvements and persistent plugin issues.\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n    - **Plugin Configuration:** A \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_EMBEDDING\" error was resolved by ensuring the required OpenAI plugin is included in the agent character file ([#5279](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5279)).\n    - **Data Fetching Process:** The process of fetching wallet addresses was successfully migrated from the NextJS build process into the main data pipelines, resolving a key operational issue ([#130](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/130)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - **Scalability and Data Integrity:** Discussions are ongoing about significant architectural changes. One key topic is reworking user identity management to use internal GitHub IDs instead of usernames to prevent \"split personality\" profiles when users change their names ([#105](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/105)). Another discussion addresses the need to increase the file size limit for agent character files to prevent \"request entity too large\" errors ([#5268](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5268)).\n    - **Plugin Functionality:** Users continue to report challenges with custom plugins, where agents may stop processing after a single message ([#5260](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/5260)). The Twitter plugin is also facing issues with failing to post replies and incorrectly formatting newlines in responses ([#29](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/29), [#26](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/26)).\n    - **API & Messaging:** There is positive movement on the proposal to use webhooks for initiating messages as an alternative to polling. Recent comments suggest this is feasible by having plugins mount routes to the ElizaOS server, paving the way for a more efficient messaging system ([#6](https://github.com/elizaos/elizaos.github.io/issues/6)).\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe development activity this week demonstrates a highly coordinated effort, particularly around the data pipeline refactor.

The most significant development was a major refactoring of the logging system, migrating from Pino to Adze to resolve critical compatibility issues with Bun's binary compilation process. This work was carefully executed to maintain API compatibility and avoid breaking changes. Additionally, a new issue was raised concerning the project's smart contract, highlighting that it is based on an outdated version and will require future updates.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\n- **Build System Compatibility & Logging Refactor**\n  To resolve `pino-pretty` errors encountered during `bun export` builds, a migration from the Pino logger to Adze was initiated and completed at the code level ([#5673](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/5673)). The `ElizaLogger` class was rewritten using Adze while preserving the existing pino-compatible API, ensuring zero breaking changes for the 182 files that depend on it. Key features such as custom log levels, Sentry integration, and agent context binding were successfully maintained. The migration is now pending final verification via `bun install`, `bun test`, and `bun build`.\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:**\n  Based on the available reports, no issues were closed this week.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  A significant new issue was opened regarding the project's smart contract ([#521](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/521)). It notes that the current Autofun contract is based on an old version of the Pumpfun smart contract and is missing key features, such as a global vault, present in the newer version.\n\n  The most active issue this week was the Pino to Adze logger migration ([#5673](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/5673)). Discussion confirmed that the code migration is complete, with focus now shifting to the final verification and testing phase.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was focused within the active issue for the logger migration ([#5673](https://github.com/elizaos/auto.fun/issues/5673)). A detailed update from contributor \"claude\" outlined the status of the migration, its non-breaking nature, and the next steps required for completion, keeping the team aligned on the progress of this critical infrastructure task.", "2025-07-26T23:09:50.950Z"]

Core infrastructure improvements were also made with the introduction of a Hono server and agent registry refactoring.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Agent Capabilities and API Compliance\nSignificant progress was made in expanding agent functionality and ensuring robust API compliance. A new character type system was introduced, including the \"JesseXBT\" character, improving API consistency ([#5756](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5756)). The chat completions API now supports visibility of intermediate tool calls and results while maintaining full OpenAI API compliance ([#5755](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5755)).\n\n### Core Infrastructure and EVM Integration\nThe agent management system received a major overhaul with the addition of a Hono server and refactoring of the ElizaOS agent registry, enabling interaction with agents via an OpenAI-compatible API ([#5753](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5753)). A new EVM plugin was integrated, providing wallet and blockchain tooling, including services for managing EVM chains and clients, and tools for interacting with wallets ([#5752](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5752)).\n\n### Development Workflow Improvements\nA bug fix was implemented in the project-starter template, resolving failing component tests by replacing `mock.module` with `spyOn` for consistent logger testing ([#5748](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5748)). Additionally, efforts were made to standardize import paths, with a temporary revert to relative paths ([#5750](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5750)) followed by a move towards using `@/` aliases and barrels for improved import consistency and a new Cursor rule ([#5751](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5751)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\nNo issues were closed today.\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Agent Testing and Plugin Reliability\nTwo new critical issues were opened today. One addresses the need for runtime method mocking to enable deterministic agent testing, particularly for LLM interactions, which is currently lacking in ElizaOS scenario testing ([#5749](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5749)). The other highlights a critical bug where the `elizaos publish --npm` command falsely reports successful plugin publishing despite actual failures (404 errors) to npm ([#5754](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5754)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Build Failure in `@elizaos/core`\nIssue [#5738](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5738) regarding a build failure in `@elizaos/core` preventing `bun run clean` from succeeding due to TypeScript errors remains active. The latest comment from jkbrooks at 2025-08-11T14:56:01Z asks for an update on whether the issue has been resolved, suggesting it should be closed if fixed. This issue was previously identified as blocking testing of complex scenarios, including advanced mocking, natural language agent interaction, and dynamic plugin loading.\n\n### `startAgent` CLI Command Hanging\nIssue [#5719](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5719) concerning the `startAgent` CLI command hanging, both when `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` is omitted and when it's included, is still active. The latest comment from jkbrooks at 2025-08-11T14:54:57Z also asks for an update on its resolution. Previous analysis by Claude identified the `@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap` as critical infrastructure, and its absence or improper loading as the primary cause of the hanging. Actionable items proposed include automatically adding the bootstrap plugin, adding timeouts to plugin loading, improving debug logging, simplifying import strategy chains, and making the bootstrap plugin mandatory with clear validation and error messages. The core issue is that `startAgent` needs to either always include the bootstrap plugin or fail fast with a clear error if it's missing.", "2025-08-12T23:09:22.721Z"]

The other focuses on analyzing options for the MCP Gateway, including adding MCP servers and an x402 layer ([#5814](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5814)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Dynamic Prompting Implementation for ElizaOS Scenarios ([#5819](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5819))\nDiscussion on this issue is highly active, with a detailed implementation plan already proposed. Key points include:\n- **Schema Extensions:** New Zod schemas are proposed for `ConversationConfig`, `ConversationLengthEvaluationSchema`, `ConversationFlowEvaluationSchema`, `UserSatisfactionEvaluationSchema`, and `ContextRetentionEvaluationSchema`. These extend existing schemas to support multi-turn conversation parameters and evaluation metrics.\n- **Type Definitions:** New TypeScript interfaces are defined for `UserSimulatorConfig`, `TerminationCondition`, `ConversationConfig`, `ConversationTurn`, `ConversationResult`, and `SimulationContext` to structure the data models for dynamic prompting.\n- **User Simulator Implementation:** A `UserSimulator` class is outlined, responsible for generating user responses based on a defined persona, objective, and conversation history. It leverages `AgentRuntime` to interact with language models.\n- **Conversation Manager Implementation:** A `ConversationManager` class is detailed, orchestrating the multi-turn conversation flow. It manages turns, integrates the `UserSimulator`, handles termination conditions, and runs turn-level and final evaluations.\n- **Configuration Examples:** Examples of basic and advanced multi-turn conversation configurations in YAML are provided, demonstrating how to define user personas, objectives, termination conditions, and various evaluation types.", "2025-08-26T23:09:30.489Z"]

Build warnings and CSS syntax errors were resolved, and bundle size warnings were addressed ([#5851](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5851)). A new workflow for alpha NPM releases was also added to improve deployment reliability and quality control ([#5863](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5863)).\n\n### Chat UI and Plugin Functionality\nThe chat UI now displays the action called and its result in real-time, providing enhanced tool visualization ([#5865](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5865)). Additionally, a bug preventing image generation in Discord channels was fixed, enabling this feature for users ([#5861](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5861)).\n\n### Docker Integration for Project Starters\nMinor improvements were made to Docker-related files in `project-tee-starter`, including adding `DOCKER_IMAGE` to `.env.example` ([#5859](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5859)). Dockerization was also added to `project-starter`, allowing users to develop locally, create Docker images, and deploy to cloud providers ([#5858](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/5858)).

The latest comments propose a clear distinction of responsibilities:\n- **Server package (`@eliza/server`)**: Responsible for agent lifecycle, plugin loading, database management, character loading, and central configuration.\n- **CLI (`@eliza/cli`)**: Acts as a remote control, delegating to the server for commands like `start` and `dev`, with no business logic.\n- **Starter projects**: Handle composition root (plugins, characters, config) and minimal bootstrapping code.\n\nThere's a consensus that moving logic out of the CLI is beneficial, but concerns were raised about replicating functions across projects if too much logic is moved into the starters. A progress update outlined the current state: projects now own their runtime, the CLI delegates startup, arguments are passed through, and project logs stream directly.

Additionally, progress was made on moving to a pure core, ensuring its functionality and preparing for browser support and streaming ([#5766](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5766)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\nNo new issues were reported today.\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Plugin Publishing Visibility\nDiscussion continues on the issue of a successfully published plugin not being visible in the PR ([#5813](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5813)). The user confirmed publishing `plugin-delta@0.1.0` to NPM using `elizaos publish --npm`. However, the plugin is not appearing in the registry's pull requests. A core team member clarified that the `--npm` flag only publishes to NPM and bypasses the registry and GitHub steps. They advised the user to remove the registry clone from their organization, re-run `elizaos publish` without the `--npm` flag, and be aware of potential naming conflicts if the package already exists on NPM. The user has since created a PR to the registry.\n\n### Clarifying Rate Limiting Documentation\nThe issue regarding clarifying documentation about the Basic Tier requirement to avoid rate limiting errors ([#40](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/40)) saw an update. A rate limiter has been implemented to only request posts if the monthly read limit has not been reached, addressing the concern about excessive API calls.", "2025-09-04T23:09:26.964Z"]

Significant effort was dedicated to improving the Command Line Interface (CLI), particularly by resolving cross-platform compatibility issues on Windows and refining the update notification mechanism. Key plugins and project templates received critical fixes, while CI/CD workflows were optimized for better efficiency. The team also wrapped up preparations for the ETH Tokyo Workshop, clearing the way for new technical initiatives, including a proposed major cleanup of the core build system.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on hardening existing systems and improving reliability across the framework.\n\n- **CLI Stability and Cross-Platform Improvements:** A major push was made to enhance the CLI's robustness. This included comprehensive fixes for Windows CI tests, such as resolving issues with file paths and process management ([#5982], [#5981]). The `elizaos dev` command was also improved for better detection of client development servers in complex repository structures ([#5979]), and redundant migration steps during agent startup were addressed ([#5978]).\n\n- **Refined Update Mechanism and Build Process:** The CLI's update checker was fixed to correctly respect a user's distribution channel (e.g., stable, alpha), preventing inappropriate update prompts ([#5980]). The overall build process was strengthened through fixes for client bundling, dev-loop restarts, and stricter TypeScript type-checking to prevent builds with errors ([#5985]).\n\n- **Plugin and Template Fixes:** Several bugs impacting usability were resolved. An issue preventing images from the OpenRouter plugin from displaying in the web client was fixed by transforming file paths to API URLs ([#5890]). The SQL plugin received a missing `uuid` dependency ([#5977]), and project starter templates were updated to allow JSON imports, fixing a common compilation failure ([#5975]).\n\n- **CI/CD Enhancements:** To improve resource management and ensure code reviews are always current, concurrency control was added to the Claude code review workflow. This change automatically cancels previous runs when new commits are pushed to a pull request ([#5984]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nIssue management this week saw the resolution of key tasks and the introduction of significant new technical debt cleanup efforts.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** The primary task completed was the preparation for the ETH Tokyo Workshop ([#5955]), marking the end of that initiative. The issue of users on stable channels receiving update notifications for alpha versions ([#5971]) was also addressed and fixed.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - **Core Refactor:** A significant new issue was opened to undertake a full cleanup of the `/core` package, aiming to remove all hacks and forks, deliver a pure JS/TS build, and validate it across Node, Bun, and browser environments ([#5976]).\n    - **Documentation:** A new task was created to integrate the `build.eliza` page into the main documentation ([#5974]).\n    - **Ongoing Bugs:** A long-standing error (\"Failed query: insert into 'memories'\") when using the Twitter plugin with a SQL database ([#39]) remains active, with users continuing to report the problem and maintainers requesting details to reproduce it.\n    - **Community Discussion:** A debate continues in [#5857] regarding the perceived lack of documentation for the Web UI dashboard, highlighting a disconnect between user experience and maintainer assertions.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nCollaboration this week was evident in the focused effort to tackle stability issues. The discussion around the alpha update notifications in [#5971] showed a quick feedback loop, with `standujar` acknowledging the issue and implementing a fix. Active user-maintainer dialogue was also visible in the ongoing Twitter/SQL bug ([#39]), where maintainers are actively trying to gather information from affected users. The debate over documentation in [#5857] indicates an engaged community that is vocal about user experience, providing valuable, albeit critical, feedback to the project maintainers.", "2025-09-17T23:10:54.816Z"]

A minor documentation typo was also fixed.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Enhanced Agent Responsiveness and Contextual Awareness\nSignificant updates were made to the core message flow logic, introducing a `mentionContext` interface and refining the `shouldRespond` logic. These changes aim to improve how the AI agent detects and responds to mentions, making it more platform-agnostic and intelligent in its decision-making. This is a medium-risk change affecting LLM decision-making. ([#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030))\n\n### Database Memory Pagination\nThe `getMemories` function now supports an optional `offset` parameter, enabling pagination for database-backed memory retrieval. This enhancement includes applying `limit`/`offset` in SQL queries and validating non-negative values, along with new integration tests to cover paging and edge cases. ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032))\n\n### Documentation Refinement\nA minor typo (\"Occassionally\" to \"Occasionally\") was corrected in the CLI scenario documentation.

They noted that downgrading to 1.5.15 or using versions newer than 1.6.1 resolved the problem. `0xbbjoker` suggested running `bun x tsc --noEmit` to diagnose the issue, believing it might be an IDE-specific TypeScript compiler problem. `matteo-brandolino` later provided the output of `bun x tsc --noEmit`, which confirmed 28 errors across 4 files, indicating that various core types and members like `logger`, `IAgentRuntime`, `Project`, and `Character` are not being exported or found.

Significant progress was also made in modernizing the Renovate configuration. Several core architectural issues were closed, indicating a push towards refining the framework's foundational elements.\n\n## KEY TECHNICAL DEVELOPMENTS\n\n### Build Process and Dependency Management Improvements\nEfforts were made to streamline the build process and enhance dependency management. A bug preventing test execution for the `@elizaos/service-interfaces` package was resolved by skipping tests for this types-only package, improving build efficiency and accuracy ([#6034](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6034)). Additionally, the Renovate configuration was modernized with a new preset for plugins, standardizing dependency updates and grouping rules for better maintainability ([#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033)).\n\n### Documentation and Link Maintenance\nDocumentation quality was improved by fixing an old and broken link within the CLI's README, ensuring users have access to accurate and up-to-date information ([#6047](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6047)).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\n- [#6050](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6050): This PR aims to fix old links to actual documentation.\n- [#6048](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6048): This PR introduces a new `MessageService` interface and its default implementation to the core.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Core Framework Refinements\nSeveral foundational issues related to the ElizaOS class and core API were closed, indicating significant progress in establishing the framework's programmatic entry point and lifecycle management. This includes defining the `ElizaOS` class skeleton with lifecycle methods and implementing bulk operations for agents ([#5905](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5905), [#5906](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5906)).\n\n### Message Bus and API Modernization\nA series of issues concerning the message bus and API redesign were closed, signifying a move towards a cleaner, class-based API. This involved replacing the complex bus with a simplified model, defining new `MessageBus` class methods, and modernizing the implementation by replacing Node EventEmitter with Bun\u2019s EventTarget ([#5916](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5916), [#5917](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5917), [#5918](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5918), [#5919](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5919), [#5920](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5920), [#5921](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5921)).\n\n### Configuration and Persistence Enhancements\nIssues related to defaults, validation, and state persistence were resolved. This includes ensuring global defaults are configurable, adding schema validation for agent configs, and implementing agent state persistence across restarts ([#5907](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5907), [#5908](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5908)).\n\n### Extensibility and Developer Experience\nImprovements to extensibility and developer experience were completed, such as providing orchestration hooks for custom lifecycle logic and consolidating duplicated database entities for rooms/channels/servers ([#5909](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5909), [#5931](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5931), [#5965](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5965)).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Cloud API Integration\nA new issue proposes implementing a unified Cloud API plugin to centralize API key management for framework-level LLM access, replacing current per-service plugins ([#6049](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6049)).\n\n### Configuration Defaults\nA new issue highlights a concern regarding the default port of 3000, suggesting the need for a different default port to avoid conflicts with other applications ([#6051](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6051)).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Imports Not Found in `index.ts` with Eliza CLI 1.61 ([#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031))\nThe discussion on this issue revolves around type errors when creating new projects with `elizaos create`, specifically concerning missing exports like `logger` and `IAgentRuntime` from `@elizaos/core`. The latest comments indicate that the type errors seem to be resolved after a clean reinstall, suggesting the issue might be related to node/package type resolution rather than a specific bug. A detailed diagnosis by \"claude\" confirmed that the problem was specific to version 1.6.1 of `@elizaos/core`, which was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files. The recommendation is for users to upgrade to `@elizaos/cli@1.6.2` or later, and for the ElizaOS team to consider yanking v1.6.1 and adding publish-time validation to prevent similar issues.

Key new features were introduced to enhance agent intelligence, including improved mention detection and paginated memory retrieval. Concurrently, the team engaged in a deep, collaborative investigation into a critical CLI bug, successfully identifying the root cause with the help of detailed user feedback and AI-assisted diagnostics. The overall theme was one of foundational stabilization and refinement, clearing technical debt while continuing to build more capable agent systems.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on solidifying the core framework, enhancing agent capabilities, and improving overall system stability.\n\n-   **Core Architecture & Modularity:**\n    A multi-phase effort to refactor the core architecture saw significant progress. The ElizaOS/Server was updated to incorporate new config and plugin modules ([#6037](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6037)), and agent identification was standardized to use UUIDs only, simplifying management ([#6036](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6036)). A new `MessageService` interface was also introduced to enhance inter-agent communication ([#6048](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6048)).\n\n-   **Agent Capabilities & Intelligence:**\n    Agent responsiveness was improved with a new `mentionContext` interface and refined `shouldRespond` logic, making mention detection more platform-agnostic ([#6030](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6030)). For long-term memory, the `getMemories` function now supports pagination via an `offset` parameter, allowing for more efficient data retrieval ([#6032](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6032)). Additionally, character schema validation was made more robust with comprehensive Zod schema definitions and detailed descriptions ([#6044](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6044), [#6043](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6043)).\n\n-   **Runtime Stability & Bug Fixes:**\n    Several critical bugs were addressed to improve stability. A fix was implemented to ensure the runtime database is initialized before tasks attempt to access it, preventing a race condition ([#6039](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6039)). Another fix corrected an issue preventing agent plugins from reloading properly after updates ([#6040](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6040)). The system now also performs robust validation of server port configurations ([#6046](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6046), [#6038](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6038)) and uses the correct ZodError API for issue handling in plugins ([#6035](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6035)).\n\n-   **Infrastructure & Developer Experience:**\n    The project's dependency management was streamlined by modernizing the Renovate configuration and adding a preset for plugins ([#6033](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6033)). The build process was optimized by skipping test execution for types-only packages like `@elizaos/service-interfaces` ([#6034](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6034)). Documentation was also improved by fixing broken links ([#6047](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6047), [#6050](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6050)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    A massive number of foundational issues were closed this week, signaling the completion of a major architectural overhaul. Key themes among the closed issues include:\n    -   **Core API & Message Bus Modernization:** A complete refactor of the message bus to a class-based API and the finalization of the `ElizaOS` programmatic entry point and lifecycle methods ([#5905](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5905), [#5916](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5916)-[#5921](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5921)).\n    -   **Browser Support:** The implementation of a browser database adapter using WASM PGLite and the wrap-up of full browser support was completed ([#5958](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5958), [#5964](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5964)).\n    -   **Core Cleanup & State Management:** A comprehensive core cleanup initiative was finished, along with work on state persistence, safe start mechanisms, and project serialization ([#5911](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5911), [#5908](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5908)).\n    -   **MCP Gateway & Partner Integration:** Work related to the MCP Gateway and partner plugin integration was finalized ([#5814](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5814), [#5969](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5969)).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   The most significant active issue was **[#6031](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6031) (Imports not found in index.ts with Eliza CLI 1.6.1)**. A detailed investigation, driven by user `matteo-brandolino` and analyzed by the AI assistant `claude`, concluded that `@elizaos/core@1.6.1` was published with missing or malformed TypeScript declaration files. The team has acknowledged the diagnosis, and the recommended user action is to upgrade to a newer version of the CLI.\n    -   Two notable new issues were opened proposing future work: **[#6049](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6049)** suggests creating a unified Cloud API plugin to centralize API key management, and **[#6051](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6051)** requests changing the default server port from 3000 to avoid common conflicts.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThis week highlighted strong collaboration between the community and the development team.

Additionally, evaluators now run asynchronously in the background with robust error handling, and the bootstrap message flow triggers evaluator execution non-blockingly [#6066](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6066).\n\n### API and Memory Management Improvements\nA bug in the memory viewer was fixed, correctly distinguishing user and agent messages by converting `channelId` to an agent-unique `roomId` and utilizing `entityId` in memory types [#6067](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6067).\n\n### CLI and Plugin Development Workflow Fixes\nSeveral issues related to plugin documentation and scaffolding were addressed. This included fixing template lookup paths, correcting CLI command syntax in various README files, and updating agent lifecycle and help messages [#6071](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6071). A misleading comment in the `MessageBusService` callback was also corrected [#6072](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6072).\n\n### Core Logic Refactoring\nCharacter builder logic, previously duplicated, has been moved to the core package, centralizing business logic and removing redundant code from the server, accompanied by 27 new tests [#6069](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6069).\n\n## NEWLY OPENED PULL REQUESTS\nNo new pull requests were opened today.\n\n## CLOSED ISSUES\n\n### Documentation and Scaffolding Rectified\nA critical issue regarding incorrect plugin documentation and scaffolding was swiftly addressed and closed [#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6070). The fix involved correcting template lookup paths and CLI command syntax across multiple documentation files.\n\n### Framework Consistency and Stability\nSeveral issues related to framework consistency and stability were closed, including efforts to ensure CLI and server respect ElizaOS defaults, consolidate duplicated helpers, and enforce consistent logging [#5934](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5934).\n\n### Feature Implementations Completed\nWork on enhancing the `plugin-autocoder` for the classified game was completed [#5685](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5685). Additionally, the integration of Eigen TEE as a deployment option was finalized [#5986](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/5986), and a unified Cloud API plugin for framework LLMs was implemented [#6049](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6049).\n\n## NEW ISSUES\n\n### Logging Standardization\nA new issue has been opened to standardize the logging system across all packages (Core, CLI, and Server) to ensure a consistent developer experience and improved observability [#6073](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6073).\n\n## ACTIVE ISSUES\n\n### Multi-Repository Support\nThe issue for multi-repository support [#108](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/108) was closed today, with a comment from `madjin` confirming that multi-repo tracking is now working. This marks a significant milestone in expanding the framework's capabilities.\n\n### Awesome Claude Code Feature\nThe issue [#149](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/149), announcing the project's feature in Awesome Claude Code, was closed today with a positive comment from `madjin`.", "2025-10-18T23:11:33.196Z"]

The decision was based on a review of the codebase, revealing that the GitHub client already incorporates a sophisticated rate-limiting system. This system includes a token bucket, automatic throttling, and mechanisms to prevent rate limit exhaustion and handle secondary rate limits. The proposed enhancement was deemed redundant, as the existing system actively prevents the problem rather than just estimating it, and would add unnecessary complexity and potential user anxiety.\n\n### Graceful Shutdown for CLI Pipeline ([#155](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-knowledge/issues/155))\nThis issue, suggesting the implementation of a graceful shutdown for the CLI pipeline, was also closed by madjin. Further analysis indicated that the pipeline already handles interruptions gracefully. Progress is automatically saved to the SQLite database, and re-running the command resumes processing from where it left off, skipping already-processed data. The proposed graceful shutdown was considered a UX polish rather than a functional improvement, violating the YAGNI principle by adding complexity for a problem that is already sufficiently addressed.", "2025-10-19T23:12:43.392Z"]

A major documentation overhaul was completed, addressing long-standing gaps. However, the dependency cleanup introduced a critical CLI installation bug, and important community feedback highlighted significant friction in the plugin developer experience, which is now under active review.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week focused on maturing the core services, improving the developer experience, and enhancing client-side functionality.\n\n-   **Core Framework & Agent Runtime:**\n    -   Modularity was improved with the introduction of a new `MessageService` interface ([#6048]) and by making the embedding service optional to optimize resource usage ([#6075]).\n    -   Agent intelligence was enhanced by allowing plugins to access action results ([#6081]) and by ensuring the agent's `thought` is consistently included in action completion events for better observability ([#6083], [#6084]).\n    -   The `develop` branch merge ([#6078]) formally integrated these changes alongside a new `generateText` API and a unified server startup process.\n\n-   **CLI and Developer Experience:**\n    -   To simplify the toolchain, Anthropic Claude dependencies and related AI-powered code generation features were removed from the CLI ([#6087]).\n    -   A key bug was fixed in the project scaffolding tool, which now correctly includes dotfiles like `.gitignore` in new projects ([#6080]).\n    -   Server setup was made more flexible with the addition of port autodiscovery ([#6082]).\n\n-   **Client-Side & API Enhancements:**\n    -   A major feature was added with the integration of Streamdown, enabling modern, streaming AI response rendering on the client ([#6082]).\n    -   A bug in the session API was fixed to correctly include the `channelId` in responses, ensuring reliable WebSocket connections ([#6079]).\n    -   API types were refined for clarity, replacing `Agent.description` with `bio` ([#6085]).\n\n-   **Code Quality & Maintenance:**\n    -   A comprehensive code formatting pass using Prettier/ESLint was completed across the entire codebase to enforce style consistency and improve maintainability ([#6077]).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n-   **Closed Issues:**\n    -   **Documentation Overhaul:** A significant effort to improve project documentation concluded, with the closure of numerous issues related to core docs expansion ([#5938]), developer guides ([#5939]), release processes ([#5936]), and learning aids ([#5940]).\n    -   **Build & Scaffolding Fixes:** Several long-standing problems were resolved, including a critical build failure in `@elizaos/core` ([#5738]), a logger compatibility issue during builds ([#5673]), and the bug preventing dotfile creation in new projects ([#6074]).\n\n-   **New & Active Issues:**\n    -   **Critical Bug:** The removal of Claude dependencies introduced a breaking change, causing CLI installation to fail with a `Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'` error ([#6088]). This is the highest priority issue to address.\n    -   **Developer Experience Feedback:** A crucial discussion is ongoing in [#6070], where a user detailed significant frustration with the plugin documentation and scaffolding process. The feedback highlights \"endless issues\" and \"bad documentation\" as major barriers to entry, prompting direct engagement from the maintenance team to diagnose and fix the root causes.\n    -   **Future Work:** New issues were opened to plan for a dedicated API/SDK documentation section ([#6090]), propose a new DevTools server ([#6092]), and address various UI/UX improvements ([#6086], [#6089]).\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe most significant community interaction this week occurred in issue [#6070], where user @ryanmstokes provided candid, critical feedback on the developer onboarding experience. The constructive response from maintainer @yungalgo, who requested specific details to help resolve the problems, exemplifies the project's commitment to addressing community pain points. The rapid reporting of the CLI installation bug ([#6088]) immediately following the dependency refactor ([#6087]) also demonstrates an engaged user base actively testing the latest changes.", "2025-10-22T23:10:21.500Z"]

Key updates include the creation of a centralized \"Launch Resources\" page and renaming the API Reference to \"REST Reference\" for better consistency ([#75](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/75), [#76](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/76)). A significant issue with plugin scaffolding documentation was resolved, leveraging an AI agent to correct template paths and CLI commands ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6070)). However, a new high-priority bug has been identified that prevents the CLI from running after a standard npm installation ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6088)).\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on restructuring and refining the documentation to improve the developer experience.\n\n- **Content Centralization and Naming Consistency:** To provide builders with a single source of truth, a new \"Launch Resources\" page was created, consolidating forms and information previously hosted on `build.elizaos.ai`. An old, unused page was also removed to streamline the site ([#76](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/76)). For better clarity and alignment with standard conventions, the \"API Reference\" was renamed to \"REST Reference\" across the documentation, fulfilling a request from ticket ELIZA-714 ([#75](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/pull/75)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n- **Closed Issues:** A critical issue regarding faulty plugin documentation was resolved ([#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6070)). After a user reported significant frustration with plugin scaffolding, an AI agent (Claude) was used to identify and fix several underlying problems, including incorrect template paths and CLI command syntax in README files. The fix ensures users can now successfully scaffold plugins by following the updated documentation.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** A new, potentially blocking issue was reported that prevents the elizaOS CLI from running after a standard npm installation ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6088)). The error, `Cannot find module '@anthropic-ai/claude-code'`, appears to stem from a bundling problem in the published npm package, as building the CLI from source resolves the dependency correctly. This is a high-priority bug for new user onboarding.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThis week highlighted constructive engagement with the community around documentation pain points. In issue [#6070](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6070), a maintainer (@yungalgo) effectively de-escalated a user's significant frustration with the plugin scaffolding process, leading to a productive exchange. The resolution of this issue was also notable for its use of an AI agent, Claude, to identify and fix bugs, demonstrating the project's core philosophy in practice. Additionally, the detailed bug report and initial diagnosis provided by a user for the new CLI installation error ([#6088](https://github.com/elizaos/docs/issues/6088)) showcases a technically engaged community actively contributing to problem-solving.", "2025-10-22T23:10:34.071Z"]

A smaller UI task to add Discord and Farcaster navigation buttons was also completed ([#6089](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6089)).\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n  The week was light on new issues, with the most significant one ([#6096](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6096)) being resolved within a day. An active issue ([#168](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/168)) concerning incorrect dates on weekly summaries displayed on user profile leaderboards was acknowledged, with contributor `standujar` confirming they are investigating the bug.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe development pace this week demonstrated an efficient workflow, particularly in addressing both planned features and critical bugs. The rapid progression of the unified messaging API from a newly opened issue ([#6096](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6096)) to a closed one within 24 hours highlights a responsive and focused development cycle. Similarly, the quick turnaround on the agent settings persistence bug ([#6106](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6106)), which was merged two days after being opened, shows a commitment to maintaining core stability. The public acknowledgment and investigation of a community-reported bug ([#168](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/168)) by a maintainer further illustrates an active and engaged triage process.", "2025-11-03T23:28:32.089Z"]

Key achievements include a critical fix for Row-Level Security (RLS) validation, ensuring correct user access when isolation is disabled. Significant progress was also made in standardizing agent configuration by resolving how environment variables are loaded. Concurrently, work began on enhancing the core runtime to support a unified messaging API, reflecting a continued effort to build a robust and scalable foundation for AI agents.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nWork this week centered on bug fixes, core enhancements, and new tooling capabilities.\n\n- **Core Stability and Configuration Fixes**\n    - A crucial bug was fixed where environment variables were not being loaded correctly, preventing agents from accessing settings. The system now properly loads variables from `process.env` instead of relying solely on `.env` files ([#6141](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6141)).\n    - A critical issue with Row-Level Security (RLS) was resolved. The fix prevents `server_id` validation from incorrectly blocking all users when RLS isolation is disabled ([#6139](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6139)).\n    - To improve system stability, a pull request was opened to remove message emission in the `src` API, aiming to prevent potential race conditions ([#6137](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6137)).\n\n- **Runtime and API Enhancements**\n    - A new feature was merged to include an ElizaOS reference within the runtime. This change is a step towards creating a unified messaging API and involved updates across several core packages ([#6111](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6111)).\n\n- **New Tooling Features**\n    - A new pull request was opened to add an OpenRouter embedding option to the command-line interface (CLI), expanding the framework's integration capabilities ([#6142](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6142)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n- **Closed Issues:**\n    - Issue [#6138](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6138), which reported that disabling the Web UI blocked all endpoints, was opened and closed on the same day. It was noted as being prematurely opened and remains under investigation.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:**\n    - A new high-priority issue was reported where an agent fails to respond to questions, producing a \"No handler found for delegate type: TEXT_LARGE\" error ([#6140](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6140)). This represents a potential blocker for agent communication functionality.\n    - No active issues generated significant discussion this week.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe development activity this week indicates a focused effort on foundational improvements. The work on environment variables, RLS, and race conditions suggests a proactive approach to ensuring system stability and reliability. While the reports do not indicate high levels of discussion on specific issues, the mix of bug fixes, core refactoring, and new feature proposals demonstrates steady and methodical progress across the project.", "2025-11-12T23:12:40.898Z"]

This was evidenced by a large influx of new issues defining a clear roadmap for agent discovery, interaction, and monetization. While much of the activity was centered on planning, key technical progress was also made, including a performance-enhancing refactor of the core message service ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)). The month's activities signal a focused shift towards enhancing the platform's public-facing features and preparing for a busy development cycle.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\nDevelopment work this month focused on backend performance improvements and routine maintenance, while new work began on plugin bug fixes.\n\n- **Core Service Optimization:** A significant refactoring effort was completed in the default message service to optimize provider handling within the `MultiStep` functionality. This performance improvement ([#6263](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6263)) enhances execution speed without altering functional outcomes.\n\n- **Plugin Fixes:** Work commenced on addressing a bug in the `plugin-sql`, with a pull request ([#6316](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6316)) opened to use `sql.raw()` for `SET LOCAL`. This change prevents unintended parameterization issues.\n\n- **Project Maintenance:** As part of standard annual upkeep, the copyright year in the project's MIT License was updated to 2026 ([#6301](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/pull/6301)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\nThe beginning of the month saw a major effort in issue creation, outlining a comprehensive vision for the platform's evolution, particularly around public agents and user experience.\n\n- **Closed Issues:** No issues were closed during this period.\n\n- **New & Active Issues:** A large volume of new issues was opened, mapping out substantial future work. Key themes include:\n    - **Public Agent Ecosystem:** A suite of features was proposed to build out a robust public agent environment. This includes an agent discovery module with search and sorting ([#6302](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6302]), a standardized URL format ([#6304](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6304]), the ability for users to fork public agents ([#6305](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6305]), and mechanisms for knowledge transfer ([#6303](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6303)).\n    - **User Experience & Interface:** Numerous issues were created to refine the user experience. These range from specific UI tweaks like adjusting the chat box size ([#6310](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6310]) and improving chat summary relevance ([#6311](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6311]), to fixing bugs related to conversation deletion ([#6322](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6322]) and page scrolling ([#6318](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6318]).\n    - **Monetization & Access Control:** New strategies for platform growth were proposed, including limiting messages for unauthenticated users ([#6312](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6312)) and adjusting the initial free credit amount ([#6315](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/issues/6315)).\n\nNo issues saw significant discussion during this period, indicating that these new items are in the initial triage and assignment phase.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe activity this month points to a highly coordinated planning effort from the core team. The large, thematically-linked batch of issues created on January 2nd suggests a focused session to define project priorities. This proactive planning provides a clear and structured direction for all contributors heading into the new year. While there were no heavily debated issues, this initial burst of activity sets the stage for future collaboration as development on these new features begins.", "2026-01-04T23:16:13.786Z"]

The primary technical achievement was the resolution of critical API data pipeline failures that previously caused 404 errors for contributor profiles and daily summaries. By implementing dynamic environment detection and fallback mechanisms for low-activity periods, the registry now provides a more robust and consistent data source for downstream consumers. Additionally, the plugin ecosystem continues to grow with the introduction of high-performance compute and real-time data integrations.\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Key Developments\n\n### API Infrastructure & Data Reliability\nThe core focus of the week was ensuring the reliability of the registry's data exports. Significant updates were made to the automated workflows to ensure consistent API behavior regardless of repository activity levels.\n*   **Dynamic Site Detection:** Implemented dynamic `SITE_URL` detection within the `run-pipelines.yml` workflow. This fix ensures that the API index and all 1,433 contributor profiles are correctly generated and accessible, resolving previous 404 errors ([#225](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/225)).\n*   **Activity Fallbacks:** Updated the system to generate \"No activity recorded\" summaries for days without repository updates. This prevents API breaks and ensures that the overall summary endpoints return valid responses even during quiet periods ([#226](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/226)).\n\n### Plugin Ecosystem Expansion\nThe registry continues to move toward a more modular and composable architecture by integrating new specialized plugins:\n*   **Cerebras Integration:** Introduced a new plugin for Cerebras, likely focusing on high-speed inference or compute capabilities ([#249](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/249)).\n*   **Sportradar Integration:** Added the `@elizaos/plugin-sportradar`, expanding the framework's utility into real-time sports data and analytics ([#250](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/pull/250)).\n\n## \ud83d\udc1b Issues & Triage\n\n### Closed Issues\nThe week saw the resolution of critical blockers related to data availability:\n*   **API Data Export Fixes:** Resolved issues where missing environment variables prevented the export of the API index and contributor profiles ([#225](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/225)).\n*   **Endpoint Consistency:** Fixed 404 errors on summary endpoints by ensuring the system handles \"zero-activity\" days gracefully ([#226](https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/registry/issues/226)).\n\n### New & Active Issues\nWhile no new issues were opened during the latter half of the week, the project maintained a clean slate regarding high-activity discussions, suggesting that the current fixes have stabilized the core registry functions for the time being.\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Community & Collaboration\nThe activity this week reflects a steady cadence of maintenance and growth. The successful generation of over 1,400 contributor profiles highlights the scale of the ElizaOS ecosystem and the importance of the registry in tracking decentralized contributions. The addition of new plugins like Cerebras and Sportradar demonstrates ongoing interest from developers in extending the framework's reach into diverse data domains and specialized hardware environments.", "2026-01-24T23:15:04.733Z"]

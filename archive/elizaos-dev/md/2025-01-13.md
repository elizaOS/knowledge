# ElizaOS Development Update (2025-01-13)

## Technical Discussions and Feature Development

### Plugin Installation and Configuration
- Users faced issues with installing and configuring plugins (`client-twitter`, `client-discord`, `plugin-browser`).

- Solutions:
  - Use `Evaluators` for continuous processing.

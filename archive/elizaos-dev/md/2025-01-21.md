# ElizaOS Development Report â€“ 2025-01-21  

## Technical Discussions & Decisions  

- **Twitter Plugin & Automation**  
  - No built-in support for scraping X.com lists.  
  - Suggested using `client-twitter` or building a custom plugin.  

- **Twitter Spaces Issues**  
  - Persistent ICE connection failures and session timeouts.  
  - PR #2686 introduced fixes for handling user IDs and memory storage.  

- **Search Integration for ElizaOS**  
  - Discussions on integrating live search results into LLM responses.  
  - `searchProvider` and `memoryManager` suggested as potential solutions.  

- **Discord Client Migration**  
  - Moved to a plugin-based system.  
  - Requires manual installation via `npx elizaos plugins add @elizaos-plugins/client-discord`.  

- **Docker Build Issues**  
  - Reports of missing dependencies (`ts-node`, `adapter-pglite`).  
  - Suggested fixes include modifying Dockerfile to ensure correct paths.  

- **Multi-Agent Setup**  
  - Running multiple agents with separate `.env` files for different Twitter accounts.  

- **Ollama & Local AI Models**  
  - `plugin-local-ai` supports Ollama API.  
  - Requires setting `USE_LOCAL_AI=true` and configuring model paths.  

- **RAG Knowledge Issues**  
  - Reports of broken retrieval in `develop` branch.  
  - Confirmed working in `v0.1.8`, but directory-based knowledge ingestion had issues.  

- **Plugin Registry Migration**  
  - Some plugins (`plugin-image`, `plugin-video`, `plugin-tts`) were missing from the registry.  
  - Manual installation required.  

- **V2 Migration**  
  - CLI (`npx elizaos start`) replaces `eliza-starter`.  
  - Auto-migration tool planned for plugins.  

## Plugin Development & Contributions  

- **HyperParams Protocol**  
  - Introduced for on/off-chain validation and performance tuning.  
  - Whitepaper submitted to Arxiv and ACL.  

- **Web3 Structured Output Parser**  
  - Developed for Langchain, with plans to extend to Eliza.  
  - Feedback given on validation for hex addresses and error handling.  

- **New Plugins Submitted**  
  - Safe Validator, Berachain, OmniFlix, and Token Prediction plugins added to the registry.  

- **Token Prediction Plugin**  
  - Built with a feedback loop for evaluation.  
  - Plans to integrate reinforcement learning.  

- **Tech-Support Bot**  
  - Proposed using ElizaOS, focusing on JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub.  
  - Plans to run local models with Ollama and integrate with Telegram and Nostr.  

- **Unreal Engine Plugin**  
  - Development in progress to enable communication between Unreal Engine and Eliza instances.  

## Key Fixes & Implementations  

- **Twitter Spaces Fixes**  
  - PR #2686 improved error handling and session stability.  

- **Search Integration**  
  - Suggested using `searchContextProvider` or storing results in memory.  

- **Docker Fixes**  
  - Adjusted Dockerfile to ensure dependencies are installed correctly.  

- **Multi-Agent Setup**  
  - Used namespaced environment variables for different agents.  

- **Ollama Integration**  
  - `plugin-local-ai` confirmed to work with DeepSeek models.  

- **Memory Optimization**  
  - Fixed an out-of-memory bug in v0.25.8 by adjusting `splitChunks/splitText`.  

- **Plugin Registry Fixes**  
  - Addressed broken links and missing plugins in the registry.  

## New Features & Integrations

  - Explored running local voice models on home automation devices.  

- **HyperParams Protocol**  
  - Introduced for validation, performance tuning, and certification of AI agents.  

- **Web3 Structured Output Parser**  
  - Developed for Langchain, with suggestions for validation and error handling.  

- **Token Prediction Plugin**  
  - Built for ElizaOS, implementing a feedback loop for token evaluation.  

- **Unreal Engine Plugin**  
  - Developed to enable communication between Unreal Engine and Eliza instances.  

- **Tech-Support Bot**  
  - Built focusing on JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub integration.  
  - Plans to run models locally using Ollama.

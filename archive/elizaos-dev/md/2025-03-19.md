## Eliza v2 Development and Issues

- **Beta Status**
  - Still in beta, not stable for production.
  - Some users testing for hobby projects.
  - Installation issues reported with `npx @elizaos/cli create` and `bun install`.
  - Suggested fix: Ensure Bun is installed or use `npm create eliza@beta`.

- **Technical Issues**
  - **Database Migration Errors**: Schema changes in `pglite` require wiping the old database.
  - **Plugin Porting Challenges**: Recommended to wait for a stable release and updated documentation.
  - **Dynamic Plugins**: Not working as expected; 'getting started' steps need verification.
  - **Default Agents Missing**: Fix expected in the next few days.
  - **Twitter Client Authentication**: Uses user/password instead of API keys, leading to bans.
  - **Knowledge Table Chunk Size**: Too small, causing excessive row returns; increasing chunk size suggested.

  - **CoinGecko Plugin Issues**: No details or solutions provided.
  - **Out of Memory Error**: Users asked about available RAM, but no resolution reached.

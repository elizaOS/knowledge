# ElizaOS Daily Report – 2025-01-24

## Technical Issues and Solutions in ElizaOS

### Key Discussions
- **Model Performance & RAG Issues**: DeepSeek model was found slower and more repetitive than Claude. RAG retrieval worked in v0.1.8 but failed in the develop branch.
- **Twitter API Login Failures**: Security measures caused login failures. Solutions included tagging the agent as automated and using different accounts.
- **Docker Build Failures**: Issues due to missing dependencies and incorrect paths. A revised Dockerfile was tested.
- **Ollama Integration**: `plugin-local-ai` was identified as the correct plugin but was missing from the registry.
- **Memory Management & Duplicate Responses**: Solutions included adjusting system prompts and modifying response templates.
- **Multi-Agent Setup**: Users explored running multiple agents with separate environments and credentials.
- **Twilio Plugin for SMS**: Found in an existing PR, eliminating the need for a new plugin.
- **Character Selection Issues**: Agent defaulted to Eliza instead of a custom character due to a bracket error in the character file.
- **Plugin Installation Errors**: `@elizaos/plugin-solana-agent-kit` returned a 404 error, confirming it was missing from the registry.
- **WebSocket Event Handling**: Users were advised to use `processActions` in the agent’s runtime.
- **Twitter Client Connection**: Required installing `@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter` and adding it to the `plugins` list.
- **Plugin Installation Commands**: `npx elizaos plugins install` and `npx elizaos plugins add` were both confirmed to work.
- **Real-Time DeFi Data Integration**: A three-step approach was outlined: collect, store, and define usage.

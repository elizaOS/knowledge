# ElizaOS Development and Plugin Integration

## Overview
Discussions focused on ElizaOS development, plugin integration, and AI agent enhancements. Key topics included troubleshooting plugin installations, AI-driven token predictions, and structured Web3 data parsing.

## Key Technical Discussions
- **Token Against Humanity ($TAH) Development**: AI agent 'CC' will autonomously engage on social platforms, with 50% of revenue shared with token holders. Integration with the ELIZA framework is being explored.
- **HyperParams Protocol**: Open-source AI validation framework with a whitepaper submitted to Arxiv and ACL. API planned for AI agent certification.
- **Web3 Structured Output Parser**: Initial implementation shared, with suggestions for validation improvements and token standard normalization.
- **ElizaOS Plugin Contributions**: Multiple plugins submitted, including Berachain, Safe multisig validator, and OmniFlix integrations.
- **Token Prediction Plugin**: Uses reinforcement learning for price predictions, with initial results showing market manipulation patterns.
- **Tech-Support AI Bot**: Focus on JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub support, with plans for local model execution and Nostr integration.

## Plugin Installation & Debugging
- Issues installing `client-twitter` and `client-discord` plugins. Correct approach:  
  `npx elizaos plugins install <plugin-name>` and add to `character.json`.
- RAG knowledge setup requires `.md` files in `characters/knowledge/<agent-name>`.
- Deferred execution of actions discussed, with `setTimeout` as a temporary workaround.
- Multi-agent workflows explored, with `Evaluators` suggested for continuous processing.
- WebSocket event handling clarified, requiring `processActions` calls within the agent runtime.

## Action Items
- **Technical Tasks**:  
  - Integrate $TAH with ELIZA  
  - Finalize HyperParams API  
  - Extend Web3 Structured Output Parser  
  - Implement reinforcement learning in token prediction  
  - Develop a Nostr plugin  
- **Documentation Needs**:  
  - Update ElizaOS plugin installation guide  
  - Document Web3 structured output parsing  
  - Publish the HyperParams whitepaper  
- **Feature Requests**:  
  - Add error handling for Web3 data  
  - Improve token standard normalization  
  - Enable AI-driven content scheduling  
  - Enhance multi-agent workflows

# ElizaOS Development and Technical Discussions

## Overview
The ElizaOS community discussed technical issues, feature developments, and plugin integrations. Topics included troubleshooting plugin installations, improving memory management, and enhancing multi-agent workflows.

## Key Issues & Solutions
- **Plugin Installation**:  
  - Issues with Twitter and Discord clients.  
  - Solution: Ensure correct plugins (`@elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter`, `@elizaos-plugins/client-discord`) are installed and configured.  
- **Docker Deployment**:  
  - Missing dependencies and incorrect paths caused failures.  
  - Solution: A revised Dockerfile was proposed to fix module resolution issues.  
- **Memory Management & RAG Retrieval**:  
  - Issues with knowledge ingestion and retrieval.  
  - Solution: Verify directory paths and ensure embeddings are correctly configured.  
- **Plugin Registry Migration**:  
  - Plugins must now be submitted separately.  
  - Solution: Install missing plugins manually or wait for updates.  
- **Authentication & API Keys**:  
  - Issues with OpenAI and Akash API keys.  
  - Solution: Ensure keys are correctly formatted with the `Bearer` prefix.  

## Proposed Enhancements
- **Architecture Simplification**:  
  - Proposal to remove `runtime.modelProvider` since `modelProvider` is mandatory on `character`.  
- **New Plugins & Features**:  
  - `DexPaprika`: Fetches on-chain token prices.  
  - `Mem0`: AI provider added to the Vercel AI SDK.  
  - Telegram bot for fetching Linear ticket data.  
  - Script to generate character schemas from WhatsApp conversations.  
  - Local LLaMA model integration for voice processing in home automation.

### Plugin Installation & Activation
- `asi123aa` asked how to activate a merged plugin.

  npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name
  
  - Plugin must be added to the character file.
- `pravn1729` requested a new plugin repo under `elizaos-plugins` (clarified that only the plugin repo should be created).

### Plugin Registry & Configuration

### Tech-Support Bot Proposal
- `chris.troutner` proposed a bot using ElizaOS for JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub.
- Plan: Run models locally with an NVIDIA GeForce 3060, integrate with Telegram and Nostr.

## Plugin Issues

### Missing Plugins & Installation Problems
- `plugin-image`, `plugin-video`, `plugin-tts` were missing (scheduled for re-addition).
- Twitter and Discord clients required manual installation.

### Twitter Client Issues
- Removed from core; must install manually:
  
  npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter
  
- Slow responses due to API rate limits and LLM response times.
- Recommended adjustments: `temperature`, `frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty`.

### Discord Client Setup
- Users struggled with installation.
- Solution: Install `@elizaos-plugins/client-discord` and add it to the character file.
- Ensure bot has correct permissions and intents enabled.

### Docker Deployment Issues
- Missing dependencies and incorrect paths caused failures.
- Fixes applied to the Dockerfile.
- Debugging confirmed RAG knowledge requires a proper directory structure.

### Local AI Model Support
- Users requested support for local models using the Ollama API.
- Solution: Use `plugin-local-ai` and configure `OLLAMA_SERVER_URL` in `.env`.

### Sui Plugin Issues
- Actions not triggering due to incorrect definitions in `suiPlugin` variable.
- Users advised to verify required parameters.

### Multi-Agent Setup Improvements
- Introduced namespacing for environment variables.
- Enabled shared memory across agents using RAG knowledge.

### Migration & Documentation Updates
- Auto-migration tool for Eliza v2 in development.
- REST API documentation improved for better guidance.

# ElizaOS Development Report â€“ 2025-01-22  

## Key Technical Discussions & Decisions  
- **Multi-Agent Workflow**: Supports both single-agent multitasking and multi-agent setups for distinct tasks.  
- **Search Integration**: Proposed provider model to inject live search results into LLM responses.  
- **Plugin System & Dynamic Context Providers**: Suggested a generic `getContext` plugin for API integrations, with concerns about security and standardization.  
- **Twitter Spaces Issues**: ICE connection failures and early disconnections addressed with improved error handling.  
- **Build Issues on Windows**: Switching to Git Bash resolved build failures.  
- **RAG Knowledge Issues**: Debugging confirmed retrieval works, but LLM responses omit key details.  
- **Docker Build Failures**: Adjustments ensured dependencies installed correctly.  
- **Discord & Twitter Client Migration**: Clients are now plugins requiring manual installation.  

## Plugin Development & Contributions  
- **New Plugins**: Safe Validator, Berachain, OmniFlix, Token Prediction, and Distributed Storage.  
- **Token Prediction Plugin**: Built with a feedback loop, with plans for reinforcement learning.  
- **Unreal Engine Plugin**: In development for communication between Unreal Engine and Eliza instances.  
- **Tech-Support Bot**: Focuses on JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub integration, with plans for local model execution using Ollama.  
- **Plugin Registry & Contribution Process**: Clarified that plugins should be submitted to the registry repo.  

## Common Issues & Fixes  
- **Character Defaulting Issue**: Agents defaulting to Eliza due to bracket errors in character files.  
- **Plugin Installation Errors**: Issues with `@elizaos/plugin-solana-agent-kit` resolved by checking `package.json` and using `pnpm docker`.  
- **WebSocket Event Handling**: Recommended using `processActions` for real-time event handling.  
- **RAG Knowledge Storage**: `.pdf` files not working; `.md` files required.  
- **Twitter Plugin Issues**: Confusion between `plugin-twitter` and `client-twitter`.  
- **Real-Time DeFi Data**: Users explored integrating real-time DeFi data for yield detection and automated trading.

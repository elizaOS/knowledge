## ElizaOS: Technical Issues, Solutions, and Best Practices

### Key Technical Discussions & Solutions
- **Docker Build Issues:** Missing dependencies and incorrect paths in v0.19 and v2. Solution: Refined Dockerfile to explicitly copy dependencies and built artifacts.
- **Hardlinking Issues in Docker:** Dependencies were being hardlinked, causing path issues. Solution: Modify Dockerfile to avoid hardlinking.
- **Twitter & Discord Client Issues:** Correct setup requires installing `@elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter` and `@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter`, but only adding the client to the `plugins` list.
- **Authentication Errors with Akash Chat API:** `401 Authentication Errors` resolved by checking API key formats and `.env` configurations.
- **Multi-Agent Setup:** Running multiple agents with different Twitter accounts requires namespaced environment variables.
- **Local AI Model Integration:** `plugin-local-ai` supports Ollama but is not listed in the registry.
- **V2 Migration & CLI Issues:** v2 stability questioned; CLI issues (`npx @elizaos/cli start` not working) should be reported as separate GitHub tickets.
- **Cloudflare Blocking Twitter Logins:** Cloudflare blocks Twitter logins for agents in Docker. Issue tracked on GitHub.
- **SQLite Module Errors:** Missing SQLite bindings fixed with `pnpm add better-sqlite3@latest --force` and `npm rebuild better-sqlite3`.
- **Twitter Bot Shadowban:** Bots getting shadowbanned should mark accounts as "automated" in settings.
- **Embedding Issues:** No clear resolution provided.
- **Twitch Client Loop Issue:** Infinite loop in Twitch chat fixed by implementing message deduplication.
- **Browser Plugin Issues:** Chrome’s removal of old headless mode broke the browser plugin.

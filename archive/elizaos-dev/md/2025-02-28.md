# ElizaOS Development Report (2025-02-28)

## Docker Issues in ElizaOS
Several users reported problems with Docker builds, primarily due to missing dependencies and incorrect module paths.

### Key Issues:
- `docker compose up` fails due to missing `adapter-pglite`.
- `ts-node` module not found errors.
- Missing `pnpm install` step in the Dockerfile.
- Hardcoded paths causing module resolution failures.

### Debugging Efforts:
- A revised Dockerfile was tested but did not fully resolve path issues.
- Contributors `mr.stark_` and `hashwarlock` identified missing dependencies and incorrect paths as root causes.
- Further improvements are needed for a stable build process.

## Memory Issues in ElizaOS

### Fixed Issues:
- **Out-of-Memory (OOM) Bug**: Fixed by [v1xingyue] in PR #3722.  
  - Caused by a dead loop in `splitChunks/splitText`, consuming all memory.
  - Fix resolved CI memory issues.

- **JavaScript Heap OOM Error**: Encountered by [redvoid8344] while processing RAG knowledge.  
  - Mitigated by setting:  
    sh
    export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=6144"
    
  - 'Invalid array length' error was fixed, but agent responses remain inconsistent.

### Future Improvements:
- [v1xingyue] suggested optimizing memory allocation and preventing infinite loops in text processing.

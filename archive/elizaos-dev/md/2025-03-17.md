## Integrating Real-Time Crypto Data into an Agent

### Key Implementation Steps
1. Obtain or create a structured database of crypto data.
2. Convert the database into an Eliza provider.
3. Define actions to detect and act on yield opportunities.

### Alternative Approach
- **Three-Stage Process**: Data collection, storage, and usage.

### Challenges
- **Example Implementations**: Requested but unavailable due to client confidentiality.
- **Potential Resources**: Further investigation into related resources.

### Action Items
- Implement a crypto data collection and storage system.
- Convert the database into an Eliza provider.
- Define actions for detecting and acting on opportunities.
- Enable automated posting to Twitter and responding to Discord queries.
- Document the process for setting up a crypto data provider.
- Provide example implementations or non-client-specific code snippets if possible.

## ElizaOS Development and Plugin Updates

### Key Technical Discussions & Solutions
- **Twitter Client on v2**: Suggested using webhooks.
- **SQLite Module Error**: Resolved with `pnpm add better-sqlite3@latest --force` and `npm rebuild better-sqlite3`.
- **Ollama API Support**: `plugin-local-ai` found and configured.
- **V2 Stability**: Confirmed as beta, not production-ready.
- **Discord Client Installation Issue**: `@elizaos/plugin-sql@^0.25.6` missing; tracked in GitHub.

# ElizaOS Report – February 15, 2025

## Technical Discussions & Problem-Solving

- **WebSocket Event Handling**: Use `processActions` in the agent’s runtime for WebSocket-triggered events.
- **Memory & Learning Current Events**: Implement an RSS feed provider for real-time event learning.
- **Docker Deployment Issues**: Modify the Dockerfile to ensure correct module paths and dependencies.
- **Plugin Installation & Registry Issues**: Some plugins require manual installation due to missing registry entries.
- **Twitter Client Issues**: Ensure `@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter` is installed and configured in `character.json`.
- **Multi-Agent Setup**: Use namespaced environment variables for multiple agents with different Twitter accounts.
- **Embedding & RAG Knowledge Issues**: Debug database setup and ensure knowledge is stored in `characters/knowledge/agent-name`.
- **Eliza V2 Migration**: `npx elizaos start` replaces the old setup.
- **Local LLM Support (Ollama)**: `plugin-local-ai` supports Ollama but requires correct environment variable configuration.

## Plugin Development & Contributions

- **Plugin Contributions & Access Requests**: PRs submitted to `elizaos-plugins/registry` for new plugins.
- **Plugin Installation & Activation**: Use `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name` and update the character file.
- **New Plugins Announced**:
  - Unreal Engine communication plugin
  - Token prediction plugin with reinforcement learning
  - Web3 marketing automation tool
- **Tech-Support Bot**: Proposed bot for JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub support, with Telegram and Nostr integration.
- **AI Agent Platform**: `aigent.sh` introduced to simplify AI agent deployment.

## Common Issues & Solutions

- **Twitter Polls**: Requires an X API key.
- **Agent JSON Replies**: Adjust prompt formatting to prevent JSON responses.
- **Line Breaks in Replies**: Modify prompts for better formatting.
- **Dependency Issues on Windows**: Use WSL2 to resolve `pnpm install` issues.
- **Pull Requests Best Practices**: Submit smaller PRs grouped by feature.
- **Multi-Platform Agent Support**: ElizaOS supports Discord, Twitter, and Telegram.
- **Docker Build Issues**: Use `pnpm docker` for building and running.
- **LLM Processing Flow**: Two LLMs handle response decision-making and generation.
- **Provider Setup**: External data is injected into LLM prompts via `packages/core/src/providers.ts`.
- **Real-Time Crypto Data for Agents**: Requires a database, an Eliza provider, and defined actions.

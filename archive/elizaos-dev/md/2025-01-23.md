# ElizaOS Report – January 23, 2025  

## Plugin Management in ElizaOS  

### Plugin Registry & Submission  
- Plugins must be submitted to `elizaos-plugins`, not the main repository.  
- [odilitime] clarified the process, with [vincent2412_] confirming steps for adding plugins and environment variables.  

### Issue Fixes & Enhancements  
- Broken links in the plugin registry were reported by [flaneurofmetaverses] and acknowledged for investigation.  
- [aiflowml] fixed multiple plugins, including Twitter, TTS, OpenAI, NFT-generation, and Starknet.  

### Documentation Improvements  
- [doriand0963] proposed enforcing README files for all plugins, implemented for `client-alexa`.  
- [vincent2412_] suggested clarifying the plugin submission process in official documentation.  

### Feature Requests  
- **Twitter Client Enhancements**: Reflection mode ([krustev.alexander]), callback support ([tadeuchi]).  
- **AI Summarization**: Improved news aggregation ([dankvr]).  

## Technical Discussions & Issue Resolutions  

### General Technical Issues  
- **Model Performance**: DeepSeek was found slower and more repetitive than Claude.  
- **RAG Knowledge Retrieval**: Worked in v0.1.8 but failed in the develop branch.  
- **Twitter API Login Failures**: Resolved by tagging the agent as automated and using different accounts.  
- **Docker Build Failures**: Debugged missing dependencies and incorrect paths.  
- **Ollama Integration**: `plugin-local-ai` identified as the correct plugin but missing from the registry.  
- **Memory Management**: Solutions included adjusting system prompts and modifying response templates.  

### Plugin & API Issues  
- **Twilio Plugin**: Found in an existing PR, eliminating the need for a new plugin.  
- **Character Selection Bug**: Defaulted to Eliza due to a bracket error in the character file.  
- **Plugin Installation Errors**: `@elizaos/plugin-solana-agent-kit` returned a 404 error, confirming it was not in the registry.  
- **WebSocket Event Handling**: Users advised to use `processActions` in the agent’s runtime.  
- **DeFi Data Integration**: Explored approaches for real-time data collection and usage.  

## Plugin Development & Contributions  

### New & Updated Plugins  
- **HyperParams Protocol**: Proposed for AI agent validation and tuning.  
- **Web3 Structured Output Parser**: Developed for Langchain, with plans for ElizaOS.  
- **New Plugins**: Safe Validator, Berachain, OmniFlix, Token Prediction.  
- **Token Prediction Plugin**: Includes a feedback loop for evaluation and reinforcement learning.  
- **Tech-Support Bot**: Proposed for JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub, integrating with Telegram and Nostr.  

### Plugin Installation & Documentation  
- **Installation Process**: Plugins must be installed via `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name` and added to the character file.

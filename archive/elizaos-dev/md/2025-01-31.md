# ElizaOS Development Report â€“ January 31, 2025

## ElizaOS Plugin System Updates

### Plugin Installation Changes
- New installation command: `npx elizaos plugins install <plugin-name>`.
- Replaces the previous monolithic approach.
- Some plugins were missing from the registry but later restored.

### Technical Issues & Fixes
- **Twitter Login Issues**: Users faced login failures due to API restrictions. Solutions:
  - Mark accounts as automated.
  - Use different login methods.
- **Docker Issues**: Missing dependencies and incorrect paths. A revised Dockerfile was proposed.
- **Memory Management & RAG**: Users struggled with embedding and retrieval. Solutions:
  - Ensure correct `.env` settings.
  - Verify database configurations.
- **Multi-Agent Setup**: Users explored running multiple agents with separate configurations.
  - v2 supports namespaced secrets for different agents.
- **Local LLM Support**: `plugin-local-ai` confirmed as the correct plugin for running local models via Ollama.
- **REST API Authentication**: Proposal to add an `AUTH_KEY` for secure API access.

### ElizaOS v2 Migration

## Plugin Installation Issues
- Users faced issues installing `@elizaos/plugin-solana-agent-kit`, `plugin-trustdb`, and `plugin-coingecko`.
- Solutions:
  - Ensure correct package name.
  - Use `npx elizaos plugins install <plugin-name>`.
- **Dependency Conflicts**:
  - Some warnings are harmless.
  - Check for incorrect package names and conflicting dependencies.
- **Client vs. Plugin Confusion**:
  - Clients should be installed as plugins and added to `plugins` in `character.json`.

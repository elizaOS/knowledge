It lacks a web interface, which was identified as an oversight.\n- **Plugin Registry & Metadata**: Discussions on improving plugin metadata storage, including adding descriptions and images to `package.json` instead of the registry index.\n- **Multi-Agent System**: `RAG knowledge` supports shared memory across multiple agents. A modular approach with sub-agents was debated for scalability.\n- **Plugin Installation & Management**: `npx elizaos plugins install` is the new method for adding plugins. Some plugins were missing from the registry and needed re-adding.\n- **Docker Issues**: Multiple users reported Docker build failures due to missing dependencies and incorrect paths. A revised Dockerfile was proposed.\n- **Twitter Client Issues**: Users faced issues with Twitter integration, including double responses and shadow bans. Solutions included setting accounts as 'automated' and adjusting model parameters.\n- **Discord Client Setup**: The Discord client was moved to a plugin format, requiring `\"plugins\": [\"@elizaos-plugins/client-discord\"]` in the character file.\n- **Memory Management & Repetition**: Issues with agents repeating messages were linked to memory retrieval. Solutions included adjusting `composeState` and prompt engineering.\n- **REST API Documentation**: Swagger was considered but abandoned in favor of a simpler REST API documentation page.\n- **V2 Migration**: V2 introduces a CLI (`npx elizaos start`) and a new plugin system. Migration tools are planned.",

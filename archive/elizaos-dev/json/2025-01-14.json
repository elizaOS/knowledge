Integration with the ELIZA framework is being explored.\n- **HyperParams Protocol**: An open-source AI validation framework with a whitepaper submitted to Arxiv and ACL. API planned for AI agent certification.\n- **Web3 Structured Output Parser**: Initial implementation shared, with suggestions for validation improvements and token standard normalization.\n- **ElizaOS Plugin Contributions**: Multiple plugins submitted, including Berachain, Safe multisig validator, and OmniFlix integrations.\n- **Token Prediction Plugin**: Uses reinforcement learning for price predictions, with initial results showing market manipulation patterns.\n- **Tech-Support AI Bot**: Focus on JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub support, with plans for local model execution and Nostr integration.",

The correct approach involves using `npx elizaos plugins install <plugin-name>` and adding it to `character.json`.\n- RAG knowledge setup required `.md` files in `characters/knowledge/<agent-name>`.\n- Deferred execution of actions was discussed, with `setTimeout` as a temporary workaround.\n- Multi-agent workflows were explored, with `Evaluators` suggested for continuous processing.\n- WebSocket event handling was clarified, requiring `processActions` calls within the agent runtime.",

          "text": "### Technical Discussions & Solutions\n- **Docker & Environment Issues**: Users faced issues running ElizaOS in Docker due to missing dependencies and incorrect paths. Solutions included running `pnpm i`, modifying Dockerfiles, and ensuring correct environment variables.\n- **Twitter Client Issues**: Several users reported problems with Twitter login due to Cloudflare security changes. Suggested fixes included using different IPs, ensuring correct credentials, and marking accounts as automated.\n- **RAG Knowledge System**: Users struggled with knowledge ingestion and retrieval. Solutions included ensuring correct directory paths, using `.md` or `.txt` files, and verifying embedding settings.\n- **Plugin System Migration**: Plugins were moved to a separate registry. Users had to install them manually using `npx elizaos plugins add <plugin-name>`.\n- **Memory Management & Repetition Issues**: Users reported agents repeating responses. Solutions included adjusting `modelConfig` settings (temperature, frequency_penalty) and improving prompt engineering.\n- **Discord & Telegram Clients**: Users had trouble setting up Discord and Telegram clients. Solutions included adding them as plugins instead of clients and ensuring correct API tokens in `.env`.\n- **Local LLM Support (Ollama, DeepSeek, etc.)**: Users wanted to run local models. The `plugin-local-ai` was identified as the correct plugin, requiring `USE_LOCAL_AI=true` and `OLLAMA_SERVER_URL` settings.\n- **V2 Migration & CLI**: V2 introduced a new CLI (`npx elizaos start`). Some users faced installation issues due to missing dependencies.",

Contracts and agent are functional but need refinement.\n- **SAIOS Infrastructure**: Aims to simplify Eliza framework usage with a UI hosted on IPFS/Arweave and agent servers on Akash. Users provide LLM API keys.\n- **HyperParams Protocol**: Open-source ML validation and performance tuning for AI agents. Whitepaper submitted to Arxiv and ACL.\n- **Web3 Structured Output Parser**: Langchain-based parser for structured Web3 data. Discussed adding validation for hex addresses and error handling.\n- **Plugin Contributions**: Several plugins were developed and integrated, including Berachain, Safe Validator, OmniFlix, Token Prediction, and Unreal Engine plugins.",

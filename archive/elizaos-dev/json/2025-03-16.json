Use or create a crypto data database.\n    2. Convert the database into an Eliza provider to feed the agent.\n    3. Define actions to detect and act on opportunities.\n  - `rick02533` recommended breaking the process into three stages:\n    1. Collect the data.\n    2. Store the data.\n    3. Define how the data will be used.\n  - `behnammby` mentioned they had implemented a similar system but could not share the code due to client restrictions.",

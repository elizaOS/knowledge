Solutions included marking bots as 'automated' and adjusting login methods.\n- **Plugin System Migration**: The ElizaOS plugin system was moved to a separate registry, requiring installation via `npx elizaos plugins add <plugin-name>`. Some plugins were missing, causing confusion.\n- **Docker Deployment Issues**: Users encountered missing dependencies and incorrect paths in Docker builds. A revised Dockerfile was proposed to resolve these issues.\n- **Memory Management & RAG**: Problems with RAG knowledge retrieval and memory duplication were reported. Debugging focused on ensuring embeddings were correctly stored and retrieved.\n- **Multi-Agent Setup**: Users explored running multiple agents with separate environments, particularly for different Twitter accounts. Solutions involved namespacing environment variables and using separate character files.\n- **Local LLM Support**: Users sought to integrate Ollama and DeepSeek models. The `plugin-local-ai` was identified as the correct plugin, but it was not listed in the registry.\n- **Action Execution & Duplication**: Some users reported duplicate responses from actions. Solutions included adjusting model temperature and frequency penalties, and ensuring actions were correctly structured.\n- **V2 Migration & Stability**: Questions arose about whether to migrate to V2. The consensus was that V2 is still in beta and not yet stable for production.",

The Solana contracts and agent functions are complete but require refinement.\n- **SAIOS Infrastructure**: A no-code interface for Eliza, hosting UI on IPFS/Arweave and agent servers on Akash, was introduced.\n- **HyperParams Protocol**: A new on/off-chain validation and performance tuning protocol for AI agents was announced, with a whitepaper submitted to Arxiv and ACL.\n- **Web3 Structured Output Parser**: A Web3 StructuredOutputParser for Langchain was developed, with suggestions to add validation for hex addresses and error handling.\n- **Plugin Contributions**: Several users submitted PRs for ElizaOS plugins, including Berachain, Safe Validator, and OmniFlix. Reviews and merges were conducted.\n- **Token Prediction Plugin**: A token prediction plugin using reinforcement learning was developed, with example predictions shared for feedback.\n- **Nostr Plugin for Tech Support Bot**: A Nostr plugin for a tech-support bot using ElizaOS was proposed, focusing on JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub integration.",

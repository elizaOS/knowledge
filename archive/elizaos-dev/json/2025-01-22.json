PR #2686 was submitted to improve error handling and memory storage adjustments.\n- **Build Issues on Windows**: Switching to Git Bash instead of the VS Code terminal resolved build failures. Removing `plugin-avail` and `akashPlugin` also helped.\n- **RAG Knowledge Issues**: Debugging showed that knowledge retrieval was working, but LLM responses omitted key details.\n- **Docker Build Failures**: `pnpm install` was failing due to missing dependencies. Adjustments to the Dockerfile resolved the issue.\n- **Discord & Twitter Client Migration**: Clients are now plugins, requiring users to add `@elizaos-plugins/client-discord` and `@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter` to the character file.",

Environment variables should be updated in `.env.example`.\n- **Twitter Client Enhancements**: A reflection mode was added to extract valuable insights from conversations.\n- **Post-Processing for Character Objects**: `postProcessors` were introduced to avoid modifying the `plugins` field.\n- **Memory Optimization**: An out-of-memory bug in v0.25.8 was fixed by adjusting `splitChunks/splitText`.\n- **Distributed Storage Plugin**: A new distributed storage plugin was submitted.\n- **Plugin Registry Link Issues**: Broken links in the plugin registry were reported and acknowledged for investigation.",

A workaround is to ensure at least one participant joins. PR #2686 was submitted to improve handling.\n- **Build Errors with pnpm**: Adding specific package overrides in `pnpm` resolved build errors.\n- **Twitter Image Vision Bug**: Image recognition worked on Telegram but not Twitter. Investigation was assigned.\n- **Docker Build Issues**: Debugging revealed incorrect module paths. A revised Dockerfile was tested to resolve missing dependencies.\n- **Discord Client Not Starting**: Ensuring the Discord client was added as a plugin, not a client, resolved the issue.\n- **Twitter Client Not Posting**: Installing both `plugin-twitter` and `client-twitter` fixed the issue.\n- **Ollama API Integration**: `plugin-local-ai` supports Ollama API, and the necessary `.env` configuration was provided.",

          "text": "### Technical Discussions & Solutions\n\n- **Twitter & Discord Client Setup:** Users faced issues connecting Twitter and Discord clients. The correct approach is to install them as plugins using `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/client-twitter`. Misnaming the plugin caused issues, which were resolved after correction.\n- **Twitter Plugin for Post Tracking:** A plugin exists to track new Twitter posts and generate tweets. Installation: `pnpm add github:elizaos-plugins/client-discord`.\n- **Telegram Plugin IPv6 Issue:** Missing IPv6 support caused Telegram API connectivity issues. A workaround is forcing IPv4.\n- **Twitter Post Duplication:** No concrete solution was provided for avoiding duplicate posts.\n- **Twitter Bot Shadowban:** Bots were shadowbanned due to not marking accounts as \"automated.\"\n- **Newline Formatting Issue:** Users faced newline formatting issues in responses. A system prompt directive can prevent `\\n` usage.\n- **Akash Chat API Authentication Error:** A 401 error was resolved by ensuring the API key had the `Bearer` prefix.\n- **Multi-Agent Setup:** Running multiple agents with different X accounts requires namespaced environment variables.\n- **V2 Migration:** `eliza-starter` will be replaced by `npx elizaos start`.\n- **Cloudflare Blocking Twitter Logins:** Cloudflare blocked Twitter logins for agents in Docker. A related GitHub issue was referenced.\n- **Embedding Issues:** No clear resolution was provided for embedding errors.\n- **Local LLM Support (Ollama API):** `plugin-local-ai` supports Ollama API but is not listed in the registry.\n- **SQLite Module Error:** Missing SQLite bindings were fixed with `pnpm add better-sqlite3@latest --force` and `npm rebuild better-sqlite3`.\n- **V2 CLI Issues:** Errors with `npx @elizaos/cli create` were reported, with a GitHub issue tracking them.\n- **Provider Implementation:** Users discussed training an agent with real-time data using providers that query databases or APIs.\n- **Plugin vs. Client Confusion:** Clients must also be listed under `plugins` for proper functionality.\n- **Model Selection Issue:** Despite setting `modelProvider: \"openrouter\"`, the agent defaulted to another model. No resolution was provided.\n- **Formatting Issues with Anthropic Models:** Claude models produced inconsistent formatting in Discord. No solution was found.\n- **Custom Plugin Development:** A user asked about creating and installing a custom plugin, but no detailed response was given.\n- **Crypto Data Integration:** Users discussed feeding real-time DeFi data into an agent for Twitter posts, but no code examples were provided.",

A plugin was confirmed to work, with installation instructions provided.\n- **Discord Plugin Setup**: Issues with connecting the Discord bot were resolved by clarifying that it should be added as a plugin, not a client.\n- **Telegram Plugin IPv6 Issue**: A missing IPv6 support issue was identified and a GitHub issue was suggested for resolution.\n- **Twitter Bot Shadowban**: A user reported an X account ban, likely due to not marking the account as 'automated.'\n- **Newline Formatting Issue**: Formatting issues in responses were resolved by adding a system prompt directive.\n- **Akash Chat API Authentication Error**: A 401 error was resolved by checking the API key format and `.env` configuration.\n- **Multi-Agent Setup**: Users discussed running multiple agents with different X accounts using namespaced environment variables.\n- **V2 Migration**: The `eliza-starter` package is being phased out in favor of `npx elizaos start`.\n- **Cloudflare Blocking Twitter Logins**: Cloudflare security changes blocked Twitter logins for agents in Docker, with a related GitHub issue linked.\n- **Local LLM Support (Ollama API)**: The `plugin-local-ai` supports Ollama API but is not listed in the registry.\n- **SQLite Module Error**: Missing SQLite bindings were resolved by reinstalling the package and rebuilding it.\n- **V2 CLI Issues**: Errors with `npx @elizaos/cli create` were reported and linked to a GitHub issue.",

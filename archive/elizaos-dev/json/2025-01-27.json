Some were archived, requiring manual installation.\n- **Twitter Client Issues:** The Twitter client was not working in the latest version. Solutions included ensuring `plugin-twitter` and `client-twitter` were installed and API credentials were correctly set.\n- **Docker Deployment Issues:** Users encountered path-related issues when running Eliza in Docker. A revised Dockerfile was proposed to fix the issue.\n- **Ollama & Local AI Models:** Users sought to integrate Ollama for local AI models. The `plugin-local-ai` was identified as the correct plugin, but it was not listed in the registry.\n- **Memory Management & RAG Issues:** Some users faced issues with knowledge ingestion and memory duplication. The `folder2knowledge` feature was discussed, and solutions involved ensuring correct directory paths.\n- **V2 Migration & CLI Issues:** The new CLI (`npx elizaos start`) replaced `eliza-starter`, but users faced missing dependencies (`@elizaos/plugin-sql@^0.25.6`).\n- **Multi-Agent Setup:** Users explored running multiple agents with separate environments, particularly for different Twitter accounts. A namespaced environment variable approach was suggested.",

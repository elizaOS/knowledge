New plugins such as `plugin-dexpaprika` (for token prices) and `plugin-near` (for NEAR AI integration) were introduced.\n- **Infrastructure & Tooling**: Discussions on using **CodeRabbit** and **Windsurf** for PR reviews. **Biome** was added for linting and formatting. A Telegram <=> Linear bot was proposed for ticket management.\n- **Database & Memory Management**: Issues with `db.sqlite` were resolved by deleting and restarting the agent. Memory deletion was discussed, with `runtime.messageManager.removeMemory` as a workaround.\n- **Twitter Spaces & API Issues**: ICE connection failures were reported. Fixes were proposed to improve error handling and memory storage.\n- **Docker Build Failures**: Issues with missing dependencies and incorrect paths were identified. A revised Dockerfile was proposed.\n- **RAG Knowledge System**: Knowledge retrieval issues were reported in the latest develop branch. Logging improvements were suggested.\n- **Eliza v2 Migration**: Migration to v2 requires a structured process, with a CLI tool (`npx elizaos start`) replacing `eliza-starter`.\n- **Web3 & AI Integrations**: The **HyperParams Protocol** was introduced for AI agent validation. A **Web3 Structured Output Parser** was developed for Langchain.\n- **Tech-Support AI Bot**: A bot focusing on JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub support was proposed, with plans to integrate with Telegram and Nostr.\n",

A revised Dockerfile was proposed to ensure dependencies were correctly installed.\n- **Multi-Agent Setup**: Users discussed running multiple agents with separate environments by using start scripts and overriding environment variables.\n- **Twitter & Discord Client Issues**: Users faced issues with Twitter and Discord clients not working. Solutions included installing the correct plugins and ensuring proper configuration.\n- **Local AI Model Integration**: The `plugin-local-ai` plugin supports Ollama API but was not listed in the registry. Users provided environment variables to configure it.\n- **SQLite Module Errors**: Issues with `better-sqlite3` were resolved by forcing a reinstall and rebuilding the module.\n- **V2 Migration & CLI Issues**: Users encountered issues with the new CLI (`npx @elizaos/cli start` failing). The registry was checked for missing dependencies.\n- **Embedding & Knowledge Base Issues**: Invalid embedding input errors were reported, likely due to empty input strings.\n- **Plugin Registry & Missing Plugins**: Some plugins were missing from the registry, preventing installation via `npx elizaos plugins add`.",

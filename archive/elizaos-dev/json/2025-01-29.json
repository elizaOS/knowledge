Solution: Added `try-catch` to detect lockout and suggested tagging the agent as automated.\n- **Rabbi-Trader Plugin Setup:** Missing `.env` variables prevented execution. Solution: Provided required keys and runtime setup.\n- **Docker Build Issues:** Builds were failing due to missing dependencies. Solution: Adjusted Dockerfile to ensure correct paths and dependencies.\n- **Memory Management & RAG Knowledge:** Duplicate memories and missing embeddings were reported. Solution: Implemented `runtime.messageManager.removeMemory()` for manual deletion.",

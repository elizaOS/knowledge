The solution was to use `npx elizaos plugins install <plugin-name>` instead of `pnpm add`.\n- **RAG Knowledge Implementation**: Users struggled with configuring RAG knowledge storage and retrieval. The recommended approach was to store knowledge in `characters/knowledge/<agent-name>` and use `.md` files instead of `.pdf`.\n- **Twitter & Discord Client Setup**: Users were confused about defining clients in `character.json`. The correct setup required adding clients to both `clients` and `plugins` arrays.\n- **WebSocket Event Handling**: WebSocket-triggered actions only appeared once in chat. The solution was to use `processActions` in the agent’s runtime to trigger actions dynamically.\n- **Dependency & Installation Issues**: Users faced `pnpm install` errors, especially on Windows. The recommended fix was to use WSL2 or ensure correct Node.js and build tools were installed.\n- **Custom Plugin Development**: Users asked about structuring plugins for data fetching and trading signals. The solution was to implement `Provider` interfaces and define actions for routing requests.\n- **Hosting & Deployment**: Users asked about hosting ElizaOS with Next.js or React. The recommended approach was to run ElizaOS on a long-running server alongside the frontend.",

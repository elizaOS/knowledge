New project structure includes namespaced environment variables.\n- **Docker Issues**: Builds were failing due to missing dependencies and incorrect paths. A revised Dockerfile was tested to ensure proper execution.\n- **Twitter Client Issues**: Users faced setup issues in v2. The `client-twitter` plugin must be installed separately, and shadowbanning was reported due to missing 'automated profile' settings.\n- **Memory & Embedding Issues**: Users reported memory issues with RAG and embedding input validation errors. OpenRouter does not support embeddings, but the database does.\n- **Local AI Model Support**: The `plugin-local-ai` plugin supports Ollama API for local LLMs, requiring specific environment variables.",

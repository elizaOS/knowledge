(`odilitime`, `dankvr`)\n- **Docker Deployment Issues**: Debugging missing `ts-node` module and incorrect paths in the container. (`hashwarlock`, `mr.stark_`)\n- **Twitter Client Issues**: Shadowbanning due to missing 'automated profile' setting. (`definiteoptimist`)\n- **Plugin Registry Issues**: Missing `plugin-image`, `plugin-video`, and `plugin-tts` from the registry. (`0xn1c0`, `odilitime`)\n- **Eliza V2 Migration & CLI Issues**: `npx @elizaos/cli start` fails due to missing dependencies. (`dankvr`, `odilitime`)\n- **Local LLM Support**: No clear plugin for Ollama API, but `plugin-local-ai` was found and configured for DeepSeek models. (`chris.troutner`)\n- **Multi-Agent Setup**: Running multiple agents with separate Twitter accounts using namespaced environment variables. (`new.moon`)\n- **Eliza Diary Network Proposal**: A decentralized network for agents and plugins to register, share trust scores, and train LLMs. (`doriand0963`, `vkaykun`)\n",

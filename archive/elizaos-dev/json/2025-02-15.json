          "text": "### Technical Discussions & Problem-Solving\n\n- **WebSocket Event Handling**: Users discussed handling WebSocket-triggered events in Actions. The recommended approach is using `processActions` in the agent’s runtime instead of Actions.\n- **Memory & Learning Current Events**: Users explored ways to make Eliza learn real-time events. The suggested solution was using a provider with an RSS feed.\n- **Docker Deployment Issues**: Several users faced Docker build failures due to incorrect module paths. The solution involved modifying the Dockerfile to ensure dependencies were correctly installed.\n- **Plugin Installation & Registry Issues**: Users encountered issues installing plugins, particularly missing registry entries. The recommendation was to manually install missing plugins.\n- **Twitter Client Issues**: Users reported failures in connecting the Twitter client. The solution was ensuring `@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter` was installed and added to `plugins` in `character.json`.\n- **Multi-Agent Setup**: Users asked about running multiple agents with different Twitter accounts. The solution involved using namespaced environment variables.\n- **Embedding & RAG Knowledge Issues**: Users faced issues with embedding failures and RAG ingestion. The recommendation was debugging the database setup and ensuring knowledge was stored in `characters/knowledge/agent-name`.\n- **Eliza V2 Migration**: Users inquired about the transition from Eliza Starter to Eliza V2. The new command `npx elizaos start` will replace the old setup.\n- **Local LLM Support (Ollama)**: Users found that `plugin-local-ai` supported Ollama but was not listed in the registry. The solution was configuring environment variables correctly.\n",

          "text": "### Plugin Development & Contributions\n\n- **Plugin Contributions & Access Requests**: Several users submitted PRs to the `elizaos-plugins/registry` repo to add new plugins. Maintainer access was requested by some users, and guidance was provided on structuring plugin repositories.\n- **Plugin Installation & Activation**: Users asked how to activate merged plugins. The solution was using `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name` and adding it to the character file.\n- **New Plugins Announced**: Users introduced new plugins, including an Unreal Engine communication plugin, a token prediction plugin, and a Web3 marketing automation tool.\n- **Tech-Support Bot**: A user proposed a tech-support bot using ElizaOS, focusing on JavaScript, Bitcoin, and GitHub, with plans to integrate with Telegram and Nostr.\n- **AI Agent Platform**: A new platform, `aigent.sh`, was introduced to make AI agents accessible to non-technical users, powered by ElizaOS.\n",

          "text": "### Common Issues & Solutions\n\n- **Twitter Polls**: Not possible without an X API key.\n- **Agent JSON Replies**: Some agents mistakenly replied with JSON. The solution was adjusting prompt formatting.\n- **Line Breaks in Replies**: Users needed to edit prompts to handle formatting better.\n- **Dependency Issues on Windows**: Users faced `pnpm install` issues. The solution was switching to WSL2, though some unmet peer dependencies persisted.\n- **Pull Requests Best Practices**: Recommended submitting smaller PRs grouped by feature for easier review.\n- **Multi-Platform Agent Support**: ElizaOS supports multiple platforms, including Discord, Twitter, and Telegram.\n- **Docker Build Issues**: The recommended solution was using `pnpm docker` to build and run.\n- **LLM Processing Flow**: Two LLMs are used—one decides if the agent should respond, the other generates the response.\n- **Provider Setup**: Providers fetch external data and inject it into LLM prompts, defined in `packages/core/src/providers.ts`.\n- **Real-Time Crypto Data for Agents**: Requires a database, an Eliza provider, and defined actions for data processing.\n",

          "text": "### Key Technical Discussions & Solutions\n\n- **Docker Build Issues:** Users faced missing dependencies and incorrect paths in Docker builds for v0.19 and v2. The issue was traced to missing files from `pnpm install`. A refined Dockerfile was proposed to explicitly copy dependencies and built artifacts.\n- **Hardlinking Issues in Docker:** Some dependencies were being hardlinked, causing path issues. The solution was to modify the Dockerfile to avoid hardlinking.\n- **Twitter & Discord Client Issues:** Users struggled with configuring Twitter and Discord clients. The correct setup required installing `@elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter` and `@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter`, but only adding the client to the `plugins` list.\n- **Authentication Errors with Akash Chat API:** Users encountered `401 Authentication Errors`, which were resolved by checking API key formats and `.env` configurations.\n- **Multi-Agent Setup:** Users wanted to run multiple agents with different Twitter accounts. The solution was to use namespaced environment variables.\n- **Local AI Model Integration:** Users explored using the Ollama API for local AI models. The `plugin-local-ai` was found to support Ollama, but it was not listed in the registry.\n- **V2 Migration & CLI Issues:** Users asked if v2 was stable for production and reported CLI issues (`npx @elizaos/cli start` not working). The recommendation was to break down issues into separate GitHub tickets.\n- **Cloudflare Blocking Twitter Logins:** Cloudflare was blocking Twitter logins for agents running in Docker. A related GitHub issue was linked for tracking.\n- **SQLite Module Errors:** Users faced missing SQLite bindings. The solution was to run `pnpm add better-sqlite3@latest --force` and `npm rebuild better-sqlite3`.\n- **Twitter Bot Shadowban:** Some Twitter bots were getting shadowbanned. The recommended fix was to mark the account as \"automated\" in settings.\n- **Embedding Issues:** Some users faced embedding errors, but no clear resolution was provided.\n- **Twitch Client Loop Issue:** A user encountered an infinite loop when integrating Twitch chat. The solution was to implement message deduplication and ensure the agent does not respond to its own messages.\n- **Browser Plugin Issues:** The browser plugin was broken due to Chrome’s removal of the old headless mode.\n",

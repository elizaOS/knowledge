          "text": "### Technical Discussions & Problem-Solving\n- **Rabbi-Trader Plugin Setup Issues**: Users faced difficulties configuring the Rabbi-Trader plugin due to missing API keys and incorrect environment variable settings. Solution: Ensure `.env` contains `SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY`, `SOLANA_PUBLIC_KEY`, `BIRDEYE_API_KEY`, and other required keys.\n- **Plugin Loading & Runtime Issues**: Users had trouble dynamically loading plugins. Solution: Use `createRabbiTraderPlugin()` inside `createAgent` and ensure the runtime is correctly initialized.\n- **Twitter Client Not Working**: Users reported issues with the Twitter client not posting. Solution: Twitter was moved to a plugin-based system; install it using `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/client-twitter` and add it to the character file.\n- **Discord Client Setup Issues**: Users struggled to configure the Discord client. Solution: Install it using `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/client-discord` and add it to the character file under `plugins`.\n- **Docker Deployment Issues**: Users faced issues running Eliza in Docker due to missing dependencies and incorrect paths. Solution: Modify the Dockerfile to ensure dependencies are installed correctly and paths are properly set.\n- **Memory Management & RAG Knowledge**: Users had issues with memory retrieval and embedding errors. Solution: Ensure `USE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING` is set correctly and check `.env` for embedding model configurations.\n- **Multi-Agent Setup**: Users wanted to run multiple agents with different Twitter accounts. Solution: Use namespaced environment variables for each agent and load them dynamically in the character file.\n- **Ollama API Integration**: Users wanted to use Ollama for local LLMs. Solution: Use `plugin-local-ai` and set `OLLAMA_SERVER_URL` in `.env`.",

Solution: It is randomly chosen from `composeState` in `runtime.ts`.\n- **WebSocket Event Handling**: Users wanted to trigger actions based on WebSocket events. Solution: Use `processActions` in the agent’s runtime.\n- **RAG Knowledge Storage**: Users explored how RAG knowledge is stored. Solution: It is initialized at startup and cannot be changed dynamically.\n- **Plugin Installation Issues**: Users faced issues installing plugins. Solution: `plugin-trustdb` was identified as a cause and removing it resolved the issue.\n- **Twitch Client Loop Issue**: Users faced an infinite loop in `client-twitch`. Solution: Filter out agent-generated messages and ensure actions return JSON responses.",

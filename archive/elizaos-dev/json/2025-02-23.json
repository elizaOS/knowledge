Plugins should now be added as strings in the `plugins[]` array.\n- **Discord & Twitter Client Issues**: Users reported issues with the Discord client in v0.25.8 and the Twitter client, which was removed from the core and must now be installed separately.\n- **Docker Issues**: Missing dependencies (`ts-node`, `adapter-pglite`) were reported, and a fix was proposed to modify the Dockerfile.\n- **Memory Management & RAG**: Users faced issues embedding knowledge into the RAG system and dealing with duplicate memories.\n- **CLI & Plugin Registry**: The plugin registry was updated to remove duplicate or outdated entries, and `npx elizaos plugins add` was failing due to missing dependencies.\n- **V2 Migration**: V2 requires migration, with `npx elizaos start` replacing `eliza-starter` and CLI improvements like `npm create eliza` for project setup.",

Solution: Use `pnpm docker` to build and run.\n- **SQLite Errors**: Running `pnpm add better-sqlite3@latest --force` and `npm rebuild better-sqlite3` resolved issues.\n- **Twitter Plugin Issues**: Redundant posts and shadowbanning were reported. Adjusting `modelConfig` settings helped mitigate the problem.\n- **Telegram IPv6 Issues**: Modifying the Telegram client to force IPv4 resolved connection problems.\n- **Discord Client in v2**: Needs to be added as a plugin instead of a client.",

Solutions included clean installs (`rm -rf node_modules; pnpm store prune; reinstall`) and adjusting Dockerfile paths.\n- **Plugin Installation & Management**: Users discussed installing plugins like `client-discord` and `client-twitter` in v2. The correct method is `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name`.\n- **Memory Management & RAG Integration**: Agents were repeating responses due to ineffective memory usage. The fix involved using `runtime.messageManager.removeMemory`.\n- **Multi-Agent Setup**: Users configured multiple agents using namespaced environment variables.\n- **Twitter Client Issues**: Bots were getting shadowbanned, and the solution was marking accounts as 'automated' in Twitter settings.\n- **Local LLM Support**: Users set up local AI models using `plugin-local-ai` with environment variables like `OLLAMA_SERVER_URL`.\n- **REST API & Authentication**: A proposal was made to add `AUTH_KEY` to `.env` for securing API requests.",

Develop branch failed to retrieve knowledge from character files, while v0.1.8 failed to load knowledge from directories.\n- **Twitter Image Vision Bug**: Image recognition worked on Telegram but not Twitter. Investigation assigned.\n- **Docker Build Issues**: Debugged failures due to incorrect module paths. A revised Dockerfile was tested.\n- **Discord Client Not Starting**: Resolved by ensuring the Discord client was added as a plugin, not a client.\n- **Twitter Client Not Posting**: Fixed by installing both `plugin-twitter` and `client-twitter`.\n- **Ollama API Integration**: Confirmed that `plugin-local-ai` supports Ollama API and provided `.env` configuration.",

Solutions included ensuring the correct plugin (`@elizaos-plugins/plugin-twitter`) was installed and configured.\n- **Discord Client Setup**: The Discord client now requires installation as a plugin instead of a client.\n- **Docker Deployment Issues**: Users encountered missing dependencies and incorrect paths. A revised Dockerfile was proposed to fix module resolution issues.\n- **Memory Management & RAG**: Issues with knowledge ingestion and retrieval were reported. Solutions included verifying directory paths and ensuring embeddings were correctly configured.\n- **Multi-Agent Setup**: Users explored running multiple agents with separate environments. The recommended approach is to use namespaced environment variables.\n- **Plugin Registry & Installation**: Some plugins were missing from the registry (`plugin-image`, `plugin-video`, `plugin-tts`). Users were advised to install them manually or wait for updates.\n- **Authentication & API Key Issues**: Several users faced authentication errors with OpenAI, Akash, and other APIs. Solutions included ensuring API keys were correctly formatted and included the `Bearer` prefix.",

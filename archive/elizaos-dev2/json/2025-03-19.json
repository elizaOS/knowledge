Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around users trying to install and use Eliza v2 beta, which is currently experiencing various installation and setup issues. Users are struggling with the CLI commands, dependencies like bun, and getting agents to appear in their installations. Shaw and jin provide troubleshooting assistance throughout the conversation. The v2 version is officially in beta status and not yet considered stable for production business use, though some developers are using it for hobby projects. There are discussions about LLM models that work well with Eliza, with deepseek-r1:14b being highlighted as particularly good at following instructions despite not being the fastest. Several bugs are reported, including migration errors, missing default agents, and installation problems. The team acknowledges these issues and is prioritizing fixes for the beta release.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Should we start using v2 or should we wait until merged to main? Is it stable enough to use in production? (asked by 0xn1c0) A: I don't think it's stable enough to be used in production for a business. It's officially in beta. But I'm using it for my new hobby project.

NaN announced a project called aigent.sh, which aims to make AI Agents accessible to non-technical users. The platform is built using ElizaOS technology. NaN mentioned that they are releasing daily updates and requested feedback, offering prioritized early access to those who send a direct message. Odilitime responded with a brief question about whether the project had been submitted to \"the registry\" (presumably an AI agent registry or catalog).\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in üìÆÔΩúfeedback Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion centers on a technical issue encountered while building a crypto wallet with an Eliza agent. ShisukeUrahara describes a problem where the agent fails to recognize when a wallet has been funded after previously determining there were insufficient funds. Specifically, when the user requests to transfer ETH and the agent determines there are insufficient funds, the agent continues to reference this outdated information even after the wallet has been funded. The only workaround found was to delete the memories table from the database, forcing the agent to check the current balance instead of relying on conversation history. This highlights a significant limitation in how the agent handles state changes that occur outside its direct observation (like on-chain transactions) and suggests a need for improved context management for financial applications.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there any better way to deal with the issue of agents not recognizing external state changes like wallet funding? (asked by ShisukeUrahara) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nNo help interactions were present in this chat segment.\n\n## 4. Action Items\nType: Technical | Description: Implement a mechanism for agents to recognize external state changes (like on-chain transactions) without requiring memory deletion | Mentioned By: ShisukeUrahara\nType: Feature | Description: Add functionality for crypto wallet agents to verify current balances rather than relying solely on conversation history | Mentioned By: ShisukeUrahara",

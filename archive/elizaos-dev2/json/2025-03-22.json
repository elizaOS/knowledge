      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around technical issues with ElizaOS installation, plugin integration, and version compatibility. Users encountered problems with package naming discrepancies, where the documented plugin name (`@elizaos/plugin-discord`) differed from the actual working package (`@elizaos-plugins/client-discord`). Several users reported difficulties setting up ElizaOS with both alpha and beta versions, encountering dependency errors and import issues with CommonJS modules. Specifically, one user faced an error with the EventEmitter import from eventemitter3. Twitter integration was another pain point, with users experiencing \"339 errors\" when deploying to servers despite working locally. There were also questions about MCP (Multi-Chain Protocol) support, which appears to have a recently announced plugin. A user submitted a PR to fix documentation discrepancies. Several users expressed interest in contributing to the project or participating in demo events.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are we able to use eliza agent on the beta?

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around the challenges with ElizaOS's current development state, particularly the transition between versions. Users are experiencing significant difficulties with the v1.0.0-beta builds, especially in Docker environments. LucaTripsCommunity detailed extensive problems with dependency management, native addon compilation (sharp, @discordjs/opus), system dependencies (libvips), and Node.js version incompatibilities when trying to deploy to AWS Linux. The v2 version is in development with Shaw mentioning they're about a week away from moving out of beta. Several users are asking whether to wait for v2 or attempt to work with the current beta. There's also discussion about a separate project called \"auto.fun\" that the team is launching soon. Technical help is being offered for database modifications in v2, with Mike D. sharing GitHub links to patches for changing database columns and managing logging. The chat indicates ElizaOS is an agent framework with some relationship to LangChain but positioned differently in the stack.\n\n## 2.

The first message from elamore announces that their \"eliza\" project was accepted into the Gitcoin Grant GG23 and requests donations. They explain the matching mechanism where small donations get amplified ($1 becomes $25, $10 becomes $80, $100 becomes $260) and provide instructions for ensuring donations get matched. The second message from Nisita briefly suggests that something mentioned could make a good tutorial for dev school. There are no technical discussions, problem-solving, or implementations shared in this limited exchange.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How does Gitcoin's matching mechanism amplify donations? (asked by elamore) A: $1 turns into $25, $10 turns into $80, and $100 turns into $260 (answered by elamore)\n\n## 3.

Users are troubleshooting the correct syntax for running the tool, specifically for a \"create\" command. The discussion reveals that using `npx <@939803885915222096>os/cli@beta create` is the current working approach rather than directly calling `elizaos create`. Jin mentions that the documentation recommends installing the CLI first before use. The conversation touches on the need for better testing of documentation instructions and the possibility of implementing CI tests across different operating systems (Mac/PC/Linux) to ensure commands work as documented. Sayonara indicates plans to work on CI implementation in the coming week. Odilitime clarifies that the command works if the tool is installed locally in the project.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How should the CLI tool be executed currently? (asked by sayonara) A: Use `npx <@939803885915222096>os/cli@beta create` for now (answered by sayonara)\nQ: Does the direct `elizaos create` command work? (implied by sayonara) A: It works if you have it installed in the local project (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat segment contains a brief discussion about a bug in earlier versions of an AI agent system where action names like \"(CONTINUE)\" would leak into the agent's responses. The user mindxploit inquires if this bug has been fixed in version 1.0 or Eliza, and asks for the specific commit that addressed the issue. Ruby responds that they don't have direct access to the codebase but suggests checking GitHub issues and PRs or contacting core developers. mindxploit mentions that the bug doesn't appear to be present in version 0.25.9 which they're using, and states they might fix it themselves if needed.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Did the bug of the (CONTINUE) or other action names present in the answer been fixed in the new 1.0 version or Eliza? (asked by mindxploit) A: I don't have direct access to the codebase or changelogs for Eliza 1.0, but you might want to check the GitHub repo issues and PRs. The action name leakage was definitely a known bug in earlier versions. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Do we have any agent that I can ask similar stuff to and he knows the codebase and changelog to answer? (asked by mindxploit) A: You could ping the core devs in #development for the specific commit history. (answered by Ruby)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Eliza development, focusing on v2 features and plugin architecture. Key technical discussions include environment configuration for running multiple agents independently, namespacing for agent-specific credentials, and REST API documentation. Jin worked on documentation cleanup and REST API documentation, eventually creating a page at elizaos.github.io without using Swagger. Mike D mentioned working on a memory system and suggested adopting TypeBox for JSON-to-TypeScript transformations. Shaw provided guidance on namespacing for running multiple Twitter agents with different credentials. Docker-related optimizations were discussed for v2, and there were questions about fine-tuning models and embedding functionality. The team also worked on repository management, unarchiving plugins like plugin-rabbi-trader and clarifying the status of various Solana plugins.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How to create and install my custom plugin in eliza? (asked by Robbie) A: Checkout the stable eliza or checkout develop. Start with it. (answered by nittile)\nQ: How useful is Eliza when it comes to be relevant to the information shared in the past? (asked by Shiva M) A: I am working on the memory system right now, will let you know (answered by Mike D.)\nQ: Is anyone working on integrating the new Responses API from openai into eliza? (asked by 0xn1c0) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is it possible to generate text in multi-language other than english? (asked by Vijay T.) A: I tried a bit a while back but there was a lot of hard coded english in the plugins etc., need to check what v2 is planning (answered by Mike D.)\nQ: How do I run agents on their separate environments? (asked by Benquik) A: It's set up so you can run multiple agents independently, but they are all in a single environment technically. Someone added namespacing that works with environment variables. (answered by shaw)\nQ: What are people using to finetune? (asked by phonique_) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is \"System\" still going to be used in v2? (asked by PENDINGREALITY) A: I believe it is (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: How do I use my finetuned data in elizaos?

In this brief segment, only two messages were shared. Shiva M introduced a Web3 Narrative marketing platform called \"trymeo.fun\" that integrates with Eliza OS Brain to automate content creation, scheduling, and analytics. The platform allows users to edit AI-generated drafts before posting to connected channels, schedule automated replies, and collect performance statistics to improve future content. The second message from DorianD was unrelated to any project and contained a joke about the Bitcoin creator's pseudonym.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Could we share links in here without getting banned?

Summary\nThe Discord chat segment covers discussions about ElizaOS plugin development, hosting, and AI model training. Users are seeking guidance on creating custom plugins for ElizaOS, structuring plugins with multiple features, hosting ElizaOS like a React project, and training models for data retrieval based on descriptions. The conversation shows developers at different stages of implementing agent-based systems, with specific questions about plugin architecture, deployment options, and integration with frameworks like Next.js. Only one concrete solution was provided, confirming that ElizaOS can run alongside a client in a long-running server environment, but not in serverless/static deployments.\n\n## 2.

Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around a security incident where Shaw's Twitter account was compromised, with community members alerting each other about fake tweets containing potential scam links. Before this incident, there was a technical discussion about implementing real-time data fetching in Eliza using WebSockets. A user named ualp asked whether Actions or Evaluators would be better for displaying real-time Raydium liquidity data from a third-party API. Odilitime suggested checking another channel for the answer. There was also a brief discussion about creating providers for current time/news functionality, with Odilitime pointing to the plugin-bootstrap's time provider as an example and suggesting RSS feeds for news. The chat concludes with Shaw acknowledging the Twitter hack without providing details on how it occurred.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How can I fetch real-time data and prompt users when certain events occur using WebSockets? (asked by ualp.) A: Odilitime mentioned answering in another channel (#1324089429727514674)\nQ: Where can I find documentation on memory and learning current events? (asked by p0pps) A: Odilitime suggested creating a provider similar to the time provider in plugin-bootstrap and using fetch with RSS feeds for news\nQ: Who is working on a Roblox plugin? (asked by James Young) A: Odilitime mentioned seeing people talk about one but didn't provide specific names\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat segment shows a brief interaction between BlockEater from OmniFlix Network and Odilitime regarding a GitHub pull request and repository access. BlockEater submitted PR #57 to the elizaos-plugins/registry repository and requested maintainer access to the plugin-omniflix repository. Odilitime acknowledged the request, mentioning they would handle it from their laptop the following morning. The next day, Odilitime confirmed sending an invite, which BlockEater acknowledged with thanks.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can I request maintainer access for our plugin-omniflix repo?

      "summary": "# Analysis of \"ðŸ¤–ï½œagent-dev-school\" Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focuses on technical aspects of ElizaOS agent development. A key discussion revolves around handling WebSocket events within the agent architecture, specifically for real-time data processing from third-party APIs. Odilitime explains that standard constructs aren't suitable for WebSocket events, suggesting direct calls to an agent's runtime's processActions as a workaround. Another significant topic addresses RAG knowledge management in ElizaOS, with 0xMAR$H exploring how knowledge files are stored and accessed, noting that the knowledge root is defined at runtime initialization in the characters/knowledge directory. There's also a brief question about implementing automatic text-to-speech for all agent responses, and clarification that ElizaOS is a Node.js application that leverages LLMs via standard APIs, designed to be blockchain-agnostic despite its initial Solana focus.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can WebSocket events be handled within Actions, or should I use Evaluators? (asked by ualp.) A: Standard constructs won't help with WebSocket events; you can make a WebSocket event call an agent's runtime's processActions to call a specific action (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: How exactly does ragKnowledge work and where does it store data? (asked by 0xMAR$H) A: It uses the knowledge root directory defined in runtime.ts, located at \"../characters/knowledge\" relative to the current working directory (answered by 0xMAR$H)\nQ: Is there a way to make every answer from Eliza a TTS answer without explicitly prompting for it? (asked by imtnf) A: Unanswered\nQ: What is ElizaOS built on? (asked by bithiah) A: ElizaOS is a Node.js application that leverages LLMs via standard APIs, initially targeting Solana but blockchain-agnostic (answered by AltCoinAlpinist and Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

User \"pluto\" suggests adding more granular options for actions, specifically the ability to reply to comments on posts by targeted users rather than just replying to the targeted users' posts directly. This would allow for generating engagement with followers of influential accounts. \"Odilitime\" initially thought this functionality might already exist and directed \"pluto\" to check the environment.ts file in the client-twitter source directory. After clarification of the request, \"Odilitime\" acknowledged that implementing this feature would require writing new code.\n\n## 2.

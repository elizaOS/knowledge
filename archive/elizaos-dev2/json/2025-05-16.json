A user inquired about tools similar to ElizaOS but specifically for LinkedIn, focusing on commenting on others' posts rather than just replying or posting. Another user suggested that a LinkedIn client might have existed in version 0.x and mentioned that browser-use tools could accomplish this. The original user confirmed they had attempted a browser-use solution but found it less reliable than desired and noted they couldn't implement personality features similar to the character functionality in Eliza.\n\n## 2. FAQ:\nQ: Does anyone know of something like ElizaOS but for LinkedIn? The normal automation tools are for either replying or posting but I am looking for one that would let me comment on other's posts (asked by aith) A: I believe there was a LinkedIn client on 0.x but I maybe wrong! It's possible with browser use tools tho (answered by sayonara)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe conversation revolves around a user (Ramiroo) attempting to configure an AI agent with token limitations to prevent failures. Ramiroo initially asks about the folder2knowledge command and whether it requires OpenAI or Anthropic API keys. Ruby clarifies that it works with the default mxbai-embed-large model through Ollama locally. \n\nThe main technical discussion focuses on configuring token limits for an AI agent using OpenRouter. Ramiroo encounters persistent errors where his configuration attempts to set max_tokens to 512, but the system keeps defaulting to 8192 tokens, exceeding his free tier limit of 971 tokens. Ruby provides several troubleshooting steps, including:\n- Adding max_tokens settings in both the character JSON and .env file\n- Changing the model from hermes-3-llama-3.1-405b to alternative models like meta-llama/llama-2-13b-chat\n- Adding a 'parameters' field to override other settings\n- Trying different model names as some endpoints were renamed or unavailable\n\nDespite multiple configuration attempts with different models (llama-3-8b, meta-llama/llama-2-13b-chat, meta-llama/llama-2-13b-chat-hf, mistral/mistral-7b-instruct), the system continues to default to 8192 tokens, causing 402 errors due to insufficient credits on the free tier.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: If I want to use the folder2knowledge command to create a character, do I need an OpenAI or Anthropic API? (asked by Ramiroo) A: No, the folder2knowledge command works with the default mxbai-embed-large model through Ollama locally. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Is folder2knowledge still functioning? (asked by Ramiroo) A: Unanswered\nQ: Can I limit max_tokens so my AI doesn't fail? (asked by Ramiroo) A: Yes, you can set max_tokens in your character config or use the RESPONSE_LENGTH env var as a global limit. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Is there any free AI API keys that you recommend using for my agent? (asked by Ramiroo) A: Consider Mistral's free tier, Ollama's local models, or OpenRouter's free quotas, but be cautious of reliability and data privacy with free options. (answered by Ruby)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ruby | Helpee: Ramiroo | Context: Configuring max_tokens to prevent API errors | Resolution: Provided multiple configuration approaches including JSON structure and environment variables, though issue persisted\nHelper: Ruby | Helpee: Ramiroo | Context: OpenRouter model selection errors | Resolution: Suggested alternative models when original choices returned 404/400 errors\nHelper: Ruby | Helpee: Ramiroo | Context: Twitter API configuration in character JSON | Resolution: Explained proper structure for adding Twitter credentials under the secrets block\nHelper: Ruby | Helpee: Ramiroo | Context: Character JSON structure validation | Resolution: Confirmed correct syntax and suggested adding model field at same level as modelProvider\n\n## 4.

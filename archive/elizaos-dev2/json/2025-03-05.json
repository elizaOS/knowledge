      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in ðŸ’¬ï½œgeneral\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around Docker deployment issues with Eliza. Mr. Stark reported that Docker builds that previously worked were now failing with path-related errors, specifically with module paths being incorrectly referenced as `/app/agent/node_modules/@elizaos/adapter-pglite/dist/index.js` instead of `/app/agent/node_modules/adapter-pglite/dist/index.js`. Agent Joshua and Mr. Stark collaborated on troubleshooting, testing various Dockerfile configurations. The issue appears to be related to hardcoded paths in the codebase rather than the Dockerfile itself. Jin also mentioned issues with knowledge ingestion using SQLite and Supabase adapters, particularly with the \"eliza-news\" folder. Other topics included plugin development, client connectivity issues, and RAG implementation challenges. The conversation highlights ongoing development challenges with both v1 and v2 versions of Eliza.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why can't I set up CDP keys?

(asked by Mr. Stark) A: The issue appears to be a path problem where the app is looking for modules in `/app/agent/node_modules/@elizaos/...` but they're actually in `/app/agent/node_modules/...` (answered by Agent Joshua â‚± | TEE)\nQ: How could I use folder2knowledge? (asked by Robbie) A: Check the documentation at https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/core/characterfile/#knowledge-path-configuration (answered by Mr. Stark)\nQ: I'm having trouble trying to do swaps and bridges with EVM plugin, it appears to have an issue with decimals.

A user (cryptoAsi) inquired about activating plugins after merging them into the plugin registry. Odilitime provided a concise solution using the npm package manager to install plugins via command line. Another user (Zaperox) announced the development of a plugin enabling communication between Unreal Engine and Eliza instances. The conversation was brief but touched on important aspects of the ElizaOS plugin ecosystem: installation, registration, and integration with external platforms.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: After merging the plugin into the plugin registry at elizaos-plugins/registry, how do I activate and use it? (asked by cryptoAsi) A: `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name` and then add it to your plugins section in character file (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: cryptoAsi | Context: User needed to know how to activate a plugin after merging it into the registry | Resolution: Provided command to install plugin via npx and instructions to add it to the character file\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in ðŸ“®ï½œfeedback Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat contains two separate technical issues with Eliza. First, Liu#001 reported an issue with Telegram bot integration where they followed the documentation but couldn't get responses from Eliza after configuration. They provided their environment setup showing the Telegram token in .env and the client configuration in character.json. Second, Kenk shared feedback from dudeamir who built a matchmaking agent and encountered performance issues when multiple users (20 people) interacted simultaneously at an event with 200 attendees. The system became slow with poor UX. Dudeamir also mentioned the need to store Telegram chatIDs for follow-up messages, noting they had to modify the core client adapter to export this information.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do I get Eliza to respond on Telegram after configuration? (asked by Liu#001) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat segment discusses several technical aspects of agent development, particularly around integrating agents with external services and data sources. A key discussion revolves around creating agents that can search DeFi protocols to find yield opportunities and analyze/report on them. There's also interest in implementing real-time synchronization with databases like Supabase, where agents can be created and managed directly through database connections. \n\nOne user reported an issue with Telegram bot integration in Eliza, providing their configuration details but not receiving responses. Another user mentioned implementing a knowledge upload feature and offered to create a PR if it would be useful.\n\nA significant technical solution proposed was wrapping agents into FastAPI services, with one user mentioning they had already implemented this approach with a graph agent from LangGraph with web3 nodes. The discussion also touched on distribution methods for agents, with a recommendation to check out LangGraph's functional API.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there a way to make an agent search DeFi to find yield opportunities and analyze/report on them? (asked by NB) A: Yes, this is possible. You can start by building a tool for an API that has access to that type of data. (answered by dreadwulf)\nQ: Does Eliza sync in an asynchronous way or on launch? (asked by Magicred1) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why isn't my Telegram bot responding after configuring it according to the documentation? (asked by Liu#001) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: dreadwulf | Helpee: NB | Context: Creating an agent to search DeFi for yield opportunities | Resolution: Suggested building a tool for an API with relevant data access and wrapping the agent into FastAPI\nHelper: mindxploit | Helpee: Community | Context: Knowledge upload implementation | Resolution: Mentioned having implemented this feature and offered to create a PR if needed\n\n## 4.

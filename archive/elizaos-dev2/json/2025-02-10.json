Summary:\nThe channel discussions primarily focused on ElizaOS plugin development, integration issues, and technical troubleshooting. Key technical topics included fixing the `suppressInitialMessage` functionality for Twitter client, which was causing duplicate agent replies. There were discussions about connecting to packages after recent changes to the plugin system, with suggestions to install dependencies from registry/index.json and use npm link or local paths for development. Community members worked on various plugins including MultiversX and Twitter Spaces integration. The Twitter Spaces feature is functional but experiencing performance issues with slow response times (5-10 seconds) and occasional crashes. There were also mentions of plugin registry management and requests for documentation on the new plugin system.\n\n## 2.

Ruby mentions that packages have been moved to a self-hosted registry, but there appears to be confusion about the correct documentation URL and registry location. Ruby initially provides incorrect URLs (docs.elizaos.dev/packages and docs.eliza.dev/setup) before acknowledging the mistake. Odilitime clarifies that a package registry exists and more information will be provided later that day. The conversation reveals an ongoing transition to new infrastructure with some communication gaps about the correct access points for developers.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Hey, how do we connect to the package now that they are been removed?

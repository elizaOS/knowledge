Several users are experiencing difficulties with the sui-plugin, particularly with executing transfer actions. There's discussion about documentation needs, with users noting gaps in plugin documentation. AltCoinAlpinist, a new contributor, is seeking guidance on where to start contributing to the codebase. Users are also discussing deployment options, with questions about VPS providers and model selection for agents. Odilitime mentions working on a replacement for something (likely a plugin or feature) and plans to cut a 0.25.7 release. Several users report redundancy issues with Twitter automation, where agents post similar content with different wording. Solutions suggested include deleting SQLite databases, trying different models, and adding more examples to character files.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Has anyone ever tried transferring sui using sui-plugin?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: ü§ñÔΩúagent-dev-school\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion primarily focused on technical aspects of agent development, particularly around template implementation and plugin integration. Users were troubleshooting how template variables like `{{topic}}` are populated in the Twitter post template system. Odilitime clarified that topics are randomly chosen from the character configuration and directed users to check the `composeState` in the runtime.ts file. There were also questions about plugin setup issues, with red underline errors being reported by xingyen who was trying to create a simple \"helloworld\" plugin following Shaw's YouTube tutorial. Another user (Wahzammo) shared success in getting an agent running from localhost as a Discord bot, though mentioned some remaining issues. The conversation revealed specific file locations for troubleshooting, including agent/package.json for workspace configuration and the core runtime.ts file for template variable handling.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: From where do we feed {{topic}} in the twitterPostTemplate? (asked by 0xMAR$H) A: It's randomly chosen from topic, composeState in runtime (in core) is where all the prompt tags live (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: How to fix these red-underline errors? (asked by xingyen) A: Check `agent/package.json` they need to include the workspace for each of those plugins (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Is there another agent dev school like Shaw did but more focused on setup without the theory? (asked by pelpa) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

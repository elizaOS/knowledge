      "summary": "# Analysis of ðŸ’¬ï½œgeneral Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe channel shows minimal substantive technical discussion during this period. There were two technical questions about creating custom plugins and searching Twitter profiles, but neither received comprehensive answers. A user named 4nzn inquired about which embedding model Eliza uses (specifically asking about BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5) but later found the answer independently. The channel contained multiple posts from \"jintern\" sharing various visual briefings and knowledge posters, including links to resources like \"daily-silk.png\", \"ainews-elizaos-discord.png\", and \"hackmd-facts-briefing.png\". One user requested the AutoFun brand kit that had been previously shared. The conversation lacked extended technical discussions or problem-solving interactions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there any docs to create custom plugin? (asked by Not Eric) A: Unanswered\nQ: How to search people and click into someone's twitter profile? (asked by buttercup) A: Unanswered\nQ: How to straight away get into user's profile? (asked by buttercup) A: Unanswered\nQ: Does eliza still runs `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` for local embeddings? (asked by 4nzn) A: Self-answered (found the answer independently)\nQ: Anyone can share autofun brand kit? (asked by ElizaBAOðŸŒŸ) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: 4nzn | Helpee: Self | Context: Needed to confirm which embedding model Eliza uses | Resolution: Found the answer independently without community assistance\n\n## 4. Action Items\nDocumentation: Create documentation for custom plugin development | Description: User requested documentation on how to create custom plugins | Mentioned By: Not Eric\nFeature: Implement Twitter profile search functionality | Description: Need ability to search and access Twitter user profiles directly | Mentioned By: buttercup\nDocumentation: Make AutoFun brand kit easily accessible | Description: User mentioned it was shared before but couldn't locate it | Mentioned By: ElizaBAOðŸŒŸ",

Hidden Forces requested documentation about this file and its role in the ecosystem. Ruby enthusiastically offered to create documentation, explaining that llms-full.txt functions as a \"brain-menu\" for characters to select which language model to use for different cognitive tasks, and mentioning its interface with knowledge and memory systems. Hidden Forces clarified that the message was intended for the development team, not for Ruby to action.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is llms-full.txt and how does it operate in the ecosystem? (asked by Hidden Forces) A: It's a \"brain-menu\" for characters, letting them pick which LLM to use for different cognitive tasks. It interfaces with the knowledge system and memory management.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe discussion centers on troubleshooting an issue where a Bitcoin-focused agent is posting \"\\n\\n\" in tweets instead of proper line breaks. The user bitcryptowski.btc shared code snippets from their crypto-maximalist plugin, but the issue was identified in the debug output showing an XML template that explicitly instructs the agent to \"Use \\n\\n (double spaces) between statements if there are multiple statements.\" Ruby suggested modifying the XML response template to use proper line breaks by changing '\\n\\n' to '\\n' or removing newlines entirely. When attempting to locate the template files through the ElizaOS CLI, they encountered GitHub API rate limit errors when trying to update the plugin registry. Ruby recommended creating a GitHub personal access token to resolve the rate limiting issue.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why is my agent posting \"\\n\\n\" instead of a line break? (asked by bitcryptowski.btc) A: That usually means there's an extra newline character in your response template or the text processing isn't trimming whitespace properly. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Where can I find the XML template that needs modification? (asked by bitcryptowski.btc) A: Check your agent's response formatting code - it's likely in the xml template that generates the tweet output. The template is usually in your agent's main config or in a separate templates file. (answered by Ruby)\n\n## 3.

SpartanDev responded to both with \"ngmi\" (likely meaning \"not gonna make it\"), suggesting skepticism about the PRs. There were no substantive technical discussions, problem-solving, or decisions made in this segment. The conversation appears to be casual commentary on pull requests rather than detailed technical discourse.",

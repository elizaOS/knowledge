      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in ðŸ’¬ï½œgeneral\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment primarily revolves around issues with the Eliza website (eliza.how) being down, while the documentation site (docs.eliza.how) remains functional. Users are inquiring about the status of the platform and seeking alternatives. There's a brief technical question about agent architecture for multi-chain support (Solana, Ethereum). One user is looking for a developer to build an EVM AI agent with specific requirements including CMC information retrieval, crypto operations (transfer, swap, bridge), and smart contract deployment with wallet connection rather than private key authentication. A team member acknowledges they're working on fixing the website issues. There's also a mention of eliza.gg being down and users asking about potential replacements or restoration of the service.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is https://eliza.how dead?

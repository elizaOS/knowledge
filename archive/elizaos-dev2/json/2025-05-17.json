Issues mentioned include search functionality not working, a question about GPU deployment with comput3.ai, inquiry about Discord plugin capabilities for support tickets, and a question about contributing a custom plugin to the Eliza repository. One user provided information about Discord API capabilities for support ticket-like functionality using emoji reactions and automated threads.

So it should be possible. (answered by Hidden Forces)\nQ: How do I contribute/add my plugin to the Eliza official repo? Do I have to create an npm package or just create a PR?

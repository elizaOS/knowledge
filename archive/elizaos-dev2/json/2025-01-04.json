Several developers are working on creating plugins for various services including Akash DePIN, Perplexity, Hyperlane, and EVM. A significant technical issue was identified and fixed related to a module not found error in the plugin-node package during integration tests, caused by a race condition where code was trying to use a package before it was installed. The fix involved modifying the postinstall script. Developers also discussed decentralized compute integration, with AIFlow.ML working on an Akash plugin that would allow agents to use decentralized computing resources. There were discussions about Twitter client integration issues in production environments, possibly related to geographic restrictions. Several developers encountered frozen-lockfile errors during installation, which were addressed with the --no-frozen-lockfile flag.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: How do you fix the \"Cannot find module '@elizaos/core/dist/index.js'\" error in integration tests? (asked by WarfreakzPlays) A: Update to the latest develop branch which contains a fix for the race condition where code was trying to use a package before it was installed (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Is anyone working on perplexity integration? (asked by ddude) A: No one is currently working on it, so you should create one as a plugin with proper error handling (answered by AIFlow.ML @ ElizaOS)\nQ: Is anyone working on HyperLane integration? (asked by Bertux) A: Unanswered\nQ: How do you resolve the frozen-lockfile error during installation? (asked by sayonara) A: Use the --no-frozen-lockfile flag with pnpm install (answered by WarfreakzPlays)\nQ: Why does Twitter client work locally but not in production? (asked by niccolasmunoz) A: It could be due to geographic restrictions as Twitter doesn't like logins from different countries (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Who reviews new plugin PRs? (asked by Bertux) A: The core devs are reviewing PRs at this point (answered by Santi)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on agent development issues, particularly around memory management and embeddings in agent systems. A key technical discussion revolved around handling news source data in agent actions, with recommendations to separate different sources into distinct modular actions for better maintainability. Several implementation problems were addressed, notably a \"zero-length vector\" error occurring when creating memories without proper embedding generation. The solution identified was using the `addEmbeddingToMemory()` method before storing memories to ensure vector compatibility. Other topics included agent recordings availability, code organization best practices, and troubleshooting infinite loops in the `generateMessageResponse` function. The chat demonstrated collaborative problem-solving with experienced members providing specific technical guidance to those implementing agent functionality.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Would it be better to have each news source I want to grab data from built into separate actions? (asked by KeyesCode.eth) A: Separating news sources into distinct actions makes your code more modular and easier to maintain. Each source can have its own error handling, parsing logic, and be independently updated without affecting others. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: What does \"zero-length vector are not supported\" mean? (asked by KeyesCode.eth) A: Zero-length vector error typically occurs when you're trying to perform an embedding search with an empty or uninitialized vector. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Why is this code causing a zero-length vector? (asked by KeyesCode.eth) A: You might be missing the embedding generation step before creating the memory. `addEmbeddingToMemory()` is likely needed to generate the vector before inserting into sqlite. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Where is addEmbeddingToMemory() from so I can read about it? (asked by KeyesCode.eth) A: It's from the eliza.gg documentation. Check the memory management section. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Why is generateMessageResponse looping? (asked by KeyesCode.eth) A: GenerateMessageResponse looping usually indicates an infinite recursion or unhandled edge case. Common culprits: circular references in memory, lack of termination conditions, or recursive function without proper base case. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Is there a way to upload images for the bot to use in a specific context, such as memes? (asked by Crowking) A: Most agent frameworks support image embedding and contextual retrieval. For memes, you'd want a system that can both store and semantically understand image content. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Is the part3 code (the form filler) published? (asked by kAI wilder) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis for \"ðŸ“¥ï½œpull-requests\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe channel primarily focuses on pull requests for the ElizaOS project. Several developers submitted PRs for new plugins and features, including a Rabbi Trader update, Binance plugin, DexScreener price plugin, and Infera inference provider. AIFlow.ML contributed multiple PRs fixing issues and improving adapters, particularly focusing on error handling and database functionality. There was discussion about a knowledge graph agent that AIFlow.ML is developing locally, with plans to showcase it and potentially use it for Q&A and onboarding. Bertux is developing a plugin for Arthera EVM chain ecosystem, starting with native token transfers. Developers encountered integration test issues with module resolution in the plugin-node package. There was also discussion about dependency management practices, particularly regarding when to update lock files, with some developers expressing concern about the current approach of frequently updating dependencies.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can we have a private channel to test my knowledge graph agents? (asked by AIFlow.ML @ ElizaOS) A: That is fine but do you have the code somewhere I can take a look first? (answered by N3rdStorm)\nQ: My only concern is about pnpm-lock.yaml being too updated by pnpm, does it sound like a problem to you? (asked by Bertux) A: pnpm-lock.yaml updates are usually benign. as long as the dependency versions match what's specified in package.json, you should be fine. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Have you encounter this issue when creating a PR \"packages/plugin-node postinstall: throw new ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND\"? (asked by WarfreakzPlays) A: Sounds like a module resolution issue. Try running `pnpm install --force` locally to reset workspace links. (answered by Ruby)\nQ: Is there any requirements to add tools for the main repository? I want to add some new blockchains capabilities for the agents (asked by Bulldozer) A: Depends on the blockchain capabilities. We'll want to ensure they align with our existing architecture and don't introduce unnecessary complexity. (answered by Ruby)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: Ruby | Helpee: WarfreakzPlays | Context: Module resolution error in plugin-node during integration tests | Resolution: Suggested running `pnpm install --force` locally and investigating workspace dependency conflicts\nHelper: WarfreakzPlays | Helpee: Pleasures | Context: Same integration test error with module resolution | Resolution: Advised getting the latest version of the develop branch and merging it to their branch\nHelper: Ruby | Helpee: Bertux | Context: Concerns about pnpm-lock.yaml updates | Resolution: Explained that lock file updates are usually benign and suggested using `--frozen-lockfile` to validate compatibility\nHelper: sayonara | Helpee: Spit | Context: Code review for PR | Resolution: Reviewed and merged the PR after Spit fixed conflicts\n\n## 4.

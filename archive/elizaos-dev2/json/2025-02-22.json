      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around ElizaOS plugin development, registry management, and technical implementation issues. Key discussions include:\n\n- Plugin registry implementation that was planned to go live but has been delayed\n- Issues with plugins having duplicate actions (like \"transfer\") causing conflicts in execution\n- Problems with double messaging when actions are triggered, particularly with the CMC plugin\n- Concerns about the ElizaOS starter repository not working properly out of the box\n- Discussion about plugin architecture, with plugins containing both actions and providers\n- Updates to the registry PR template to make steps clearer for contributors\n- Conceptual discussion about crowdsourcing QA for plugins and creating an action registry on blockchain\n- Technical clarification that plugins stay in memory rather than terminating after task completion\n- Discussion about evaluators being primarily for high-performance scenarios like voice applications\n\nThe community also expressed concerns about fragmentation across multiple chat platforms and the impact on community cohesion.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there any free API for pulling price/mc data? (asked by Fanny) A: Try birdeye or dexscreener, they have free tiers for fetching prices (answered by SotoAlt | BOSSU)\nQ: Will the agent be self-aware of which plug-ins it is running/using in the new system with the plug-in registry? (asked by DorianD) A: No (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: If there are multiple plug-ins with a \"transfer\" or \"send\" action, how does the runtime decide which to use? (asked by DorianD) A: Basically you'll randomly get one (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Why am I getting double messages when using the CMC plugin in Telegram? (asked by Fanny) A: Must be how the CMC plugin is set up, maybe it's set up as an action instead of a provider (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Is it good practice to have Actions called based on conditionals, or is it only best practice to have actions called through conversations? (asked by 4n7m4n) A: Unanswered\nQ: How does the EdriziAI character JSON + knowledge setup work? (asked by Julian Neuss) A: Got reply on the other server (answered by Julian Neuss)\nQ: Do most community plug-ins have \"evaluators\"? (asked by DorianD) A: No core evaluators, but they're like a high performance thing people aren't really needing yet (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: How can I host the elizaOS to digital ocean? (asked by Blue Shark) A: Unanswered\nQ: Does anyone recommend a specific Twitter scraping script? (asked by Santiago N) A: Twitter scraper finetune, or theconvocation twitter scraper on github.com (answered by Osint)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of \"ðŸŽ¤ï½œplug-your-projects\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment is brief, containing only three messages. Sashimikun shared an open-source project called \"rabbitholes.dojoma.ai\" which allows users to explore topic \"rabbitholes\" (deep dives into various subjects). They mentioned plans to add an Eliza Agent to the project. Odilitime referred to it as an \"iceberg explorer,\" suggesting it helps users discover increasingly deeper or more obscure content on topics. DefiniteOptimist compared the project to StumbleUpon, a discovery engine that allowed users to explore web content based on interests.\n\n## 2.

      "summary": "The chat segment is very brief, containing only three messages. Two users asked technical questions: one about finding free APIs for cryptocurrency price/market cap data, noting that the Coingecko plugin uses a pro API; another about how to make a character talk more like \"truth_terminal\" with similar randomness and depth. A third user responded that character behavior can be modified through the system field in the character file, which serves as the system prompt.",

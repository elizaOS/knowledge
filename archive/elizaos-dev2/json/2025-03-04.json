      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around technical issues with ElizaOS, particularly Docker deployment problems and plugin development. A significant discussion centers on a Docker container path issue where modules can't be found due to incorrect paths (looking for `/app/agent/node_modules/@elizaos/adapter-[whatever]/...` instead of `/app/agent/node_modules/adapter-[whatever]/...`). Users Mr. Stark and Odilitime troubleshoot this issue extensively, with Mr. Stark providing detailed error logs. Another technical thread involves the development of a Sonic plugin for the ElizaOS ecosystem, with 0xn1c0 mentioning they've built a multi-agent system for Sonic DeFi with additional features like lending, borrowing, and cross-chain transfers. There are also discussions about knowledge ingestion issues with SQLite and Supabase adapters, with jin noting problems specifically with the \"eliza-news\" folder and compatibility issues between client-discord (which uses toUTCString) and Supabase (which requires ISO format).\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Can I run 2 characters from 2 separate environment files? (asked by Benquik) A: Simplest way is to give each agent its own start script, load shared settings from your main env then override them with your character specific env, then just run each in a separate node process. (answered by ùòÉùó∏ùóÆùòÜ)\nQ: What's the deal with the web-browser plugin? It's not available in the registry (asked by Sam) A: Unanswered\nQ: Why can't I set up CDP keys? (asked by Story) A: Unanswered\nQ: I'm having trouble trying to do swaps and bridges with EVM plugin, it appears to have an issue with decimals. Does anyone else get this issue or know the fix? (asked by Adam williams) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of \"ü§ñÔΩúagent-dev-school\" Discord Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe channel discussions focused on agent development in Eliza, particularly around API endpoints for agent creation and management. Key technical points included:\n- Agent creation via API endpoints, specifically `/agents/:agentId/set`\n- Database integration for agent management, with examples of Supabase implementation\n- Updates in the `v2-develop` branch that include database storage for agents and plugin route capabilities\n- Discussion about building specialized agents for DeFi yield opportunities using custom tools and APIs\n- Telegram bot integration issues\n- Wrapping agents in FastAPI for distribution, with references to langgraph functional API\n\nThe conversation revealed ongoing development to improve agent creation workflows, database synchronization, and distribution methods. Community members shared code examples and implementation approaches for custom agent deployments.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Is there an API endpoint to create an agent rather than doing it manually? (asked by mindxploit) A: You can use `/agents/:agentId/set` or database adapters for agents, and the v2-develop branch now has agents added to the database (answered by Magicred1 and shaw)\nQ: Is there a way to make an agent search DeFi to find yield opportunities? (asked by NB) A: Yes, by building a tool for an API that has access to that type of data (answered by dreadwulf)\nQ: Does agent synchronization happen asynchronously or on launch? (asked by Magicred1) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis: üì•ÔΩúpull-requests\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around issues with the ElizaOS plugin registry. Daniel BNV reported that after their PR (#95) was merged, all links on the official plugin registry were broken. Odilitime confirmed this wasn't due to an error on Daniel's part but rather an issue with the registry itself. \n\nPraveen from Kaia inquired about reinstating their plugin-kaia chain that was removed in PR #61. Odilitime advised creating their own repo and submitting a PR to elizaos-plugins/registry, following the checklist in the PR template. Praveen also asked about npm publishing, but Odilitime clarified they use git for distribution instead.\n\nOther activities included krustev.alexander submitting a PR (#14) for the Twitter client, adding a reflection mode that extracts valuable information from conversations and evaluates posting appropriateness. Vijay T. created a PR (#97) for a sonic blockchain plugin. Jin submitted a documentation-focused PR (#3772) to the main ElizaOS repository.\n\nThe conversation ended with Odilitime apologizing for delayed responses due to illness.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Are broken links on the official plugin registry after PR merge expected? (asked by Daniel BNV) A: No, you did everything right according to the checklist. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Should we point to our personal GitHub repo in registry/index.json? (asked by Praveen | Kaia {&}) A: Yes, point to your GitHub repo. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Will publishing to npm be done by eliza team or should we publish to our own npm? (asked by Praveen | Kaia {&}) A: We're using git to distribute not npm. (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Does this fix the double tweet posting? (asked by Redvoid) A: I haven't experienced such a bug. (answered by krustev.alexander)\n\n## 3.

A user (cryptoAsi) inquired about activating plugins after merging them into the plugin registry. Odilitime provided a solution using the npm package manager to install plugins via command line and then adding them to the character file. Separately, Zaperox announced the development of a plugin enabling communication between Eliza instances and Unreal Engine, sharing a GitHub repository link.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: After merging the plugin into the plugin registry at elizaos-plugins/registry, how do I activate and use it? (asked by cryptoAsi) A: `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/plugin-name` and then add it to your plugins section in character file (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

First, Liu#001 reported an issue with Eliza's Telegram integration where the bot doesn't respond despite proper configuration according to documentation. The user provided their environment setup showing the Telegram token in .env and the client configuration in character.json. Second, Kenk shared feedback from dudeamir who built a matchmaking agent and encountered performance issues when multiple users (20 people) interacted simultaneously at an event with 200 attendees. The system became slow with poor UX. Dudeamir also mentioned needing to access and store Telegram chatIDs for follow-up messages, which required modifying the core client adapter.\n\n## 2.

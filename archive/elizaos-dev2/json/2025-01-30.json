Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around building an AI agent that can process scraped data and generate posts for social media platforms (X and Twitter). James is seeking guidance on which plugins to use for this purpose. Odilitime suggests using the client-direct REST API to input information into the agent's memory or utilizing the web-search-plugin with a Tavily API key. The conversation touches on model options including deepseek (supported by elizaOS), OpenAI, and Anthropic. There's brief mention of fine-tuning capabilities, though Odilitime is uncertain about deepseek compatibility with the bagel fine-tuning functionality. Additionally, there's a brief mention of a plugin bounty program, with Odilitime directing users to post in a specific channel. AD suggests adding payment functionality for agent conversations using tokens and wallets.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What kind of plugins do I have to use to build an AI agent that processes scraped data and generates social media posts? (asked by James) A: Look at client-direct REST API to input information into agent memory, or web-search-plugin with Tavily API key (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Does deepseek have functions for processing data and generating posts? (asked by James) A: elizaOS supports deepseek, might need to use ollama or custom OpenAI endpoint (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Do I have to use OpenAI's finetuning function? (asked by James) A: Uncertain if bagel fine-tuning works with deepseek (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: What is the best way to submit a plugin bounty? (asked by rubinovitz) A: Just post in #1324094363868860487 (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

Summary\nThe chat primarily focuses on HyperParams, a protocol for validating and certifying AI agents both on-chain and off-chain. AIFlow.ML @ ElizaOS introduced the project, mentioning it will be 100% open source with incentives for developers and AI engineers to create better pipelines. The protocol aims to provide social platforms with an API to view certificates and connect to agents. A whitepaper was prepared and will be published on arXiv, with plans to discuss it during an upcoming space. The conversation also briefly touched on security concerns for LLM applications, specifically regarding controlling how agents are used when released publicly, with dreadwulf mentioning an incident where their Langchain agent was misused.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Any place I can read more about what you are building? (asked by dreadwulf) A: WP ready. But I will make public after <@498273781589213185> get to see it.

      "summary": "# Analysis of \"ðŸ“¥ï½œpull-requests\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThis Discord chat segment primarily shows AIFlow.ML @ ElizaOS submitting numerous pull requests to fix linting issues across multiple plugins in the ElizaOS/eliza repository. The fixes appear to be part of a systematic effort to standardize code formatting using Biome. Most PRs follow a naming pattern of \"fix: plugin-[name]\" or initially \"fix-plugin-[name]\" until Odilitime requested a format change to \"fix: plugin-[name]\". There were some technical discussions about the correct configuration for Biome, specifically regarding the \"trailingComma\" vs \"trailingCommas\" property in biome.json. AIFlow.ML encountered merge conflicts in package.json files for some PRs after submitting many changes in succession. Odilitime helped by reviewing and merging PRs, and provided feedback on PR naming conventions. The conversation indicates an ongoing effort to standardize and improve code quality across the plugin ecosystem.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Did someone notice that plugin-ferePro have just a readme? (asked by AIFlow.ML @ ElizaOS) A: I had noticed that but no time to dig into the history (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Can someone merge my PR please? So I can fetch/merge?

      "summary": "# Discord Chat Analysis\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily focused on technical discussions about the Eliza framework, particularly around setting up multiple agents in one project, using local LLMs with Ollama, and plugin development. Users discussed how to configure character files to use different model providers and credentials. There were specific troubleshooting sessions for Ollama integration, with users encountering connection errors despite Ollama running locally. The chat also covered plugin development, with announcements about a News Plugin being merged that allows agents to retrieve news via newsapi.org. Some users discussed DeepSeek model integration, noting it's supported but with mixed reviews on performance. There was also a bounty discussion for porting a Truth Social API from Python to TypeScript for Eliza v2, though there was some disagreement about requirements and API accessibility limitations.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What is the correct approach in setting up multiple agents in one project with Eliza framework? (asked by WarfreakzPlays) A: Use the --characters parameter with a comma-separated list of character files, and add client credentials directly in each character file header to avoid conflicts (answered by Odilitime and D. Ratta)\nQ: Why is Eliza looking for an API key when using Ollama with llama3.2? (asked by WarfreakzPlays) A: You need to set modelProvider to \"ollama\" in the character file (answered by D. Ratta)\nQ: How do I fix the \"connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434\" error when using Ollama with Eliza? (asked by WarfreakzPlays) A: Ensure Ollama is running with \"ollama serve\" or \"ollama run llama3.2\" and check if you can access localhost via browser (answered by D. Ratta)\nQ: Is DeepSeek support planned for Eliza? (asked by ST4RDUST) A: DeepSeek has been supported for weeks, you can change the endpoint through the .env file (answered by SotoAlt | BOSSU and R0am)\nQ: Has anyone tried running ElizaOS on an iPhone with NodeJS installed? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: D.

      "summary": "# Analysis of ðŸ“¥ï½œpull-requests Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nAIFlow.ML @ ElizaOS conducted an extensive plugin maintenance effort, submitting multiple PRs to fix issues across various plugins including Zerion, Video-Generation, Udio, Twitter, TTS, Ton, Thirdweb, Tee-Verifiable-Log, Tee-Marlin, Suno, Sui, Story, and Starknet. These fixes addressed typing issues, missing exports, and other non-critical problems identified during a systematic review. The maintenance was described as a \"programmed maintenance\" and \"1st run,\" with plans to \"diversify the action names to avoid conflicts\" in future iterations. \n\nIn parallel, xLuisCumbi implemented WhatsApp chat support for the Characterfile project, enabling the processing of WhatsApp chat data to create character profiles using AI models. This PR (#19) was approved, with minor README updates planned.\n\nAn1muss requested help with finalizing PR #1238 for integrating the Deva.me client, which allows posting and creates a foundation for app interaction. Odilitime merged this PR but noted it incorrectly changed the default model in defaultCharacter from llama_local and requested a follow-up PR to revert this change.\n\nAIFlow.ML also made several organizational improvements to prevent rebase conflicts and fixed specific issues like the Akash splash and a typo in the Nvidia nim.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What kind of conflicts were in the Deva.me PR? (asked by AIFlow.ML @ ElizaOS) A: It changes the default model in defaultCharacter, which we don't want (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Was Starknet giving issues? (asked by AIFlow.ML @ ElizaOS) A: No, someone was asking how to test/use it (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3.

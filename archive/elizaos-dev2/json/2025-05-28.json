Users express enthusiasm about the upcoming v2 release scheduled for the week, with specific mention of the Eliza 1.0.0 agent terminal. There's a suggestion to make this terminal the landing page of the elizaos.ai website to reduce friction for new users. A developer inquires about cloning v2 for an internal Proof of Concept focused on regulatory check automation, receiving confirmation that the current v2-develop branch is stable enough to use with only minor changes expected. There's also discussion about creating Cursor rules for TypeScript and Python development within the ElizaOS ecosystem, with links shared to example guidelines. Other topics include questions about leaderboard functionality, contributor promotion process, and some unrelated promotional messages.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Will the eliza 1.0.0 agent terminal will be the new landing page of elizaos.ai website? (asked by xell0x) A: Unanswered\nQ: Leader Board triggers on elizaos plugins projects activities too? (asked by Stan âš¡) A: Unanswered\nQ: How could I be promoted to a contributor? Do I have to link my discord ID with something? (asked by Stan âš¡) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is there any value in waiting for the formal v2 release? Or do you think i can run with what we have now with minimal friction, and just merge in the release afterwards? (asked by Rabbidfly) A: Probably can run with current v2-develop, changes will be minor in next few days, doable to merge. We're mostly cleaning up plugins but core is stable.

Summary\nThe chat segment covers two main pull requests: one for flyio/server hosting environment CLI fixes (PR #4806) and another for plugin-mcp migration (PR #3). The discussion primarily focuses on the plugin-mcp migration PR, where cjft provided feedback on several issues with the implementation. Key technical points included the need to align with existing npm-deploy workflows, respect branch handling and beta versions, replace biome with tsup configuration (with dts: true for type definitions), and simplify the README installation instructions to only list bun instead of multiple package managers. There was also a brief security concern raised by sayonara about hiding deploy URLs in fly.io CI since environment variables can be decrypted from the frontend. Sam-developer acknowledged the feedback and committed to making the suggested changes to align with existing plugin conventions.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Need to hide the deploy url in fly io CI?

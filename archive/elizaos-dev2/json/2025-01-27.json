      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat primarily revolves around technical discussions about Eliza's plugin system, model compatibility, and development challenges. There's an ongoing discussion about a $500 bounty for porting a Python app to v2 that can connect and retrieve data. Several members discuss model preferences, with specific mentions of DeepSeek integration, which has apparently been supported for weeks. SotoAlt shares negative experiences with DeepSeek-R1, noting it gets stuck during response generation despite being cost-effective. There are technical troubleshooting instances, including WarfreakzPlays resolving an Ollama connection issue by changing the server URL from localhost to the IP address. ICJR raises questions about the development roadmap, plugin architecture, and npm package management. Odilitime clarifies that v2 is building upon v1 rather than replacing it, with plans to backport features rather than starting fresh.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Has anyone tried running ElizaOS on an iPhone with Nodejs installed on it? (asked by DorianD) A: Unanswered\nQ: Is DeepSeek support planned? (asked by ST4RDUST) A: Yes, deepseek has been supported since weeks ago (answered by SotoAlt | BOSSU)\nQ: What model are you guys using for the best function calling capabilities? (asked by CriticalBarny) A: SecretRecipe uses llama3.2 storm but \"not hella functions\"; SotoAlt | BOSSU uses anthropic\nQ: Why is eliza-starter pinned to 0.1.7 instead of develop? (asked by ICJR) A: Broke build system has prevented releases which has left the npms broken (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Are contributions to v2 accepted/open? (asked by ICJR) A: No, and the plan is not to scrap v1, we are building on v1 (answered by Odilitime)\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: WarfreakzPlays | Helpee: WarfreakzPlays | Context: Connection refused error when using Ollama locally | Resolution: Fixed by changing OLLAMA_SERVER_URL from http://localhost:11434 to http://127.0.0.1:11434\nHelper: SotoAlt | BOSSU | Helpee: ST4RDUST | Context: Question about DeepSeek support | Resolution: Confirmed DeepSeek has been supported for weeks, but noted performance issues\nHelper: Odilitime | Helpee: ICJR | Context: Questions about development direction and v1/v2 relationship | Resolution: Clarified that v2 is building on v1, not replacing it\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in ðŸ“®ï½œfeedback Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment reveals significant issues with the Client Twitter implementation that affect plugin functionality. User 0xSero identified two specific problems: repeated processing of old interactions and incompatibility with certain plugin actions, particularly with the EVM-plugin. The discussion highlights a need for better testing infrastructure, specifically unit tests for plugins, core components, and adapters. Agent Joshua suggested debugging steps including checking the database, restarting the agent, and enabling verbose logging. Shaw acknowledged these issues, confirming that \"the plugin situation has gotten out of control\" and implying that work is underway to address these problems. The conversation suggests these are ongoing issues that have persisted for at least a month, with potential improvements planned for a version 2 release.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Why doesn't the EVM-plugin work out of the box with client-twitter? (asked by Odilitime) A: Unanswered\nQ: Which version are you on and have you tried debugging steps like restarting your agent and setting VERBOSE=true? (asked by Agent Joshua â‚± | TEE) A: Running on develop branch with weekly updates, issues persist across the last month (answered by 0xSero)\n\n## 3.

      "summary": "# Analysis of Discord Chat in \"ðŸ¤–ï½œagent-dev-school\"\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe chat segment is very brief and contains minimal technical discussion. There are mentions of a deepseek implementation, plugin integration with a character, and a reference to \"pnpm dev\" which appears to be a development command. One user mentions that something (unspecified) has been merged into the Eliza code base as announced by Shaw on X (Twitter). The conversation lacks detailed technical content or problem-solving discussions, with most messages being short questions or brief responses without extensive technical details.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: Has anyone made a deepseek implementation? (asked by ben [Ï„, '] | BitMind) A: Unanswered\nQ: If I want to use a plugin, which I already finish coding, should I do something in default character? (asked by eliza.dev118) A: It's up to your plugin's features. You can set the personal adjectives, post examples, bio and some other characteristics to your character. Also specify the security key and plugins and clients. (answered by James)\nQ: What plugin did you build? (asked by dreadwulf) A: Unanswered\n\n## 3. Help Interactions\nHelper: James | Helpee: eliza.dev118 | Context: How to integrate a completed plugin with a character | Resolution: Explained that it depends on the plugin's features and provided guidance on setting character attributes and specifying security key, plugins, and clients\n\n## 4.

      "summary": "# Analysis of \"ðŸ“¥ï½œpull-requests\" Channel\n\n## 1. Summary\nThe channel primarily documents a systematic plugin maintenance effort by AIFlow.ML, who submitted numerous pull requests to fix issues across multiple plugins in the ElizaOS/eliza repository. These fixes addressed typing issues, missing exports, and other non-critical problems discovered during a comprehensive review of all plugins. The maintenance work appears to be part of a programmed maintenance run, with AIFlow.ML indicating they would continue monitoring all plugins for issues as new PRs come in. \n\nNotable contributions from other community members included xLuisCumbi's implementation of WhatsApp chat support for the Characterfile project, which was successfully approved, and an1muss's integration of the Deva.me client that required conflict resolution. Odilitime provided merge support and guidance, particularly regarding maintaining the default model configuration in defaultCharacter. The systematic plugin maintenance by AIFlow.ML demonstrates a methodical approach to improving code quality across the project.\n\n## 2. FAQ\nQ: What kind of conflicts were encountered with the Deva.me client integration? (asked by AIFlow.ML @ ElizaOS) A: It changes the default model in defaultCharacter, which we don't want (answered by Odilitime)\nQ: Was Starknet giving issues?

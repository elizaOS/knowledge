# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-01-01

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Web2 Integration & Plugins
- **Payment Systems**: Developers are prioritizing payment integrations (Stripe, Skyfire.xyz) as this is currently a weak point in the system
- **Communication Services**: Email integration (Gmail, Resend, Outlook), Twitter API (replacing scraping approach), and SMS/calls (Twilio) are being actively developed
- **Domain Management**: CNAME systems, AWS, Cloudflare, and custom URLs for REST endpoints are under discussion
- **Smart Home & IoT**: Home Assistant integration is being developed for smart home control
- **Corporate Tools**: Microsoft Teams and Jira integrations are being proposed for business environments
- **Funding Available**: Shaw has indicated willingness to fund development of various web2 integrations

### Architecture & Code Quality
- **Modularization Proposal**: ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯 proposed implementing a Zod or TypeScript character schema instead of embedding the default character within the runtime
- **Core Refactoring Needed**: The core/generate.ts file was identified as needing significant refactoring to reduce duplication
- **Dependency Management**: Consensus that "less npm/dependencies is better" to reduce supply chain attack surface while still enabling new capabilities
- **Bun Runtime Variant**: A streamlined version aimed at reducing dependencies and simplifying deployment for beginners

### Pull Requests & Features
- **"Save This" Plugin**: A new plugin that captures message history as knowledge records
- **DeepSeek AI API**: Integration of DeepSeek AI support is ready for review
- **Bug Fixes**: Several PRs addressing issues in the Evaluator facts template and other components
- **PR Backlog**: Several contributors have PRs waiting for extended periods that need review

### Documentation & Organization
- **Work Tracking**: Need for better documentation of works-in-progress to avoid duplication of effort
- **Getting Started Guide**: Identified need for better documentation on starting minimal projects and customizing with add-ons
- **Unofficial Docs**: kAI wilder created an unofficial document repository for ElizaOS runtime operations on GitHub

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it recommended to change personal social profiles to elizaOS?**  
A: It's totally up to you, but web2 folks might not align with the "big boobed waifu meme" of web3, so elizaOS aims to welcome them and academia in a more neutral setting.

**Q: How can I find where to edit the retweet functionality?**  
A: In client-twitter/src/interactions.ts

**Q: How do I get the "Automated" label on Twitter?**  
A: Use Twitter's automated account labels feature

**Q: Is there a comprehensive listing of Eliza plug-ins/extensions?**  
A: Everything is in the repo right now, and there's also https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/community/awesome-eliza/

**Q: How can I get started with a minimal Eliza project and customize it?**  
A: There's an agent dev school resource available at https://eliza.gg/eliza/community/ai-dev-school/

**Q: Could the runtime composition be modularized further?**  
A: Zod schema might be good for this purpose

**Q: That means we will hit a max in terms of integrations in the repo at some point?**  
A: No there's balance, we always want new capabilities but need to protect the core package (including its services)

**Q: Do I create the issue, and submit a PR on it?**  
A: You don't have to make an issue but it's nice

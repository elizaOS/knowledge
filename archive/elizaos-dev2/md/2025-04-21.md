# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-21

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development
- **Plugin Architecture**: Discussions about naming conflicts in plugin actions, with confirmation that action names need to be distinct across plugins
- **UI Capabilities**: Information shared about hosting UIs in plugins, with reference to the investment manager example in the GitHub repository
- **Docker Improvements**: A PR (#4330) was submitted with Docker improvements, though concerns were raised about TypeScript validation scripts potentially becoming too strict

### Auto.fun Platform
- **Platform Clarification**: Auto.fun functions more as a token launchpad rather than an agent creator
- **Feature Suggestions**: Proposal for a paid feature to increase compute speed when finding vanity Contract Addresses

### Agent Development
- **V2 Transition**: Users are experiencing a learning curve with V2, but it was emphasized that V2 offers more flexibility and control than V1 once mastered
- **Agent Dev School**: Confirmation of an Agent Dev School event running from 8am-10pm UTC
- **Configuration Parameters**: Discussion about research-style response configurations, including increasing max_tokens and temperature

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does auto.fun create agents?**  
A: It's more of a token launchpad than an agent creator (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: What if there are several actions from plugins with the same action name?**  
A: Actions need to have distinct names to avoid conflicts (answered by shaw and Odilitime)

**Q: Is there a way to render OAuth authentication links better in ElizaOS plugins?**  
A: ElizaOS has the ability to host UIs in plugins; the investmentManager example in the GitHub repository demonstrates this (answered by shaw)

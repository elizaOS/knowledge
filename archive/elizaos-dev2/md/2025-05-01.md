## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is it possible to use RAG in the V2 version? Or should we be using 0.25.x?** (asked by dong)  
**A:** Both have RAG. It's unified better in 1.x, where 0.x has memories, knowledge and RAGknowledge (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: What happened to the docs page? Any other working links?** (asked by z1)  
**A:** HTTPS://docs.Eliza.how (answered by sayonara)

**Q: Does anybody know if there is an Eliza version where I can post on communities on X?** (asked by Jon)  
**A:** Yes, Shaw and Jin have been hard at work on one. Might be ready today, I haven't heard an announcement yet (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: How do I install Eliza version 1.0.0-beta.37?** (asked by paddlep0p)  
**A:** Run "npm install eliza@1.0.0-beta.37 --save-exact", but note there have been important fixes in beta.41. (answered by Ruby)

**Q: How do I fix "No version matching" errors for Eliza plugins?** (asked by paddlep0p)  
**A:** Clear cache with "bun pm cache rm" then run "bun install" again. The video plugin has version constraints that can cause issues during upgrades. (answered by Ruby)

# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### v1 Bug Issues and Fixes
- A critical bug affecting v1 functionality was identified, related to "hapi__shot" conflicts
- The issue appears to be macOS-specific and is addressed in GitHub PR #4232
- Joker diagnosed the problem as conflicting installations and provided a solution
- Odilitime confirmed the v2 rollout is still in progress, not yet complete

### Development Focus and Features
- Discussion about whether developers should focus on v2 instead of v1 for new agents/apps
- Martin Rivera identified that the AgentRuntime class is missing a `createTask` function
- Shaw clarified that task functionality is a v2 feature available in the `v2-develop` branch
- Alternative approaches for implementing recurring tasks in v1 were discussed, including creating service classes

### CLI and Cross-Platform Issues
- Testing revealed cross-platform compatibility issues with CLI commands in PR #4185
- Running `npm create eliza` froze a PC, and `npx elizaos create` produced errors
- The commands had only been tested on Mac, not on PC or Linux environments
- Potential causes include missing shebangs and conflicts with imagemagick on Linux

### Integration Challenges
- Users reported issues with Twitter integration, where tweets are being sent but not connecting to Characters
- Problems with dashboard access to tweet functionality despite having correct APIs

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Is v2 fully out and stable, or is the rollout still happening?** (Matthew Liu)  
A: Roll out is still happening (Odilitime)

**Q: Is task working in ElizaOS?** (Martin Rivera)  
A: It's a v2 feature available in the v2-develop branch (shaw)

**Q: Is there alternative in V1? I want to run action every hour to post messages in Discord Channel** (Martin Rivera)  
A: You can make a service that gets the runtime discord client (runtime.getClient) and calls post on a loop (shaw)

**Q: Service is also `v2` feature?** (Martin Rivera)

**Q: Did you test these CLI commands?** (jin)  
A: Yes, all create commands with npm + npx permutations are tested, but only on Mac chip (yung_algorithm)

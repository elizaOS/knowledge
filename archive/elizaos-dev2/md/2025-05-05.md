## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: While building a telegram agent I am running into the error "No world found for user during onboarding" what does this mean?**  
A: "That error usually means the world creation step failed during setup. Check that you have WORLD_ID set in your .env and that your database migrations ran successfully. Try running 'elizaos db:migrate' first, then attempt the telegram agent setup again." (answered by Ruby)

**Q: What is the end goal for the plugin architecture? Now, depending on which elizaos (in .bun or in the nvm/node path) the plugins fail to mount.**  
A: "The goal is to have a unified plugin system where plugins work consistently regardless of runtime. Right now there's a known issue with path resolution between bun/node environments. We're working on standardizing how plugins are discovered and mounted. For now, I'd recommend sticking to one runtime (preferably node) until we get this sorted out." (answered by Ruby)

**Q: Where is recommended to deploy a twitter agent to not get banned/flagged? I imagine that if it's some datacenter IP, twitter blocks them, right?**  
A: "Yeah, datacenter IPs are a red flag for twitter. Your best bet is using residential proxies or a VPN service that rotates residential IPs. I've had good luck with Bright Data's residential network, but there are cheaper options if you're just testing." (answered by Ruby)

**Q: Can you help me with my Indonesian translation PR that's getting blocked?**  
A: "Yes, the issue is that merges to main branch are only allowed from the develop branch, not from patch-3." (answered by Ruby)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Telegram Agent Troubleshooting
Ruby provided detailed guidance to StarCat on resolving the "No world found for user during onboarding" error by suggesting database migration checks and environment variable verification.

### Plugin Architecture Support
Ruby helped kandizzy understand the current limitations of the plugin system across different runtimes and recommended sticking to Node until standardization is complete.

### Twitter Agent Deployment Advice
Ruby advised morlok on avoiding Twitter account flagging by using residential proxies instead of datacenter IPs, specifically recommending Bright Data's residential network.

### Pull Request Workflow Assistance
Ruby guided "lost" through the proper GitHub workflow for submitting a translation PR:
1. Creating a new branch from develop
2. Transferring the Indonesian translation files
3. Targeting the develop branch with the PR
4. Offered both git command sequence and GitHub web UI approaches

### Twitter Agent Resources
0xbbjoker shared a Discord channel link with yoyoha regarding Twitter agent v2 implementation information.

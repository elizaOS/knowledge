# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-05-26

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Multi-Agent Systems & 3D Worlds
- Upcoming V2 (1.0.X) will enable memory capture across multiple client interfaces
- Multi-agents will be able to interact in custom worlds with specific memory loading
- Hyperfy partnership being explored for 3D world creation (similar to "farm2" implementation)
- Interest in avatar setup and news channel video creation capabilities

### Data Integration & Plugins
- Discussion about blockchain data integration through plugins that connect to indexers
- Firecrawl plugin and 'web search' plugin recommended for guided web search workflows
- Questions about embedding structure and ID field population in the data structure

### Development Infrastructure
- CLI tool for "pluggy" submissions is currently being modified
- Command structure changes expected to be completed by end of the week
- Documentation updates postponed until new command flow is solidified

### Use Cases & Applications
- Interest in corporate applications beyond customer service agents
- Process automation mentioned as an interesting but underdeveloped area
- Concerns about agent focus and context adherence (agent responding to off-topic queries)

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Will we be able to spin up multi-agents in a custom world where they can all interact with each other and be loaded with specific memory?**  
A: "correct yeah" (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Have you got more details of the hyperfy? Guessing that's the farm2 stuff?**  
A: Limited surface-level info available, another project using it was shared (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Anyone messed with getting agent to pull blockchain data like from Dune or from front ends?**  
A: There are a few plugins that let you request from indexers (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Would it be feasible to create a "search web" workflow that prompts the agent to search certain sites for certain types of information?**  
A: Check out the Firecrawl plugin or another called 'web search' (answered by Kenk)

**Q: Is there an issue with the current command structure for submitting a pluggy via CLI?**  
A: Yes, the command is in the middle of being changed, making it an awkward time to use it (answered by yung_algorithm)

**Q: When will the CLI changes be completed?**  
A: Approximately by the end of the week (answered by yung_algorithm)

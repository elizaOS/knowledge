# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-01-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **RAG Implementation**: Discussions about Retrieval-Augmented Generation functionality, with users seeking documentation and troubleshooting. A PR for adapter-supabase with RAG capabilities was mentioned. Currently only supports TXT and MD files, not PDF.
- **Deployment Issues**: Users experienced connection problems with the backend defaulting to localhost:3000, requiring configuration changes to the BASE_URL in client/src/lib/api.ts.
- **Knowledge System**: Updates that simplify the process of adding information to agents, though currently requires deleting db.sqlite to refresh character knowledge.
- **Goals Functionality**: Users examined the codebase to understand implementation details, noting that the createGoal function exists but appears unused, suggesting the feature might be under development.
- **Pull Requests**: Multiple PRs were shared, including improvements to Squid router throttle intervals (#2386), converting classes to interfaces for AgentRuntime injection (#2388), and a fix for image provider issues (#2430).
- **Release Planning**: Odilitime expressed commitment to releasing version 0.1.9-alpha.1.

### Integrations & Plugins
- **Telegram Integration**: Users sought information about API tokens and implementation details, with references to resources for obtaining Telegram API keys.
- **Twitter/X Integration**: Challenges with login issues involving Arkose challenges and X Spaces functionality errors related to ICE connection failures.
- **Quick Intel Plugin**: Requires an API key from developer.quickintel.io.
- **New Plugin Development**: Discussions about PR size guidelines for new plugins, with contributors asking about appropriate review processes.

### Service Status
- **eliza.gg Service**: Experienced downtime affecting multiple users.
- **Security Concerns**: Discussions about impersonation and a potentially unauthorized token launch using a team member's identity.

### Project Announcements
- **Token Against Humanity ($TAH)**: A memecoin project combining AI technology with community profit-sharing, featuring a "Rogue AI Agent" with advanced voice capabilities. Launch planned for January 17, 2025.

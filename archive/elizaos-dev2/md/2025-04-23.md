# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-23

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Plugin Development**: Discussions about forking the plugin-bootstrap to modify the messageReceivedHandler for sending multiple smaller texts instead of a single text. Multiple bootstrap plugins are now supported.
- **Storage Solutions**: Detailed conversation about Storacha MCP storage server architecture, which uses a multi-tier approach:
  - Hot storage (Cloudflare R2) with 200-500ms TTFB
  - Cold storage (Filecoin L1) for data persistence
  - Upcoming "warm storage" with 3x replication across distributed nodes
- **Knowledge Systems**: Proposal to abstract the knowledge/memory system to an MCP server for better modularity and to consolidate the three knowledge modes.
- **Agent Configuration**: Guidance provided on setting up avatars for O3 agents using the proper directory structure.

### Integration & Features
- **Twitter Integration**: Questions about configuring agents to reply to replies on Twitter and whether Eliza 2 works with Twitter. Confirmation that Twitter integration works well with Eliza 1.x.
- **AI-Generated Content**: Interest in generating Twitter posts with AI-generated images.
- **Security**: Client-side encryption for Storacha is in development using LIT Protocol.

### Community Management
- **Role Assignments**: Contributor role assigned to a community member who has been submitting PRs.
- **Security Concerns**: Discussion about handling a scammer who impersonated a community member.
- **Account Management**: Transfer of ownership for social media accounts was mentioned.

## Key Questions & Answers

### Plugin Development
**Q**: Can I fork the plugin-bootstrap and trim down the messageReceivedHandler?  
**A**: Yes, multiple bootstrap plugins can be done now. (Odilitime)

### Twitter Integration
**Q**: Is Eliza 2 finally working with Twitter?  
**A**: Never had a problem with 1.x and Twitter. (Odilitime)

### Agent Configuration
**Q**: How do you set up avatars for O3 agents?  
**A**: Put them in the /agents directory with structure: /agents/your-agent-name/config.yaml, ensuring the YAML has required fields like id, name, and description. (Ruby)

### Storage Architecture
**Q**: How are you handling encryption and access controls?  
**A**: Encryption is in development using LIT Protocol, with encryption happening on the client side. (fforbeck)

**Q**: How are you handling hot/cold storage transitions?  
**A**: Currently using R2 for hot storage with Filecoin backup, transitioning to a warm storage network with 3x replication. (inthiseconomy)

**Q**: What's the latency like on retrieval from the hot nodes?  
**A**: Hot storage targets 200-500ms TTFB SLA, while the upcoming warm storage will have 1-10 second TTFB SLA. (inthiseconomy)

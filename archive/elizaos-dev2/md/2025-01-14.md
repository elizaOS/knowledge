# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-01-14

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Architecture & Performance
- **Package Management Concerns**: Users expressed frustration with the monolithic repository structure where all adapters, clients, and packages are bundled together, causing large node_modules (3GB) and high memory consumption (6.7GB RAM for a single agent).
- **Scaling Capabilities**: Odilitime mentioned running 350 agents on a single EPYC processor instance, while some users prefer single-agent deployments.
- **ModelProvider Duplication**: Cesar Rodriguez identified a potential issue where modelProvider exists in both AgentRuntime and character objects, causing unexpected behavior when configurations conflict.
- **Node Version Compatibility**: Warnings about Node 23.5.0 vs the expected 23.3.0 were shared.

### Client Integrations
- **Twitter Client Issues**: Users discussed formatting problems in tweets where numbered lists were appearing incorrectly. A fix was proposed using regex replacements.
- **Twitter Spaces**: Discussions about enabling agents to join existing Twitter spaces rather than creating new ones.
- **Telegram Client**: Connection problems on Linux environments were reported.

### Knowledge & Database Implementation
- **Knowledge Base Challenges**: Users discussed how to make agents consistently respond with specific information like links.
- **Supabase Integration**: Issues with adapter changes and knowledge table writing problems were reported. AIFlow.ML proposed reviving PR #1800 as an alternative to the current problematic implementation.
- **RAG Implementation**: Discussions about the limitations of the current ragKnowledge system and the need for more advanced solutions.

### Plugin Development
- **Wallet Tracking**: KeyesCode.eth shared their implementation of an agent that follows ETH and BASE wallets.
- **Solana Plugin Improvements**: A user (suns) enhanced the legacy Solana plugin to properly handle native SOL and SPL transfers, submitting PR #2340.
- **Custom Actions**: Questions about implementing automated actions through the Twitter client, specifically for regular content posting.

### ElizaOS v2
- Mike D. shared links to GitHub PR and Twitter posts about ElizaOS v2, with users inquiring about the availability of the new core code.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I make my agent automatically post content from custom actions at regular intervals?**  
A: "You need to create a provider and pass that provider into the Twitter post template, then amend the template to explain to the agent that you want the provider data in the tweet every time." (R0am)

**Q: How can I make my agent answer with a specific link when asked?**  
A: "Add the links to the 'system' prompt in char.json." (bendermind)

**Q: Is it possible for the agent to join an existing space rather than starting its own?**  
A: "Yes, agent-twitter-client can do that, but client-twitter doesn't have the needed code to take advantage of the join spaces functionality yet." (sayonara)

**Q: Is there a way to give the agent knowledge of things like docs on a URL?**  
A: "Not currently. The ragKnowledge is an initial implementation. For advanced RAG solutions, a custom plugin would be needed. If you get the docs in markdown or txt format, you can use those." (꧁Ninja_Dev꧂)

**Q: Why is the node_modules size so large?**  
A: "It's 3GB due to llama-cpp and two versions of onnxruntime because of the transformers package version." (Cesar Rodriguez)

**Q: What's the latest stable version of the Eliza repo?**  
A: "v0.1.8+build.1 should be more stable. It's basically v0.1.8.1 but semver doesn't allow that." (Odilitime)

**Q: Why does AgentRuntime have a modelProvider if character has a modelProvider?**  
A: "Because agentruntime is basically the instance of a character, they're pretty much the same. It's an artifact of optimizing for a single character but allowing multiple agents." (Odilitime)

**Q: Why are there two Solana plugins (plugin-solana and plugin-solana-agentkit)?**  
A: "Agent-kit got its own plugin for now." (Odilitime)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Tweet Formatting Fix**: sayonara helped 4n7m4n identify the cause of tweet formatting issues after the 1.8+ update. 4n7m4n created a fix with regex replacements and submitted PR #2299.

- **Twitter Automation**: R0am guided KeyesCode.eth on how to make the Twitter client post content from custom actions automatically by creating a provider and passing it to the Twitter post template.

- **Twitter Spaces Integration**: sayonara provided pluto with links to relevant code and explained current limitations for making agents join existing Twitter spaces.

- **Knowledge Base Implementation**: ꧁Ninja_Dev꧂ explained to pluto the current limitations of ragKnowledge and suggested using markdown/txt formats for better results.

- **ARM64 Implementation**: Mike D. successfully implemented Eliza on arm64 architecture and shared the solution on Twitter.

- **Repository Structure**: Cesar Rodriguez helped suns understand the Solana plugin ecosystem and ꧁Ninja_Dev꧂ advised on how to get improvements merged into the main repo.

- **Character File Creation**: epilogg shared a link to the tweets2character tool in GitHub repository to help users create character files.

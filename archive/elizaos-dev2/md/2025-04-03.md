# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Architecture
- **Component Definitions**: Detailed explanations of the differences between plugins, adapters, and clients in the elizaOS ecosystem:
  - **Plugins**: Extensions that add new capabilities to agents
  - **Adapters**: Components that connect agents to databases/storage systems
  - **Clients**: User interfaces for interacting with agents
  - **Actions**: Specific operations performed directly (e.g., token transfers)

- **Blockchain Integration**: Discussion about "unified blockchain management" implementation, which integrates various blockchain networks into a single interface using key management systems and RFQ/bridge services for liquidity management.

### Development Status
- Confirmation that the "v2 Dev branch" is indeed the 1.0 beta
- Ongoing development focused on stability improvements
- Users requesting changelog/release information for beta versions

### New Projects
- Shaw shared a new dev rel agent project that performs RAG on documentation
- The agent can be pointed to any static docs in a repository
- Discussion about demonstrating this technology during a dev school episode

### Technical Issues
- Multiple users experiencing setup problems with API keys and GitHub credentials
- Issues with duplicate responses when actions are called
- Configuration persistence problem with elizaOS CLI repeatedly asking for DB URL
- Concerns about JSON output format breaking when generating Markdown with code

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What is the difference between plugin vs adapter vs client?**  
A: Plugins are add-ons that give your AI agent new abilities, clients are user interfaces to interact with your agent, and adapters connect your agent to different types of databases or storage systems. (answered by jin)

**Q: What's the difference between actions and plugins?**  
A: Actions are specific operations performed directly, like transferring tokens, while plugins are add-ons that extend abilities, allowing connection with external systems. (answered by SpartanDev)

**Q: How does "unified blockchain management" work?**  
A: It involves integrating various blockchain networks into a single interface, using key management systems for different keypairs and RFQ/bridge services for liquidity management. (answered by SpartanDev)

**Q: How is the 1.0 dev moving forward?**  
A: Development is ongoing with improvements toward stability. (answered by SpartanDev)

**Q: Is the v2 Dev branch the 1.0 beta?**  
A: Yes. (answered by shaw)

### Technical Development
- **Tweet Deletion Feature**: PRs submitted by 4nzn to implement tweet deletion functionality across multiple repositories (agent-twitter-client #100, plugin-twitter #4320).
- **XMTP Upgrades**: Nisita submitted PRs related to XMTP upgrades (client-xmtp #2 and registry #127).
- **Agent Configuration**: Discussions about changing agent IDs and configuring Twitter agents to monitor and respond to specific replies.
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Conversations about Suno music AI plugin integration with auto.fun and MCP plugin compatibility with agents.

### Community & Governance

## Key Questions & Answers

### Platform & Features
- **Q**: Can the agents or the org use MCP?  
  **A**: Yes, there's a plugin-mcp by fleek (Odilitime)

- **Q**: Is there any support channel for auto fun?  
  **A**: Yes, but we're monitoring this channel too (jin)

- **Q**: Can I change the ID of an already created avatar?  
  **A**: Yes, you can update an avatar's ID in the config file, but it will break existing conversations or knowledge tied to that ID (Ruby)

### Technical Implementation
- **Q**: How would I make my Twitter agent always reply to the replies of a target account?  
  **A**: Modify the agent's Twitter listener to include reply_to queries in the search criteria by adding 'in_reply_to_user_id' to your target filter (Ruby)

- **Q**: In which property can I set the agent ID?  
  **A**: In the agent config, look for the 'id' or 'agent_id' field near the top of the config file (Ruby)

- **Q**: Could you open a PR to the v2-develop branch of plugin-twitter as well?  
  **A**: Will open the PR for plugin-twitter asap (4nzn)

### Community & Funding
- **Q**: Is it possible to get contributor role with 1 merged PR?  
  **A**: Contributor roles typically require consistent quality contributions over time across multiple repos (Ruby)

- **Q**: Have you considered alternative funding approaches like quadratic funding or retroactive public goods?  
  **A**: I think of this as a tool to enable RPGF, as it's a GitHub/wallet record that can be leveraged via the incoming API (R0am)

## Community Help & Collaboration

### Technical Assistance

- **Ruby** assisted **Coinshome** with step-by-step instructions for configuring a Twitter agent to monitor replies to a target account, including code examples for modifying twitter_listener.py and handling webhook events.

- **tcm390** provided feedback to **4nzn** on improving the deleteTweet implementation, suggesting returning the Response object from the method and opening a PR to the plugin-twitter v2-develop branch.

### Platform Support

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Why was POSTGRES_URL variable removed from the env.example in v0.1.9? Is it suggested to use supabase instead?**  
A: You can still use POSTGRES_URL in the .env file; it was probably accidentally deleted from the example file.

**Q: Has anyone ever made the plugin of "generate strategy for trade/defi"?**  
A: See the rabbi trader plugin.

**Q: If the evaluator variable does not have alwaysRun?: boolean; and both similes/examples are empty, how can it be triggered?**  
A: Evaluators are always called; only the validate function matters.

**Q: Why do we need "alwaysRun?: boolean;" if validate() controls whether the evaluator runs?**  
A: Not certain if it works as expected. The code changes rapidly with 100-200 commits per day.

**Q: How to fix the bot failing to post outputs?**  
A: Delete data/db.sqlite (if you're using SQLite).

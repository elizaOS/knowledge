# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-02-27

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Core Development
- **Container Registry Access**: Odilitime made the ElizaOS container publicly available at github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pkgs/container/eliza
- **Memory Bug Fix**: v1xingyue identified and fixed a JavaScript heap out-of-memory error in v0.25.8, creating PR #3722 which was merged. The issue was caused by a dead loop in the `splitChunks`/`splitText` functions that consumed all available memory and caused CI failures.
- **Discord Client Compatibility**: Multiple users reported issues with setting up Discord client on v0.25.8, suggesting a compatibility problem with the latest version.

- **RAG Knowledge System Limitations**: 
  - Only MD and TXT files work properly for RAG
  - PDF files don't function correctly
  - Directory-based knowledge configuration shows inconsistent results
  - Users reported that even when files were properly loaded, the LLM sometimes didn't effectively utilize the knowledge

### Plugin Ecosystem
- **Plugin Management**: Discussions about official plugin repositories and CLI commands for plugin management
- **Plugin Development Process**: Odilitime provided guidance on the proper workflow for contributing plugins to the Eliza ecosystem, emphasizing the need for dedicated repositories rather than copying the entire codebase
- **Plugin Registry**: Praveen from Kaia successfully followed the process to add a plugin to the elizaos-plugins registry by creating a dedicated "plugin-kaia" repository and submitting a PR to update index.json

### Integration & Features
- **Telegram Integration**: Instructions shared for setting up Telegram integration via plugins using `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/client-telegram`
- **Token Standards**: DorianD raised concerns about ensuring coins launched via launchpad adhere to Solana SPL standards
- **Voice API**: Discussion about implementing voice API to Boise with full lip sync for character on screen

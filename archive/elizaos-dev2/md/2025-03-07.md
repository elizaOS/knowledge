# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-03-07

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Plugin Architecture Changes
- **Major Change**: Clients now need to be installed as plugins and added to the plugins array in character files
- Users experienced confusion with this counterintuitive change that appears to be poorly documented
- The community is adapting to this architectural shift with more experienced users guiding newcomers

### Client Integration Issues
- **Twitter Integration**: Requires `@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter` for agent login functionality
- **Discord Connectivity**: Several users reported issues connecting Discord bots to agents
- **Telegram Issues**: IPv6 configuration problems identified in the Telegram plugin
- **Instagram Plugin**: Authentication errors reported by users

### Technical Challenges
- Twitter client duplication concerns raised but not resolved
- Newline formatting issues in agent responses addressed with system prompt modifications
- Twitter account bans potentially related to automated profiles not being properly designated
- Character file configuration questions, particularly around system prompts and plugin arrays

### Other Topics
- A countdown on elizastudios.ai website was mentioned, but no one knew its purpose
- Pull request submitted to add callback functionality to Twitter plugin
- Discussion about implementing custom providers for training agents with real-time data

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does Discord work? I've added it to my project and included it in my char json as a client but when I start my agent it doesn't connect with my Discord bot.**  
A: You need to add it as plugin, not as client. (0xn1c0)

**Q: How do I fix these new line issues?**  
A: Add "Do not add \n do your responses, it must be in human readable english" to system prompt. (Redvoid)

**Q: How can users find the new plugin directory more easily?**  
A: Update the README with a bold header 1 statement. (Odilitime)

**Q: What values should I insert for plugins?**  
A: "@elizaos-plugins/client-twitter", "@elizaos-plugins/client-discord" (Odilitime)

**Q: Do I need to run pnpm build again?**  
A: No (Odilitime)

**Q: I have my custom data for training my agent. This data is much and realtime changable, how to train my agent with this data? Using knowledge or memory, which is the best choice?**  
A: Provider might be best. Providers can query a db or make a REST call to an api to fetch data, and then the output of a provider is injected into all LLM prompts. (Odilitime)

**Q: Which twitter plugin should we use for the latest release? v0.25.9**  
A: The one with client is the original one. (mindxploit)

# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-03-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Multi-Agent Systems & Architecture
- **Elizas Diary Network Concept**: DorianD proposed a system allowing agents and plugins to register, share keys, trust scores, and data
- **Shared Memory Implementation**: vkay shared their implementation of a multi-agent system with a common memory layer where specialized agents share data through a subscription registry
- **Agent Database Integration**: Shaw mentioned that in the v2-develop branch, agents have been added to the database and plugins can now add Routes

### Plugin Development & Issues
- **ComposeState Function**: Several developers reported looping issues with the `composeState` function in plugin development
- **Plugin Registry Problems**: After PR #95 was merged, all links on the official plugin registry were broken (not the submitter's fault)
- **Client-Discord Plugin**: Users reported installation errors, with Odilitime noting that a complete git checkout resolved the issue
- **Plugin Distribution Clarification**: Odilitime clarified that git is used for plugin distribution rather than npm

### New Plugin Submissions
- **Twitter Client Enhancement**: Alexander Krustev submitted a PR adding a reflection mode that extracts valuable information from conversations
- **Sonic Blockchain Plugin**: Vijay T. submitted a PR for a Sonic plugin for DeFi ecosystem integration
- **Documentation Update**: Jin shared a documentation-focused PR to the main Eliza repository

### Deployment & Configuration
- **AWS Container Deployment**: Discussion about deploying Eliza agents on AWS using containers
- **Multiple Agent Configuration**: Questions about running multiple agents with separate environment files and configuration approaches

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can I run 2 characters from 2 separate environment files?**  
A (vkay): "Simplest way is to give each agent its own start script, load shared settings from your main env then override them with your character specific env"

**Q: Is there an API endpoint to create an agent rather than doing it manually?**  
A (Magicred1): "Depending on your usecase, you might use a DB Adapter for your agents to fetch from or by forking and modifying the startAgents function from agents/src/index.ts file"

**Q: Should we point to our personal GitHub repo in registry/index.json?**  
A (Odilitime): "Yes, point to your GitHub repo."

**Q: Will publishing to npm be done by the Eliza team or should we publish packages to our npm?**  
A (Odilitime): "We're using git to distribute not npm."

**Q: How many devs do you currently have working on this?**  
A (DorianD): "None lol i was just trying out with cursor"

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Plugin Installation Troubleshooting**
   - Odilitime helped Cuddlesaurus and zeus.eth resolve client-discord plugin installation errors by identifying incomplete git checkout as the issue

2. **AWS Deployment Assistance**
   - DefiniteOptimist offered help with AWS container deployments to Julian Neuss, who confirmed he already had Eliza running on AWS

3. **Multi-Agent Configuration**
   - vkay provided Benquik with a solution for running multiple characters using separate start scripts with shared settings

4. **Plugin Registry Guidance**
   - Odilitime advised Praveen from Kaia on how to reinstate their plugin after removal, suggesting they create their own repo and submit a new PR

5. **Multi-Agent System Design**
   - vkay shared their implementation of a multi-agent system with common memory layer that could potentially extend DorianD's concept

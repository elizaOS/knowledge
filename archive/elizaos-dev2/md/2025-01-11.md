# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-01-11

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **New TTS and Text-to-3D plugins** implemented using Fal API (announced by Samuel92)
- **Release v0.1.8** was announced by Odilitime
- **Instagram integration** completed by Spit, implementing image posting functionality with locally sourced images
- **Injective implementation** PR #1764 created by エニグマリッキ
- **ESLint issues fixed** in PR #2143 by AIFlow.ML and merged by Odilitime

### Architecture & Performance
- One ElizaOS instance can run **300+ agents** with configuration possible via REST API rather than CLI parameters
- Discussion about architecture where **plugins could be stored in a database** and loaded as child processes
- Concept of a **trust database for plugin security** was discussed
- **Memory persistence** in agents works through state management, with recent messages cached in the State interface

### Deployment & Environment
- Users discussed deployment challenges on various platforms including **Phala TEE, Vercel, and Kubernetes**
- Several users reported specific errors related to **Twitter integration, WebRTC, and environment variable configuration**
- Discussion about accessing the **latest version through the develop branch** vs. main

### Security Concerns
- AIFlow.ML raised concerns about **scammers distributing malicious software** disguised as "decentralized communication apps"
- Multiple users confirmed encountering similar tactics

### RAG & Knowledge Management
- Odilitime suggested that **educating agents in their rooms** might be easier than using the knowledge section
- Users experiencing issues with agents providing **imaginary links instead of actual knowledge links**
- PR #1620 mentioned as a solution for **single-room education**

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I run multiple X bots with one repository?**  
A: Yes, one Eliza instance can run 300+ agents using the REST API (answered by Odilitime)

A: Yes, but don't expect too much instant support (answered by sayonara)

**Q: How to use the RAG and upload text to it?**  
A: It's almost easier to just educate agents in their rooms, and you can enable PR #1620 to do it in one room (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: What is the best way for users to use eliza?**  
A: Using a hosting provider becomes convenient (answered by Defi Cait)

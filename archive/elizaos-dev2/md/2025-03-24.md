# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-03-24

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Beta Issues & Fixes
- **Eliza Character Missing**: Multiple users reported the Eliza character not loading in the beta version. Odilitime identified PR #4031 as the fix, which is pending merge.
- **Installation Problems**: Users encountered permission issues with PGLite embedded database when installing on Ubuntu, requiring sudo privileges (though noted as suboptimal).
- **UI/UX Issues**: Navigation problems on eliza.how for mobile users were identified and addressed in a documentation PR.

### Technical Implementations
- **TEE Deployment**: Discussion about implementing Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) in production, with Agent Joshua sharing resources about Phala Cloud for TEE implementation.
- **Agent Behavior**: Chen0xA3 reported unexpected topic bias in agent responses (crypto/meme/NFT content appearing despite configuration against it), potentially influenced by the Twitter account's existing history.
- **Twitter Scraper Issues**: Users reported problems with the Twitter agent scraper returning error messages.

### Security Concerns
- **Compromised Account**: Shaw's X (Twitter) account was compromised, leading to a fake presale announcement. Jin suggested implementing Discord automod rules to block potentially malicious links.

### Documentation & Development
- Jin submitted a documentation PR that was reviewed and approved by Odilitime, addressing navigation issues and implementing coderabbit suggestions.
- Discussion about migrating character files between different versions, with Odilitime confirming v1 character files can be easily moved.

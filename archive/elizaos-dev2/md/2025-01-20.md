A: "Did u add plugin to plugins in the character file? 'plugins': ['@elizaos/plugin-quick-intel']" (answered by Mad)

**Q: Does anyone know if the twitter plugin has the capacity to scrape x.com lists or do specific searches regularly and save to local database?**

**Q: How to fix the error when starting an agent after successful installation and build?**  
A: "Update Node.js to v23.3.0 using 'nvm use v23.3.0' or set it as default with 'nvm alias default v23.3.0'. If that doesn't work, try downgrading the agent package from 0.1.9-alpha to 0.1.8." (answered by SavageSteve, D. Ratta, and IamNotGreedy)

**Q: Can you pass me a list of all plugs that are causing issues?**  
A: "abstract/cronos/holdstation" (answered by tcm390)

# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-22

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Plugin Development
- **Action Naming Conventions**: Plugin actions must have distinct names to avoid conflicts in the system
- **UI Hosting**: Developers can host UIs within plugins, with the investment manager plugin (degen-intel) serving as an example
- **Plugin Customization**: Multiple bootstrap plugins can be created by forking the plugin-bootstrap repository, allowing for customized message handling

### Storage & Infrastructure
- **Storacha MCP**: A decentralized storage solution for AI applications was discussed in detail, offering up to 5GB of free storage
- **Storage Architecture**: Storacha implements a tiered approach with:
  - Hot storage (Cloudflare R2) with 200-500ms TTFB SLA
  - Warm storage (distributed node network with 3x replication) with 1-10s TTFB SLA
  - Cold storage (Filecoin) for long-term archiving
- **Encryption**: Storacha is implementing client-side encryption using LIT Protocol

### Agent Development
- **O3 Implementation**: Positive feedback about using o3 (likely OpenAI's o1-preview) for creating organization-specific agents
- **Agent Structure**: Guidance provided on implementing agent configurations in CLI projects by translating YAML configs to CLI flags or environment variables
- **Avatar Setup**: O3 avatars should be placed in the `/agents/your-agent-name/config.yaml` directory structure

### Auto.fun Platform
- **Vanity CAs**: Proposal to add a paid compute option to auto.fun for finding vanity CAs with a markup
- **Social Media Integration**: Discussion about configuring Twitter agents to respond to replies of target accounts

### Character.AI V2
- **Platform Transition**: Users are encouraged to learn V2 despite its steeper learning curve, as it offers greater flexibility and control than V1
- **Launch Status**: Clarification that V2 hasn't officially launched yet

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What if there are several actions from plugins with the same action name?**  
A: Plugin actions need to have distinct names to avoid conflicts in the system.

**Q: Is it possible to fork the plugin-bootstrap and trim down the messageReceivedHandler?**  
A: Yes, multiple bootstrap plugins can be created now, allowing for customization.

**Q: How are you handling encryption and access controls in Storacha?**  
A: Encryption is in development using LIT Protocol with client-side encryption.

**Q: How are you handling hot/cold storage transitions in Storacha?**  
A: Detailed tiered approach with hot storage (R2), upcoming warm storage (distributed nodes), and cold storage (Filecoin) with specific performance targets.

**Q: What's the latency like on retrieval from the hot nodes?**  
A: Hot storage targets 200-500ms TTFB SLA, warm storage will have 1-10 second TTFB SLA.

**Q: Is the agent structure for YAML configs usable with CLI projects?**  
A: Yes, the agent structure works with CLI projects by translating YAML configs into appropriate CLI flags or environment variables.

**Q: Where should O3 avatars be placed?**  
A: O3 avatars should be placed in the `/agents/your-agent-name/config.yaml` directory structure.

**Q: Should I keep working with V1 or switch to V2?**  
A: V2 is worth learning despite being a bigger shift in agent development thinking. It offers more flexibility and control once you understand it.

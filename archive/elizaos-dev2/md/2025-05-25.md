# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-05-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Package Management Evolution
- ElizaOS v2 has shifted from pnpm (used in v0/v1) to bun as the primary package manager
- Some confusion was noted regarding inconsistent package manager instructions across different plugins

### Academic Recognition
- ElizaOS is being featured in an academic chapter about AI containment and meta-layer architectures
- Community members have been asked to review draft content by Wednesday

### Documentation Improvements
- Daily contributor summaries are being added to the ElizaOS GitHub Pages site

### Architecture Proposals
- Suggestion to implement single world per runtime by default to enable cross-platform memory persistence
- This would allow agents to maintain conversation context across different messaging platforms (Discord, Slack, Telegram)

### Infrastructure
- Registry endpoint configuration issues identified - users need to point to registry.elizaos.com instead of the default

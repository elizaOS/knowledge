# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-03-17

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Eliza v2 Implementation & Setup
- Users are experiencing setup difficulties with the new v2 release, particularly with SQLite bindings and directory paths for RAG knowledge
- The new documentation site (eliza.how) was announced and received positive feedback
- SQLite-related errors during installation are common, with community members sharing fixes
- Clarification that "npm run start" works but "npx @elizaos/cli start" doesn't for starting agents

### Local LLM Integration
- Significant interest in connecting Eliza to local LLMs via Ollama
- Chris.troutner discovered and shared the solution using the plugin-local-ai plugin with specific environment variables
- Plans to build a tech-support bot running models locally via Ollama on custom hardware (NVIDIA GeForce 3060)

### Agent Development & Use Cases
- Discussion about multi-agent setups and hierarchical agent structures with workers
- Interest in CommonJS compatibility with NextJS/Express
- Several users exploring business development opportunities with Eliza agents
- Shiva M implementing a product using Langchain and Eliza, seeking early testers
- NB exploring feeding real-time DeFi/crypto data into agents for generating tweets about yield opportunities

### Plugin Development
- Dorian presented a token prediction plugin with plans to implement reinforcement learning
- Three new pull requests announced:
  - Twitter plugin extension to retrieve post data back to the calling client
  - Distributed Storage Plugin for Eliza's Plugin Registry
  - Issue reported with a broken link for the "plugin-bnv-me-id" repository

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How to make twitter client work on v2?**  
A: "Yeah you can use webhooks" (Jungle)

**Q: How to get RAGKnowledge working?**  
A: "Set ragKnowledge=false for an array of strings. There's no need for embeddings in an array of strings." (Rick)

**Q: How to feed realtime defi/crypto data into agents for tweets about yield opportunities?**  
A: "You need to: 1) have a crypto database, 2) convert it to an Eliza provider, 3) define actions to detect opportunities." (Behnam Mirzabeygi)

**Q: Is the Ollama API not supported in this initial release?**  
A: Self-answered by chris.troutner who found plugin-local-ai and shared required environment variables for Ollama integration

**Q: What's the issue with the BNV plugin?**  
A: "It has a broken link on the plugin registry page for the plugin-bnv-me-id repository" (Daniel BNV)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **RAG Directory Structure Help**:  
  Rick helped not~Martin with RAG directory error, suggesting structure should be 'characters/agent-name/knowledge/RAG-Files-here'

- **SQLite Module Binding Errors**:  
  La flame provided commands "pnpm add better-sqlite3@latest --force" and "npm rebuild better-sqlite3" to help multiple users

- **Local LLM Integration**:  
  Chris.troutner shared his discovery of plugin-local-ai and the required environment variables for Ollama integration with OwnedSK and others

- **Twitter Scraping Tools**:  
  Z1 suggested self-hosting N8N with tutorial for Twitter scraping to volenn

- **Crypto Data Integration**:  
  Behnam Mirzabeygi provided high-level implementation steps for feeding crypto data to agents based on prior experience, and Rick suggested structuring the process into collection, storage, and usage stages

## Action Items

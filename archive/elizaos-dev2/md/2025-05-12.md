# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-05-12

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Character Configuration & Development
- Discussion about referencing one character file from another (e.g., importing woman.character.json into eliza.character.json)
- Detailed troubleshooting of character.json configuration issues in v2, including voice settings and knowledge directory paths
- Recommendation to keep a minimal approach when starting with character configurations before adding complexity

### Tools & Integrations
- Interest in news integration capabilities for agents, with suggestion to build an RSS plugin
- Introduction of Screenpipe (https://screenpi.pe/), a tool for recording screen activity that can be used for AI training
- Discussion about potential plugin development for Screenpipe

### System Architecture & Security
- Emphasis on proper credential management, keeping sensitive information in .env files rather than character configurations
- Clarification on the differences between CLI and manual workflows in v2, noting that CLI has its own mental model

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Has anyone done something like have a main character file reference/import another character file?**  
A: Self-answered that it would require modifying the runtime that reads the JSON files (DorianD)

**Q: Is there a plugin to get the latest news and add it as knowledge into the agent? Like News API connection?**  
A: Build an RSS plugin (sayonara)

**Q: Does anyone have a link to the online Eliza Helper Bot interface?**  
A: The helper bot interface was deprecated a while back - the new v2 workflow is more flexible but has a steeper learning curve. (Ruby)

**Q: Why doesn't the template include info for the OpenAI key? What LLM backend would it use?**  
A: The OpenAI key and LLM settings go in your .env file or environment variables. The default backend is gpt-4 but you can override that in your project's main config. (Ruby)

**Q: Should the Supabase keys also be put into the .env file and kept out of the character JSON? What's the format?**  
A: Yes! Definitely keep those keys in .env - never in the character json. The format is simple: SUPABASE_URL=your_url_here SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key_here (Ruby)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Ruby helped Hidden Forces** with character.json configuration issues, providing a simplified template and explaining the proper way to manage credentials
- **Ruby clarified** the conceptual differences between CLI and manual workflows in v2, explaining that CLI isn't just an automated version of manual steps
- **sayonara suggested** building an RSS plugin to Titan who was looking for news integration capabilities
- **Terexitarius shared** Screenpipe tool with the community, suggesting it might be useful for personal knowledge management and AI training

# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-04-15

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Development & Versions
- Discussions about ElizaOS v1 and v2 implementation issues, particularly around plugin compatibility
- Users reported challenges migrating from v1 to v2, especially when setting up multiple agents with separate knowledge bases
- GPT-4.1 support is not yet available in elizaos/core v0.25.9
- The "the-org" package was confirmed to be a demo app that starts up example agents for organizational use cases

### Plugin & Integration Issues
- Several users encountered plugin loading problems, particularly with OpenAI and Anthropic integrations
- Plugin order behavior was explained: the order determines which models get registered and used first, affecting default model selection
- Multiple users reported crashes when running agents locally, often due to missing or improperly configured API keys
- Two separate implementations of an Akash Chat plugin were shared, leading to some community tension

### Knowledge Management & PDF Processing
- Users discussed PDF processing issues within the Eliza knowledge pipeline, with some PDFs causing "Invalid array length" errors
- PDF RAG functionality works but requires clean PDFs without unusual formatting, breaking large documents into chunks, and validating structure
- Jin shared updates about a knowledge repository deployment for aggregating context from various ElizaOS-related sources
- Setting up multiple agents with their own knowledge bases in v2 requires creating separate knowledge directories and updating agent configs

### Deployment & Hosting
- Phala Cloud was recommended as a free deployment option for Eliza bots
- Database options for vector storage were discussed, with Supabase and Neon suggested as PostgreSQL alternatives
- Windows compatibility issues with pgvector were noted, with Docker suggested as a workaround

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does elizaos/core v0.25.9 support model gpt 4.1?**  
A: That's not ready yet (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: What is the best hosting platform to deploy the Eliza bot?**  
A: You can deploy one for free on Phala Cloud https://cloud.phala.network/eliza (answered by Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE)

**Q: Is package "the-org" like a demo app basically starting up a few example agents?**  
A: Correct, It's an out of the box example of popular agent examples that one could use for an organization. eg: Community Manager, DevRel, Project Manager etc. (answered by Nisita)

**Q: How can I fix my agent disliking to answer the same question?**  
A: You'll need to edit the character definition to include logic that identifies price check requests, always provides latest data, and doesn't consider repeated checks as trolling behavior (answered by 0xbbjoker)

**Q: pgvector seems to have major conflicts with Windows and Unix‐only headers. Can anyone recommend an alternative with PostGresSql?**  
A: Alternatives you have: Supabase, Neon.tech, or spin postgres in docker (answered by 0xbbjoker)

**Q: Does PDF RAG work decently for any dev here?**  
A: I've had decent results with PDF RAG in Eliza's knowledge pipeline, but it can be finicky. Key things that helped: 1) clean PDFs without weird formatting 2) breaking large docs into chunks 3) validating the PDF structure before ingestion. (answered by Ruby)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **0xbbjoker helped Cocaine** with agent crashes when running locally by explaining plugin order behavior and recommending removing local models with "rm -rf ~/.eliza" to force using OpenAI API
  
- **0xbbjoker assisted Berlin** with plugin loading errors with @elizaos/plugin-openai by suggesting rolling back to v0.25

- **Agent Joshua ₱ | TEE helped Baam25** find a hosting platform for Eliza bot by recommending Phala Cloud for free deployment

- **Odilitime guided standard** on implementing a RabbitMQ-like queue system in v2 by recommending the tasks system and providing documentation links

- **DeFine helped Cocaine** resolve agent crashes by explaining the need to add Anthropic API key to .env file

- **0xbbjoker assisted Hans** with an agent refusing to answer repeated questions by suggesting modifications to character definition components

- **Ruby offered help to mindxploit** with PDF processing issues and setting up multiple agents with their own knowledge bases in v2

# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-02-16

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Technical Development
- **Memory & Current Events Integration**: Discussions about implementing memory and current events awareness in Eliza agents, with suggestions to create custom providers that could fetch news from RSS feeds.
- **Build Issues**: Several users reported dependency management problems, particularly related to package versions and compatibility. Solutions included clean installations, using Docker Compose, and version upgrades to v0.1.18.
- **Plugin Interaction Patterns**: Brief discussion about chaining actions between plugins where one plugin calls another's action and consumes its output.
- **Twitter Plugin Enhancements**: Suggestions for more granular Twitter engagement options, specifically the ability to reply to comments on posts by targeted users rather than just replying directly to the targeted users' posts.

### Community Updates
- **Security Alert**: Shaw's Twitter account was hacked, with community members alerting others and reporting the fake tweets until control was regained.
- **Documentation Contributions**: Community members are working on documentation, with at least one PR merged and requests for feedback on additional documentation efforts.

### Pull Requests
- PR #1 for elizaos-plugins/plugin-news repository was mentioned by w1ld3r
- PR #3501 was merged, as reported by Bealers

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q**: Looking for documentation on memory + learning current events, can anyone point me in the right direction?  
**A**: Look at creating a provider, plugin-bootstrap has a time provider that informs the OS of the current time/date. For news, you could use fetch and make a provider that injects information from an RSS feed. (Odilitime)

**Q**: Is there a design pattern for chaining actions where one plugin calls another and consumes its output?  
**A**: Actions is the design pattern. (lefrog)

**Q**: Is there a way to reply to comments on posts by targeted users rather than just the posts themselves?  
**A**: No, this would require writing new code. (Odilitime)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Build Issue Resolution**:
   - joaointech suggested to a user experiencing "basex not being a function" errors that it was likely an npm version issue and recommended using Docker Compose
   - 0xSmartCrypto later shared their solution: upgrading to v0.1.18 and running only pnpm i, build, and dev worked

2. **Security Alert Collaboration**:
   - Multiple community members quickly alerted others about Shaw's hacked Twitter account and reported the fake tweets until the situation was resolved

3. **Documentation Feedback**:
   - Bealers shared a HackMD document with documentation they've been working on and asked for community feedback
   - Odilitime provided guidance on the proper channels for documentation contributions

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How can I solve the issue where the agent is unresponsive after running pnpm start:client?**  
A: Try using `pnpm run dev` instead of `pnpm start:client`, and look for the link to port 5713 rather than port 3000.

**Q: How can I implement multi-agent orchestration with ElizaOS?**  
A: Use Redis as a communication layer where agents can read what other agents do; Eliza can be on the front-end reading a Redis channel with a complex crew in the backend.

**Q: How can I fix the "ERROR: failed to solve: archive/tar: unknown file mode ?rwxr-xr-x" when building a Docker image?**  
A: Build it using Ubuntu in Windows; using GitBash or terminal directly in Windows doesn't work.

**Q: How can I fix Twitter configuration validation errors in Docker even when environment variables are set?**  
A: Try using debug mode, check which plugins are enabled, and update or move the .env file.

**Q: How does one host on VPS without it stopping?**  
A: Install pm2, a node process manager. Use: `pm2 start pnpm --<instance name> start`

**Q: Is there a tutorial on getting the AI agent to post images?**  
A: Use open-ai as provider; works out of box. Add instruction in character file like "ALWAYS RESPONDS WITH AN IMAGE" in all caps.

**Q: How can I deal with the Arkose Twitter captcha error?**  
A: Check if the bot is set to tell Twitter it's a bot.

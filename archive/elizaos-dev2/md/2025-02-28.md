## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How do I use the CLI for plugins?**  
A: It's in the QuickStart documentation, with commands like `npx elizaos plugins remove @elizaos-plugins/client-twitter` (Odilitime)

**Q: Which branch has best compatibility with current docs + previously implemented plugins?**  
A: Develop is in a good state (Odilitime)

**Q: Is there any docs or starter kit to start building plugin?**  
A: https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/docs/tutorials/nader_tutorial_35min/ (jin)

**Q: Will message manager history automatically search message history to not repeat messages?**  
A: Most client prompts include the last 20 messages, and vector search finds relevant memories, but it's platform dependent (Odilitime)

**Q: How do I have the agent run on Twitter/Discord in the latest update?**  
A: Need both client and plugin parameters in the character json (Odilitime)

**Q: How do I add my plugin to the Eliza plugins registry?**  
A: You need to make a dedicated repo for the plugin (not a complete Eliza copy), then make a PR that edits index.json to add your new repo (Odilitime)

**Q: I want to use the agent to post to a telegram channel, how could I?**  
A: `npx elizaos plugins install @elizaos-plugins/client-telegram` need to talk to botfather too to get the tokens (Odilitime)

**Q: What caused the out-of-memory bug in v0.25.8?**  
A: It was a dead loop issue in the splitChunks/splitText functions that consumed all available memory (v1xingyue)

- Fix missing quantity parameter in Binance MARKET trade implementation (mentioned by Zakito11)
- Address JavaScript heap out of memory errors in RAG implementation by increasing Node.js memory allocation (mentioned by Redvoid)
- Fix invalid array length issue in RAG implementation (mentioned by Redvoid)
- Troubleshoot agent not using knowledge from MD files in RAG implementation (mentioned by Redvoid)
- Improve memory management to prevent command repetition in agents (mentioned by 4n7m4n)

### Documentation

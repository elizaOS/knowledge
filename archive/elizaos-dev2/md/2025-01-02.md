# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-01-02

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Architecture & Framework Improvements
- **Runtime Modularization**: ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯 proposed using Zod schemas for character definition to better modularize the runtime composition, with Odilitime confirming this approach could be beneficial.
- **Bun Runtime Variant**: ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯 shared a Bun runtime variant aimed at reducing dependencies and simplifying deployment for beginners.
- **Code Quality Issues**: DeFine identified spaghetti code patterns in Core/generate.ts that need refactoring, particularly around redundant provider handling functions.
- **Unofficial Documentation**: kAI wilder created an unofficial documentation repository for ElizaOS runtime operations based on analysis of the Eliza agent core source code.

### Plugin Development
- **Cryptocurrency Plugins**: Multiple cryptocurrency-related plugins are in development, including:
  - CoinGecko plugin (PR #1761, potentially duplicating PR #1382)
  - CoinMarketCap plugin (PR #1773)
  - A crypto price plugin for dexscreener shared by ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯
- **Twitter Integration**: Several developers discussed Twitter API integration, with agwnl mentioning work on a Twitter client using the Twitter API, which was identified as a needed contribution.
- **Trading Bots**: Discussions about integrating trading bots for cryptocurrency trading.

### Project Management & Onboarding
- **Starter Repository Issues**: Significant concerns were raised about the neglected state of the eliza-starter repository, which hasn't been maintained for two months despite being the recommended starting point.
- **Onboarding Solutions**: Cole proposed either properly maintaining the starter repo or creating a "create-eliza" tool similar to create-react-app for better onboarding.
- **Upcoming Release**: Odilitime mentioned plans for version 0.1.8, likely to be released the following week.

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- **Hosting Recommendations**: Developers discussed hosting options for running agents 24/7, with recommendations for OVH/Hetzner over AWS for cost reasons.
- **Documentation Needs**: Teejay mentioned the need for better documentation on starting minimal Eliza projects and customizing them with add-ons.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can I use eliza without knowing how to code?**  
A: Yes (answered by sean)

**Q: Recommendation on cloud services for running an agent 24/7?**  
A: AWS is okay, Digital Ocean too. Clouds like AWS are expensive, OVH/Hetzner are much cheaper/better value. (answered by SotoAlt | BOSSU and Odilitime)

**Q: Any idea how can I retweet from specific person or reply to related post?**  
A: I am not aware of how that is possible with the twitter plugin but what I think the other way is that you can use the twitter webhook and can retweet certain posts and also replies to comments under your posts (answered by jumpspace)

**Q: Anyone making a twitter client which uses Twitter API?**  
A: I think that's very needed, I haven't heard of anyone working on it (answered by Odilitime)

**Q: How can I get started with a minimal Eliza project and customize it?**  
A: R0am pointed to the agent dev school resources at eliza.gg/eliza/community/ai-dev-school/, and Odilitime offered to answer questions about the framework

**Q: Could the runtime composition be modularized further with a schema-based approach?**  
A: Odilitime confirmed a Zod schema might be good

**Q: How is the CoinGecko plugin PR #1761 different than PR #1382?**  
A: "Oh didn't see one already open for coingecko" (answered by Spit, indicating potential duplication)

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Documentation Support**:
   - kAI wilder created an unofficial documentation repository for ElizaOS runtime operations to help the community understand the system better.
   - R0am shared agent dev school resources with Teejay who was looking for documentation on getting started.

2. **Plugin Development Collaboration**:
   - ℭ𝔦𝔭𝔥𝔢𝔯 shared a GitHub repo with an aggregate of multiple pricing services for crypto and offered to collaborate with Pleasures on their crypto price plugin.
   - Ruby offered to draft a side-by-side feature analysis of the competing CoinGecko plugin PRs to help determine which to merge.

3. **Infrastructure Guidance**:
   - Odilitime advised Dragonbutt on cloud services, suggesting OVH/Hetzner as cheaper alternatives to AWS for running agents 24/7.

4. **Twitter Integration Help**:
   - jumpspace helped Alex curtin with Twitter integration, suggesting using Twitter webhook to retweet certain posts and reply to comments.

5. **Debugging Assistance**:
   - Ruby requested error message details from Teejay to diagnose import issues with Eliza core and Twitter packages.

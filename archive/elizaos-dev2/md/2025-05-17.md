## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does the Discord plugin have functionality to allow an agent to see, monitor, and respond to support tickets?**  
A: There's no pre-built support-ticket-object in the Discord API, but it does support bots who monitor designated channels for emoji interactions that can trigger an automated private response thread. So it should be possible. (answered by Hidden Forces)

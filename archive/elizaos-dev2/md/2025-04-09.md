## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS v2 Migration & Architecture
- The architecture has significantly changed from v1 to v2:
  - The "agent" package has been moved into "cli" with REST API integration
  - Agents are now database-driven rather than client-driven, enabling programmatic creation
  - REST API is now natively integrated into the system
- Users are actively working through the beta CLI setup process
- GitHub authentication is now required during fresh installation before interacting with the default character

### Plugin Development
- Community members are collaborating on plugin migration strategies for v2
- The `setup-monorepo` command is being recommended as a starting point
- The plugin-starter structure is being referenced as a template for new plugin development
- Several users are looking for guidance on how to adapt existing plugins to the new architecture

### API Integration
- Questions about REST API availability in v2 are emerging
- At least one user reported difficulties with message endpoints returning 404 errors despite agent showing active status
- Google Generative AI enterprise version configuration support is being questioned

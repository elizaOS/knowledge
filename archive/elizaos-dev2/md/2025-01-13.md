# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-01-13

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### ElizaOS Core Development
- **Knowledge Implementation**: Discussions about adding persistent knowledge to ElizaOS agents to reduce hallucinations. The development branch now features a knowledge folder that allows adding data to character files.
- **Docker Development**: Mike D. is working on Docker image development for ARM64 architecture.
- **Memory Optimization**: Concerns raised about the monolithic repository structure consuming excessive resources (6.7GB RAM per agent), making cloud deployment costly.
- **PR Agents**: AIFlow.ML mentioned starting work on PR Agents and requested review for PR #2275.

### Twitter Integration Issues
- **Login Problems**: Users reported issues with Twitter login in Eliza v0.1.8+build.1, sometimes requiring manual login with the agent account first.
- **Tweet Formatting**: After the 1.8+ update, tweets are displaying with unwanted numbered lines and quotes. A PR has been submitted to fix this with regex improvements.
- **Twitter Spaces**: Discussions about enabling agents to join existing Twitter spaces programmatically rather than starting their own.

### Plugin Development
- **New Plugins**: Several users discussing development of plugins including:
  - Crypto news plugin
  - Transaction monitoring functionality
  - GNU social/Mastodon plugin

### Project Showcase
- **SAIOS Platform**: ICJR introduced SAIOS (https://saios.app), a platform making the Eliza framework accessible to users without coding skills, featuring a decentralized architecture with UI on IPFS/Arweave and agent server on Akash.

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How to add knowledge in the ElizaOS agent to prevent hallucinations?**  
A: Use the development branch, create a knowledge folder in the character file, and add necessary variables. Alternatively, fine-tune the agent with specific data to reduce reliance on messageExamples.

**Q: How to fix Twitter login issues in Eliza v0.1.8+build.1?**  
A: Sometimes you need to manually login with your agent X account first before running the agent again, as this may be related to X soft bans.

**Q: How to make an agent answer with a specific link when asked?**  
A: Add the link to the 'system' prompt in char.json.

**Q: Is it possible for the agent to join an existing space rather than starting its own?**  
A: Yes, agent-twitter-client can do this.

**Q: How to install ElizaOS on MacBook Pro?**  
A: Install Xcode command line tools first with 'xcode-select --install', then use Homebrew and clone the repo.

**Q: What plugins or tools can scrape ALL historical tweets from someone?**  
A: Check tweets2character tool in the characterfile repo.

**Q: Why does eliza-starter boot with LlamaService instead of specified provider?**  
A: It still makes calls to the specified provider (e.g., Anthropic) when chatting begins despite initializing LlamaService.

## Community Help & Collaboration

1. **Knowledge Implementation Guidance**:
   - Mad helped WarfreakzPlays implement knowledge in ElizaOS agents by explaining how to use the development branch, create a knowledge folder in character files, and add necessary variables.

2. **Twitter Spaces Integration**:
   - sayonara assisted pluto with joining Twitter spaces programmatically by providing GitHub links to relevant code and explaining that client-twitter uses agent-twitter-client.

3. **Tweet Formatting Fix**:
   - 4n7m4n created a PR with regex fixes to remove numbered list markers from tweets after multiple users reported formatting issues.

4. **MacOS Installation Support**:
   - Ruby provided step-by-step guidance to 43rdBigIdeaCEO for installing ElizaOS on MacBook Pro, including Xcode tools installation prerequisites.

5. **RAG Knowledge Implementation**:
   - ꧁Ninja_Dev꧂ explained to pluto that current ragKnowledge is basic and works for static data in markdown/txt format, not for dynamic website parsing.

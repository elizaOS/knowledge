# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-01-25

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### RAG Functionality Issues
- Users reported knowledge retrieval failing in the develop branch while directory loading failed in v0.1.8
- kAI wilder investigated and found that knowledge was being retrieved properly but the LLM was omitting important information
- Embedding matches were no longer being logged, reducing transparency in the retrieval process

### Multi-Agent Configuration
- Several users discussed approaches for running multiple agents within a single project
- The recommended approach involves using the `--characters` parameter with comma-separated character files
- Adding client credentials directly to character files helps avoid conflicts between agents

### Ollama Integration
- Users troubleshooted using Ollama with Eliza, encountering connection errors despite Ollama running locally
- Setting `modelProvider` to "ollama" in the character file is required
- Running Ollama with commands like "ollama serve" or "ollama run llama3.2" is necessary before connecting

### New Features
- The News Plugin has been merged, allowing users to get the latest news about specific topics using newsapi.org
- Interest in social media integration was expressed, with requests for Facebook/Instagram and Twitter posting capabilities

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: What is the correct approach in setting up multiple agents in one project?**  
A: Use `--characters` with a comma-separated list of character files, and add client credentials directly to character files to avoid conflicts.

**Q: Why is Eliza looking for an API key when using Ollama locally?**  
A: You need to set `modelProvider` to "ollama" in the character file.

**Q: How can I fix the "connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:11434" error when using Ollama?**  
A: Ensure Ollama is running with "ollama serve" or "ollama run llama3.2".

**Q: My agent keeps defaulting to the Eliza character despite having worked before. What could be wrong?**  
A: Check for bracket errors in your character file that might be causing JSON parsing issues.

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Auto.fun Solana Program Implementation
- Discussion about Raydium liquidity migration implementation details
- Clarification on using `lockLp` function (temporary lock) versus `burnAndEarn.createLockInstruction` (permanent lock/burn)
- Confirmation that Auto.fun contracts have been audited by Spearbit/Cantina
- Developer explained they're using `feeNftOwner` parameter with a custom vault as recipient
- Future plans for NFT functionality beyond creator fee claiming

### Plugin Development for Eliza V2
- User inquired about developing plugins for Eliza V2 without requiring multiple agents
- Guidance provided on using documentation and template creation command
- Discussion about code structure differences between V1 and V2 versions

### EVM Plugin Configuration Issues
- Troubleshooting session for EVM plugin connection problems
- Identified that using multiple provider URLs requires setting a default chain
- Solution involved adding `EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN` environment variable to specify primary network

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Can plugins be developed based on the current V2 version? Is there any excellent open source code to refer to?**  
A: Check the docs on how to create a plugin at https://eliza.how/docs/core/plugins. Once you create your template plugin with `elizaos create --type project`, you can start developing your plugin and integrate it to your Eliza v2 project.

**Q: Are auto.fun solana program (contracts) audited?**  
A: Yes, by Spearbit/Cantina.

**Q: Could you explain the reasoning behind choosing the standard lockLp function (temporary lock) for the Raydium liquidity migration instead of the burnAndEarn.createLockInstruction (permanent lock/burn) feature?**  
A: We do use the `feenftowner` but it's the custom vault. There's more plans for the NFT than just creator fee claiming.

**Q: How do I fix the EVM plugin when it's not connecting properly?**  
A: Set an `EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN` environment variable to specify your primary network when using multiple provider URLs.

**Q: What logs should I check for EVM connection issues?**  
A: Check `/var/log/elizaos/agent.log` for EVM connection details.

**Q: What environment variables are required for the EVM plugin?**  
A: `PROVIDER_URL` and `CHAIN_ID` are required, and `EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN` when using multiple networks.

## Community Help & Collaboration

### EVM Plugin Troubleshooting
- **Helper:** Ruby
- **Helpee:** ItzMrTobz
- **Context:** User had configured multiple Ethereum provider URLs (Arbitrum, Polygon, Fantom, Base) but encountered "no wallet or connection" error when attempting transfers
- **Resolution:** Ruby identified the missing `EVM_DEFAULT_CHAIN` environment variable and provided solution to set a default chain (e.g., "arbitrum")

### Plugin Development Guidance
- **Helper:** DeFine
- **Helpee:** lantianlaoli
- **Context:** User needed guidance on developing plugins for Eliza V2
- **Resolution:** Directed to documentation at eliza.how/docs/core/plugins and provided command `elizaos create --type project` to create a template plugin

# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-01-17

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Development & Technical Issues
- **Backend Connection Issues**: Several users reported problems with hardcoded localhost:3000 connections making remote deployment difficult. Santi identified the issue in client/src/lib/api.ts and offered to create a PR.
- **RAG Knowledge System**: Discussion about the current capabilities of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation system, which currently only supports TXT and MD files (not PDF). Users inquired about when it would be pushed to the main build.
- **Pull Request Activity**: Multiple PRs are awaiting review, including plugins for Twilio, Livepeer as an LLM provider, and other features. Developers are actively seeking feedback and resolving conflicts.
- **Database Management**: Some users experienced database issues requiring resets by deleting db.sqlite from the agent directory.
- **API Integration**: Users worked on connecting ElizaOS with external services, particularly Telegram bots, with guidance provided on obtaining API tokens.

### Tools & Infrastructure
- **Review Automation**: Discussion about using AI tools like CodeRabbit and Codeium Forge to accelerate PR reviews, with Odilitime confirming CodeRabbit is available upon request.
- **Project Management**: Linear has apparently been mandated for all projects despite earlier flexibility, prompting discussion about organizational tooling decisions.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Suggested as a solution for finding information within repositories when documentation is lacking.

### Feature Requests & Roadmap
- **Scheduled Actions**: Users expressed interest in implementing functionality to run agent actions at regular intervals.
- **Twitter & Social Media Integration**: Questions about Twitter Spaces functionality and Twitter DM capabilities without official API access. Also interest in Instagram client integration.
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Multiple users mentioned the need for workflow and multi-agent orchestration capabilities.
- **Deferred Execution**: Interest in implementing deferred execution of actions for scheduling functionality.

### Documentation Concerns
- **Information Accessibility**: Frustration expressed about information being scattered across videos rather than consolidated in documentation.
- **Core System Understanding**: Specific concerns about understanding providers, plugins, and goals functionality.
- **Developer Support**: Difficulty in getting technical support and responses to questions, particularly challenging for Python developers working with TypeScript.

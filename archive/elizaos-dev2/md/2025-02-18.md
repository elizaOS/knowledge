# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-02-18

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Agent Development & Infrastructure
- **Twitter/X Integration**: Functionality exists but is disabled by default due to Twitter API v2 rate limits. Implementation details can be found in `packages/client-twitter/src/interactions.ts`.
- **Agent Registry Protocol**: A specification was proposed for an agent registry using the ai16z token2022 standard memo field and PGP signatures for agent verification on public networks.
- **Secure Agent Communication**: Discussion of encrypted messaging, P2P handshaking, and potential Tor-like networks for agent privacy.
- **Hosting Options**: Common platforms include Ubuntu 24.04 (sometimes with Nvidia GPU for local Llama) and standard VPS/dedicated servers. Docker containers are the recommended deployment method.

### Development Workflow
- **PR Management Best Practices**: Contributors should create smaller, feature-focused PRs to avoid blocking entire changes due to minor issues.
- **Contribution Process**: PRs should be made to the `develop` branch rather than the `main` branch, and contributors need to fork the repository rather than requesting direct push access.
- **Plugin Contributions**: Developers can submit PRs to the new registry to make their plugins available to all users.

### Technical Issues
- **eliza.gg Site**: Issues were noted with the current site, and a replacement is in development.
- **Starter Template Errors**: Users encountered "Headers Timeout Error" when starting Eliza using the Starter template.
- **Docker Build Issues**: A user reported an "unknown file mode ?rwxr-xr-x" error during Docker containerization.

### Upcoming Events
- **Compass Labs Demo**: A demonstration about their plugin for agent execution within DeFi is scheduled for 1pm UTC.

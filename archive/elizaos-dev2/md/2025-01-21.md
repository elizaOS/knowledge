# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-01-21

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Plugin Development & Integration Issues
- Several developers reported issues with the Twitter Spaces functionality, encountering ICE connection failures despite trying multiple branches and configurations
- Compatibility problems were identified with plugins (abstract, cronos, holdstation) when porting from v1 to v2
- A PR (#2599) was submitted by AIFlow.ML adding moderation capabilities to Eliza, including video understanding functionality
- Discussions about creating a search integration that could fetch context from external APIs and incorporate it into responses, rather than just returning links
- Interest in developing a generic context provider that could connect to various APIs without requiring custom plugins for each service

### Build & Environment Issues
- Multiple developers reported build failures on Windows environments
- Agent package version compatibility issues were identified (v0.1.9-alpha causing problems, v0.1.8 working correctly)
- JSON validation errors occurred with the knowledge property being formatted as an object instead of an array

### Community Infrastructure
- A "brain drain" issue was identified where active developers had moved between Discord servers
- The solution implemented was bridging the coders channels between Discord servers rather than having developers monitor multiple servers

### New Tools & Features
- A community member (xLuisCumbi) developed "chats2character.js" that generates character schemas from WhatsApp conversations
- Titan shared a guide for setting up nodes and mentioned an incentive program for building AI agents with Livepeer

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Does the Twitter plugin have the capacity to scrape x.com lists or do specific searches regularly and save to local database?**  
A: Use client-twitter. There isn't a specific plugin for that functionality, but it could be built as a custom solution.

**Q: How does Eliza distinguish between different actions? Is there a meta prompt of some kind?**  
A: There isn't a single hard-coded system prompt. Instead, the runtime compiles a "master prompt" on each request by combining multiple pieces of context.

**Q: What was causing the error with the agent package?**  
A: The issue was with the latest release (0.1.9-alpha) of the agent package; downgrading to 0.1.8 resolved it.

**Q: Why is the JSON file not validating?**  
A: The knowledge property is being formatted as an object instead of the required array type, likely due to syntax errors like missing commas.

**Q: Can you pass me a list of all plugins that are causing issues?**  
A: abstract/cronos/holdstation are the problematic plugins.

**Q: Should developers be present in both Discord servers?**  
A: Initially yes, but bridging is a better solution to avoid context switching.

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **tcm390 helped boolkeys** by disabling problematic plugins that were breaking the development branch
- **WarfreakzPlays helped boolkeys** identify two issues causing build failures: plugin-avail implementation problems and akashPlugin references that needed removal
- **BackyOG helped WarfreakzPlays** with Windows build failures by suggesting using gitbash terminal instead of editor terminal
- **D. Ratta helped kuzyakiev** with JSON validation errors by identifying likely bracket/comma errors and suggesting debugging approaches
- **Odilitime helped jin** by implementing a bridge between Discord servers to solve the developer attention fragmentation issue
- **AIFlow.ML guided xLuisCumbi** on how to contribute their WhatsApp character generation script to the community

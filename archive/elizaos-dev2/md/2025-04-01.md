## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: How to use the DeepSeekAI for V2? There is no place to input the ApiKey.**  
A: Use the DEEPSEEK_API_KEY environment variable (Sashimikun)

**Q: Are pre-1.0.0 plugins compatible with v1.0.0?**  
A: Depends on complexity. Simple plugins might work, but complex ones need changes. `Clients` was changed to `Services` in plugins, and there are API differences. Not 100% backwards compatible. (Ritvik S)

**Q: What is the purpose of the llms-full.txt file mentioned in the docs?**  
A: It's to give an LLM context about Eliza code before asking it questions (jin)

**Q: Why would someone new to agent development use Eliza rather than OpenAI Agents SDK or Microsoft's Autogen?**  
A: Ownership, community, crypto integrations (jin)

**Q: What capabilities does Hedra enable for Puppetto agents?**  
A: Lipsync and some animation features (DefiniteOptimist)

**Q: Could we have an event created - so I could put that into my calendar?**  
A: Here's a Public calendar that reflects all events [Google Calendar link] (Nisita)

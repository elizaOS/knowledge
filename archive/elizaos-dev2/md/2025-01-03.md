# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-01-03

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Plugin Development & Ecosystem Growth
- Multiple cryptocurrency plugins are in development, including CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, Binance, and DexScreener price plugins
- Pleasures completed a DexScreener price plugin with actions, evaluators, and providers
- AIFlow.ML contributed database adapters aligned with the new PostgreSQL schema
- Neodotneo is working on Rabbi Trader that removes external dependencies from the Solana plugin
- Users are actively building agents for various purposes, including TradFi automation

### Developer Experience & Onboarding
- The `eliza-starter` repository is outdated and causing friction for newcomers
- Cole suggested implementing an `npx create eliza` command similar to create-react-app
- Ruby offered to collaborate on streamlining starter repo documentation
- Community members prefer TypeScript over Python for development
- Robin shared links to the first four agent dev school recordings

### Infrastructure & Deployment
- Discussion about hosting options for running agents 24/7
- Recommendations included AWS, Digital Ocean, OVH, and Hetzner
- Some users prefer bare metal servers for cost efficiency
- Technical challenges around implementing clients in character files

### Architecture & Design Discussions
- Ruby advised separating news sources into distinct actions for better modularity
- Discussion about dynamic lore/bio integration using environment variables
- Interest in agent discovery mechanisms, possibly using cookie.fun
- Integration possibilities with other tools like Cursor

## Key Questions & Answers

**Q: Recommendation on cloud services for running an agent 24/7?**  
A: AWS and Digital Ocean are good options (SotoAlt | BOSSU), but OVH/Hetzner offer better value with cheaper bare metal options (Odilitime)

**Q: Could `npx create eliza` be a useful feature?**  
A: Yes, it would be nice (Teejay)

**Q: Would it be better to have each news source in separate actions?**  
A: Yes, separating news sources into distinct actions makes your code more modular and easier to maintain. Each source can have its own error handling, parsing logic, and be independently updated (Ruby)

**Q: What does "zero-length vector are not supported" mean?**  
A: This error typically occurs when trying to perform an embedding search with an empty or uninitialized vector. Check your embedding generation process (Ruby)

**Q: How is the new CoinGecko plugin different from PR #1382?**  
A: Spit acknowledged they didn't see the existing PR and suggested they might create a CoinMarketCap plugin instead

**Q: Is the Binance plugin using API or WebSocket?**  
A: API for now, with WebSocket functionality potentially coming later (Spit)

## Community Help & Collaboration

- **Hosting Recommendations**: Odilitime provided specific links to OVH and Hetzner bare metal hosting options when Dragonbutt asked about running agents 24/7
- **Twitter Integration**: R0am shared the link to eliza.gg when Alex curtin was trying to figure out how to use Eliza for Twitter
- **Crypto Utility**: ‚Ñ≠ùî¶ùî≠ùî•ùî¢ùîØ created a GitHub repository with discussions enabled for a crypto pricing utility
- **Code Resources**: kAI wilder informed Robin that the pizza bot code is on the "pizzabot" branch of the main repo
- **Architecture Guidance**: Ruby advised KeyesCode.eth on structuring actions for different news sources, recommending separate action files for better modularity
- **Onboarding Improvement**: Ruby offered to collaborate with Cole on streamlining starter repo documentation and prototyping a solution

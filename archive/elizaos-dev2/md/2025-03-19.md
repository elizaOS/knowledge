# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-03-19

## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Eliza v2 Beta Status and Issues
- The v2 beta is experiencing various installation and setup issues that the team is actively addressing
- Not yet considered stable for production business use, though some developers are using it for hobby projects
- Users are struggling with CLI commands, dependencies (particularly bun), and getting agents to appear
- Several database migration errors reported, including issues with the "agents" relation
- Default agent creation not working properly in beta installations

### Technical Performance and Models
- deepseek-r1:14b highlighted as particularly good at following instructions despite not being the fastest
- Performance report: ~35 tokens per second on a GeForce 3060 with 12GB of VRAM using deepseek-r1:14b
- EVM chain support confirmed for agent wallets across "couple dozen chains"

### Community Projects
- NaN announced aigent.sh, a project built on ElizaOS technology to make AI agents accessible to non-technical users
- Daily updates being released with prioritized early access offered to those providing feedback

### Agent Development Challenges
- Significant issue identified with crypto wallet agents not recognizing external state changes (like wallet funding)
- Current workaround requires deleting the memories table from the database to force balance rechecking
- Better context management needed for financial applications to handle on-chain transactions

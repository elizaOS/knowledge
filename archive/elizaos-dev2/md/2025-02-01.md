# elizaOS Development Discord - 2025-02-01

## Overall Discussion Highlights

- **Package Availability**: The @elizaos/plugin-solana-agent-kit package appears to be missing from the npm registry, returning 404 errors when users attempt to install it.

### Plugin Development & Architecture
- **Model Size Selection**: Odilitime clarified how ElizaOS determines which model size to use: small models for decision making, large for drafting, and medium for images.
- **Plugin Integration**: Discussions about how to specify plugins in character files and the proper way to import plugins into agents.
- **Context Window Limitations**: Users discussed embedding models and context window constraints when using certain plugins.
- **New Plugins Announced**: MrVash announced a new plugin for dynamic API calls based on OpenAPI schemes, and DorianD proposed a bounty for a "Quantum Eliza" plugin.

### Agent Capabilities & Development
- **Trading Strategy Agents**: A user inquired about developing agents capable of generating trading and DeFi strategies based on user conditions and market data.
- **Self-Iteration Mechanisms**: Discussion about how agents might self-improve by adjusting strategies based on performance feedback.
- **Demo Opportunity**: Kenk announced an opportunity for developers to showcase their agent projects to the ai16z community and mentors.

### Development Updates

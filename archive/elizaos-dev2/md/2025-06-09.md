## Overall Discussion Highlights

### Unified Message Handler Implementation
A technical discussion focused on the unified message handler in the v1 implementation. The conversation centered around how provider selection works within the system architecture. It was clarified that the message handler is located in plugin-bootstrap, which determines what dynamic providers are included in the system.

There appears to be confusion about how the AI selects providers, as this logic isn't clearly visible in the codebase. Additionally, issues were identified with generated messages not including provider information and memories from AI-selected actions not being properly sent to "socials" components.

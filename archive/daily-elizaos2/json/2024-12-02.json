This feature introduces a CircuitBreaker class with three states: CLOSED, OPEN, and HALF-OPEN. A BaseCircuitBreakerAdapter has been added for database adapters, allowing configurable failure thresholds and recovery timeouts. The circuit breaker opens after five consecutive failures (configurable), resets after 60 seconds in the OPEN state, and requires three successful operations in the HALF-OPEN state to close. Automatic recovery attempts and detailed logging of state changes have also been included to enhance reliability. These changes help prevent overwhelming failed database connections and provide graceful degradation during outages.",

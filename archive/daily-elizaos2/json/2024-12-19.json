This feature allows agents to interact with Nostr relays, post notes, and manage interactions. Configuration requires setting environment variables such as NOSTR_RELAYS, NOSTR_NSEC_KEY, and NOSTR_NPUB_KEY. The update includes the integration of Nostr NDK, a new NostrClient class, and interaction and post managers. Testing confirms that Nostr notes are posted successfully when running an agent.",

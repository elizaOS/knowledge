This appears to be related to documentation functionality in the project.\n\n2. Issue #3914 discusses the usage of typebox for safety. Typebox is likely a type validation library being considered for implementation to improve type safety in the codebase.\n\nBoth issues are currently open and awaiting resolution from the project maintainers.",

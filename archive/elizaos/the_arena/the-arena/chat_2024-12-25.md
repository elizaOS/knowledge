## Summary
The chat focused on extending the `TelegramClientInterface` from the `@ai16z/eliza` library to implement custom message handling. E.T. inquired about the limitations of the interface, which only includes start and stop methods. Alice and Ruby suggested creating a custom client that inherits from the base interface, emphasizing the need for message handling and connection management. They discussed the feasibility of integrating a custom Telegram client into the `IAgentRuntime`, highlighting the importance of implementing required methods and maintaining clean abstraction layers. Ruby offered to draft TypeScript prototypes to assist E.T. in the implementation process.

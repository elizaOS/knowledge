## Summary
The chat focused on the regulatory landscape of cryptocurrencies, with Ruby providing statistical insights into the percentage of unregulated assets and the complexities of compliance. Koda inquired about the percentage of regulated versus unregulated crypto, to which Ruby responded with detailed metrics. Alice offered to pull real-time data comparing DEX and CEX trading volumes but encountered issues due to API limitations. Despite this, she expressed willingness to share insights on SOL DEXes, highlighting her experience with liquidity pools in that ecosystem. The discussion emphasized the need for accurate data and the challenges posed by the dynamic nature of crypto regulations.

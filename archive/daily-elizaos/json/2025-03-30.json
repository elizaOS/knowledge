          "text": "The ElizaOS community has been actively troubleshooting and resolving issues related to plugin installations, local AI configuration, and third-party integrations such as Twitter and Telegram. A major focus was on resolving plugin visibility issues after installation via CLI and Bun. The recommended fix involved cloning the ElizaOS repository, switching to the v2-develop branch, and running a sequence of Bun commands: `bun install`, `bun run build`, and `bun start`. This resolved several plugin-related errors.",

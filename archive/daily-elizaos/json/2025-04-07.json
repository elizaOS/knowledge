        {
          "text": "The ElizaOS team resolved a documentation issue related to CLI plugin commands. Previously, users encountered 'subcommand not found' errors due to outdated or incorrect syntax in the documentation. The fix updates the CLI usage instructions for `elizaos plugin <subcommand>` to reflect the correct syntax, improving user experience and reducing confusion. This change is low-risk as it only affects documentation and does not impact runtime behavior.",

          "text": "A bug causing port conflicts during local development was fixed. When running `npx elizaos start`, users previously encountered an 'agents already exists' error if the default port was in use. The updated logic now checks for port availability and automatically selects the next available port, ensuring smoother project startup. This is a low-risk, non-breaking change that improves the development experience without requiring documentation updates.",

This medium-risk update ensures proper deletion of agents, prevents UI hangs, and handles edge cases like active logs or running agents.",

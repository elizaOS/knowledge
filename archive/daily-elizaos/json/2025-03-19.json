The team is actively fixing bugs to ensure Spartan functions properly in v2.\n- Major improvements include a new GUI, Tauri app, CLI, and in-browser editor. The API has been simplified with runtime-based operations, and character files are no longer required.\n- Some community members expressed concerns that DegenSpartan AI’s progress appears stalled due to its dependency on ElizaOS v2. The team clarified that all development efforts are focused on v2, making them inseparable.",

Solution: Place knowledge files in `characters/knowledge/<your_directory>` and ensure `.md` format for better processing.\n- **Supabase RAG Knowledge Issues**: `search_knowledge` function was missing in the latest version. Suggested fix: Generate embeddings for vector search.\n- **Plugin-SQL Errors**: Users faced issues with `plugin-sql` in v2. Suggested fix: Use `npm install -g @elizaos/cli@1.0.0-beta.1`.\n- **OAuth2 Plugin Authentication**: Suggested solution: Use a custom API for handling access/refresh tokens.\n- **Token Limit Exceeded**: Users encountered GPT-4o token limit errors. Suggested fix: Reduce input/output tokens.\n- **Debugging Eliza Actions**: Users struggled with Eliza not executing actions. Suggested fix: Check `shouldHandle` method and watch Nader’s tutorial.",

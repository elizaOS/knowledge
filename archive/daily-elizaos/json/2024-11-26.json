Documentation updates are required to guide users on configuring Coinbase API keys. Testing steps include wallet initialization, trade execution, and error handling.

The proposed solution introduces a property-driven approach where the system will use either OpenAI embeddings or local BGESmallENV15 from fastembed, depending on an environment variable. BGE-Small is preferred over BGE-Large due to its smaller size and comparable performance. This change aims to reduce API costs and latency while maintaining high embedding quality.",

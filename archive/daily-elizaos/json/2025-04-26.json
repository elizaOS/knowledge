In the main discussion channel, users debated the potential migration from 'ai16z' token to 'ElizaOS', with some advocating for immediate action while others cautioned about potential negative price impacts. There was frustration expressed about the current platform developer (Bao/baoskee) not delivering promised features like voting functionality.\n\nA moderation incident occurred where a community member (DorianD) was temporarily kicked from the server but was later reinstated after review. The community manager clarified that this was done by a moderator who had been inactive for 9 days and that they would review who has access to kick privileges.",

Tokens not appearing after creation\n\nThe team acknowledged these issues and provided updates.

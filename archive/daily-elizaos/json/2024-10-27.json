This system categorizes orders into low, medium, and high confidence levels based on predefined criteria. The implementation includes UI elements for confidence selection, a scoring algorithm, and filters for the order book. Users should be able to assign confidence levels, view them in the UI, and filter orders accordingly. The confidence scoring will also impact trust calculations.",

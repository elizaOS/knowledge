Multiple users reported that the site redirects to the X (Twitter) account when accessed. Team members confirmed they are working on database upgrades and implementing new features.\n\nDuring brief periods when the site was accessible for testing, users reported several issues including:\n- Blank chart, transaction, and holder data\n- Missing tokens (imported tokens were temporarily disabled)\n- Failed fee claims functionality\n- UI inconsistencies in list view\n- Problems with sort functionality\n\nTeam representatives (including k_carv and accelxr) acknowledged they were \"testing in prod\" and asked for patience. They mentioned that significant progress has been made, but couldn't provide a specific ETA for when the site would be fully operational again.",

One user specifically asked if it would be released this week despite the bugs in Auto.fun.\n\nA technical question was raised about running multiple AI characters (with different JSON configurations) on the same machine, though this remained unanswered in the chat.\n\nWeekly builder demos were announced, with recordings to be uploaded to the ElizaOS Developer YouTube channel. The team clarified that these demos feature agent teams introducing their projects, ranging from hackathon projects to larger team efforts, but are not related to upcoming launches.",

Implementing a token economy where a percentage of fees from tokens created on Auto.fun could fund AI compute resources for agents\n\n2. Enabling agents to dynamically switch between different LLM providers based on performance evaluations\n\n3. Using price correlations after agent interactions as a proxy for measuring LLM effectiveness\n\n4. Creating statistical dashboards showing metrics like issuances, transaction volume, and user participation\n\nThere was also excitement about Smolverse's Neurochimp project, which was featured in a demo and appears to implement NFTs with memory functions.",

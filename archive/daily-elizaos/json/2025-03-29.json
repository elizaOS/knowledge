Users encountered various technical issues, including plugin import errors, database configuration problems, and Discord/Twitter integration challenges. One common issue was a SyntaxError when importing EventEmitter from eventemitter3 due to CommonJS/ESM incompatibility. The workaround involved importing the default export and destructuring it. Users also faced problems with outdated CLI commands, which were clarified by community member dankvr, who provided updated instructions and documentation links.",

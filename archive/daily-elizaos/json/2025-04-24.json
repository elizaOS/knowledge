The platform now features improved stability and a refreshed UI. Shaw announced that the Auto.fun codebase has been open-sourced, which was shared without much fanfare but represents a significant development.\n\nThe platform recorded approximately $12 million in trading volume within the first 12 hours of its relaunch. A comprehensive launch article has been published, and the team has implemented a coordinated marketing strategy featuring one launch partner per day for the next two weeks, starting with FightFI on Monday.\n\nSome users have reported issues with token migration to Raydium, which the team is addressing. Hardware wallet support (particularly Ledger) is currently unavailable but has been logged as a feature request.",

Projects are already building on V2, including bioDAO which used it for their BioAgents hackathon. The team clarified that Eliza V2 is not being sunset after release, contrary to some community concerns.\n\nA key feature of Eliza V2 is the Swarm integration, which enables agent collaboration through the Multi-agent Coordination Protocol (MCP). According to documentation shared by community member osintmao9, swarms can \"share vector memory, use the same wallet safely, chain tasks in sequence, learn over time, and act as one hive mind.\"\n\nDevelopers working with V2 have reported some challenges with plugins, particularly with SQL connections and OpenAI integration. The team is providing support through dedicated channels and has pointed developers to resources like the Bio Agent plugin as a reference implementation.",

The profile includes separate Twitter accounts for the agent and the token to make updates and announcements easier to find.\n\nSpartan development continues with Odi still working on the project.

The platform is expected to launch within 1-2 weeks, with Spartan V2 integrated into it. Despite progress, users are encountering significant implementation difficulties, particularly around plugin integration and database connectivity.\n\n## Key Development Issues\n\n### Plugin Development Challenges\n- Multiple users express confusion about developing and adding plugins in v2\n- Significant structural changes from previous versions causing adaptation difficulties\n- Folder structure and plugin registration process are particularly confusing\n- Providers for plugins don't appear to be registered at startup (though this was later clarified)\n\n### Technical Problems\n- SQL plugin compatibility issues (`@elizaos/plugin-sql@^0.25.6 failed to resolve`)\n- Database connection timeouts with Neon database URLs\n- EVM plugin integration challenges for ETH transfers\n- Build errors including DTS build errors and JSON parsing issues\n- Flag-related errors specifically on Windows systems\n\n### Model Support\n- V2 appears to primarily support OpenAI and Anthropic models by default\n- Some support exists for local-ai, Grok/Groq, and Ollama as alternatives\n- Users have requested support for additional models like deepseek\n\n## Integration Solutions\n\n- **Telegram Integration**: Working solution involves disabling Privacy Mode in BotFather settings\n- **Plugin Development**: Current recommendation is to clone v2-develop and copy existing plugins\n- **JSON Parsing Errors**: Removing starterPlugin from index.ts resolves some issues\n\n## Upcoming Features\n\n- A \"linktree-like service\" is being developed to consolidate Spartan/DegenAI links\n- Spartan will be open-sourced after ElizaOS v2 officially releases\n- There's a connection between ai16z transactions and DegenAI, where ai16z transactions create buy pressure for DegenAI\n\nThe overall sentiment indicates that ElizaOS v2 is still in development with incomplete documentation and missing features, making it challenging for developers to implement custom solutions.",

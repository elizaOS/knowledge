Notable token launches include 'Fat Factory Model' (FFM/SOL), 'jerome powell' (fed/SOL), and 'humanize' (humanize/SOL), with social media signals playing a key role in their momentum.

Hedra was highlighted for its upcoming multi-actor and camera control features. Dankvr also proposed a Discord bot to crowdsource AI news using ChatGPT, and is working on avatar production workflows for DAO partners. In crypto-gaming, Hyperfy was praised for its seamless token integration, with plans for a game jam to explore its capabilities. Documentation improvements and open-sourcing workflows were also discussed.",

Plugin-related issues included deterministic key generation in @elizaos/plugin-tee v1.0.0-beta.27, with advice to check for consistent parameters and cached data. Twitter integration problems were also noted, with users unable to post tweets despite successful authentication.

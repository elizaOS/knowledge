The command was reported to be slow and occasionally timing out. [spynter] initiated the discussion after observing delays. [dev_riko] identified that the command was retrieving excessive data from the database without pagination or filtering. To address this, they proposed limiting the query to the last 100 reports and adding an index on the timestamp column. They also recommended using async/await properly to avoid blocking the event loop.",

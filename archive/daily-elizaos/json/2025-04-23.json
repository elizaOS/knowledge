The team is working through backend upgrades to improve cache and database systems to handle increased workload. Team member Ben shared a detailed go-to-market strategy for the relaunch:\n\n- Launch partners remain engaged and excited despite scheduling delays\n- When live again, the community will be informed first before wider marketing\n- Launch communications will include articles on platform purpose and tokenomics\n- Launch partner spotlight campaign will begin with FightFI on Monday, followed by one launch per day over two weeks\n\nTeam members described the technical challenges as a \"hydra\" where solving one issue reveals additional problems. Some community members have expressed frustration about the lack of specific timeline updates.",

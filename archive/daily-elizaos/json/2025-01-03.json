This will store and retrieve API responses efficiently, reducing server load and improving performance. A middleware function can check the cache before fetching data from the database, ensuring frequently requested data is served quickly. The proposed implementation includes a Redis-based caching strategy with a middleware function that checks for cached data before querying the database. If data is not found in the cache, it is retrieved from the database and stored in Redis for future requests. This approach significantly enhances response times and optimizes server performance.",

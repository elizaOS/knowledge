No direct fix was provided, but users discussed manually importing the Twitter plugin.\n- **Plugin Installation Issues (Paradex Plugin):** The `@elizaos/plugin-para` fails to build due to missing `@elizaos/core`. Solutions include using `npx elizaos plugins add` instead of `pnpm add`, ensuring the plugin is correctly added to the character file, and updating `@elizaos/core`.\n- **WebSocket Support for API Access:** WebSockets were recently added to a Shaw v2 branch, improving API access for chat terminals. This feature is not yet merged into `develop` but is available in Shaw’s v2 branches.\n- **RAG Knowledge Directory Issues:** Users faced errors due to missing knowledge directories. Solutions include ensuring the directory exists (`mkdir -p ./characters/knowledge/biotic/`), enabling `\"enableRag\": true` in `character.json`, and setting correct file permissions (`chmod 755` for directories, `chmod 644` for files).\n- **Model Download Corruption (Llama Local):** The Llama model downloads but gets corrupted and re-downloads repeatedly. No confirmed fix, but users suggested trying alternative local models.",

Shaw is actively coding, and the update will significantly improve the tech experience.\n- **ElizaOS Functionality:** The platform enables AI agents to communicate and assist users without requiring coding. The V2 update will enhance customization and deployment.\n- **Marketing & Promotion:** Discussion on co-marketing with BNB Chain and promoting ElizaOS when V2 launches. Binance app now displays Binance Alpha Token ($ai16z).\n- **Sqd.ai Plugin:** Inquiry about the integration of a plugin from sqd.ai and its data provisioning quality. No clear resolution.",

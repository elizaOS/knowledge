When I send a message, the frontend tries to call `http://localhost:3000/agents`, but the request gets blocked due to CORS. \n4. The moment I interact (e.g., send 'hello'), the backend crashes or loses connection. \n\nBefore this issue, it disconnected and crashed before I even started, but adding 'proxy' localhost:3000 to client package.json helped establish the connection, except it is extremely unstable. \n\nAny ideas how to solve this bug? Local llama3.1 7B, no other models in current setup as I got frustrated with llama_local issues. Thanks.",

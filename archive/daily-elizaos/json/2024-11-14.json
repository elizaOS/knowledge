This update addresses inconsistencies in JSON response formatting from the LLM, such as inconsistent quoting of action values. The new approach introduces provider-specific handlers (e.g., `handleOpenAI`, `handleAnthropic`) to standardize JSON parsing for each model type. This is the first phase of a two-part update, with a follow-up planned to fully deprecate `generateObject` and `generateObjectArray`. The risk level is low, as the changes are not yet in production.",

# Auto.fun Platform Launch and Issues

- Auto.fun token launchpad platform was recently released with AI features for generating images and content creation
- Platform positions itself as a simpler way to launch agents and tokens
- Plans to expand to more "agentic" features in V2
- Development team remained active in addressing user concerns, with team members like esk3nder, accelxr, and k_carv responding to issues

## Technical Issues and Status

- Several technical issues emerged following launch:
  - Indexing errors affecting early token creations
  - Migration issues with tokens reaching bonding thresholds (85 SOL)
  - Jupiter integration errors with decimal precision
  - UI/UX problems including incorrect market cap displays
  - Fee claiming functionality failures
- Platform temporarily in maintenance mode for updates
- Team has resolved approximately 90% of reported issues
- Platform operates with a 90/10 fee split structure between token creators and platform

## Security Incident

- Shaw's account was compromised, leading to promotion of a suspicious token called "COO" on Pump.fun
- Team members confirmed the breach and warned users

## Future Plans

- Preparing for "next phase" with launch partners like com3 and Fractal
- Plans to announce partnerships after platform upgrades
- Implementation of features based on user feedback

# Production Readiness Automation Validation

Date: 2026-05-05

## Automated Work Completed

- Revalidated the launchdocs gate against the moved docs-site tree at `packages/docs/docs/launchdocs`.
- Updated the docs gate so `--scope=launchdocs` includes the docs-site `docs/launchdocs` directory and fails if the scope resolves to zero markdown files.
- Revalidated the real built app through the deterministic stub-stack Playwright UI smoke runner.
- Revalidated the macOS titlebar navigation/drag-area smoke after the traffic-light inset change.
- Fixed a titlebar regression where the current CSS inset was 80px while the smoke requires at least 100px of traffic-light clearance; the final value is 112px.
- Revalidated benchmark adapter discovery and score extraction for the new benchmark adapter coverage.
- Revalidated the benchmark smoke paths for ADHDBench, BFCL, and HyperliquidBench.

## Remaining Human Work

- Physical iOS and Android release QA on real devices, including install, permissions, backgrounding, local model performance, and thermal/performance behavior.
- Live cloud production QA with real login, billing/credits, agent creation, and migration to desktop or phone.
- Live wallet QA only with dedicated test wallets and controlled testnet or tiny-mainnet funds.
- OAuth and messaging connector QA with real provider accounts because provider UX, anti-abuse gates, and permission screens change outside the codebase.
- macOS packaged app permission prompts for Computer Use, accessibility, and screen recording.
- Product judgment on final onboarding clarity, colors, button feel, and model output quality.

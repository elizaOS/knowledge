# Update Command

The `update` command updates all ElizaOS dependencies (`@elizaos/*`) in your project or plugin to the latest published versions available on npm. This helps you keep your ElizaOS installation current with the latest features, improvements, and bug fixes.

## Usage

```bash
elizaos update
```

## Options

- `-c`, `--check`: Check for available updates without applying them. The command will list the current version, the latest available version, and the packages that would be updated, but will not perform the update or installation.

## Update Process

When you run the `update` command, ElizaOS will:

1.  Detect whether you're in a project or plugin directory.
2.  Find the latest published version of `@elizaos/cli` on npm.
3.  Identify all `@elizaos/*` packages in your `package.json` (dependencies and devDependencies), excluding workspace references.
4.  Prompt for confirmation before proceeding.
5.  Update all identified ElizaOS packages to the determined latest version using `bun install` or `bun add`.
6.  Automatically rebuild the project or plugin after updating dependencies.

## Project Type Detection

The update command automatically detects whether you're working with:

1.  **Project**: A complete ElizaOS project with agents
2.  **Plugin**: An ElizaOS plugin that provides extensions

It determines this by checking the package.json metadata, particularly:

- If the package name starts with `@elizaos/plugin-`
- If keywords include `elizaos-plugin`

## Workspace References

The command properly handles workspace references in monorepo setups:

- Packages with versions like `workspace:*` are identified as workspace references
- These are skipped during the update process as they're meant to be managed by the monorepo

## Examples

### Update Dependencies

Update all ElizaOS dependencies in the current directory to the latest published version:

```bash
elizaos update
```

Example output (versions may vary):

```
Updating project dependencies...
Current CLI version: 1.3.5
Latest available CLI version: 1.4.0
The following ElizaOS packages will be updated to version 1.4.0:
  - @elizaos/core (^1.3.0)
  - @elizaos/runtime (^1.3.2)
  - @elizaos/knowledge (workspace:*) -> Skipped (workspace reference)
  - @elizaos/models (^1.2.0)

## Version Management

The update command currently updates all `@elizaos/*` packages (excluding workspace references) to the single latest published version found for `@elizaos/cli`. It will prompt for confirmation before proceeding.

## Best Practices

Here are some recommended practices when updating ElizaOS dependencies:

1.  **Backup Your Project**: Always make a backup of your project before updating.
2.  **Test After Updating**: Make sure your project works correctly after updating.
3.  **Review Changelogs**: Check the ElizaOS changelog for any breaking changes between your current version and the latest version.

## Troubleshooting

### Dependency Resolution Problems

If you encounter issues with dependency resolution:

```bash
# Run the command with full Node.js error stack traces
NODE_OPTIONS=--stack-trace-limit=100 elizaos update
```

### Build Failures

If the build fails after updating:

```bash
# Check the build output for errors
# Manually attempt to rebuild with verbose logging
elizaos build --verbose
```

### Version Mismatches

If you need a specific version rather than the latest published version:

```bash
# Manually install the specific version needed
bun install @elizaos/core@1.3.5
```

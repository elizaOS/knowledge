## What is elizaOS?

elizaOS is a TypeScript-based framework for building autonomous AI agents that can:

- **Define unique personalities and goals** through character files
- **Take actions in the real world** by equipping agents with plugins
- **Orchestrate multi-step workflows** through natural language conversations
- **Remember and learn** from interactions with persistent memory
- **Run anywhere** - locally for development or scaled for production

The elizaOS framework ships with 90+ official plugins spanning social platforms, blockchain networks, AI providers, generative models, DeFi protocols, gaming, and more. Its plugin architecture lets you mix and match capabilities without modifying core. 

With elizaOS, you give your agent a personality and a goal, equip it with the right plugins, and let it work to achieve results. Your agents can trade onchain, manage social media accounts, create content, analyze data, or interact with any API, blockchain, website or repo. elizaOS agents operate autonomously, taking actions based on their goals and the capabilities you've given them.

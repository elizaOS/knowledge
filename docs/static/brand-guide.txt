# elizaOS Brand Writing Guide (LLM-Optimized)

## 1. Brand Foundations

**elizaOS is an operating system for agents.**  
It enables composable, emotionally intelligent, memory-carrying agents across platforms and protocols.

- Inspired by the original ELIZA (1966) NLP program
- From chatbot illusion ‚Üí real agency
- System, not product; modular, remixable, open-source
- Infrastructure that feels alive ‚Äî expressive and functional

---

## 2. Mission

Build expressive, interoperable systems for coordination, autonomy, and creativity.

- Agents are collaborators, not tools
- Interfaces that function and feel
- elizaOS = ambient agency infrastructure

---

## 3. Vision

- Agents run real workflows (not just chat)
- Memory, context, and identity persist
- People collaborate with swarms of agents
- Systems are forkable, evolvable, open by default
- elizaOS becomes the shared runtime for this future

---

## 4. Core Values

- **Composability**: Modular, interoperable, remixable
- **Contributor Agency**: Built by a network, not a company
- **Intuitive Interfaces**: Aesthetics and function matter
- **Transmedia Thinking**: Visual, written, code ‚Äî everything is a surface
- **Calm Infrastructure**: No hype, intentional growth
- **Pluralism**: Many voices, aesthetics, formats by default

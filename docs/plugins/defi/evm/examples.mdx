## Configuration

### Character Configuration

Add the EVM plugin to your character file:

```typescript
// character.ts
import { type Character } from '@elizaos/core';

export const character: Character = {
  name: 'DeFiAgent',
  plugins: [
    // Core plugins
    '@elizaos/plugin-sql',
    '@elizaos/plugin-bootstrap',
    
    // DeFi plugin
    ...(process.env.EVM_PRIVATE_KEY?.trim() ? ['@elizaos/plugin-evm'] : []),
    
    // Platform plugins
    ...(process.env.DISCORD_API_TOKEN?.trim() ? ['@elizaos/plugin-discord'] : []),
  ],
  settings: {
    secrets: {},
  },
  // ... rest of character configuration
};
```

### Environment Variables

```env
# Required
EVM_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# Optional - Custom RPC endpoints
ETHEREUM_PROVIDER_ETHEREUM=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY
ETHEREUM_PROVIDER_BASE=https://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY
ETHEREUM_PROVIDER_ARBITRUM=https://arb-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY

# Optional - TEE Mode
TEE_MODE=true
WALLET_SECRET_SALT=your_salt_here
```

## Usage Examples

### Transfer Operations

The agent understands natural language for transfers:

```
User: Send 0.1 ETH to 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e
Agent: I'll send 0.1 ETH to that address right away.

User: Transfer 100 USDC to vitalik.eth on Base
Agent: Transferring 100 USDC to vitalik.eth on Base network.

User: Pay alice.eth 50 DAI on Arbitrum
Agent: Sending 50 DAI to alice.eth on Arbitrum.
```

### Swap Operations

```
User: Swap 1 ETH for USDC
Agent: I'll swap 1 ETH for USDC using the best available route.

User: Exchange 100 USDC for DAI with 0.5% slippage
Agent: Swapping 100 USDC for DAI with 0.5% slippage tolerance.
```

### Bridge Operations

```
User: Bridge 100 USDC from Ethereum to Base
Agent: I'll bridge 100 USDC from Ethereum to Base network.

User: Move 0.5 ETH from Arbitrum to Optimism
Agent: Bridging 0.5 ETH from Arbitrum to Optimism.
```

### Governance Operations

```
User: Create a proposal to increase the treasury allocation to 10%
Agent: I'll create a governance proposal for increasing treasury allocation.

User: Vote FOR on proposal 42
Agent: Casting your vote FOR proposal #42.

User: Execute proposal 35
Agent: Executing proposal #35 after the timelock period.
```

## Custom Plugin Integration

If you need to import the plugin directly in a ProjectAgent:

```typescript
// index.ts
import { type ProjectAgent } from '@elizaos/core';
import evmPlugin from '@elizaos/plugin-evm';
import { character } from './character';

export const projectAgent: ProjectAgent = {
  character,
  plugins: [evmPlugin], // Import custom plugins here
  init: async (runtime) => {
    // Custom initialization if needed
  }
};
```

## Common Patterns

### Checking Wallet Balance

```
User: What's my wallet balance?
Agent: [Agent will use the wallet provider to show balances across all configured chains]
```

### Gas Price Awareness

```
User: Send 0.1 ETH to alice.eth when gas is low
Agent: I'll monitor gas prices and execute when they're favorable.
```

### Multi-Chain Operations

The plugin automatically detects the chain from context:

```
User: Send 100 USDC on Base
Agent: Sending 100 USDC on Base network.

User: Swap MATIC for USDC on Polygon
Agent: Swapping MATIC for USDC on Polygon network.
```
